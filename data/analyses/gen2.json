Compared to other Belly Drum users, it lacks the bulk and recovery options to work consistently and won't be able to overcome most bulky Water-types, but it outshines them with its Speed and the ability to beat walls like Skarmory and Steelix with its powerful Fire Blast. Generally, Charizard needs quite a lot to go right for it to succeed, but with the right support, this fan-favorite Fire-type starter can become a powerhouse that can end games much like its anime counterpart.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Miracle Berry is a great alternative to Leftovers. When paired with Light Screen or Reflect support, Miracle Berry can be used to take advantage of Pokemon that may try to cripple Charizard with status-inducing moves such as Gengar's Hypnosis and Snorlax's Body Slam. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for its higher accuracy, but misses out on the OHKO on Skarmory. Hyper Beam is an interesting option that can be used after Belly Drum to eliminate certain bulky Pokemon like Snorlax and Suicune with minimal prior damage. The recharge turn will make Charizard basically useless afterwards, but you can still take down something that Charizard wouldn't be able to otherwise, which can potentially lead to beneficial situations. Sunny Day is a possibility, since not only does it boost Charizard's Fire Blast for useful 2HKOs on Zapdos or Raikou, it also weakens incoming Water-type attacks and makes the common Thunder less accurate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is probably the best counter, as it outspeeds Charizard and can take it down with Surf after it uses Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Raikou and Gengar</strong>: Raikou and Gengar outspeed Charizard and beat it with Thunder or Thunderbolt, but they have to be wary about the OHKO from a boosted Earthquake. A low damage roll from Gengar's Thunderbolt can fail to KO after Leftovers recovery, so it may be forced to use Explosion instead.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is not a reliable check because it Speed ties with Charizard, may be reliant on Thunder hitting, and gets OHKOed by a boosted Rock Slide. However, it still has a decent shot at stopping a sweep through winning the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Keeping bulky Pokemon like Suicune and Snorlax healthy throughout the game is a good way to stop an attempted sweep. Machamp can take a boosted Earthquake if it is kept healthy and retaliate with a Rock Slide for a KO. Vaporeon also survives a boosted Earthquake and easily KOes Charizard with Surf after it has used Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Charizard cannot sweep if it has been paralyzed as it relies heavily on its Speed to be effective. Poisoning Charizard before it can set up is another good way to make it more difficult for it to set up a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Keeping Key Pokemon Healthy</strong>: Preventing the necessary support Charizard needs to set up is usually enough to render it useless, so make sure to not let status conditions get spread too far and try to preserve key Pokemon such as Starmie and the Electric-types if you suspect a Charizard may be waiting in the wings.</p>",

        "BellyZard (Belly Drum)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Belly Drum is a high-risk, high-reward move that boosts Charizard's Attack to the maximum level. Earthquake and Rock Slide form an arsenal of physical attacks that hits everything in the tier for at least neutral damage. After a Belly Drum, Earthquake gets several notable OHKOs against the likes of Tyranitar, Raikou, Misdreavus, Nidoking, Gengar, and Rhydon. Everything else that doesn't resist it or is immune to it gets 2HKOed. Rock Slide is necessary for Zapdos and other less common Flying-types such as Dragonite, Moltres, and opposing Charizard. It can also come in handy in situations where you need the 30% flinch rate to overcome bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax and Suicune. Fire Blast uses Charizard's high Special Attack and Fire typing to get the OHKO on Skarmory, Steelix, Forretress, and Exeggutor after Spikes as well as a 2HKO on Cloyster and Heracross.</p> <p>For a successful Charizard sweep, you want everything that outspeeds it paralyzed or removed completely. That includes Raikou, Starmie, Gengar, Jolteon, and the rarely seen Alakazam. Charizard Speed ties with Zapdos, Miltank, and Tentacruel, so it is best to paralyze or eliminate them too. Pokemon such as Cloyster, Machamp, Marowak, Suicune, Snorlax, and Vaporeon should also be weakened beforehand, as they can survive a hit from +6 Attack Charizard. The other issue you have with Charizard is getting a free turn to use Belly Drum without being taken down in the process. Threatening with the immediate OHKO on Steelix, Skarmory, Forretress, or Exeggutor is a good way to force a switch and get off the Belly Drum. It can also be done with Reflect or Light Screen support or by channeling your luck against paralyzed or sleeping Pokemon. Charizard will usually not get any opportunities to switch out and attempt another sweep at a later point in the game, which means that often you will have to go for Speed ties and flinchesâ€”the fact that it is a realistic possibility for Charizard to succeed in these scenarios is a major reason it's considered so dangerous. It should also be noted that the probability of getting two flinches in a row from Rock Slide is greater than that of getting a critical hit with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster pairs well with Charizard, as it can use Explosion to take out Suicune, Raikou, Zapdos, and most importantly Starmie. It also provides Spikes support, which can wear down the Pokemon listed above, other than Zapdos. Paralysis and sleep spreading is quite essential to prevent key Pokemon on the opposing team from blocking a sweep. Exeggutor can be quite useful, since it can inflict both of these status problems thanks to its access to Sleep Powder and Stun Spore; it can also use Explosion on Zapdos, Raikou, or Umbreon. Body Slam or Dragon Breath Steelix can also attempt to paralyze Zapdos and can use Explosion to eliminate bulky Water-types. Dragonite also does a good job of luring in the Electric-types and catching them with Thunder Wave on the switch. Gengar can be an effective teammate because it can land an Explosion against Raikou quite reliably. Snorlax can be used to spread status with Body Slam or Lovely Kiss or take out walls like Suicune with Self-Destruct or Belly Drum. Reflect or Light Screen users also pair up well with Charizard to support it when it's setting up.</p>"

Access to Rapid Spin in a tier where such a trait is rare also boosts Blastoise's viability. It faces competition from Qwilfish and Omastar, two other viable bulky Water-types, but its access to Rapid Spin and its lack of a weakness to Ground differentiates it from its peers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used instead of Sleep Talk to hit Qwilfish, Haunter, and Electric-types like Ampharos hard. Hidden Power Electric could be used instead, still hitting Qwilfish but traiding coverage on Haunter and Electrics for big damage on Gyarados. However, both moves limit Blastoise's defensive use against Ground-types like Piloswine and Nidoqueen as well as its spinning capabilities against Slowbro.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: All Electric-types offensively pressure Blastoise with a hard-hitting Thunder, and aggressive play from these Pokemon with Spikes down can pressure it by forcing it to switch and take residual damage. However, Magneton, Pikachu, and Electabuzz cannot switch into Blastoise easily, as Surf 3HKOes the former and hinders the latter two because they are not Pokemon that typically use Rest. These Pokemon should also be careful of the rare Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Hypno</strong>: Chansey and Hypno can stalemate Blastoise with their high special bulk and set up Light Screen for teammates that would usually find difficulty in beating it one-on-one, like Granbull. They can also paralyze it with Thunder Wave and, in Chansey's case, damage it with Present. Blastoise can, however, take this as an opportunity to remove Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Setup Physical Attackers</strong>: Granbull safely 2HKOes Blastoise after a Curse, Victreebel walls Blastoise and can set up with Swords Dance, and Scyther threatens to Baton Pass an Attack boost to an ally along with being able to deal some decent damage itself.</p> <p><strong>Water-types that resist Water</strong>: Slowbro and Slowking wall Blastoise and, while Blastoise does have more PP thanks to Rapid Spin, can aim for Special Defense drops with Psychic or even to try to take it out with a critical hit, which Blastoise cannot reciprocate. Lanturn safely comes in and counters Blastoise, scaring it out with the threat of a STAB Thunder. If Blastoise does not have Roar, Politoed can set up with Growth or Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Victreebel, Jumpluff, and Bellossom check Blastoise well and can exploit the free turn generated by Blastoise's inability to do any meaningful damage to them. Victreebel can set up with Swords Dance, Jumpluff can use Encore on Blastoise and turn it into setup fodder, and Bellossom can deal a chunk of damage with Hidden Power Grass.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blastoise is highly regarded as the best spinner in the tier. Its ability to beat Qwilfish one-on-one with the longevity gained from Rest means that it can remove Spikes reliably in the long term. However, Curse Qwilfish or a well-timed critical hit can give it some trouble. Although Haunter can spinblock Blastoise, it does not appreciate a hard-hitting Surf that has a chance to 2HKO. Blastoise's Speed and respectably powerful Surf make it a viable counter to the Ground-types of the tierâ€”even Thunder Nidoqueen. It also hits Pokemon with low Special Defense reasonably hard, like Granbull and Kabutops. Sleep Talk makes Blastoise less passive when asleep and lets it use Rapid Spinâ€”mainly on Qwilfishâ€”while asleep. Sleep Talk also allows Blastoise to play around status inducers and gives it better odds against Sandslash and Lovely Kiss Nidoqueen. Roar can be used instead as an emergency button against some of the setup Pokemon like Scyther and Granbull, but it means that Blastoise should be supported by a Heal Bell user like Granbull or Chansey to reduce the drawbacks of Rest without Sleep Talk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As the tier's best spinner and due to the defensive utility it offers, Blastoise finds relevance in making defensive teams work. Rapid Spin support reinforces the resilience of walls such as Slowbro and Hypno, greatly improving their performance as Nidoqueen checks. It also works well with sweepers that are difficult to wall in the long term, such as Belly Drum Quagsire, Growth or Belly Drum Politoed, and Swords Dance Pinsir. These can all work as standalone sweepers on defensive teams and use its teammates' defensive utility to wait for an opportunity to set up. Pokemon that can stomach hard-hitting Electric-type attacks, such as Nidoqueen, Ampharos, and Chansey, make good partners for Blastoise because they take away the burden of one of its weaknesses. All of these appreciate the removal of Spikes that Blastoise offers.</p>"

Thunder Wave can be used to spread paralysis, but Pikachu should largely be used to attack, and you're better off using a better paralysis spreader such as Jumpluff or Hypno. Pikachu can run Attract over Swagger; it should change its gender to female, since most Pokemon are male for higher Attack DVs. Unfortunately, this makes Attract fail against Nidoqueen and Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ampharos</strong>: Ampharos completely walls Pikachu thanks to its resistance to Thunder and great bulk, and it's also able to set up Light Screen for its teammates to switch into Pikachu more easily. It also runs RestTalk most of the time, meaning Sing won't do much to it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Chansey's huge special bulk makes it a very reliable Pikachu answer, and it can threaten Pikachu with Present. Chansey does have to be careful of a potential Sing, though. Hypno has a low chance of being 3HKOed by Pikachu's Thunderbolt, and it can either set up Light Screen or cripple Pikachu with Thunder Wave. Hypno is potentially 2HKOed by Thunder after Spikes, though, and Pikachu can break through variants without RestTalk.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Quagsire solidly checks Pikachu as long as it's not running the uncommon Hidden Power Grass, since Quagsire is a Ground-type not weak to Surf and OHKOes Pikachu in return. However, it is crippled by Sing. Nidoqueen, Sandslash, and Piloswine are also able to pivot in and OHKO Pikachu with Earthquake, but they are all 2HKOed by Surf. Generally, Ground-types don't have the longevity to check Pikachu long term with Spikes up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom, Vileplume, and Victreebel resist Thunder and Surf and can threaten Pikachu with status and their attacks, but they are shaky checks due to their weakness to Hidden Power Ice. Jumpluff can ruin Pikachu with paralysis or sleep and use Encore to disrupt it before and after it uses Substitute, but it's hit very hard in return and is less consistent at switching in than other Grass-types.</p> <p><strong>Thief</strong>: Pikachu relies entirely on Light Ball to be viable, so Thief from Pokemon such as Mr. Mime, Scyther, and Electabuzz invalidates it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Dodrio, Scyther, and Haunter don't want to switch into Pikachu, but they make effective revenge killers.

        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute makes use of Pikachu's good Speed and punishes foes for using Sleep Talk or trying to pivot around Pikachu's attacks. Thunderbolt gives consistent damage and threatens Flying- and Water-types such as Scyther, Slowbro, Slowking, Blastoise, and Qwilfish. Alternatively, Thunder is incredibly powerful and has a chance to OHKO Slowbro, 2HKO Mr. Mime, and even 2HKO Hypno after Spikes, but its lower accuracy combined with Pikachu's fragility makes it quite risky. Surf crucially 2HKOes the very common Nidoqueen as well as Piloswine and Sandslash, three usually big roadblocks for Electric-types. Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-types such as Bellossom, Victreebel, and Vileplume, which otherwise wall Pikachu. Swagger synergizes very well with Substitute and other status conditions from teammates, letting Pikachu potentially break through certain foes it normally struggles to. Sing is also an option, and it can be game changing if it hits a foe such as Chansey or Quagsire, but it does have very poor accuracy. Pikachu is tough to switch in, often requiring carefully switching in on double switches or non-attacking moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pikachu is generally tough to fit onto teams due to its flaws and inability to break through certain foes. Its best fit is on offensive teams. Nidoqueen is a very good partner for Pikachu, as it can switch into and threaten most of Pikachu's usual checks such as Chansey and Ampharos, while Pikachu can threaten Water-types that trouble Nidoqueen. Spikes support from Qwilfish is also very useful, maximizing the pressure Pikachu exerts. Other powerful offensive Pokemon such as Scyther, Mr. Mime, and Haunter work with Pikachu to overwhelm opponents and fit well on offensive teams. In addition, Mr. Mime can cripple one of Pikachu's answers with Thief or Hypnosis, while Haunter can remove one of Pikachu's checks with Explosion. Rapid Spin support from Blastoise or Graveler is useful for removing Spikes, seeing as Pikachu can't hold Leftovers and will get worn down quickly by Substitute. Light Screen and Reflect support brings Pikachu into battle more easily, so Pokemon such as Hypno work well with it. Pikachu's bulk means it's not a good option for switching into STAB Surf from Water-types, so Pokemon that can come in and threaten them such as Mr. Mime, Ampharos, and Bellossom make good choices.</p>"

The addition of Light Ball gives Pikachu potential to hit things very hard, and it has a decent enough Speed stat (278, which is slightly above the \"average\" threshold of 268) to where it could potentially strike twice without getting hurt, once on the switch, the other right after. With a Light Ball, Pikachu's Special Attack is the second highest in GSC, after only Mewtwo. The flip side, of course, is the fact that Pikachu is OHKOed by most decent STAB attacks, so only switch Pikachu in when you know it is not going to get hurt.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder can be a gamble, but if you're using Pikachu you're probably a risk-taker anyway, and it hits hard with Light Ball. Thunder Wave gives paralysis support, which is never a bad thing, and status is about the only thing Pikachu can hope to do against Blissey, Raikou, and Snorlax. Charm can hit Snorlax when it comes in to soften the blow it deals to whatever you decide to switch in. Hidden Power Grass can work if you're really paranoid about Quagsire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pikachu's main counter is good prediction as far as switching into attacks go. Since Pikachu usually cannot take a single strong STAB hit, if something switches in that isn't in KO range after the initial hit, then Pikachu will have to switch out. However, Snorlax and Blissey in OU will wall Pikachu all the time. Exeggutor can absorb Thunder and Surf with no problem, but can get hit hard with Hidden Power. Ground-types can naturally switch into Thunderbolt, but be waryâ€”if the Ground-type switches into a Surf, it can probably be KOed the next turn. If you're facing a UU team, your most reliable counter is Quagsire, who can take all three of Pikachu's attacks and KO it with Earthquake. Muk is also somewhat of a reliable counter with the high HP and Special Defense (and also a powerful STAB Sludge Bomb). Another UU counter is Venusaur, who can take Thunderbolt and Surf with no problem, set up Light Screen, and recover damage away with Synthesis.</p>",

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Raichu's Speed, along with Rain Dance, lets it become a very good middle-to-late-game threat, where incurring 60-70% with a Surf looks a lot better than it did when everything was at full health. A Grass-type works excellently alongside Raichu to help buffer Earthquake, along with the fact that Fire-types won't be at full strength if you use Rain Dance. While once BL in tiers, it has sunk more towards UU as time progressed due to the strengthening of teams and Raichu not matching up well to the new standards: there was a time where Miltank was more popular than Blissey; that was Raichu's prime in GSC. Raichu is simply too fragile to be considered for today's OU play. At the same time, however, it isn't quite the run of the mill useless Pokemon. It isn't very difficult to use, and since it is valuable early in the game to paralyze, in the middle to inflict doses of damage as well as setting up Rain Dance, and late-game to sweep away entire teams of crippled and paralyzed Pokemon. It is a viable, although often neglected, Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Raichu's movepool is somewhat limited, the few alternatives it does possess can prove vastly useful. Raichu can make use of Endure and Reversal thanks to its good Attack stat, something other special attackers lack. With good Speed and the ability to spread paralysis, it could cause some problems late-game. If improving your Defense is more your thing than lowering their Attack, Reflect helps out Raichu and any other team members who may be soft defensively. Hidden Power Ice can be used for Grass-types if you choose not to go the Seismic Toss route, as it gives Raichu a special-based attack that is super effective on them rather than fixed damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that is faster than Raichu can prove to be a mess to handle, due to its 298 Speed being its most valuable weapon. Ground-types, while suffering from Raichu's Surf, will be able to KO Raichu in one hit if it doesn't have Charm or Reflect--even then it will only buy Raichu an extra turn. Most of its weaknesses come from simple type-based match-ups that are difficult for it to overcome. The most important thing to remember about Raichu is don't be a hero; if it isn't faster and can't kill the opposing Pokemon, make sure the game is in hand before committing to an attack. If a strong Pokemon survives Raichu's attack, that will be the last of it for the battle.</p>",

Rain Dance comes natural to it as it is one of two (along with Lanturn) who can take advantage of both the perfect accuracy of Thunder along with Surf, due to Thunder being boosted by STAB and thus all the more powerful. Surf will take out many of Raichu's natural enemies, including every Ground Pokemon that's not named Quagsire. Substitute is great when a Pokemon with Earthquake switches in because, along with Leftovers, it will only cost you around 13% of your total health to get a cheap hit in on whatever switched in. If paralyzing Pokemon with certain accuracy is a need, then Thunder Wave makes a good fourth move. Miracle Berry can be used to protect Raichu from opposing status effects while spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave.</p>"},

While it sacrifices the power gained by having Thunder and Rain Dance, it requires no set up and Seismic Toss has proven to be useful on occasion for finishing off weak Pokemon who otherwise have very little to fear from Raichu, such as Grass-types.

It also helps stop Mean Look + Perish Song users, as you can just switch it in on the Mean Look and then use Encore to trap them in that move.</p> <p>Hidden Power Water (Surf + Encore is an illegal move combination) is a useful secondary attack to have, as it can take care of Ground-types such as Rhydon or Donphan after having Encored their Rest, Sleep Talk, or Curse. Using Light Screen is also an option to support the rest of your team; however, it's fairly common on many other Pokemon, so use it only if you don't have screen coverage elsewhere.

It has an excellent typing and bulk; the former reduces the viability of the Electric types in the tierâ€”such as Ampharosâ€”while also granting immunity to both Toxic and Thunder Wave, and the latter allows it to pose a threat throughout the game with natural longevity. Nidoqueenâ€™s movepool allows it to pack its own countermeasures for its supposed checks, and the ease of keeping Spikes on the field means that it is able to apply pressure to opposing teams fairly easily. Nidoqueen is most certainly the most commonly seen Pokemon, fitting on any playstyle with little or no drawback to using it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief is an option, but Nidoqueen generally gets more utility out of Lovely Kiss or Moonlight and the type-coverage moves, and Thief is also usable on other Pokemon such as Haunter and Electabuzz. An all-out attacking set is also a possibility with Ice Beam, Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Thunder, but again, the opportunity cost of missing out on Lovely Kiss or Moonlight is quite high. Roar is also an option, as Nidoqueen forces a lot of switches and can really rack up chip damage with Spikes support. Counter is incompatible with Moonlight but can be another option for luring in and punishing physical attacks such as Hidden Power Ground from Scyther and Return from Granbull.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There is not one counter to Nidoqueen, and it requires good teambuilding skills and outplaying to get around; however, there are some decent measures to it. Bulky RestTalk users such as Slowbro, Slowking, Granbull, and Blastoise all switch in and can threaten Nidoqueen while being able to restore any damage with Rest. Inflicting Nidoqueen with status such as sleep or paralysis are viable threats to it from Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Haunter. Gligar can take on Nidoqueen lacking Ice Beam, and Bellossom and Pinsir have a good matchup against non-Fire Blast variants but must watch out for Lovely Kiss. Qwilfish outspeeds and can 2HKO with Hydro Pump, but it cannot switch in and must risk sacrificing a lot of its HP one-on-one. Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime and Hypno also threaten Nidoqueen with both status and hard-hitting Psychic attacks. Lastly, bulky Ground-types such as Piloswine (against non-Fire Blast variants) and Quagsire can switch in and threaten Nidoqueen themselves.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "The Queen of UU (3 attacks)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake is Nidoqueen's necessary STAB attack, which allows it to be the threat that it is. Thunder is also necessary to nail the bulky Water-type pair of Slowbro and Slowking and is also very handy with its 30% chance to paralyze a Pokemon that is not a Ground-type (provided it hits). Nidoqueen's next coverage move allows it to punch through more checks and has a useful chance to either freeze or burn. Ice Beam hits Jumpluff and Gligar like a truck, whereas Fire Blast is useful for dealing even more damage to Bellossom and is a better option for winning against Scyther one-on-oneâ€”another dominant Pokemon in this tier. Lovely Kiss and Moonlight are not legally compatible with each other on Nidoqueen, so one must choose which utility option to run. Lovely Kiss is more commonly seen on hyper offense teams, as Nidoqueen can then spread status for itself or its teammates to plow through teams, whereas Moonlight is usually on other playstyles, as it improves Nidoqueen's longevity to allow the user to make some risky plays with the safety net of being able to recover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As said earlier, Nidoqueen is the most splashable Pokemon in the tier, so it is a useful teammate with any other Pokemon. There are certainly other Pokemon that, when paired with it, increase Nidoqueen's ability to dominate including Baton Passers such as Girafarig and Scyther that can pass on +2 Special Defense, Speed, and Attack boosts to prepare for a Nidoqueen sweep. Spikes support from Qwilfish is incredibly useful, as it allows Nidoqueen to punish the opponent for switching in, for example, their Slowbro to attempt to eat up an expected Earthquake. Of course, countermeasures for Psychic- and Water-types should be included when teambuilding, so Thief users and Electric-types are great at pressuring these such Pokemon. Psychic-types themselves are also good teammates for Nidoqueen, so Slowbro and the like are commonly seen paired with it because they cover the aforementioned weaknesses.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Nidoking is the quintessential blue-collar Pokemon. It evolves from one of the earliest Pokemon you encounter in RBY, its stats aren't flashy--the best it gets is base 92 Attack--and its typing is a strange Poison / Ground mixture that you wouldn't expect to be great defensively. Regardless of these reasons for humility, Nidoking has all the right tools to get the job done as the premier mixed attacker of GSC. For starters, its movepool gives it a fairly strong STAB Earthquake coupled with solid super effective coverage moves for physical walls and Pokemon that resist it. Nidoking's immunities to Toxic and Thunder and its base 85 Speed, which is particularly fast by GSC standards, are also nice advantages that Nidoking totes over other attacking threats. However, that's not all Nidoking has to offer, for if that were the case, it would still be outclassed by Pokemon with flashier stat spreads such as Tyranitar and Dragonite. Access to Lovely Kiss is Nidoking's ace in the hole, allowing it to instantly take one of its chief counters out of the game, something the other mixed sweepers can't do.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is an attacking option that allows Nidoking to cleanly 2HKO Steelix and Exeggutor while granting it an OHKO against Forretress and a 3HKO against Heracross. However, Fire Blast must go over either Ice Beam, which leaves Nidoking unable to touch Zapdos, or Thunder/Thunderbolt, which leaves Nidoking unable to do as much damage to Water-types, especially Suicune. Using Fire Blast over Thunder/Thunderbolt also makes Nidoking unable to significantly damage Charizard, which, while uncommon, can then threaten to set up Belly Drum and sweep. Counter is an interesting option for surprise KOs. Morning Sun can be used to allow Nidoking to last longer and heal off potential Hidden Powers from Zapdos and Raikou, but it cannot be used with Lovely Kiss. Counter even works against special Hidden Powers in GSC, so it allows Nidoking to bounce back Hidden Powers from Zapdos for major damage, in addition to attacks from Snorlax and Miltank. However, Counter requires careful use to ensure the opponent is definitely in KO range before it is revealed, and ultimately makes Nidoking less effective as a mixed attacker by taking away one of its attacking moveslots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>RestTalk Suicune, Heracross, and Snorlax are probably the most complete Nidoking counters in existence. All three of these Pokemon can absorb Lovely Kiss and can tank whatever attacks Nidoking can use. Suicune must watch out for the 3HKO from the inaccurate Thunder, Heracross must watch out for the rare Fire Blast 3HKO, and Snorlax, being slower than Nidoking and taking more from Earthquake than the other two counters, must be wary of switching in, especially with Spikes down. Zapdos is also a fine switch-in to Nidoking, although Ice Beam is very common, averages a 3HKO against Zapdos, and, unlike Thunder against Suicune, is 100% accurate. However, unlike the other counters, Zapdos is guaranteed to outspeed Nidoking, is immune to Earthquake and Spikes, and can 3HKO Nidoking with a super effective Hidden Power.</p> <p>When Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss, many more options for countering it open up. Suicune and Snorlax without RestTalk can switch in to sponge hits and scare it out. Miltank is a fantastic switch-in when Sleep Clause is active, as Nidoking is slower and cannot penetrate its defenses with its attacks. Miltank can also force Nidoking to switch out with the threat of Body Slam paralysis. However, if Sleep Clause is not active, Miltank balks at the prospect of being put to sleep, since it is then unable to cure its teammates of status with Heal Bell. Starmie is also a solid check that outspeeds Nidoking, gets Recover to shrug off its attacks, and 2HKOes it in return. Starmie is also often common sleep bait to offer against Nidoking on teams without a Sleep Talk user. However, Starmie is 2HKOed by Thunder. Umbreon is slower than Nidoking, which makes switching into Earthquakes difficult at times, but otherwise it is a stellar wall that avoids even being 4HKOed by any of Nidoking's attacks. Umbreon, however, does struggle to threaten Nidoking in return; it can pass Mean Look to another counter that can threaten to KO Nidoking, or it can use Charm to weaken Nidoking's Earthquake to allow an easier switch to another counter.</p> <p>Aside from the checks listed above, Sleep Talk Vaporeon also makes a somewhat decent answer to Nidoking. It is slower than Nidoking, is 4HKOed by Earthquake unlike Umbreon and Snorlax, and is even 3HKOed by Thunder, so it is, admittedly, a very shaky check. However, it can absorb Lovely Kiss with a Sleep Talk set and can threaten to 2HKO Nidoking in return. Other slower Pokemon that can nonetheless threaten Nidoking include Quagsire and Porygon2. Unlike Vaporeon, these Pokemon cannot absorb Lovely Kiss, but on the other hand, they are not 3HKOed by any of Nidoking's moves, either. Quagsire gets to guarantee a 2HKO in return with Earthquake, whereas Porygon2 gets access to Recover instead of relying on Rest to stay healthy.</p> <p>Other slower Pokemon that struggle to switch into or threaten Nidoking are Forretress and even Blissey. Forretress generally does not have a good way to threaten Nidoking and fears the possible Fire Blast, but otherwise tanks Nidoking with ease and can even attempt to stall it out if it runs the uncommon Rest. Obviously, it wants to switch in only after Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss so that it is not rendered unable to lay Spikes. Blissey, on the other hand, is generally a cleric and so obviously wants to avoid taking a Lovely Kiss, but otherwise avoids being 2HKOed by Earthquake, which permits the use of Soft-Boiled to attempt to stall Nidoking. In addition, Ice Beam can threaten to 3HKO Nidoking while Growl and even the odd Reflect (which cannot be used along with Heal Bell) can make tanking Earthquakes a lot easier.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Mixed Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>This set allows Nidoking to threaten as wide an array of opponents as possible. STAB Earthquake running off a decent Attack stat is Nidoking's main attacking move, and it does solid damage to most threats. However, it does run short of hitting relevant KO thresholds against certain walls, such as Snorlax, Miltank, and Umbreon; Earthquake will shave off roughly 25-30% of these threats' HP, which is well short of a 3HKO and just short of even a 4HKO after Leftovers. That's where Lovely Kiss comes in. With a well-timed Lovely Kiss, one of these walls can be indefinitely incapacitated, allowing Nidoking to go for the KO itself by spamming Earthquake or permitting a teammate to switch in and start setting up. As for the other two moves, these are for hitting foes that resist or are immune to Earthquake for super effective damage. Ice Beam is a must to 3HKO Zapdos, as otherwise Nidoking cannot touch it even with Lovely Kiss since most Zapdos run Sleep Talk. Ice Beam also allows Nidoking to 3HKO Exeggutor and, when all else fails, to play for the freeze against Miltank. The last moveslot is a bit more flexible, although Thunder is the preferred option because it guarantees a 2HKO against Starmie and Skarmory, can 3HKO Suicune and Vaporeon, and has a 21% paralysis chance, factoring accuracy, to facilitate these KOs. However, Thunderbolt is an option if you don't want to chance a miss against a Cloyster, Skarmory, or weakened Suicune in KO range. That said, Nidoking will miss out on the KO thresholds that Thunder achieves, and furthermore it will do more damage to Vaporeon with Earthquake than it would with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Nidoking is a bit easier to get to work than other heavy hitters in GSC because of its good Speed stat, access to Lovely Kiss, immunity to Electric moves and Toxic, and defenses that, while not great, are passable. However, just as with any mixed attacker, Nidoking will require a bit of prediction to be able to use appropriately. It should be switching in whenever you anticipate an opponent switching to a Pokemon that does not want to be put to sleep or that cannot afford to take a super effective attack. Being able to double-switch effectively or, alternatively, to predict Thunders from Electric-types to prevent Nidoking from taking damage or status on the switch will go a long way toward keeping Nidoking healthy enough to still pose a threat. To facilitate these double-switches, Nidoking appreciates Rapid Spin support from Starmie, Cloyster, or Forretress to keep Spikes off the field. Spikes support from Cloyster and Forretress can also be helpful to Nidoking, especially since it struggles to KO the likes of Snorlax and Umbreon without such help. However, since Nidoking already has Lovely Kiss to deal with the Pokemon it struggles to outright kill, and because one of the more common switch-ins to Nidoking is Zapdos, Spikes don't help Nidoking as much as you might expect.</p> <p>While Nidoking is, for the most part, self-sufficient offense, there are Pokemon that pair well with Nidoking by KOing or weakening its counters. Self-Destruct Snorlax can bait and explode on these threats, in addition to Suicune and Miltank, to make Nidoking's life easier. Exeggutor is a fine partner as well, since it can bait Zapdos and Explode on it to allow Nidoking to aim for a better sleep target with Lovely Kiss. Tyranitar with Rock Slide and Pursuit can help Nidoking chip away at Zapdos to put it in Ice Beam KO range to prevent it from switching in to absorb Lovely Kiss. Tyranitar also helps to weaken Exeggutor so that Nidoking does not have to be concerned with its inability to 2HKO it. Steelix can bait and Explode on Miltank, Suicune, and even Zapdos to make life easier for Nidoking as well.</p> <p>Other good partners for Nidoking are those that can capitalize off Nidoking's ability to weaken their counters or put them to sleep. CurseLax generally works well with Nidoking's ability to target Charm Umbreon and opposing CurseLax with Lovely Kiss. Marowak and Quagsire appreciate Nidoking's ability to target opposing Water-types with Lovely Kiss. Cloyster and Machamp can take advantage of Nidoking's ability to target Starmie with Lovely Kiss or Thunder paralysis. Vaporeon can capitalize off Nidoking's ability to weaken Zapdos, Snorlax, and Roar Suicune.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Wigglytuff is an all-around great Pokemon in NU. With solid defensive stats and a fantastic movepool including moves such as the coveted Thunder Wave, it's a Pokemon that can fit on many teams. Wigglytuff checks many of the stronger attackers in the tier such as Xatu, Dugtrio, and Octillery with its great bulk, and it can cripple Pokemon that can otherwise hurt it, such as Primeape, with paralysis on the switch, meaning it can be a difficult Pokemon to play around. While it is walled by Rock-types and can be overwhelmed by setup sweepers such as Kingler and Stantler, this pink blob should always be considered for defensive and balanced teams alike.</p> <p>The choice of STAB attack comes down to if Wigglytuff wants to support its team or have better offensive use. Double-Edge can 3HKO a lot of common Pokemon in the tier, such as Primeape, Ninetales, and Rapidash, and the recoil is largely offset by Wigglytuff's huge HP stat. Body Slam can spread paralysis while also dealing damage to common Wigglytuff switch-ins, most notably Primeape. Body Slam variants are also much better against fast Pokemon such as Dugtrio due to the paralysis chance and not having to deal with recoil from Double-Edge. Thunder 2HKOes Xatu and Kingler, making it a decent check to these two Pokemon. Rest and Sleep Talk make it a great sleep absorber and give it good longevity.</p> <p>Wigglytuff fits best on defensive and balanced teams and works very well as a lead Pokemon, since it can absorb sleep from common leads such as Stantler. Poison-types such as Weezing and Gloom can help with Wigglytuff's weakness to Fighting-types. Weezing also appreciates Wigglytuff's ability to switch in and check Xatu. Slower Pokemon that appreciate paralysis such as Flareon, Graveler, and Kingler pair well with Body Slam variants. Users of Light Screen and Reflect such as Azumarill can make its job switching in easier; this can also be further supported with a spinner to remove Spikes, such as Pineco.

The choice of STAB attack depends on if Wigglytuff wants more power or a chance to inflict paralysis to support its sweep. Sleep Talk is the more consistent option in the third moveslot, making it less of a sitting duck when asleep and hugely helping against Hypnosis users such as Rapidash and Stantler, although Thunder Wave's synergy with Curse is useful, and paralysis can help out Wigglytuff's teammates. Most paralyzed foes are unable to check a Curse-boosted Wigglytuff, so the combination can be difficult to deal with in the absence of Pokemon immune to Thunder Wave, like Graveler and Pupitar.</p> <p>Water-types such as Kingler and Octillery do well as teammates due to their ability to switch in and destroy Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Graveler. Troublesome Haze users such as Weezing and Arbok can stop Wigglytuff's sweep, so teammates such as Weezing and Gloom can be used to paralyze or remove them with Explosion. Spikes support from Pineco can go a long way in helping Wigglytuff break through Poison- and Rock-types. Poison-types such as Gloom and Weezing also make good partners because they can threaten Primeape, which can potentially remove Wigglytuff despite its boosts with a critical hit Cross Chop. Houndour could also be paired with Wigglytuff to prevent it from being walled by Gastly, although Gastly is a fairly uncommon Pokemon.</p>"

His stats are actually even all around, but therein lies the problem; he isn't quite good enough at anything in particular to be of much use. In a UU arena dominated by Pokemon like Lapras and Clefable, he could be potent with STAB on Fighting moves, but he has nary a chance to make an impact on the OU metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Poliwrath certainly learns a lot of moves, not many of them are going to be much use on him.

There's also Submission and Dynamic Punch to take advantage of that potentially great Fighting STAB.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Three Pokemon have the perfect typing to wall Poliwrath indefinitely: Exeggutor, Starmie, and Slowbro. The first two of these are extremely common, and Slowbro is one of those crazy \"BL\" types, so many teams can counter Poliwrath with ease without even considering him. Other common counters would be Raikou, Zapdos, Umbreon, Suicune and even Snorlax if Poliwrath doesn't have a Fighting move. If you're in UU, there are plenty of counters to be found as well. Gyarados can wall Poliwrath's typing, Lanturn can take him on, and Muk can absorb Poliwrath's attacks with little trouble (unless Poliwrath has Earthquake).

Hydro Pump will really hurt those Rock-types and can soften up physical walls like Skarmory. Lovely Kiss is Poliwrath's wild card, so whenever they bring out a Pokemon they think can beat it, use Lovely Kiss and put it to sleep before it can take Poliwrath out. While this is a good idea in theory, Poliwrath is hindered by horrible typing and a bad physical movepool and can't hit anything directly hard off the bat.

      "overview": "<p>With the highest Special Attack in GSC OU, ultra high Speed, and STAB Psychic, Alakazam is well positioned to take advantage of the popular offensive Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Nidoking, and Machamp and severely threaten a broad swath of the metagame. Compared to Espeon, which has Growth and Baton Pass, Alakazam has Dynamic Punch, which allows it to use a mixed set, and Encore to stop setup Pokemon. Its Speed advantage over almost all other Pokemon makes it one of the best late-game cleaners and ensures that other fast Pokemon like Raikou and Gengar can't threaten it with Thunder or Explosion without taking a heavy hit first.</p> <p>However, Alakazam faces one very large problem. Snorlax, as well as other specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, can make it very difficult for Alakazam to deal lasting damage to the opposing team if they are not first weakened or removed by its teammates. Alakazam does have Dynamic Punch in its arsenal to give it a fighting chance at breaching these Pokemon, but it is unreliable due to its poor accuracy. In addition, status effects, especially paralysis from Pokemon such as Exeggutor, will compromise its potential. Furthermore, compared to Jynx, a much more common offensive Psychic-type, Alakazam has better defensive properties and unique coverage options, but it lacks Lovely Kiss and the ability that Jynx has to 2HKO Zapdos with STAB Ice Beam.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave has good synergy with Recover, potentially allowing Alakazam to return to full health by waiting for the foe to miss a turn. Inflicting paralysis is also an excellent way of supporting its teammates, especially if it can land paralysis on speedy foes such as Starmie, Raikou, and Zapdos. However, it is incompatible with Encore. Hidden Power Dark can be used for Psychic-types like Exeggutor, Starmie, and Jynx, while Hidden Power Water can be used for Tyranitar, Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon. Light Screen helps Alakazam against special attackers and supports its team, but can be tricky to fit in Alakazam's moveset. Counter can be used to land a surprise OHKO against Double-Edge Snorlax. While Encore can't be used alongside Counter, the threat of Encore can be enough to deter Curse and Belly Drum from Snorlax and encourage it to attack Alakazam immediately. However, if Snorlax sets up in anticipation of Alakazam switching out, dealing with a boosted Snorlax could prove to be very challenging. Thief can steal an item from an opposing Pokemon, which will often deprive Alakazam's checks such as Snorlax, Blissey, and Starmie of the recovery from Leftovers; however, this is typically done better by Jynx and Gengar, as they don't need the moveslot as much. Miracle Berry can help Alakazam shrug off status effects from Pokemon such as Exeggutor, but it can only work once.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Snorlax and Blissey have great bulk to take Alakazam's special attacks and inflict status ailments with Body Slam, Toxic, or Thunder Wave. The former frightens Alakazam with its STAB moves, while the latter can run Present or Light Screen. However, Dynamic Punch can hit them super effectively and cause confusion.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Crunch from Tyranitar and Houndoom is useful to 2HKO Alakazam, but they should be wary of Dynamic Punch on the switch-in. In particular, Tyranitar without Rest will be severely crippled by Toxic. Umbreon can wall many Alakazam sets even if it struggles to trap it and can threaten it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Starmie can use Thunder Wave or Thunder to cripple Alakazam, but it will struggle to KO Recover Alakazam without them and could be crippled by Toxic or take heavy damage from Thunder Punch or Zap Cannon. Exeggutor can run Stun Spore or Sleep Powder to cripple Alakazam and Explosion for a trade KO, but Alakazam can potentially have Fire Punch or Ice Punch to hit it super effectively and Substitute to block status moves, Explosion, and Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix can force a trade with Explosion to remove Alakazam, Skarmory can cripple it with Toxic, and Forretress can threaten it with Explosion or Toxic, but all of them, especially Forretress, are heavily threatened by Fire Punch variants. Substitute Alakazam can cause major problems to Forretress and Steelix; the former struggles to break Alakazam's Substitute without Hidden Power Bug or Hidden Power Ghost and is OHKOed by Fire Punch, whereas the latter must guess whether Alakazam will use Fire Punch or Substitute and use Earthquake, Roar, or Explosion accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou and Zapdos can paralyze Alakazam with Thunder or Thunder Wave in Zapdos's case, but neither can break its Substitute with neutral Hidden Power, so if they are using the inaccurate Thunder, they may be forced to hit several in a row to beat Alakazam. Alakazam can also 3HKO Zapdos with Ice Punch reliably and has a chance of 3HKOing it with Psychic, whereas Raikou survives three hits from Psychic but must be wary of Spikes damage racking up. Alakazam can also force them to switch out by using Encore to lock them into Rest.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Vaporeon can wall most Alakazam sets with Rest. Suicune can threaten to poison it, while Vaporeon can potentially PP stall Encore if Alakazam is being relied upon to check Vaporeon due to its high PP count.</p>",

Recover gives Alakazam a survivability tool to function as a switch-in to said Pokemon, but Substitute can be used instead to block status effects and scout for Explosion from Pokemon like Forretress. Since Hidden Power from Zapdos and Exeggutor breaks Alakazam's Substitute less than 10% of the time, Alakazam can use its Speed to set up a Substitute, avoid status ailments from Stun Spore and Thunder, and exploit Thunder's low accuracy. Dynamic Punch hits not only Snorlax and Blissey, but also Tyranitar for super effective damage, and its guaranteed confusion can potentially open up an opportunity to break past them.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Fire Punch is nice for Forretress and threats such as Exeggutor, Jynx, Steelix, and Skarmory. An Electric-type attack hits not only Skarmory, but also Starmie; Thunder Punch is reliable in accuracy, but Zap Cannon inflicts paralysis if it lands, which has great synergy with Dynamic Punch and Substitute. Ice Punch hits Exeggutor, secures the 3HKO against Zapdos, and has a chance to inflict freeze.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is used more on offensive teams with Explosion users. With access to Explosion, Dynamic Punch, and Destiny Bond, Gengar can be used to wear down Snorlax, Blissey, and Dark-types, which Alakazam appreciates. It can sometimes block Explosion for Alakazam, too. Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to take out opposing Snorlax, especially Curse variants. Its coverage moves such as Earthquake can also be used to weaken Alakazam's other checks like Tyranitar. Spikes from Pokemon such as Cloyster are helpful to chip down the opposing team and eventually bring them into Alakazam's 2HKO range. Cloyster can also potentially use Clamp to trap Snorlax, nullify any of its Defense boosts with Screech, and use Explosion to remove it. Rhydon is a great choice for a complementing offensive Pokemon thanks to its ability to pivot into Electric-type attacks and take on unboosted Snorlax, although it needs to be wary of Curse + Earthquake Snorlax if it lacks Counter. Finally, although Alakazam has Zap Cannon, paralysis support from teammates such as Zapdos is still recommended to achieve parafusion when combined with Dynamic Punch.</p>"

        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Encore is the selling point of the utility set. It allows Alakazam to stop setup Pokemon such as Growth Vaporeon and can create safe opportunities for teammates to switch in by locking foes like Zapdos into Rest. If Alakazam is brought in by a phazing move, it can also lock that Pokemon into said move, buying a free turn for the next Pokemon to be brought in. It also pairs well with Recover, as it allows Alakazam to stall out weak attacks such as Pursuit. However, although Encore may give you momentum to attack or switch out, an opponent can predict it and switch out. Moreover, it always fails against a Pokemon that last used Sleep Talk. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to wear down Alakazam's checks so that they will use Rest or be knocked out, which pairs well with Recover against Pokemon such as Starmie without Thunder Wave in the long run. In addition, it puts Tyranitar without Crunch or Rest on a timer as long as it doesn't land a critical hit on Alakazam. Despite being the selling point of the set, Encore can also be dropped for the combination of both Fire Punch and Toxic, which shines once Snorlax is removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is used more on bulky teams that do not require consistent pressure on the opponent. Offensively, Snorlax's coverage and status moves such as Earthquake and Toxic can be used to weaken Alakazam's checks such as Tyranitar. Defensively, it can absorb status from Pokemon such as Exeggutor for Alakazam. Skarmory and Umbreon help Alakazam against Snorlax and Exeggutor, while Alakazam can switch into dangerous foes such as Gengar and Machamp.</p> <p>If Alakazam is using Toxic and Spikes are set by Cloyster or Forretress, Roar Raikou can pose a serious offensive threat by racking up residual damage, especially since all of its checks are affected by Spikes and many of Alakazam's checks are also used to check Raikou. To keep Spikes on the field and provide a switch-in for Explosions, Ghost-types such as Gengar and Misdreavus also make for good teammates.</p>"

Counter, which works against all Hidden Power types in this generation, is also incompatible with Rapid Spin but can be a decent surprise option. Toxic is an option to make checking Golem with Cloyster more difficult for the opponent in the long run, but this would make Golem a much worse check for Curse Snorlax due to not having Roar and forcing it to use Explosion sooner rather than later. A four attack set of Earthquake, Explosion, Body Slam, and Fire Blast or Rock Slide is another alternative.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: With its high Defense stat, Cloyster has not much to fear from Golem, forces it out with the threat of Surf, and puts Spikes right back up after Golem removes them.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Earthquake, is only 3HKOed by Fire Blast should Golem have it, and can threaten Golem with Giga Drain, Psychic, or Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross resists Earthquake and has a chance to avoid the 3HKO from Fire Blast; in return, it can threaten Golem with Megahorn, Seismic Toss, or even the less common Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Should Golem not have Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock, the only thing Zapdos has to fear is Explosion, while in return it can pressure Golem with Hidden Power Ice or even Hidden Power Water or Grass.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory can help wear Golem down with Toxic or by stealing its Leftovers with Thief.

      "sets": {
        "Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The main reason to use Golem instead of similar Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix is its access to Rapid Spin, which it can use to give your team the all-important advantage of removing Spikes. Golem's resistance to Snorlax's Normal-type attacks allows it to find opportunities to switch in, and its ability to OHKO Gengar with STAB Earthquake makes it very difficult for the opponent to block Rapid Spin, as even Misdreavus, which takes neutral damage from it, is still 2HKOed after Spikes. Sadly, a healthy Cloyster has little to fear from Golem and can just switch in, forcing it out by threatening it with Surf or Ice Beam; Cloyster can then use Spikes again and Golem will need to find another opportunity to remove them later on. Forretress needs to worry about a possible Fire Blast but can otherwise threaten Golem with either Giga Drain or Toxic. Due to this, it can be helpful to hide Golem until Cloyster and Forretress are afflicted with status or weakened to make it more difficult for the opponent to get their Spikes back onto the field once Golem has spun them away.</p> <p>Explosion is generally a very strong move in GSC and that is no exception for Golem. The threat of spinning Spikes away with no consequences can lead to your opponent deciding to pressure Golem more aggressively. Potentially, if you deem Golem no longer needed for defensive purposes, this can allow you to surprise your opponent with a less expected Explosion and take out huge threats like Zapdos using Hidden Power Ice or Snorlax wanting to use Earthquake. Doing this prematurely, however, can leave you vulnerable to other threats that Golem previously could have checked.</p> <p>Roar is the most common fourth move, allowing Golem to fulfill the key defensive role of checking Snorlax, although it must watch out for Earthquake and Mean Look trappers. Roar also provides Golem with the ability to pressure the opposing team by racking up Spikes damage, especially against more defensive teams, which tend to have fewer Pokemon that threaten Golem. If you don't need another phazing move for your team, Fire Blast is a good alternative to prevent Forretress from switching in or even KOing it should the opponent play carelessly, as well as offering coverage for Skarmory and Exeggutor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Unlike Starmie or Tentacruel, Golem is terrible at checking most Spikes users, so Pokemon that can lure them like Snorlax with Thunder for Cloyster or Fire Blast or Flamethrower for Forretress are good partners. Your own Cloyster can help to weaken the opposing Cloyster or Forretress with Toxic and Surf, respectively, so that it is more difficult for them to use Spikes a second time later in the game. In most cases the opponent's Spikes setter must be removed or severely weakened because otherwise, the opponent is likely to set them up again. Rapid Spin Golem does not handle Hidden Power Ice Electric-types particularly well, having neither the Steel typing of Steelix nor the powerful Rock Slide that Rhydon has to threaten Zapdos. Due to that, on defensive teams, Golem is often used in combination with Raikou, which can safely switch into any Electric-type, and Skarmory, which covers the Ground-type weakness that the other two have. As a Ground-type with access to Thunder and Lovely Kiss, Nidoking is not handled well by that core, so an additional Pokemon like Sleep Talk Snorlax, Suicune, Vaporeon, or Heracross is recommended. Golem is less commonly used on very offensive teams, but if it is they usually try to ensure that many team members have a decent matchup versus Electric-types or can take them out with Explosion.</p>"

Curse helps Golem stand its ground against Curse Snorlax and can also give it the needed Attack boost to ensure that Explosion OHKOes some Pokemon. Due to not using Roar, this set gets utterly walled by Curse Skarmory, and it might also be forced to use Explosion earlier against Curse Snorlax.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With Explosion, Golem can pave the way for other sweepers like Charizard by removing Water-types.

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>When looking for a fast lead that beats other common leads and can inflict status, one would be hard pressed to find a better choice than Mr. Mime. Access to a wide variety of status and disruption moves makes Mr. Mime one of the best utility Pokemon in the tier. It doesn't clown around offensively, eitherâ€”its scarcely resisted STAB Psychic is complemented by a powerful Thunder that threatens common Water-types and offers near-perfect coverage. Unfortunately, Mr. Mime's low Defense and HP stats mean that it can't stick around to trade hits with many physical attackers, but its high Speed, terrific ability to disrupt foes, and respectable damage output solidify its status as one of GSC UU's best special attackers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch is a decent coverage option for Magneton, which is the only Pokemon in the tier that resists both Psychic and Thunder. Mr. Mime's high Speed and solid damage output mean that it can make good use of Swagger alongside Substitute, especially if the foe has been paralyzed beforehand. This can potentially allow Mr. Mime to get past Pokemon it would otherwise have almost no chance to break through, although it is an option that can be risky to use against physical attackers. Counter is another option that Mr. Mime can use to deal surprising amounts of damage to Pokemon such as Scyther, Granbull, and Piloswine, although it requires Mr. Mime to take a heavy physical hit and relies on surprising the opponent to work. Nightmare can be used to help Mr. Mime break through bulky RestTalk users that it can't 3HKO such as Ampharos and Hypno, although it has limited use cases when compared with other options overall. Ice Punch allows Mr. Mime to 2HKO Jumpluff and Gligar, although it has limited use outside of hitting those two Pokemon hard, and Mr. Mime is not lacking in ways to deal with them. Meditate or even Curse could theoretically be used alongside Baton Pass, but with Swords Dance + Baton Pass Scyther available, it is difficult to justify using Mr. Mime for this role. Flash could be used to further disrupt a paralyzed foe, but it has unreliable accuracy and is largely inferior to Mr. Mime's other options for disruption like Encore and Swagger.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense and HP such as Hypno, Ampharos, Chansey, and Lanturn take little damage from any of Mr. Mime's attacks and also tend not to mind the status effects Mr. Mime can inflict on them. Ampharos threatens Mr. Mime with its powerful Thunder, Hypno can inflict status on it and gradually wear it down, Chansey can threaten it with Present or status moves, and Lanturn can wear it down with its STAB attacks. However, Mr. Mime can lock them into an undesirable move with Encore, steal their Leftovers with Thief, or set up Reflect or Light Screen for a teammate against them.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton is the only Pokemon in GSC UU that resists both Psychic and Thunder. Its STAB Thunder comes close to 2HKOing Mr. Mime, and its RestTalk set has little fear of status. However, Mr. Mime occasionally uses Fire Punch, which comes close to 2HKOing Magneton.</p> <p><strong>Bellossom</strong>: Bellossom makes for a decent check to Mr. Mime, taking relatively little from its attacks and threatening it with status. However, it doesn't like getting paralyzed or put to sleep, can struggle to break Mr. Mime's Substitute, and is at risk of losing or being forced to switch if it gets locked into a move by Encore or gets fully paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Phazers</strong>: Pokemon such as Piloswine, Arcanine, and Blastoise make for decent answers to Baton Pass Mr. Mime, as they can take a hit from it and remove any boosts or Substitute safely with Roar. Piloswine also threatens Mr. Mime with its STAB Earthquake and Arcanine can trade hits decently with Fire Blast or Crunch. However, they can be worn down quickly if they repeatedly switch into Mr. Mime's Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Mr. Mime is terrible at taking strong physical attacks. Pokemon such as Granbull and Piloswine aren't afraid of Thunder Wave, can take a hit from Mr. Mime, and can 2HKO it in return, although they can be quickly worn down by Psychic if Spikes are up. Other physical attackers such as Dodrio, Scyther, Pinsir, and Sandslash take heavy damage on the switch and fear status, but they can all 2HKO Mr. Mime with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Encore Users</strong>: Pokemon such as opposing Mr. Mime, Jumpluff, and Kadabra make for decent checks to Baton Pass Mr. Mime, since they can lock it or its recipient into an undesirable move with Encore and take relatively low damage from its attacks. However, they fear status from Mr. Mime and Encore will fail if the last move used was Baton Pass, so in some scenarios they can be played around.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Disruptor": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set works well as a lead, getting its team off on the right foot by inflicting status on the opposing Pokemon or else directly attacking foes it has a type advantage against, such as Nidoqueen and Qwilfish. Spreading Thunder Wave is helpful for both Mr. Mime and its teammates, crippling offensive threats and bulkier Pokemon alike. Ground-types, which are immune to Thunder Wave, take hefty damage from Mr. Mime's powerful STAB Psychic. Slowbro and Slowking, two common Pokemon that resist Psychic and don't mind Thunder Wave too much, are dealt with handily by Thunder. Mr. Mime's fourth moveslot can be customized to suit one's team. One of the most useful moves is Encore, which is effective at handling the many Pokemon in the tier that attempt to set up Attack boosts thanks to Mr. Mime's high Speed and can also work as a method of creating opportunities for a teammate to switch in. It works well with Thunder Wave against Scyther, which cannot afford to risk setting up in front of Mr. Mime due to the possibility of getting paralyzed and outsped and hit by Encore the following turn. Other options Mr. Mime can use include Light Screen and Reflect, which can be useful at setting up opportunities for other sweepers. Thief is another option that can be used without an item to make some of Mr. Mime's safer counters like Hypno and Chansey a lot less durable by stealing their Leftovers. Substitute has good synergy with Mr. Mime's status moves and can protect Mr. Mime from the foe's attempts to inflict status. Lastly, although it has poor accuracy, Hypnosis can be used over Thunder Waveâ€”or even in the fourth slot for double statusâ€”to potentially cripple an opposing Pokemon with sleep, which can be devastating if it lands on a target that doesn't have Sleep Talk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mr. Mime tends to be best suited for offensive teams and strategies due to its stat distribution. Electric-types such as Ampharos and Magneton are often used to check Mr. Mime, so Nidoqueen can make for a good teammate. Scyther also works well because it can make good use of the opportunities Mr. Mime creates with its support moves and can hit Pokemon like Hypno and Chansey hard. Mr. Mime can sacrifice itself to lock various attackers into moves a teammate resists with Encore, for example locking Granbull into Return for Swords Dance Kabutops or Piloswine into Earthquake for Scyther or Pinsir. Using setup sweepers with useful resistances is therefore a good idea. Another strategy that can be used is to bring Mr. Mime with Thief to take the Leftovers of the opponent's check to Mr. Mime and using a Kadabra as a secondary special attacker to finish the crippled foe off. Haunter is a great choice with Mr. Mime, as it checks mono-attacking Granbull and has several checks in common with Mr. Mime, allowing it to lure in a Mr. Mime check and eliminate it with Explosion. Finally, Qwilfish's Spikes are very handy in ensuring Mr. Mime's Psychic can pose a threat to Pokemon it hits neutrally like Ampharos and Granbull.</p>"
        },
        "Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mr. Mime's wide array of support moves makes it one of the tier's premier Baton Pass users. Although it cannot boost its Speed, it is very good at creating opportunities for its teammates. Thunder Wave is excellent for slowing down the foe and also synergizes with Substitute to buy free turns for Mr. Mime or a teammate. When equipped with a Miracle Berry, especially if it has been passed Speed boosts from Pokemon like Girafarig, Mr. Mime can come in on a status move, set up a Substitute to block the second attempt, and lock the opposing Pokemon into the ineffective status move with Encore. Encore can also be used to get a teammate the free turn it needs to set up and sweep. For example, a Slowbro locked into Surf may provide the opportunity for Politoed to set up Belly Drum, or an Electabuzz locked into Thunder might allow Quagsire to set up. Barrier allows Mr. Mime to supplement its low Defense and reduce the damage taken from Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Granbull, which can be crucial to finding an opportunity for a Belly Drum user to set up. Hypnosis can also be used to take care of any out-of-control threat, although it relies on very shaky accuracy. In order to deter phazers, it is important to have an attacking move. Psychic hits all phazers for decent damage and offers good general coverage, whereas Thunder's coverage is not as good but hits some Haze and Roar users, such as Omastar and Blastoise, harder than Psychic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Baton Pass Mr. Mime makes for an excellent addition to a Baton Pass chain. It is important that Mr. Mime is passed a Speed boost if being used on a Baton Pass chain due to Pokemon like opposing Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Jumpluff, which otherwise threaten to outspeed it and lock it into a move with Encore. Girafarig is perhaps the best Speed passer in the tier, having few relevant weaknesses and access to Amnesia, as well as threatening coverage moves for Haze and Roar users. Another option is Scyther, although it poses less of a threat to Haze and Roar users if it does not set up Swords Dance before setting up a Speed boost. A third option is the rare Ariados, which has the unique quality of being able to Baton Pass Spider Web along with its Speed boost and can use Protect and Disable to block strong attacks and phazing moves. Spider Web Ariados, in particular, works well with Mr. Mime's Encore. In terms of recipients, Quagsire is the best Belly Drum user in the tier and is typically seen as the recipient of choice, although Poliwrath and Politoed have the advantage of access to Lovely Kiss alongside Belly Drum and lack an exploitable 4x type weakness. Quagsire's powerful STAB Earthquake is the most important factor that separates it from the others, as it allows Quagsire to OHKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it after a Belly Drum. Pokemon that can set up dual screens for the Baton Pass chain are also welcome additions; the most commonly chosen option for this is Electrode, which can use Explosion to guarantee safe entry for the first Pokemon in the Baton Pass chain. Haunter is another common choice, as it checks Curse Granbull, which can be tricky to deal with for Baton Pass teams, and it can attempt to trade itself for a threatening foe with its Explosion.</p> <p>Baton Pass Mr. Mime does not have to be used on a dedicated Baton Pass team; it can work as a standalone Baton Pass user and simply pass Substitute or Barrier to Pokemon that appreciate it. Flimsy but powerful Pokemon such as Dodrio, Sandslash, Haunter, and Pikachu appreciate the protection and safe entry that Mr. Mime's Substitute passing affords them. Barrier is most appreciated by receivers that use other boosting moves such as Growth + Amnesia Politoed, but it can also be of use to Pokemon with good special bulk like Ampharos in helping to overcome their usual checks.</p>"
        },
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Despite its mediocre physical bulk, Mr. Mime can make for a decent RestTalk user with its decent Special Defense, solid coverage, and ability to threaten common Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Slowbro. Psychic and Thunder are both necessary, as they allow it to pose a substantial threat to much of the metagame, with a few notable exceptions in Magneton, Chansey, and Hypno. This Mr. Mime set has much more flexibility in terms of what it can switch into, since it fears status a lot less. Its decent special bulk alongside RestTalk makes it possible for it to check many Psychic-types such as opposing Mr. Mime, Slowbro, Slowking, and Kadabra, despite many of them utilizing status moves. It should avoid coming in on Nidoqueen's Earthquake, but it can switch into Nidoqueen's other attacks without too much to fear and threaten a 2HKO with Psychic while only being 3HKOed by Earthquake in return. However, Mr. Mime should still try to avoid picking fights with powerful physical attackers such as Granbull, Dodrio, Scyther, Pinsir, and Piloswine unless absolutely necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Mr. Mime can fit on both more offensively inclined teams and more balanced teams. Offensive teams value its ability to absorb status while still having solid damage output, and balanced teams appreciate that it provides defensive support without introducing passivity to the lineup. While it provides a degree of defensive support, RestTalk Mr. Mime is not reliable at holding back powerful Pokemon such as Ampharos, nor can it handle strong physical attackers. It is therefore a good idea to bring Nidoqueen, Piloswine, or Quagsire, as these Pokemon can typically withstand attacks from Electric-types. Ground- and Rock-types such as Piloswine, Sandslash, and Kabutops can be effective at handling Scyther, which is a major threat to Mr. Mime. Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types such as Omastar, Magneton, and Haunter are also very much appreciated as teammates due to Mr. Mime struggling against Granbull and Dodrio. Jumpluff is a fantastic catch-all for setup sweepers that may look to take advantage of Mr. Mime's lack of control while it is asleep. Mr. Mime's offensive presence can be bolstered by Spikes support from Qwilfish, which can help it get past bulkier foes.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Although Articuno may not have nearly as much influence over the metagame as its Electric-type sibling Zapdos, like many other UUBL Pokemon it still finds a small niche in OU. While it may not have the best defensive typing or movepool, Articuno still avoids taking damage from Spikes, has decent defensive stats, and is able to reliably absorb sleep from all of the metagame's sleep spreaders besides Snorlax. Articuno faces fierce competition in the form of its fellow legendary Pokemon Suicune. Suicune performs the exact same roles as Articuno while having a resistance to Fire, a neutrality to Rock, the ability to threaten back Rock-types with super effective damage, and a typing with generally superior offensive coverage, which means it can check more Pokemon than Articuno. This can make it difficult to fit Articuno on teams without introducing weaknesses to Pokemon like Charizard and Machamp. Spikes immunity does give it an edge in longer, drawn-out battles, and STAB Ice Beam makes it harder for RestTalk Zapdos to take Toxic, but most teams have a Rest Snorlax to wall Articuno anyway. While generally left out in the cold in terms of usage, the king of Seafoam Islands has just enough useful defensive traits that it retains viability in OU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to stop Forretress from getting a free switch into Articuno while also giving Articuno a move to break Jynx's Substitute, but giving up one of the main options on the set makes Articuno worse off against everything else. If you wish to compromise Articuno's ability to absorb sleep status, you could use Toxic alongside Reflect and drop Sleep Talk. This would give Articuno a better matchup against Snorlax, but by doing so it trades reliability against sleep inducers Articuno normally checks. Blizzard can be used for more power, which can OHKO Pokemon such as Rhydon, Marowak, Exeggutor, and Nidoking, though the latter two require prior Spikes damage, and Articuno generally does well against them with Ice Beam anyway. Blizzard's low PP and accuracy also makes Ice Beam the better option, though the PP issue can be supplemented with Sleep Talk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-type Attacks</strong>: Pokemon with Rock-type attacks such as Machamp and Tyranitar threaten Articuno with super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Forretress</strong>: As said before, Forretress can freely switch into Articuno and can proceed to remove Spikes or set them up. However, it does always run the risk of being frozen by Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Raikou can freely switch into Articuno and threaten it out with an Electric-type attack or begin shuffling Articuno's team with Roar, but it must be careful of Articuno using Toxic to hit it on the switch. Snorlax with Rest counters Articuno in a similar fashion with its hard-hitting Normal-type attacks. Blissey shrugs off Ice Beam and has Heal Bell to undo the freeze and poison that Articuno can spread.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Tentacruel is safe from all attacks that Articuno can throw at it and can either set up with Substitute or Swords Dance or take advantage of the free turn to remove Spikes with Rapid Spin. Cloyster and Starmie do not fear Ice Beam and can Rapid Spinâ€”or use Toxic, Explosion, or Spikes in Cloyster's caseâ€”in retaliation, but they lack an immunity to Toxic. Vaporeon can set up Growth boosts against Articuno, and although Toxic may force it to use Rest, Sleep Talk variants will not mind this too much.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk Users</strong>: Pokemon that run Sleep Talk with Rest and do not fear Ice Beam such as Umbreon, Snorlax, Heracross, and Suicune can switch into Articuno and not worry about being inflicted with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Entei, Typhlosion, Charizard, and Moltres can all switch into Articuno and threaten it with Fire Blast. Moltres in particular typically runs RestTalk, and so doesn't fear Toxic.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Blue Bird (RestTalk / Phazer)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>As Articuno can safely switch in on Jynx, Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Blissey, Sleep Talk and Rest make a lot of sense to ensure that Articuno is effective as a designated sleep absorber. Alternatively, Roar can be used over Sleep Talk to make Articuno harder to set up on for Snorlax and Vaporeon and allow Articuno to pressure Pokemon that it has poisoned and stop them from switching in and using Rest. Ice Beam provides some offensive utility coming off a Special Attack stat that isn't too bad. A 10% chance to freeze should never be underestimated, either. Toxic is used to weaken incoming Pokemon that can beat Articuno one-on-one, such as Raikou, Snorlax, and Tyranitar. It can also be used to buy some time against sweepers like Vaporeon by forcing them to use Rest and wear down enemy Cloyster in an attempt to win the all-important Spikes war. Reflect may also be used to provide some defensive support for Articuno's teammates and help Articuno against the many Explosion users in the metagame.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Articuno generally plays a supportive role and can be taken advantage of by a lot of common metagame threats, it works best when supporting defensive teams. Pokemon that do not mind stomaching a Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, such as Raikou and Blissey, cover Articuno's weakness to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Articuno's shallow movepool means that Forretress, which has an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Ice, can freely switch into Articuno and proceed to remove Spikes. Hence, Ghost-type Pokemon that can block Rapid Spin and Pokemon with Fire-type coverage to lure Forretress make good partners for Articuno.</p> <p>Articuno's big weakness to Rock-type attacks means that Pokemon that can safely switch into them can cover the frosty bird's weakness. Golem, Rhydon, and Nidoking can all do this, but they must be careful of other moves that may threaten them. Skarmory is a blanket check to physical attacks and can sometimes fill this role as well. Miltank's fast Growl and Umbreon's Charm mean that both Pokemon can help out in an emergency, especially when supported by Reflect from Articuno. Suicune can also be used as a partner to Articuno, as if one caries Roar and the other has RestTalk, they can cover a lot of threats together. They both spread poison effectively, and Articuno can take Explosion for Suicune reasonably well thanks to its Spikes immunity making it harder to wear down.</p> <p>Pursuit support from Umbreon helps Articuno out against Starmie, which Articuno is otherwise passive against and can only hope to poison or freeze. Pursuit support can also help out in the Gengar matchup, which can be difficult for Articuno if it has to switch into Thunder.</p> <p>Speaking of Starmie, it too makes a good partner for Articuno thanks to its effectiveness against Machamp, Rhydon, and Charizard.</p> <p>Offensively, Articuno's most effective teammates are those that aim to win in the long term, such as Forretress through its use of Spikes, Snorlax with a STAB attack and two coverage moves, and Belly Drum Snorlax. The status inflictions Articuno provides can give these teammates the opportunities they need to switch in and make a long-lasting impact on the game.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Zapdos is a dominant and defining Pokemon in GSC OU. It has tremendous base 125 Special Attack and near perfect coverage between STAB Electric-type moves and Hidden Power Ice, making it an offensive force to be reckoned with. It is particularly deadly when used with Spikes support, as no Pokemon immune to Spikes can stomach hits from it for long, and even grounded foes that can withstand a beating from it, such as Raikou and Snorlax, become crippled if Zapdos's Thunder inflicts paralysis on them. Zapdos also has defensive traits that its main competition, Raikou, can only look to the sky in envy at. Its Flying typing grants it immunity to Earthquake from the tier's many Ground-types as well as useful resistances to Fighting and Bugâ€”all without the usual accompanying weakness to Electric-type attacks. Its phenomenal typing and formidable defensive stats make it one of the best candidates for using RestTalk, which gives Zapdos excellent longevity and makes it one of the best Pokemon at taking Toxic from foes such as Skarmory, Cloyster, Suicune, and Blissey, although it should be more wary of taking paralysis when it doesn't need to. Thanks to its spectacular damage output, even the few Pokemon that can 2HKO it, such as Jynx, Tyranitar, and Marowak, can struggle to find an opportunity to advantageously trade hits with it, especially since Zapdos often finds chances to recover lost health with Rest. This excellent balance between offense and defense makes Zapdos an easy fit on many teams. However, Zapdos will often find itself having to trade hits with Snorlax, which is one of the very few Pokemon that can do so favorably. Furthermore, while it generally has the upper hand in most matchups, many common offensive Pokemon such as Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Steelix will often try to trade themselves for Zapdos with Explosion, which almost always OHKOes it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running Drill Peck with an Electric-type move and Hidden Power Water will give Zapdos a better matchup against threats such as Heracross, Machamp, and Exeggutor, and its high PP and solid damage output can put pressure on Blissey's Soft-Boiled PP, but Zapdos will still have problems with Raikou, Snorlax, and Quagsire. When used alongside Whirlwind, Reflect is helpful when dealing with Tyranitar, Machamp, and Snorlax; Light Screen is similarly useful when fighting Nidoking, Jynx, and opposing Zapdos. Light Screen also tends to be valuable in helping setup sweepers find opportunities to boost without losing too much health in the process. Toxic is a possibility to force Snorlax and Raikou into a predictable Rest, which can grant momentum. In addition, if Snorlax is unable to safely absorb Toxic, this can put Blissey in a difficult position due to its limited Heal Bell PP. Zapdos can consider running Hidden Power Grass to deal a lot of damage to Quagsire, but this will severely impact Zapdos's HP stat and lose crucial super effective coverage against Nidoking, so it is therefore almost never recommended. With Magnet, Zapdos can possibly 3HKO Snorlax with Thunder after Spikes, though losing Leftovers reduces Zapdos's longevity by such a huge amount that Zapdos loses much of its usual defensive effectiveness. Zapdos's high Speed means that it can use Substitute + Swagger somewhat effectively with prior paralysis spreading and Spikes support. This can give it a better chance of getting through some of its bulkier checks, such as Snorlax and Quagsire. However, this strategy can easily fall apart against RestTalk Zapdos and Raikou if they are able to use Rest, and the set suffers from the inability to fit Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou is the best counter to Zapdos, as it can take any of Zapdos's moves while phazing or hammering Zapdos with a powerful STAB Thunder of its own. Jolteon can use Zapdos without Whirlwind as setup bait. After it uses Agility or Growth, it can use Baton Pass to send a deadly boost to a teammate to sweep Zapdos's team. Jolteon can also easily dispose of Zapdos itself after using Growth. Other less common Electric-types such as Ampharos also have a good matchup against Zapdos. However, none of them appreciate being paralyzed by Zapdos's Thunder or Thunder Wave, and none of them can immediately threaten a 2HKO on Zapdos, which can give Zapdos a chance to fish for paralysis against them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey walls Zapdos all day long; however, it is largely unable to do anything significant to Zapdos other than use Light Screen to support its team or fish for a freeze with Ice Beam while Zapdos is awake. With RestTalk or Heal Bell support, Snorlax will easily take on even Thunder Zapdos. Even without such support, Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon at tanking Zapdos's moves and threatens it back significantly with its STAB attacks. However, Zapdos's Thunder is capable of 4HKOing Snorlax, so pairing Snorlax with a Ground-type Pokemon to bait Hidden Power can be useful in limiting the damage it takes switching in. Rapid Spin support also helps immensely in this regard, as Spikes damage counteracts Leftovers recovery and causes Thunder damage to accumulate far more quickly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix works as an effective pivot for teams looking to bring in a check to Zapdos against a relatively weak Hidden Power Ice. Steelix can also use Explosion to trade itself for Zapdos, phaze, or paralyze Zapdos with Body Slam or Dragon Breath. Piloswine and Quagsire can also check Hidden Power Ice Zapdos reliably and potentially threaten it in return with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Rock. Quagsire also has the advantage of taking neutral damage from Hidden Power Water, unlike the other Ground-types that also take neutral damage from Hidden Power Ice. Marowak can 2HKO Zapdos with Rock Slide and almost always avoids a 2HKO from Hidden Power. Nidoking usually 3HKOes with Ice Beam and has the threat of Counter up its sleeveâ€”Counter always succeeds against Hidden Power in GSC, although Nidoking should weaken Zapdos before attempting to pull this off. Rhydon 2HKOes Zapdos with Rock Slide and narrowly evades being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice almost all of the time. However, the slim margins in this matchup, as well as the potential Hidden Power Water OHKO, make fighting Zapdos with Rhydon head on a risky proposition. Rhydon and Marowak both also have access to Counter; Rhydon will OHKO if targeted by Hidden Power Ice about 85% of the time and can guarantee an OHKO if it has slightly lower Special DVs than maximum, whereas to KO with Marowak, Zapdos must be weakened or Marowak's Special DVs and Special Stat Experience must be significantly lower than maximum, which may not be worth the serious loss of special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>:  Tyranitar has STAB Rock Slide, which achieves the rare feat of 2HKOing Zapdos. Furthermore, it has Pursuit to chip away at Zapdos as it switches out. However, Tyranitar cannot afford to switch in on Zapdos's Thunder, which 3HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx cannot afford to switch into a an Electric-type move from Zapdos, but usually avoids a Thunder 2HKO and threatens a 2HKO in return with Ice Beam, making it a good option to switch in as Zapdos uses Rest.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Zapdos makes a great target for Explosion users such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, Golem, Steelix, and Gengar. With the exception of Gengar, which can use Ice Punch to bring it into KO range beforehand, most Explosion users in OU can always OHKO Zapdos, and this is often an excellent trade to make. Removing Zapdos from the picture often paves the way for attackers such as Vaporeon, Nidoking, and Machamp to wreak havoc.</p> <p><strong>Sunny Day</strong>: Pokemon with Sunny Day can turn a winning matchup into a potential losing one for Zapdos variants relying on Thunder. Entei, Typhlosion, and Houndoom can also 2HKO Zapdos with Fire Blast in sun, and Moltres often survives one hit from Thunder to land a 2HKO. However, if Zapdos manages to land Thunder, it has good odds to 2HKO Typhlosion and Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Zapdos's tendency to use the inaccurate Thunder can be exploited by fast Pokemon with Substitute, such as Alakazam, Espeon, Tentacruel, and Starmie. As Zapdos fails to break Substitute with Hidden Power most of the time, Thunder misses can generate free turns to set up, fire off attacks, or spin away Spikes.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Great Special Attack, combined with the ability to continuously get rid of status and restore health with virtually no drawbacks, turns Zapdos into a powerful tank. The choice between Thunder and Thunderbolt depends on what your team needs more: power or consistency. Offensive teams will typically favor Thunder's higher Base Power, which allows Zapdos to possibly 4HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Miltank. The damage roll on Snorlax is particularly notable against non-Sleep Talk Snorlax, as Zapdos without Thunder will require multiple critical hits within a few turns to KO Snorlax, whereas Thunder Zapdos can potentially KO it if Thunder lands a critical hit within three attacks. Thunder's high chance of inflicting paralysis also makes Electric-types such as Raikou shakier at checking Zapdos, as they depend on their Speed to reliably deal with other foes such as Vaporeon and Cloyster. This high chance of paralysis on such a powerful move is an important reason why Zapdos can be so difficult to deal withâ€”aside from Raikou, Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Tyranitar, Porygon2, and Gengar lose considerable effectiveness when they become paralyzed, and they will all need to risk this occasionally. Still, some teams may prefer the high PP and accuracy of Thunderbolt, which gives Zapdos more consistency against foes such as Vaporeon, Cloyster, Starmie, and Tentacruel. Zapdos's coverage attack is primarily used to threaten Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak. Hidden Power Ice has the benefits of hitting Grass-types such as Exeggutor super effectively and crucially increasing Zapdos's odds at beating opposing RestTalk Zapdos with Sleep Talk rolls. Hidden Power Water is an alternative option to hit Golem, Steelix, and Rhydon harder, but the resulting HP DV drop and neutral damage to opposing Zapdos make Zapdos substantially less likely to come out on top against RestTalk Zapdos with Hidden Power Ice. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Zapdos makes a great status absorber and a more consistent check to Vaporeon, Exeggutor, and Nidoking. Its defensive stats and typing pair together so well that, with the right Sleep Talk rolls, it can sometimes beat almost an entire weakened team by itself, especially if the team lacks Explosion or attacks that 2HKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos possesses several qualities that make it fantastic at taking advantage of Spikes: its attacking moves hit all Spikes-immune Pokemon extremely hard, its immunity to Spikes makes it excellent at double switching to rack up Spikes damage, and very few of the Pokemon that can withstand its powerful attacks pose an immediate KO threat in return. Cloyster not only provides these Spikes, but it also switches into many of the Pokemon that can switch into Zapdos, with the notable exception of Raikou. Offensive partners such as Gengar and Exeggutor lure in the three major walls that trouble Zapdosâ€”Raikou, Blissey, and Snorlaxâ€”and can use a strong Explosion to KO or severely weaken them. Gengar also acts as an effective lure to Quagsire, which, while uncommon, walls Zapdos effectively. Exeggutor, on the other hand, can check Quagsire with ease. Zapdos also enjoys support from Snorlax, which can take on problematic foes such as Raikou, Blissey, and Jolteon, while a Raikou of your own will take on opposing Electric-types. If Snorlax has Self-Destruct, it can also bait and KO opposing Snorlax to give room for Zapdos to wreak havoc. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Machamp appreciate paralysis support from Thunder, and teams that have Raikou will almost certainly switch it into Zapdos, giving Zapdos plenty of chances to inflict this paralysis for its teammates. Zapdos enjoys support from Snorlax checks such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Machamp on offensive teams and Skarmory, Misdreavus, Umbreon, and Miltank on defensive teams; Tyranitar and Golem are also commonly found on both kinds of team. Skarmory can also take Explosion from Steelix and deal with Quagsire. Machamp, Vaporeon, and Ground-types such as Nidoking help Zapdos against Tyranitar. Ground-types also help against Electric-types, especially Raikou.</p>"

        "Offensive Phazer": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Zapdos can take its already respectable offensive presence to another level by using Whirlwind in tandem with Spikes support. This set works due to Zapdos's huge threat level against a vast majority of the metagame. Few Pokemon can afford to stay in to trade hits with Zapdosâ€”notably, fewer than can take Roar Raikou onâ€”with many risking being OHKOed if they stay in. Most teams rely on Snorlax and Raikou or a Ground-type to combat Zapdos's onslaught, but repeatedly taking Spikes damage on entry and then immediately being phazed, forcing another entry, can bring even the sturdiest checks into KO range of its attacks. There is no reliable answer to such a strategy other than to anticipate Whirlwind and attack Zapdos or hope that Whirlwind drags in a healthy Pokemon that has a favorable matchup. Whirlwind also lets Zapdos punish Snorlax for setting up Curse against it by preventing it from burning through any of its sleep turns if used when Snorlax is forced to use Rest. Thunder Wave can cripple most healthy Pokemon, making the target easier for Zapdos and its team to deal with. It is particularly useful when dealing with RestTalk Zapdos, which is one of the only Pokemon that can give this Zapdos significant trouble due to its immunity to Spikes and ability to avoid being 2HKOed. Thunder Wave is not the only option for this moveslot; rather, it is the clear best option for a majority of teams. One alternative is Protect, which can block Explosion from the likes of Exeggutor, Steelix, and Gengar and allow Zapdos to recover health with Leftovers to help compensate for lacking Rest, potentially turning 3HKOs into 4HKOs against foes such as Nidoking and Gengar. While this Zapdos is typically considered an offensive variant, Whirlwind also allows it to play defensive roles, such as phazing Mean Look variants of Misdreavus and Umbreon, Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax that have used Rest, and other foes with boosting moves. On more defensive lineups, it may elect to use Rest over Thunder Wave and pair up with a Heal Bell user such as Blissey.</p> <p>In terms of attacks, this variant of Zapdos is much more dependent on Spikes support and therefore prefers to have the most powerful and accurate moves against Rapid Spin users. Thunderbolt is slightly preferred over Thunder, as it consistently eliminates Starmie and Cloyster and deals reliable heavy damage to Forretress, and Hidden Power Water is preferred over Hidden Power Ice so that Zapdos can nail Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix, which is useful to deter use of Rapid Spin from Golem, Rock Slide from Rhydon, and Body Slam or Roar from Steelix. In addition, Whirlwind somewhat compensates for Hidden Power Water's worsened Exeggutor matchup, as Zapdos can phaze it as it switches in. However, Exeggutor is a much bigger threat to this Zapdos and can be especially problematic if the team cannot maintain Spikes support. Hidden Power Ice can therefore still be useful, and it also helps against opposing Zapdos when using the less reliable Thunder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster is the preferred teammate for Spikes support, as it provides a significant offensive threat alongside its Spikes and can blow a hole in the opponent's defenses against Zapdos. It also provides a decent temporary answer to Curse Snorlax thanks to its high Defense, tendency to run Toxic in its standard movesetâ€”which can force Snorlax to use Rest, and ability to threaten Snorlax with Explosion. Cloyster also provides a temporary answer to Ground- and Rock-type foes that Zapdos may not always want to trade hits with, such as Rhydon and Marowak. Forretress is a valid alternative, although its offensive capabilities are lacking. It is great at taking advantage of foes such as mono-attacking Snorlax and capitalizes well when opponents are stacking their teams with anti-Cloyster measures, such as Thunder Snorlax and Toxic Skarmory, which are less effective against Forretress and can grant it easy opportunities to set Spikes. Gengar is another useful teammate for its ability to spinblock, as losing Spikes can significantly impair Zapdos's offensive capabilities against defensive teams. Without RestTalk, Zapdos is far more susceptible to status. RestTalk Snorlax is therefore a great choice of teammate, especially on teams that lack other good candidates for a RestTalk user, as it can absorb status from most foes safely. Zapdos generally appreciates having offensive teammates that punish foes for trying to recover. Some of these include Nidoking, Gengar, Exeggutor, and Jynx. In particular, it is important that Zapdos's teammates do not allow paralyzed opposing Zapdos opportunities to switch in and use Rest without threatening a 3HKO in return or a trade with Explosion.</p> <p>However, if Zapdos is instead found on a defensive lineup, pressing a favorable position is much less important and its teammates can instead be focused on gaining and maintaining a Spikes advantage while walling the enemy team. Skarmory is a commonly chosen teammate that can take on Curse + Earthquake Snorlax reliably and check Marowak and Machamp, which are two Pokemon that Zapdos does not want to be the lone check against. Blissey is a great choice for checking special attackers and offering Heal Bell support to Zapdos. When paired with other formidable mixed tanks such as Snorlax, Zapdos can also help against foes such as Nidoking, Machamp, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, despite lacking RestTalk.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Moltres is GSC OU's most consistent Sunny Day attacker. It has the highest Special Attack out of any Fire-type, and with the help of Charcoal and Sunny Day, it has extremely high odds to 2HKO Snorlax after Spikes. Moltres's defensive stats are also quite solid, and its typing enables it to answer common threats like Exeggutor, Steelix, Forretress, and Heracross. In addition, it makes for a decent sleep absorber, and its Spikes immunity can be quite useful for longer games. Moltres best matches up versus offensive teams that lack Fire-resistant Pokemon, in particular when Steelix is used as the only Normal-type check with a Zapdos / Snorlax / Cloyster core; unless Vaporeon or Charizard is used in one of the slots, the other two Pokemon likely do not resist Fire. Some examples of those Pokemon are Nidoking, Jynx, Exeggutor, Machamp, and Gengar. In addition, Moltres can wreak havoc versus traditional defensive teams that replace Suicune with Umbreon.</p> <p>Despite Moltres's potential to 2HKO Snorlax, it's still not favored in a one-on-one matchup; its best chances are if sun has already been set up, but Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to take Moltres down with it. Usually Moltres's only attack is Fire Blast, so Water- and Rock-types like Vaporeon, Suicune, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem will often stop it in its tracks. Moltres also struggles versus Zapdos and Raikou if they switch in safely, as they outspeed it and threaten it with their powerful Electric-type attacks.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more PP and higher accuracy, but this is generally not worth it, as the additional power is extremely important and Moltres can somewhat compensate for Fire Blast's low PP with Rest and Sleep Talk. Leftovers can also be used over Charcoal for increased longevity at the expense of more power. Hidden Power Grass gives Moltres better coverage, enabling it to turn the tide against Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire; however, the move is far too weak to make a significant difference versus Vaporeon, Starmie, and Suicune. Whirlwind is a decent option, since Moltres is able to force many switches with its offensive presence. Sleep Talk can be used without Rest on more offensive sets so Moltres can still function as a sleep absorber, but its longevity will be significantly hampered. Toxic could be used to cripple Rock-types like Rhydon, Golem, and Tyranitar, but it's quite difficult to find room for this move. Substitute is an interesting option alongside moves like Sunny Day and Toxic, which can potentially enable Moltres to more safely combat Electric-types like Zapdos and Raikou. Overall, however, Moltres has an extremely difficult time giving up any of its main moves and will lose a large portion of its effectiveness if any of them is replaced.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Vaporeon, Quagsire, Starmie, and Suicune can completely shut down Moltres, as they can shrug off Fire Blast, even in the sun, and hit Moltres with super effective Water-type attacks or, in Quagsire's case, Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon can check Moltres, as Fire Blast is usually its only attacking move. While Tyranitar and Rhydon can fire back with a 4x super effective Rock Slide, Golem typically needs to use Explosion to remove Moltres as it often forgoes Rock-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou both outspeed Moltres and can threaten it with powerful STAB-boosted Electric-type attacks. While Moltres can deal massive damage back with Fire Blast, it doesn't usually want to stay in and take an attack. Moltres is able to take one Thunder, however, so it may want to go for a KO in a pinch. If sun is up, Moltres may also want to stay in and bank on a 50% chance for Thunder to miss, which may open the gate for it to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax have a lot of natural Special Defense, which enables them to check Moltres. While Blissey checks Moltres defensively by shrugging off Fire Blast, Snorlax can hit Moltres with powerful STAB-boosted Normal-type attacks like Body Slam, Double-Edge, and even Self-Destruct. Snorlax needs to be careful of a Charcoal-boosted Fire Blast in the sun, though, which has high odds to 2HKO it after damage from Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar outspeeds Moltres and can attack it with a super effective Electric-type attack, use Explosion to remove it, or even take Moltres down with it by using Destiny Bond. Gengar can never switch into Moltres safely, though; it needs to be very healthy to take a hit. While sun is up, Gengar should never switch into Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Rock-type attacks</strong>: Machamp and Marowak can always take a hit from full and hit Moltres with a devastating 4x super effective Rock Slide, landing a 2HKO and an OHKO respectively. Neither of these Pokemon can switch into Moltres safely, however, because they risk being 2HKOed by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Charizard is a great Moltres check because it can switch into Fire Blast safely from full, and it can outspeed and 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Entei resists any of Moltres's attacks, but it can't do too much damage back to Moltres. Still, it can be used in hopes that Moltres wastes its Fire Blast PP on it. Moltres can check itself, but that often results in a PP war.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>RestTalk is Moltres's most consistent moveset because of its overall longevity and ability to compensate for Sunny Day's and Fire Blast's low PP. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk enables Moltres to check Pokemon like Exeggutor and Jynx, which would otherwise be a bit difficult to switch into. In addition, thanks to Sunny Day reducing Thunder's accuracy, Moltres can also absorb Nidoking's Lovely Kiss relatively well. If Nidoking tries to use Thief, it ends up stealing Charcoal, which significantly reduces Thief's effectiveness. Sunny Day significantly increases Moltres's damage output, which enables it to OHKO Cloyster and Gengar after Spikes, as well as 2HKO several Pokemon such as Machamp, Zapdos, and Raikou. With Charcoal, it even has high odds to 2HKO Snorlax after Spikes, which is significant in that no other Sunny Day attacker is capable of accomplishing that feat.</p> <p>Although it may seem inconvenient for Moltres to use Sunny Day with Sleep Talk, this can be useful to restart sun's timer and also make it more difficult for Pokemon like Zapdos, Raikou, Snorlax, and Nidoking to land Thunder. While Moltres is awake, try to conserve Fire Blast's PP carefully, as 8 PP is extremely low and may be difficult to manage in a long game. It may also be best to keep Moltres hidden as long as possible, because compared to other Pokemon, Moltres can become much easier to manage once it has been revealed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>For Moltres to successfully sweep a team, it needs quite a bit of support. Sleep inducers like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Gengar make it easier to switch Moltres in and set up. As an added bonus, all of these Pokemon can use Explosion or Self-Destruct to potentially remove a Moltres check like Vaporeon, Suicune, Zapdos, or Raikou. Cloyster is an almost mandatory teammate, as Spikes are what enable Moltres to have high odds at 2HKOing Snorlax. In addition, its Explosion is also very useful, especially for removing Moltres checks like Starmie, Vaporeon, and Suicune. Steelix's Steel / Ground typing allows it to support Moltres with its Electric immunity and Normal and Rock resistances. It can often use a combination of Curse, Roar, and Explosion to force in and KO Zapdos, assisting in Moltres's eventual sweep. Other Ground-types like Nidoking and Golem can be useful to combat Electric-types; Nidoking can use Lovely Kiss, and Golem can use Explosion to disrupt typical Moltres checks. Your own Raikou can support Moltres by shrugging off Electric-type attacks from Zapdos, using Roar to phaze the opposing team and identify Moltres checks early, and pressuring Water-types like Suicune and Vaporeon. Raikou can potentially use Hidden Power Water to lure in and remove Rock / Ground types like Rhydon and Golem, but both should be worn down slightly before using the move, as it is not a guaranteed OHKO. Also, using Thunderbolt over Thunder on Raikou should be considered so as to not be messed up by your own sun. Moltres can directly support Tyranitar by using Sunny Day to weaken Water-type attacks and enable it to take on Electric-types with slightly more ease. In return, Tyranitar can switch into Starmie and threaten it with Pursuit and Crunch, which frees up Moltres and Cloyster significantly.</p>"

Synthesis and dual screens, coupled with Meganium's solid defense stats and notable resistances--Electric, Water, and Ground--make it a wonderful supporter that can switch in on numerous threats. If that role is not needed, Meganium can also generate some offense with Swords Dance while still staying around with Synthesis. Should one opt for the Swords Dance set, be able to get Skarmory and Zapdos out the way.</p>",

Meganium also learns Counter, which is an awesome and underrated surprise move that will send Zapdos and Skarmory packing if they've taken any damage beforehand (remember that Counter also works on Hidden Power, so Hidden Power Ice Zapdos cannot circumvent the issue).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The support set is hard to take down, but Meganium won't be taking anything down itself, so most things sporting a super effective attack and/or a resistance to Razor Leaf can break through Meganium's defenses.</p> <p>The Swords Dance set is walled by Skarmory and most Flying-types in general, including Charizard, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Aerodactyl. However, none of the aforementioned can afford to be paralyzed a lot, so fishing for paralysis with Body Slam is a good place to start. From there, something can set up to take them down and open the gates for Meganium.</p>",

The beauty in Body Slam is its ability to cripple something like Starmie, who needs its speed to be effective. Try and keep this set hidden until the counters for it--Skarmory and Zapdos, mainly--are eliminated. From there, bulk up with Swords Dance and go to town.</p> <p>One may be tempted to put a Grass STAB move here, but it's generally not needed. You're better off trying to paralyze Suicune and Starmie, and after a Swords Dance, either of the physical attacks will do as much or more than a super effective Razor Leaf. The only things that Razor Leaf or Giga Drain will do more damage to are Cloyster and Rhydon, which is far from enough to merit use over the 50% recovery of Synthesis. Rhydon will get hit hard with a +2 Earthquake anyway.

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Typhlosion has a small edge over its main competitors Charizard and Moltres with its Electric neutrality and lesser weakness to Rock, which allows Typhlosion to directly take on Zapdos as well as avoid an OHKO from some Rock-type move users like Tyranitar. Typhlosion also has Dynamic Punch, which despite its abysmal accuracy, allows it to threaten Tyranitar and annoy Snorlax.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even when considering the above traits, Typhlosion is still generally outclassed by other Fire-types. As a Sunny Day sweeper, Typhlosion struggles to stand out from Moltres, Houndoom, and even Entei, which have better Special Attack, typing, or bulk, respectively, that allow them to take on a much larger range of threats; notably, unlike Typhlosion, Houndoom and Entei can use Solar Beam, an incredibly useful move under sun. Typhlosion also faces competition from Charizard, which has the same base stats, a Flying typing that gives it an immunity to Ground-type moves, and access to Belly Drum to bolster its offensive prowess even further. Additionally, Typhlosion's poor bulk and common weaknesses mean that it heavily relies on prediction and team support to work effectively. Even when predicting correctly and having the right support, Typhlosion relies on moves with unreliable accuracy such as Fire Blast and Dynamic Punch, so it is generally inconsistent.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Typhlosion can use Hidden Power Ice to 2HKO Dragonite, which usually hard counters it. However, running Hidden Power Ice over Hidden Power Grass leaves Typhlosion more vulnerable to Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire, which are able to pressure Typhlosion offensively much harder than Dragonite, so Hidden Power Ice is usually not worth it. Typhlosion can also run a RestTalk set with Rest / Sleep Talk / Fire Blast / Dynamic Punch, which can separate itself from the only other Fire-type RestTalk user Moltres with its access to Dynamic Punch, no Electric weakness, and a Speed tier that lets it Speed tie with Zapdos. This set also pairs well with Zapdos because it can absorb sleep from Pokemon that would threaten to 2HKO or use Explosion on Zapdos such as Exeggutor, Jynx, and Gengar. Unfortunately, frequent bad matchups and the issue of moves with unreliable accuracy cut down on the set's viability a lot, so it isn't very effective. Toxic can wear down typical switch-ins such as Suicune and Snorlax and force them to use Rest. However, Toxic is difficult to fit on the mixed set because it removes coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: With the notable exception of Cloyster, Typhlosion is completely shut down by most Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Suicune, and Hidden Power Grass fails to do significant damage to them. Vaporeon is also able to use Typhlosion as setup fodder. Starmie is one of Typhlosion's strongest offensive counters, as it 2HKOes Typhlosion with Surf, outspeeds it, and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, hindering its offensive presence. Tentacruel resists or is neutral to most of Typhlosion's coverage, 2HKOes with Hydro Pump, and can use Typhlosion as setup fodder. However, Tentacruel is not a fan of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax completely walls Typhlosion due to its incredible HP and Special Defense stats and can use Curse to raise its otherwise poor Defense and already excellent Attack, meaning that even Dynamic Punch doesn't do enough damage to take down Snorlax. Furthermore, Snorlax can retaliate with Earthquake or STAB-boosted Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite invalidates Typhlosion, as it resists or is immune to nearly all of Typhlosion's coverage and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave to try to take it out. However, Hidden Power Ice can prevent Dragonite from checking Typhlosion.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar takes little damage from Hidden Power Grass and Earthquake and resists Fire Blast. It also threatens to KO Typhlosion with STAB Rock Slide, but Dynamic Punch can possibly take out Tyranitar if it hits. If Typhlosion isn't running Hidden Power Grass, it is hard countered by Rhydon and Golem, which can KO Typhlosion with Earthquake or Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Charizard and Moltres</strong>: Charizard and Moltres take little to no damage from any attack if Typhlosion is not running Thunder Punch. Moltres outdamages Typhlosion and often runs RestTalk, and Charizard can retaliate by hitting it with Earthquake. These Fire-types can also take advantage of Sunny Day if Typhlosion sets it up.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Typhlosion's STAB move that super effectively hits common Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Steelix, and Skarmory as well as doing decent neutral damage to Pokemon like Zapdos and Machamp. Dynamic Punch does the most amount of damage to Tyranitar and has the added bonus of confusing the target if it hits. Hidden Power Grass hits Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire that would otherwise wall Typhlosion. Thunder Punch is an alternative that hits Flying-types, such as Charizard and Moltres, as well as hitting Water-types, such as Starmie and Suicune. Earthquake reliably 3HKOes Raikou and 2HKOes Gengar without having to rely on Fire Blast's 85% accuracy, and it is also the best move to use against Tentacruel, Jolteon, and Houndoom. Sunny Day is an alternative that boosts Typhlosion's wallbreaking potential with Fire Blast and reduces the accuracy of Thunder, giving it the advantage against Zapdos and Raikou.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Typhlosion is helpless against teams with Water-types barring Cloyster, so Pokemon that can weaken or take them out for Typhlosion make useful teammates. Starmie and Suicune are especially problematic for Typhlosion, and one of the best partners that can deal with Starmie is Cloyster due to its resistance to Water and access to Explosion. Cloyster also has Spikes to assist it and its teammates in sweeping or cleaning teams. Pokemon that can take advantage of Suicune's passivity such as Tentacruel and RestTalk Vaporeon are also valuable teammates, as they can wall Suicune and use it as setup fodder if it is not running Roar. Zapdos and Snorlax can absorb sleep for Typhlosion and can pressure Water-types. Lures for Water-types are also very helpful too, and Thunder or Thunderbolt Nidoking and Explosion Steelix are examples of such Pokemon. Nidoking is also a decent check to Tyranitar and can potentially weaken Pokemon Typhlosion dislikes such as Zapdos and Snorlax.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Ampharos is an all-round solid Pokemon in GSC UU. Its bulk and typing allow it to sponge attacks from much of the tier, its powerful Thunders force many switches with the threat of heavy damage and paralysis, and it has several utility options that allow it to support its teammates. Ampharos is one of the few Pokemon that can safely switch into and create momentum against the likes of Slowbro and Slowking thanks to its great Special bulk. In addition, Ampharos is one of the biggest threats to many of the commonly seen Water-types of the tier such as Politoed and Gyarados. However, the most commonly seen Pokemon in the tier, Nidoqueen, completely dominates Ampharos, which can turn it into a liability at times. Nonetheless, this wholesome lighthouse keeper remains a threat to be considered, and it is very rare for a player not to gain any utility from having it on the team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It should be noted that if Sleep Talk is dropped, Ampharos loses some of its longevity as well as its ability to absorb status which is one of the reasons why Ampharos is so valuable. Furthermore, Nidoqueen counters Ampharos no matter the set. Thunder Wave can be seen as another option for a more consistent way to spread paralysis. Hidden Power Grass can be used to deal heavy damage to Quagsire, and Fire Punch can be used to hit Magneton and Piloswine for super effective damage. Body Slam is an option to fish for a paralysis to punish incoming Ground-type Pokemon that think they can switch in without risk. If Nidoqueen can be eliminated somehow, an all-out offensive set becomes more viable, which might use Dynamic Punch to hit Chansey alongside additional coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: If Nidoqueen has Moonlight, it fears almost nothing from Ampharos, easily tanking its Hidden Power Ice on the switch and being under such negligible threat from Ampharos that it is free to toss out any coverage move it has to hit the predicted switch-in with little consequence if it guesses wrong. Its STAB Earthquake is a safe 2HKO against Ampharos, and the best Ampharos can hope to do in return is to set up a screen for a teammate to try to stop it.</p> <p><strong>Other Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon are able to switch in on and threaten Ampharos with a powerful Earthquake, provided they avoid the coverage moves that would put a dent in them. Piloswine and Quagsire can also use Ampharos as a setup opportunity, though the latter must be careful of Hidden Power Grass. Gligar, Sandslash, and Graveler can also take advantage of Ampharos if it doesn't have coverage moves to hit them super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Ampharos</strong>: Opposing Ampharos can take advantage of an Ampharos that does not have a screen to set up a screen of their own or try to PP stall it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey easily shrugs off any of Ampharos's special attacks and can set up a screen, threaten it with Present or Curse-boosted Double-Edge, or cure its team's status inflictions with Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom and Vileplume can switch into Ampharos not carrying Hidden Power Ice or Fire Punch and threaten it with a Leech Seed to force it out and spread status. However, these Pokemon do not possess an Electric immunity and thus run the risk of being paralyzed when they are thrown into Ampharos.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Heart of the Lighthouse (Sleep Talk)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Ampharos's offensive and defensive presence, coupled with it only needing one attacking move to pose a threat, means that it is a great candidate to use RestTalk. Thunder is the obligatory Electric-type attack and has a 30% chance to inflict paralysis, provided it hits. Thunderbolt can be used instead for greater accuracy in exchange for less power and paralysis probability. As Nidoqueen is omnipresent in the tier, it is necessary for Ampharos to have a second move that is guaranteed to gain some utility if Nidoqueen inevitably switches in. The most commonly seen moves that fit this criteria are dual screens and Hidden Power Ice. The screens make pivoting around Nidoqueen much easier, while Hidden Power Ice chips it down. Light Screen allows Ampharos to take on powerful special attackers like Mr. Mime and Politoed more reliably, while Reflect improves its matchup against Granbull. Hidden Power Ice is also useful coverage to chip Grass-type Pokemon as they switch in and deals a considerable chunk of damage to Gligar. RestTalk grants Ampharos longevity so that it can sponge hits and dish out attacks more consistently while also reducing the disadvantages caused by status inflictions.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake means that Pokemon that are not weak to Ground and can pivot around Nidoqueen such as Granbull, Blastoise, Bellossom, Gligar, and Slowbro make suitable partners for it. Granbull is particularly well suited to pairing up with Ampharos, as none of Nidoqueen's possible attacks can 3HKO it. Offensive Pokemon such as Scyther, Dodrio, and Pinsir appreciate the protection that Light Screen offers, as they become a lot more difficult to check. Slowbro especially enjoys Light Screen being set up, as it allows Slowbro to safely come in on Nidoqueen without fear of being defeated by a Thunder on the predicted switch.</p>"

  "Bellossom": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>In a metagame full of Water-, Ground-, and Psychic-types, Bellossom's mono-Grass typing, ample defensive stats, and access to a wide variety of support moves allow it to twirl its way into a niche of its own. It stands out by checking a wide array of threats that have very few reliable answers, such as Electabuzz, Nidoqueen, Slowbro, and Quagsire. It is also an awkward Pokemon to switch into owing to its access to Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, and it can force switches with Leech Seed or Swords Dance to spread these status afflictions to more foes. This strong ability to spread status helps cement Bellossom's status as one of the premier support Pokemon in the tier. However, while it performs well as a supporter, Bellossom is lacking in both good STAB attacks and coverage attacks, and thus its damage dealing ability is quite limited. Furthermore, being a Pokemon that relies on instant recovery, it is particularly susceptible to status, a weakness that very often leads to its downfall.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bellossom can make reasonably good use of Reflect to help its teammates switch into powerful physical attacks or set up without fearing a strong response from a physical attacker. However, supporting its teammates with paralysis or sleep tends to be the more effective option. Giga Drain can be considered as a STAB option alongside Leech Seed or Hidden Power Ice, but it is fairly weak, only has 8 PP, and can leave Bellossom helpless against foes such as Substitute Sandslash. Bellossom can also drop its recovery move to fit in an additional coverage or support move, but this should only be done on fast-paced teams because it will sharply reduce Bellossom's longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Granbull and Chansey</strong>: Granbull and Chansey take little from Bellossom's STAB attacks and can undo all of Bellossom's hard work spreading status with Heal Bell. Chansey needs to beware of Sleep Powder and Swords Dance variants, but it has access to Present and a wide array of status moves with which it can cripple Bellossom. Granbull also poses a significant threat to Bellossom with its powerful Return, dealing up to 50% unboosted, and Curse variants are even more dangerous, although they can potentially be forced out with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Magneton and Ampharos</strong>: Magneton and Ampharos, particularly RestTalk variants given they are less concerned about status, are difficult for Bellossom to deal with. Magneton resists most of Bellossom's attacks, outspeeds it, and threatens it with Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire, but it becomes a less reliable answer if Bellossom has Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground. Ampharos similarly outspeeds Bellossom and beats it in the long run with Hidden Power Ice or Fire Punch. Both Magneton and Ampharos can also typically fish for paralysis against Bellossom with Thunder if they are lacking Thunder Wave. Magneton also runs Substitute occasionally, which allows it to block status from Bellossom.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: While Qwilfish despises paralysis and should be wary of Sleep Powder, it can use Bellossom as an opportunity to set up Spikes and can force it out with the threat of STAB Sludge Bomb. Other Poison-types such as Crobat, Victreebel, and Haunter also pose a threat to Bellossom, the former two with their super effective STAB attacks and Haunter with Explosion. Haunter is particularly good against mono-attacking variants of the Swords Dance set. However, all of these Pokemon are very much dependent on their Speed to perform their roles effectively and must be prepared to sacrifice this if they are considering switching into Bellossom.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: While Hypno struggles to take Bellossom down, with RestTalk it can easily absorb Bellossom's status inflictions and potentially inflict status with Thunder Wave or run Bellossom out of recovery PP. However, it must also beware of being used as setup fodder when affected by Leech Seed or against Swords Dance Bellossom variants.</p> <p><strong>Scyther and Pinsir</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir have powerful STAB attacks that hit Bellossom super effectively. They both typically struggle with status but still pose a significant threat to Bellossom while paralyzed, potentially OHKOing it after boosting their attack with Swords Dance. RestTalk Pinsir is particularly problematic, as it can use Bellossom as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio typically doesn't have many opportunities to switch in freely throughout a game, but Bellossom is one of the few Pokemon Dodrio can switch into without taking a hefty chunk of damage. It does risk getting paralyzed or put to sleep, but RestTalk variants won't mind too much. Once it has come in, any STAB attack will deal hefty damage to Bellossom that it won't be able to withstand for long.</p> <p><strong>Status and Secondary Effects</strong>: Unlike many other defensive Pokemon, Bellossom cannot cure itself of status, which makes it particularly susceptible to moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore. Pokemon like Slowking with Thunder Wave can cripple Bellossom despite the typing disadvantage. In addition, Bellossom is commonly depended upon to switch into Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Electabuzz that can deal a chunk of damage to it but fail to 2HKO it. It commonly switches into moves like Thunder, Psychic, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Ice Punch, all of which have secondary effects that can make Bellossom unable to fulfill its usual defensive roles if they activate. Moreover, if Bellossom takes too much damage on the switch, it will often have to spend the next turn recovering, which can provide another opportunity to Pokemon wielding these moves to fish for secondary effects that will allow them to bypass Bellossom.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While Fire-types are fairly uncommon in the metagame, Pokemon like Arcanine and Magmar deal upwards of 70% to Bellossom with STAB Fire Blast, although they must beware of status moves.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Supporter": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bellossom aims to spread status and force switches with this set. With adequate defensive stats and useful typing, Bellossom has no trouble finding opportunities to switch in, from which point it can spread paralysis with Stun Spore or put something to sleep with Sleep Powder. Leech Seed is a solid option for Bellossom, as it forces most foes to retreat, which can allow Bellossom to target additional foes with Stun Spore. Should resilient foes such as Hypno aim to prevent Bellossom from spreading status by staying in, they make for easy opportunities for Bellossom's teammates to set up boosts. Bellossom has a couple of alternatives for its STAB attack; Hidden Power Grass is perfectly accurate and has a decent Base Power but requires Bellossom to sacrifice HP DVs, whereas Razor Leaf is a weaker option that is not obtainable on the same set as Leech Seed but has no major drawback. If Bellossom uses Razor Leaf, this frees up Hidden Power to be used as a coverage attack. Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit foes such as Scyther, Dodrio, Magneton, and opposing Grass-types that would wall Leech Seed Bellossom, such as Jumpluff and Victreebel, super effectively. Scyther is particularly dangerous due to its access to Swords Dance and Baton Pass, so these options can be useful to deter it. The choice between the two comes down to a couple of factors; Hidden Power Fire hits the more common Magneton hard but requires the sacrifice of a substantial amount of HP due to DV requirements, whereas Hidden Power Ice can threaten Dodrio. However, even hitting super effectively, Bellossom's damage output is rather underwhelming, so Leech Seed is the preferred option. Moonlight is a strong recovery option with no major drawback that provides Bellossom with a moveslot advantage over RestTalk users such as Hypno and Slowking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bellossom makes for an excellent support Pokemon to a wide variety of offensive Pokemon. Setup sweepers such as Pinsir, Curse Granbull, Sandslash, and Quagsire can strongly benefit from having their checks paralyzed before they attempt to set up. Pokemon that can effectively use Substitute such as Pikachu, Mr. Mime, and Sandslash also become more threatening if foes have been paralyzed by Bellossom. Defensively, Bellossom finds it helpful for Granbull to be safely checked, so Omastar, Haunter, and Magneton make for useful teammates. Omastar in particular has solid defensive synergy with Bellossom, as Bellossom can handle some of the Electric-types, bulky Water-types, and Ground-type attacks that often target it. As Bellossom lacks Rest to cure status effects, Heal Bell Granbull can be a very useful teammate. Granbull also relieves Bellossom against a potential Fire Blast Nidoqueen, which comes quite close to 2HKOing Bellossom and is therefore dangerous to deal with. Blastoise is another teammate that is useful in this regard while also providing Rapid Spin support. Furthermore, Blastoise easily withstands the tier's few special STAB attacks that hit Bellossom super effectively, such as Piloswine's Ice-type moves and STAB attacks from Fire-types, giving the pair great synergy. If Bellossom can paralyze Qwilfish, not only will sweepers like Pinsir and Sandslash have a much easier time, but Blastoise will also find it easier to keep Spikes off the field and keep Qwilfish under pressure to stop it from firing off attacks. Ideally, Bellossom does not want to have to deal with Electric-types that often sport Ice- or Fire-type coverage; Ground-types that can shrug off Ice- and Fire-type attacks such as Nidoqueen, Quagsire, and Piloswine can assist with patching this weakness. As Scyther and Pinsir are dangerous sweepers and threaten an OHKO on Bellossom after a Swords Dance, it is useful to have Flying-types such as Crobat, Gligar, Gyarados, and Scyther to help deal with them; Crobat reliably prevents Scyther from passing Swords Dance boosts; Gligar checks both adequately and, alongside Bellossom, makes for a combination that can take on most Nidoqueen reliably, as it can wall Fire Blast variants safely; Gyarados threatens both with STAB Hidden Power Flying and has access to Roar to prevent Scyther from passing boosts; and Scyther makes for a decent Pinsir check and can help finish off a weakened, paralyzed opposing Scyther safely. Finally, as Bellossom can force switches effectively, Spikes from Qwilfish can be useful to punish foes switching in.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The goals of this set are two-fold: spread paralysis to foes beyond just passive RestTalk users and turn Bellossom into a damage-dealing threat rather than relegating it to a purely supportive role. With Swords Dance to boost its attack, Bellossom can topple some of its usual status absorber checks like Hypno and Ampharos, as, despite their impressive bulk, they cannot withstand boosted physical attacks for long. This buys Bellossom an opportunity to either attempt to take something down with its physical move of choice or land crippling paralysis on a more desirable target with Stun Spore. Return is the standard attacking option and comes without any drawback, although Double-Edge grants Bellossom enough power that it can cleanly 2HKO Scyther and Dodrio after using Swords Dance, albeit at the cost of taking recoil. Crafty opponents will realize that this physical threat comes at the cost of possible coverage attacks and potentially wall Bellossom with Omastar, Haunter, or Magneton. While the standard choice for a fourth move is to take advantage of Bellossom's healing moves like Moonlight, which allows Bellossom to play a defensive role alongside its offensive strategy, an alternative option is to forgo reliable healing and take a more offensive route by choosing Giga Drain, which allows it to remain effective against Slowbro and Slowking and OHKO or come close to OHKOing Omastar, Kabutops, and Graveler. Another alternative is Hidden Power Ground, which allows it to OHKO Magneton all of the time and Haunter about half of the time after a Swords Dance boost. Should this more offensive route be chosen, Bellossom will require a much greater amount of support from its teammates and will not reliably be able to check foes like Electabuzz and Nidoqueen as it usually can. In contrast, with Moonlight and Stun Spore, Bellossom retains much of its usual defensive efficacy and makes for an excellent supporter, especially for Normal-types such as Granbull, Dodrio, and Lickitung. Whereas more passive sets such as those with Leech Seed are well suited to reactive play, this set benefits more from playing aggressively to force reactive play from opponents, which will lead to Bellossom being in a better position to spread status without risking taking heavy hits from foes such as Qwilfish and Scyther.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Bellossom makes for a great addition to a paralysis-based offensive team. Its knack for spreading paralysis to Normal-resistant Pokemon makes Pokemon like Hidden Power Ground Granbull and Dodrio even more difficult to deal with. Other foes that Swords Dance Bellossom tends to be able to target with Stun Spore include Qwilfish, Scyther, and Nidoqueen. Setup sweepers such as Kabutops, Pinsir, Victreebel, and Politoed greatly appreciate these Pokemon being paralyzed, as their sweeps are often cut short by these foes. Teammates that generally appreciate paralysis, such as Belly Drum Quagsire, Belly Drum Politoed, Substitute Pikachu, Substitute Sandslash, and Substitute Mr. Mime, are also good choices for teammates. As Bellossom struggles to beat Curse Granbull due to it accruing Defense boosts, teammates such as Haunter and Magneton also make for sensible choices. Omastar can also be solid choice for this purpose despite its tendency to feature more often on defensive teams, as it is capable of running a more offensive set with Thief or Ancient Power to increase its threat level. As Swords Dance Bellossom often lacks Grass-type STAB attacks, assistance in taking on Ground-types such as Piloswine, Nidoqueen, and Sandslash is appreciated; bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Blastoise make for good choices in this regard and can also double as status absorbers. Despite being known primarily for their defensive prowess, these bulky Water-types also have substantial damage output that is enough to scare out many offensive Pokemon that Bellossom has inflicted with paralysis.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Azumarill is a defining Pokemon in GSC NU and easily one of the best defensive Pokemon available thanks to the roles it can perform. With great bulk both physically and specially alongside access to Light Screen, it is an excellent check to the many Fire-types in GSC NU such as Rapidash and Magmar while also being one of the best checks to Dugtrio. It can also safely switch into the best Pokemon in the tier, Xatu, and set Light Screen for its teammates or threaten a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Because of this, it naturally finds itself on defensive teams very commonly. However, it is not without flaws. Azumarill is susceptible to Thief from Pokemon that can lure it in such as Magmar and Dugtrio, which hurts its survivability. Moreover, its relatively low offensive presence can let Pokemon such as Primeape, Kingler, and Lickitung set up on it and threaten it.</p> <p>Surf is mandatory to threaten Fire- and Ground-types. For Azumarill's second move, Light Screen is preferred a lot of the time for its ability to enable key Pokemon such as Kingler to set up more easily as well as letting Azumarill's teammates switch into special attackers more easily; however, Ice Beam crucially lets it defeat Xatu and Fearow in a one-on-one matchup, while Light Screen variants are more susceptible to getting KOed by critical hits against these threats. Ice Beam also hits the dangerous Gloom, which sets up for free against the Light Screen variant, quite hard. Finally, Rest and Sleep Talk give excellent longevity and let it absorb sleep moves from the likes of Rapidash and Stantler. Azumarill pairs exceptionally well with other defensive Pokemon, most notably Gloom and Ninetales. These three form a fierce defensive core that is capable of covering each other's weaknesses exceptionally well, such as Azumarill checking Dugtrio for Ninetales, Gloom checking Primeape for Azumarill, and Ninetales checking Xatu for Gloom and enjoying Light Screen support. Spikes support from Pineco helps Azumarill in longer games and can make its Surf have a more lasting impact against threats such as Primeape. Kingler appreciates Azumarill variants carrying Light Screen, which lets it set up with Swords Dance and trade hits much more easily against Pokemon such as Hidden Power Grass Ninetales, Octillery, and Xatu. Xatu itself pairs well with Azumarill, as it checks some of Azumarill's biggest threats in Kingler and Hitmonlee and can use Haze to eliminate their boosts.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jumpluff is one of the best support Pokemon in UU, since it is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier and carries a lot of utility moves. Its access to Encore lets it stop many of the setup sweepers in the tier, like Scyther and Quagsire. Its useful typing also makes it an awesome pivot against a variety of threatening Pokemon. However, its lack of offensive options means that it can be quite passive, and its mediocre bulk means that it cannot take many hits without being forced to use Synthesis, so it can be forced out with some offensive pressure.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jumpluff can run a RestTalk set, which lets it shrug off status ailments more easily. However, if it uses such a set, it will have a hard time using the proper move at the right moment, making its utility less reliable; it also wants to have the other utility moves over Rest and Sleep Talk. Another option Jumpluff could use is Toxic, which would help it take down Bellossom and force some RestTalk users to use Rest earlier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status-Inflicting Moves</strong>: Jumpluff dislikes any status whatsoever due to the fact that losing its Speed or being asleep pretty much nullifies its usefulness. Therefore, any unexpected moves that can inflict status on it will make it really hard for it to get back in action, unless you're running a Heal Bell user.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users</strong>: Outside of Leech Seed, Jumpluff cannot do much to RestTalk users, since it cannot use Encore to lock them into Sleep Talk and isn't going to do much damage to them if it has Hidden Power Flying. Blastoise in particular can be really annoying, since it can also remove Spikes and nullify the offensive pressure that Jumpluff can create with them. Other examples are Slowbro, Slowking, Hypno, Ampharos, Magneton, and Arcanine. RestTalk users still need to be careful, though, since they can be paralyzed or hit with Encore, the latter making them unable to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Scyther, Dodrio, and Granbull are dangerous for Jumpluff to switch into or stay in against due to their hard-hitting attacks. However, they must be willing to risk being paralyzed or hit by Sleep Powder if they stay in on Jumpluff, especially if they don't have RestTalk or Heal Bell support. Jumpluff can also reduce its risk when switching into dangerous physical attackers by using Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage Moves</strong>: A lot of Pokemon run Ice-type coverage moves to cover common Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon in the tier. Because of that, Jumpluff needs to be careful of Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Piloswine, Electabuzz, and Magneton.</p> <p><strong>Qwilfish</strong>: Qwilfish can inflict heavy damage and poison on Jumpluff with its STAB Sludge Bomb. However, if it has not yet set up Spikes, it should beware of Sleep Powder preventing it from laying them down. In addition, Qwilfish's ability to check many setup sweepers with Haze will be severely impaired if it gets paralyzed by Stun Spore.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Stun Spore is one of the main selling points of Jumpluff, since it helps shut down and threaten a lot of Pokemon that don't like being crippled with status, like Scyther, Nidoqueen, Electabuzz, and Kadabra. Jumpluff's access to Encore, combined with its high Speed, allows it to check a significant portion of the setup sweepers in the tier. One especially notable target is Scyther, which is notoriously difficult to check due to its high Speed and access to Baton Pass. An unboosted Scyther is relatively weak, so Jumpluff can take advantage of this by outspeeding it and locking it into Swords Dance before it can strike Jumpluff down. Even if Scyther anticipates Jumpluff's entry and uses Wing Attack, it is still at risk of being hit by one of Jumpluff's status moves, the threat of which can potentially give Jumpluff the opportunity it needs to recover with Synthesis. Synthesis is also useful to allow Jumpluff to better check defensive Pokemon such as RestTalk Slowbro, which would otherwise be able to wear it down over time. Jumpluff can take advantage of this by using Encore to lock these Pokemon into a move that one of its teammates resists for an easy opportunity to switch in. Leech Seed can be used over or alongside Synthesis, as it forces a lot of switches and lets you get Jumpluff's teammates onto the field more easily, on top of chipping down other Pokemon, especially bulky RestTalk users like Slowbro or Slowking. However, using it over Synthesis reduces its longevity and effectiveness against Scyther. Sleep Powder forces a Pokemon to be used as sleep fodder, provoking more switches and giving your team more momentum; it also works as an effective emergency option if Jumpluff is in a pinch. Reflect lets Jumpluff switch into physical attackers and shut them down more safely with Encore or Stun Spore while staying healthy with Synthesis; it can also be taken advantage of by Jumpluff's teammates. Hidden Power Flying is a nice option to hit Scyther, Bellossom, and Pinsir super effectively so you are able to chip them down, punish the low HP Pokemon that try to recover on Jumpluff, or wear down Pokemon that don't threaten it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Pokemon like Qwilfish is crucial for Jumpluff, allowing it to wear down the opposing team by forcing switches. Without Spikes support, Jumpluff fails to do anything against bulkier teams, which can repeatedly switch between their RestTalk users and waste its utility. Bulky Pokemon like Slowbro, Hypno, and Ampharos can be used as status absorbers, take hits for Jumpluff and spread more status alongside it. Nidoqueen, Granbull, Pinsir, and Quagsire appreciate Jumpluff spreading paralysis as it allows them to outspeed Pokemon they wouldn't be able to otherwise. Thief users like Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Haunter can steal foes' Leftovers, making them easier to wear down. Jumpluff also appreciates Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Granbull and Chansey so it can be healed of any status ailments when necessary.</p>"

For this reason, Jumpluff requires a fair amount of prediction to be used effectively. When played right, Jumpluff is amazingly useful.

      "overview": "<p>Granbull's bite is assuredly worse than its bark. Its powerful STAB Frustration comes off a great Attack stat, and its lack of relevant weaknesses allows it to take on a wide variety of foes. These qualities are so useful that it can arguably be considered on par with GSC UU's monarch, Nidoqueen, in terms of overall effectiveness. The tier's relative dearth of Pokemon that resist Normal plays fantastically to Granbull's advantage, enabling it to be highly effective as a mono-attacker. While the most prominent Granbull strategy is to take advantage of its Curse RestTalk set, which dominates against all but a few of the tier's Pokemon, it is the possibility that Granbull could be running a set that can surprise KO some of its better checks that really pushes its threat level over the edge. Its relatively wide movepool also gives it the potential to run a more team-supportive set with Heal Bell and to experiment with other, less predictable options such as Lovely Kiss and Dynamic Punch. In terms of flaws, Granbull's lacking Special Defense stat means that it can struggle to take on powerful special attackers, especially those that run 120-Base Power STAB attacks, such as Ampharos, Magneton, Omastar, and Arcanine, as these can threaten a potential 2HKO. Furthermore, although Granbull is favored against most Pokemon with its mono-attacking Curse set, it can invite dangerous Pokemon such as Haunter and Omastar in for free, which causes some inflexibility when team building with it. Moreover, its lack of resistances and low Speed can leave it in positions where it may be unable to find an opportunity to switch in and recover its health safely.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is a viable option that gives Granbull a tool against foes that might boost their stats alongside it, such as Kabutops, opposing Granbull, and Shuckle. However, it generally comes at the expense of a better option such as a coverage move. Granbull can be an effective anti-lead with Dynamic Punch and Shadow Ball as alternative high-powered options to Hidden Power Ground that deal extra damage to opposing Granbull, Haunter, Rock-types, and Psychic-types. Lovely Kiss can also be used to make Granbull even more difficult to handle. However, despite its coverage, Granbull can still struggle with certain physically bulky foes, and its low Speed hurts the effectiveness of such a low-durability set. Hyper Beam is a very powerful weapon that can unexpectedly OHKO foes at +1 Attack, but it has obvious drawbacks in the recharge turn and the cost of a moveslot. Present can be used alongside Frustration to potentially deal heavy damage to certain targets such as Slowbro, Blastoise, and Omastar. However, Granbull will still struggle to deal with Haunter and Magneton unless it also has Hidden Power Ground, which means it must either sacrifice the longevity of RestTalk or be walled by similar foes to the otherwise superior Curse set. Furthermore, Present can be highly unreliable in terms of damage output. Zap Cannon can be used to turn Granbull into a paralysis spreader, which could help it get past certain foes or make them easier to handle for its teammates. However, this can decrease Granbull's effectiveness in taking on Ground-types, opposing Granbull, and Magneton.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar is the tier's premier counter to Granbull, convincingly 3HKOing with Surf and potentially 2HKOing with Hydro Pump. A RestTalk set has great odds to beat nearly any Granbull set, even if Granbull has boosted Attack. Furthermore, its excellent Special Attack, coverage options, and Thief allow it to threaten just about anything that the opponent may switch to. However, it does need to be careful of variants with Thunder or the combination of Lovely Kiss, Curse, and Hidden Power Ground, especially if paired with Light Screen support. An even more reliable answer is Shuckle, which can wall nearly any Granbull set indefinitely but lacks the offensive presence of Omastar. Healthy Kabutops has a fighting chance against mono-attacking Granbull variants with its somewhat powerful Hydro Pump or Swords Dance-boosted Submission but should otherwise generally steer clear of taking Granbull on. Graveler can have issues fitting moves with which to reliably beat Granbull, but Explosion is generally enough to stop a Granbull that only has one Curse boost by knocking it into KO range of a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is an excellent answer to mono-attacking Granbull, and it has the tools to threaten both Granbull and its teammates. In addition, Destiny Bond can allow it to trade for Granbull variants that have Hidden Power Ground, and Hypnosis can be used out of caution when the set is unknown. However, if Haunter is the sole answer to Granbull, one should take care not to use Explosion against another foe if Granbull will be difficult to deal with later without Haunter. This consideration can restrict Haunter's offensive potential substantially.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton is an excellent counter to mono-attacking Granbull, taking advantage of it by setting up Reflect, setting up Substitute, or simply chipping away at Granbull or its teammates with its powerful special attacks. However, Magneton must be very careful to avoid getting OHKOed by a boosted Hidden Power Ground from Granbull.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Slowbro is one of the few Pokemon that does not resist Normal that can claim any kind of reliability against Granbull due to its formidable physical bulk, powerful STAB attacks, and efficacy as a RestTalk user. It avoids not only a 3HKO from unboosted Frustration but also a 2HKO from +1 Frustration. However, Granbull does outspeed it and can occasionally have Thunder, which 3HKOes it. Pokemon that can hit a boosted Granbull very hard from the special side as well as take a hit from unboosted Granbull, such as Ampharos and Arcanine, can switch into Granbull and threaten it with enough damage that it may be forced to switch out. However, these are far from reliable answers, as they rely on moves with imperfect accuracy for a chance at a 2HKO and cannot be assured of a 2HKO without prior chip damage. These special attackers, as well as other less powerful ones such as Blastoise, Reflect Hypno, and Feraligatr, can sometimes be sufficient to deal with non-boosting Granbull variants.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curse RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse RestTalk Granbull is one of the most polarizing forces in GSC UU. It combines power and resilience and can use Curse to rapidly boost both to levels that almost cannot be dealt with. On top of this, Granbull also deals well with some of the most prominent metagame forces, such as Nidoqueen and Hypno, thanks to its lack of weaknesses other than Fighting. This means it typically has ample opportunities to switch in throughout a game. Furthermore, thanks to its high physical stats, it dominates other more passive Curse users such as Hypno and Chansey, as well as rarer Curse users such as Wigglytuff and Vileplume. Opposing Granbull also struggle to deal with a Curse RestTalk Granbull, especially if they lack Curse, although Granbull should typically avoid switching into another healthy Granbull. Teams without one of the few Pokemon that resist Normal risk being quickly overwhelmed by a Curse RestTalk Granbull, as it can trade hits favorably with nearly any other Pokemon and can reliably sustain itself with RestTalk. However, teams that do have one of the few reliable answers can sometimes take advantage of Granbull entering the field to launch attacks freely at its teammates as it is forced to retreat. These answers often double as powerful special attackers, such as Omastar, Magneton, and Haunter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The most crucial Pokemon to handle as a mono-attacking Curse Granbull are its counters, which include Omastar, Magneton, Haunter, and occasionally Graveler. Electric-types such as Ampharos and Electabuzz can be very useful in this regard. Ampharos has the bulk to easily take on any of the special attacking foes with ease, and it can also provide Light Screen support to allow Granbull an opportunity to actually threaten Magneton, which is slightly less reliable than the other two special attacking counters. Electabuzz is a huge threat to many teams, as it has access to super effective coverage for Nidoqueen as well as Fighting-type coverage for Chansey and Magneton. On top of this, Pursuit can be used to weaken or outright remove foes that cause mono-attacking Curse Granbull issues, such as Slowbro and Haunter. However, Electabuzz lacks the bulk of Ampharos, so it is a good idea to back it up with a specially bulky teammate such as Hypno or Slowking. Granbull being a solid answer to Nidoqueen also helps the Electric-types out, as they often invite it in. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, Piloswine, and Quagsire are also solid choices for dealing with Magneton and Haunter. Granbull also benefits from having teammates that can lure in and KO Magneton and Haunter. Normal-types such as Dodrio and Lickitung and Grass-types like Swords Dance Victreebel, Vileplume, and Bellossom can potentially catch them out with Ground-type coverage. Blastoise can wear down Haunter that attempt to block its Rapid Spin. Lastly, Granbull can also benefit from paralysis spreading to help it deal with powerful special attackers such as Slowbro, Ampharos, Arcanine, and Mr. Mime. Thunder Wave Hypno and Slowking are some of the best options for spreading paralysis to these foes. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Vileplume can also paralyze various foes with Stun Spore.</p>"
        },
        "Cleric RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Among Granbull's numerous options is one of the most valuable support moves in the game, Heal Bell. Granbull hits quite hard with its unboosted Frustration against nearly everything that doesn't resist it, and Heal Bell is an excellent support option that allows its teammates to play more recklessly against status inducers. For example, teammates such as Nidoqueen and Scyther can more freely make assaults against Grass- and Psychic-types that often sacrifice their health to cripple them with paralysis in return. Furthermore, threats that struggle to fit recovery, such as Belly Drum Quagsire and boosting Politoed variants, can potentially use Rest in their fourth moveslot to assist them in setting up multiple times in a game. However, this Granbull set struggles more than others against bulky RestTalk users such as Slowbro and opposing Granbull, and its lower threat level can allow foes that would normally have to switch out against it to pose a threat. Furthermore, as a mono-attacker, it suffers from similar flaws to Curse RestTalk Granbull against Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, and in particular, it can provide Kabutops with a setup opportunity that Curse Granbull would not provide as easily. Moreover, having Heal Bell in a moveslot can be more of a curse than a blessing when considering that it has nearly no effect in many circumstances and therefore reduces the usefulness of RestTalk. While it can wake Granbull up early, the more turns Granbull spends not attacking or recovering health, the more turns the foe has to land a game-changing critical hit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this Granbull set only has a single attacking move and is therefore easily forced out by Pokemon that resist it, Pokemon that can deal with its counters are highly recommended. Haunter and Omastar both dominate Granbull, but they can be mostly neutralized by teammates such as Hypno, Ampharos, and Slowking. Magneton can similarly be checked by Nidoqueen, Ampharos, and Piloswine. Common offensive threats such as Nidoqueen and Scyther can be more bold when facing Pokemon that threaten to inflict status against them when supported by Granbull's Heal Bell. Similarly, Belly Drum and Growth users such as Quagsire and Politoed can potentially run Rest without Sleep Talk with the intention of waking them up at full health with Heal Bell. This same strategy can also be used with Curse users and Swords Dance users, potentially giving them an opportunity to run a useful coverage attack without sacrificing as much by dropping Sleep Talk. Finally, Rest Blastoise can take advantage of cleric Granbull to give it an extra advantage against Qwilfish as it tries to keep Spikes off the field by either dropping Sleep Talk for a coverage move or reducing the turns it needs to spend using Sleep Talk.</p>"
        },
        "Curse Kiss": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>While mono-attacking Granbull sets must sometimes patiently wait for their counters to be chipped down or otherwise removed before they can really let loose, such counters are almost non-existent for this set. Frustration is mandatory as Granbull's powerful STAB attack, 3HKOing a significant portion of the metagame. Hidden Power Ground is similarly important, as it 2HKOes Magneton and Haunter, two Pokemon that very commonly switch into Granbull. Hidden Power Ground can also be used to chip away at Graveler and Omastar, which are two of Granbull's sturdier checks. For its last two moveslots, Granbull can elect to use Curse to boost its attacking power and make it more sturdy against physical attackers such as opposing Granbull, Nidoqueen, and Scyther, as well as against Explosion users such as Electrode. If Curse is used before revealing its moveset, Granbull can also potentially surprise OHKO Magneton and Haunter with +1 Hidden Power Ground, although it only has just under 50% chance to OHKO the latter. As an alternative to Curse, Thunder can be used to threaten Omastar, which takes relatively low damage even from +1 Hidden Power Ground. In addition to threatening a 2HKO on Omastar with Spikes support, Thunder also instantly threatens a 2HKO and paralysis on Qwilfish, Gyarados, and Kabutops and a 3HKO on Slowbro, whereas variants without Thunder must use Curse first to achieve these benchmarks. However, without Curse to boost its Attack, Granbull risks being worn down and beaten by RestTalk users, especially those that are faster such as Hypno, Ampharos, and Blastoise. By boosting its Attack, 3HKOs against these foes become 2HKOs, which makes Granbull much more reliable at taking them down.</p> <p>Granbull has several good options for the final moveslot. The most obvious choice is Lovely Kiss, which grants it a potent weapon with which it can incapacitate many Pokemon that may switch into it, such as Qwilfish, Haunter, and Shuckle. Lovely Kiss can be used offensively, against Granbull's checks, or defensively, against opposing sweepers that are difficult to control, such as Scyther. It can also be used as a way to deal with Baton Pass users, such as Girafarig, or their recipients, such as Quagsire. However, Pokemon such as RestTalk Omastar, Blastoise, and Slowbro may be able to beat Granbull even when it has put them to sleep. An alternative to Lovely Kiss is Protect, which has good synergy with Curse. This will allow Granbull to gain additional Leftovers recovery at crucial times, which could lead to an additional KO. Protect can also be used to scout for moves such as Explosion and Destiny Bond. Finally, Thunder may be used alongside Curse to maximize Granbull's coverage without sacrificing its ability to boost, which can help it deal with nearly all of its checks effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Granbull benefits tremendously from Light Screen and paralysis support. Electrode, Mr. Mime, Hypno, Ampharos, and Chansey are all great options for providing this support. Electrode can also provide offensive momentum with Explosion, whereas Ampharos and Chansey tend to be chosen as part of a defensive core. Depending on the approach taken, Granbull can work on an offensive team that relies on keeping up momentum or can be used on a team that stalls out the opposing team until a good opportunity for Granbull can be found. On offensive teams, Granbull will typically want to run Lovely Kiss to maximize the number of foes it can get past without switching out, whereas on more defensive teams, it may want to consider running Protect in tandem with a spinner to gradually regain health after it takes a foe down. Offensive teams will want to run teammates such as Scyther, Pinsir, and Dodrio, whereas defensive teams might choose Blastoise. Spikes support can help Granbull secure KOs on foes such as Haunter and Omastar, so Qwilfish is a worthy consideration for a teammate. As Granbull can surprise KO Magneton and Haunter, it can be effective to run a second Normal-type with Curse such as Wigglytuff or Chansey to overload the opponent's answers to Curse users. Similarly, Dodrio and Lickitung can potentially benefit from these surprise KOs, as their powerful STAB attacks will no longer be met with resistances. Granbull is also a good Baton Pass recipient and is capable of making good use of both Speed and Attack boosts, so teammates such as Girafarig and Scyther can also perform well with it.</p>"

        "Coverage RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Granbull's mono-attacking sets have good durability with RestTalk but often find themselves walled and taken advantage of by Pokemon that resist Normal. This set aims to solve that problem without losing too much durability. Normal + Ground coverage is unresisted in GSC UU, and Granbull's STAB Frustration is among the strongest physical attacks in the tier. Hidden Power Ground always 2HKOes Magneton and Haunter and does decent damage to Graveler and Omastar. It should be noted that using Hidden Power Ground reduces Granbull's HP by 16 due to DV requirements, which makes it slightly less bulky than mono-attacking variants. This set really shines when it becomes the recipient of Attack boosts from Scyther, which can make it almost impossible to deal with defensively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Granbull set lacks the means to boost its damage output, which can result in poor matchups against bulky special attackers in particular. Scyther is an obvious partner, as it can pass Attack boosts to Granbull, making it almost impossible to wall. Light Screen support from Ampharos can also help both Scyther and Granbull while simultaneously aiding against special attackers. Hypno is a valid alternative to Ampharos that can play a similar role. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Blastoise, Omastar, Gyarados, and Feraligatr are also helpful for taking on Ground-types and opposing Granbull. Slowbro can check most physical attackers other than Scyther and Pinsir adequately, Blastoise is an excellent check to Nidoqueen and provides Rapid Spin support, Omastar is one of the best answers to Granbull in the tier and can check Hidden Power Bug Scyther, Gyarados checks Scyther and can function as an alternative Baton Pass recipient, and Feraligatr is a solid all-around Water-type that can also function as a decent Baton Pass recipient.</p>"

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>Hitmonlee possesses two very useful qualities that give it a great niche in GSC NU: high Special Defense and high Attack. In combination with RestTalk, they allow it to reliably check special attackers that cannot use physical attacks effectively, such as Dewgong, Chinchou, and Ninetales. The fact that these Pokemon are all very common defensive options means Hitmonlee is granted a large number of opportunities to switch in and either hit something hard or fish for paralysis with Body Slam. Its high Attack and STAB Fighting-type moves also allow it to check Normal- and Rock-types, and it can 2HKO the majority of these with High Jump Kick. If a more offensive approach is desired, Hitmonlee can replace Body Slam for Hidden Power Rock, which can hit Flying- and Bug-types hard. The scarcity of viable Psychic-types makes this the preferred option over Hidden Power Ghost, and the primary target of Hidden Power, Xatu, happens to be weak to both. However, RestTalk Xatu, especially the Drill Peck variant, is still very difficult for Hitmonlee to deal with if healthy, so paralyzing it for a teammate tends to be the more effective approach.</p> <p>Hitmonlee's ability to spread paralysis to an opposing team's checks to Fighting-types gives it great offensive synergy with setup sweepers like Kingler, Primeape, and Lickitung. Removing Xatu outright can also sometimes leave an opposing team without any good response to Hitmonlee. One way to achieve this is to Pursuit trap Xatu with Houndour. If Hitmonlee paralyzes Xatu with Body Slam, it becomes particularly vulnerable to a Houndour with Crunch and Pursuit. Furthermore, Houndour can use Counter to dispatch of a Xatu that tries to fight it with Drill Peck. However, Hitmonlee is not entirely without downsidesâ€”Pineco sets up Spikes against it relatively freely and can be difficult to safely deal with. It is a good idea to have a plan in place to try to ensure that Pineco is at least unable to take something down with Explosion after setting up Spikes. Pokemon that resist Normal, such as Sudowoodo, Graveler, and Pupitar, are helpful in this regard. Opposing physical sweepers like Kingler and Primeape also have an advantage over Hitmonlee, so checks to these such as Xatu and Weezing make for desirable teammates.</p>"
        },
        "Setup Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>Hitmonlee can attempt to sweep an opposing team by boosting its already high Attack and then using its strong coverage to overpower foes. Meditate is the best standalone option, as it does not lower Hitmonlee's Speed. However, if Hitmonlee is receiving Speed boosts from a Baton Passer, then Curse can be used to increase both its bulk and damage without sacrificing its Speed advantage. Hidden Power Rock is used to target the nearly omnipresent Xatu, and Double-Edge gives Hitmonlee the most damage possible against Poison-types like Weezing, Arbok, and Gloom. Hitmonlee can also sacrifice a small amount of power against Xatu and other Flying- and Bug-types by running Double-Edge over Hidden Power Rock, which frees up the last slot for Hitmonlee to use a utility move such as Body Slam for paralysis, Rapid Spin to remove Spikes, or Mach Punch for priority. However, this leaves Hitmonlee without any move to hit the rare Gastly, leaving it dependent on teammates with Pursuit such as Houndour.</p> <p>Hitmonlee is generally inferior to Primeape when it comes to the role of setup sweeper due to Primeape's higher Speed and its access to Cross Chop and Rock Slide. Hitmonlee's main advantages over Primeape are its ability to hit Poison-types slightly harder with its neutral attacks and its superior special bulk. This arguably makes Hitmonlee a better receiver of Speed boosts than Primeape, so it is worth considering Baton Passers with Agility, such as Ledian, Farfetch'd, and Ariados, as potential teammates. Hitmonlee is also more suitable to switch into weaker special attacks for its team, whereas Primeape prefers to remain at near full health for as long as it can. It's important to bring a reliable method of handling Xatu when using Hitmonlee, so Pokemon like Ninetales, Mantine, and Magnemite make for useful teammates. Primeape also has a huge advantage over Hitmonlee when the two face off thanks to its potential Cross Chop critical hit OHKO, so Pokemon such as Xatu, Weezing, and Gloom are useful to put the enraged monkey in its place; the latter of the three can also help spread paralysis.</p>"

It also crucially reduces the need for Dugtrio to guess which Pokemon will switch in or whether the foe will switch at all and forces the opponent to attack Dugtrio directly in fear of giving it free turns.</p> <p>While Dugtrio is the fastest Pokemon in the tier, its base 80 Attack is a far cry from the Attack stats of behemoths like Kingler. To highlight its lack of power, Dugtrio fails to OHKO Ninetales and Rapidash from full health. Furthermore, Weezing and Sudowoodo only take about 54% from Dugtrio's super effective STAB Earthquake. To help bring these Pokemon into Dugtrio's KO range, pairing it with Pineco is essential to making it thrive, as Spikes help wear down roadblocks to Dugtrio such as Octillery and Dewgong and help push its attacks over the line when Dugtrio might otherwise barely miss out on 2HKOes or OHKOes. Powerful attackers such as Kingler, Fearow, and Rapidash are all good teammates given that all three are capable of weakening foes with their powerful hits, which further makes Dugtrio's job easier. Sudowoodo can lure in Water- and Grass-types Dugtrio has trouble with and remove them with Self-Destruct. Chinchou is a great partner to complement Dugtrio's defensive shortcomings, as it can take opposing Surfs and Ice Beams, which Dugtrio is weak to, and hit back with its strong STAB Thunder.</p> <p>The biggest flaw to Dugtrio is its lack of raw power and generally poor bulk, so Pokemon that can take advantage of these deficits make for good checks. Bulky Normal-types such as Wigglytuff and Dunsparce take 30% from Dugtrio's Earthquake on average while hitting back with STAB Normal attacks such as Body Slam, Return, and Double-Edge for between 40% and 67%. Xatu can force Dugtrio out despite its faster super effective Rock Slide if Dugtrio isn't healthy and behind a Substitute. Water-types in general are the best answers to Dugtrio. Octillery takes 31-37% from Earthquake while threatening to OHKO back. Dewgong only takes 28-33% from STAB Earthquake while doing 75-88.6% with STAB Surf and Ice Beam in return. Physically bulky attackers like Kingler can potentially set up a Swords Dance boost against Dugtrio without too much to fear.</p>"

Agility with Baton Pass is an extremely powerful combination that allows Farfetch'd to pass Speed boosts to huge threats such as Cubone, Machoke, Kingler, and Stantler. These recipients are more than capable of sweeping entire teams if they aren't carefully prepared for. Due to the sheer power of this strategy, most teams will have a Haze user such as Xatu or Weezing that they will use to thwart this strategy. However, unlike other Baton Passers, Farfetch'd comes equipped with STAB Return, which can be used to chip away at these Haze users to get them to the point where they have no choice but to allow you to pass your chosen stat or else be KOed. Swords Dance further amplifies the danger posed by Farfetch'd and can be used to preserve the more valuable HP of the recipient, which would otherwise need to spend a turn setting up an Attack boost, in exchange for taking a hit with Farfetch'd.</p> <p>Apart from the aforementioned recipients, Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Primeape, and Flareon can also make for adequate recipients. Flareon can also set up additional Growth or Curse boosts to pass along with the Speed boosts from Farfetch'd. Pokemon that can spread paralysis and set up screens, such as Voltorb, Flaaffy, and Bayleef, are also essential teammates for giving Farfetch'd the best possible chance at passing boosts to a teammate. Explosion users are also useful, as they can create a chance for Farfetch'd to enter the battlefield without having to take a hit. Voltorb is great for this purpose and compresses the role of screens user and Explosion user into a single team slot. Weezing and Gastly are also capable of performing this role; Weezing can handle opposing setup attempts adequately with its access to Haze and Explosion, whereas Gastly can null Explosions aimed at preventing Farfetch'd from passing boosts.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Gengar is an interesting Pokemon. It gets a wonderful movepool with super effective coverage and sacrificial moves that can hurt pretty much anything the OU tier has to offer. However, since Shadow Ball is physical, Gengar gets no special STAB moves to run off that amazing base 130 Special Attack stat. Gengar is also very frail, and while its Ghost typing is very useful for capitalizing off foes that only run Normal-type STAB moves, it's vulnerable to Pursuit and cannot take a hit that it doesn't resist. Moreover, as a Ghost-type, Misdreavus outclasses it as a spinblocker, Perish trapper, and Snorlax counter because of Gengar's unfortunate weaknesses to Earthquake and Starmie's Psychic. Furthermore, its Speed, while great, is eclipsed by that of Raikou and Starmie, which leads to particularly relevant match-up problems. In spite of these issues, Gengar is the tier's best assassin, being able to take down pretty much anything it wants to with Explosion, Destiny Bond, wonderful type coverage, or some sort of surprise. To get the most out of it, Gengar users should be sure to play to its strengths, maintain good prediction, know how to utilize the element of surprise, and be wary of letting it take any kind of status-inducing move or unresisted hit.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aside from the aforementioned move choices, Counter makes for an intriguing option, as it can bounce back non-STAB Earthquake from Snorlax and Tyranitar, or even weaker STAB Earthquake from the likes of Steelix and Nidoking, for a surprise KO. STAB Rock Slide from Tyranitar, as well as non-STAB Hidden Power and Rock Slide from Machamp, are also excellent moves to bounce back with Counter. However, the move is fairly situational, as many Snorlax do not carry Earthquake; many Tyranitar pack Crunch; Nidoking has a slight chance to OHKO Gengar with Earthquake; and most of the move's intended targets can boost with Curse to be able to OHKO Gengar. However, should the foe indeed pack Curse, Destiny Bond synergizes well with Counter, giving Gengar an alternative way to surprise and KO its foe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gengar has no true counters due to the many tools it has in its movepool. The best option for a check is Raikou, as it outspeeds Gengar, can survive Explosion at full health, can use Reflect to weaken Explosion, and can even use Sleep Talk to negate Hypnosis or Roar to eliminate the threat of Perish Trap. Umbreon is another top check, as it does not take a lot of damage from Dynamic Punch, takes only 65-77% from Explosion, and can either use a combination Mean Look and Baton Pass, which is especially effective against Perish trap sets, or simply spam Pursuit. However, Umbreon can still lose to Explosion if it is not at full HP, is vulnerable to caught by Hypnosis, and is not powerful enough to outlast Perish Song with Pursuit spam. Dark-types with higher Special Attack such as Tyranitar and Houndoom make for better Pursuit users, and Tyranitar resists Explosion while frequently carrying Roar to deal with a healthy Perish trap Gengar. However, these threats, in addition to being vulnerable to Destiny Bond and Hypnosis, take heavy damage from Dynamic Punch. Steelix makes for a solid check to Gengar as well, since it is immune to Electric, resists Explosion and Ice Punch, and just barely misses out on an OHKO with Earthquake. However, Steelix can always be caught by Destiny Bond or Hypnosis, is weak to Fire Punch, and lacks the special bulk to switch into Ice Punch too many times. Snorlax also makes for a great check for Gengar, especially if it has Earthquake. It takes paltry damage from Gengar's non-STAB special attacks, and without a Defense boost from Curse, it still takes only 28-33% from Dynamic Punch and 69-81% from Explosion. However, without Earthquake, Snorlax has to rely on trying to outstall Gengar, making it vulnerable to a freeze from Ice Punch or a KO from Perish Song. Even with Earthquake, Gengar can always surprise Snorlax with Destiny Bond, incapacitate it with Hypnosis, or KO it with Explosion after some prior damage. Quagsire makes for an okay check, as it does not take super effective damage from BoltBeam and can hit back hard with its STAB Earthquake; like most Gengar checks, though, it can be beaten by Hypnosis, Destiny Bond, or Explosion. Blissey also sponges Gengar's special moves easily, but it cannot force Gengar out, takes a lot of damage from Dynamic Punch, is usually OHKOed by Explosion, and hurts the team greatly if hit by Hypnosis due to the supportive role it plays.</p> <p>Aside from the above checks, there are a few other Pokemon like Zapdos that don't match up as well against Gengar one-on-one but can still threaten it if need be. Zapdos frequently runs Sleep Talk, so Hypnosis isn't too big of a deal, and it can hit Gengar hard and possibly paralyze it with STAB Thunder, although it is 3HKOed by Ice Punch and can always be KOed in return by Explosion or Destiny Bond. In addition, Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoking, and Marowak can hit hard enough to OHKO Gengar, so they can force Gengar out as they switch into a predicted Thunderbolt, transferring the offensive momentum to their team. However, they cannot switch into Ice Punch, so the Gengar user can beat them with good prediction. Any other Pokemon that does not fear the BoltBeam combination can also act as a Gengar counter in some form. Misdreavus, your own Gengar, Heracross, and even Miltank can all switch into Gengar to take its hits and force it to use its surprise tactics to win, even though Heracross fears Fire Punch. However, keep in mind that unless such a Pokemon has away to force Gengar out, Gengar can always stay in and spam Ice Punch to try to freeze its foe.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Assassin": {
          "description": "<p>This is the standard Gengar set that maximizes its ability to threaten the GSC metagame, dealing significant damage to almost every viable Pokemon. An Electric-type move functions as a pseudo-STAB attack and, running off Gengar's high base 130 Special Attack, is what keeps specially bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, from switching in. Thunderbolt is generally preferred because Gengar is too frail to afford to miss a lot, but Thunder is a good option for the increased paralysis chance, which is particularly useful against the speedier Raikou. Ice Punch keeps Ground-types at bay and also hits Zapdos and Exeggutor super effectively. It can also be used for its freeze chance in matchups where the foe cannot touch Gengar, such as when Gengar switches in against Miltank or Seismic Toss Heracross. The next moveslot is generally reserved for Gengar's non-sacrificial method of dealing with checks. Generally, Hypnosis is the most effective move, being able to put any one counter out of commission. However, Hypnosis can be caught easily by a Sleep Talk user if it is well-predicted, so it must be used cautiously. Furthermore, because of Sleep Clause, Hypnosis is an unreliable move for dealing with foes such as Pursuit Tyranitar. For this reason, Dynamic Punch is a viable alternative, as it hits Tyranitar hard enough to 2HKO it. Dynamic Punch is also good for putting Snorlax and Umbreon switch-ins into Explosion's KO range after Spikes damage. Finally, the last moveslot deals with Gengar's sacrificial tactics for taking out foes. Explosion is the preferred choice, as Gengar tends to draw in sleep absorbers and physically weak special walls and has no other options with which to eliminate Raikou. However, if Raikou isn't a problem, you can opt instead for Destiny Bond, which is a more reliableâ€“and often game-savingâ€“way to take out opposing Tyranitar, CurseLax, and Steelix. All of these Pokemon are slower than Gengar, take little damage from its BoltBeam coverage, and can frequently have multiple Curse boosts under their belts.</p> <p>Gengar pairs well with teammates that enjoy having its targets removed. Zapdos makes for an excellent partner, as two of its main counters, Raikou and Snorlax, are also two of Gengar's more common Explosion targets. If Gengar is using Destiny Bond, it can lure a Pokemon like Tyranitar, Snorlax, or Steelix into attacking and then going down; this is useful because physical tanks and switch-ins to Normal-type moves can frequently give Gengar trouble.</p> <p>Gengar is not just a role-playing assassin, but also works fantastically as an offensive powerhouse in its own right. It really enjoys using its immunities and Speed to avoid taking as many hits as possible. While it can be effective as a lead, Gengar is often better used later in the match, when opposing Pokemon are weakened and likely in OHKO or 2HKO range of Gengar's super effective attacks. However, if the opponent is using a Normal-type without any coverage moves, such as Miltank or Snorlax, be sure to switch Gengar in early and often to take advantage of that foe's inability to deal damage to it. If you plan to do this with Gengar, though, you should either run Dynamic Punch or be very careful with Hypnosis to ensure that Gengar can deal with Tyranitar, which is likely present on the opponent's team because of the fact that they are using a Pokemon incapable of touching Gengar. Furthermore, if the opponent is using a wall that Gengar is typically used specifically to KO, such as Raikou, do not be afraid to pull the trigger with Explosion, especially if you have been throwing out attacking moves the whole time. The opponent will likely be perfectly willing to risk having their Sleep Talk Raikou eliminated when the risk of trying to predict an Explosion is more damaging than the risk of more super effective attacks and a possible Hypnosis against the rest of their team. Just make sure that Raikou has taken a slight amount of damage or is paralyzed when you pull the trigger, as Raikou can usually survive Gengar's Explosion from full health and, since it outspeeds everything, easily use Rest to undo the Explosion damage without the fear of being revenge killed.</p> <p>Gengar can also make use of Mean Look in the third moveslot. Using Mean Look prevents a switch-in such as Raikou from switching back out in an attempt to predict Explosion, allowing Gengar to use the move safely. Mean Look also pairs well with Destiny Bond, as it prevents a mixed attacker such as Tyranitar from switching out to avoid knocking Gengar out when it's using Destiny Bond. Alternatively, the third moveslot could be forgone to allow room for Gengar to use Destiny Bond and Explosion on the same set, allowing Gengar to be more flexible depending on what Pokemon the opposing team has. Explosion allows it to do serious damage to Raikou, Zapdos, and unboosted Snorlax, whereas Destiny Bond allows Gengar to take down Tyranitar, Steelix, and Curse-boosted Snorlax.</p> <p>Fire Punch could be inserted somewhere on the set, usually in the second or third moveslot. It's mostly useful for Steelix, which does not take super effective damage from BoltBeam, deals heavy damage to Gengar with STAB super effective Earthquakes, and can tank Explosion thanks to its ludicrous Defense and Steel typing. Fire Punch also allows Gengar to counter Curse Heracross, which otherwise sets up with impunity against Gengar's coverage moves, and OHKO Forretress, which can otherwise set up Spikes against Gengar without taking too much damage in return. However, Fire Punch is a poor coverage option outside of these particular matchups. Ice Punch is rarely foregone, as it 3HKOes Zapdos and Ground-types, whereas Dynamic Punch or Hypnosis is preferred in the third moveslot to give Gengar a way to beat Tyranitar, which can spam Pursuit to KO it.</p>"
        },
        "Perish Trapper": {
          "description": "<p>Gengar's Poison typing makes it take a lot more damage from Earthquake and Psychic, making it an inferior Perish trapper relative to Misdreavus. However, because Gengar rarely carries Perish Song, this set carries the element of surprise. Opponents will likely stay away from bringing their phazer in on a potential Hypnosis when scouting out Gengar's set. Instead, they will frequently bring in their Sleep Talk Raikou or Zapdos looking to absorb Hypnosis or will try to stall your team out with their non-Earthquake Snorlax only to find out that Gengar has just used Mean Look and plans to eliminate its foe with Perish Song. This move combination helps Gengar beat any foe that lacks a phazing move, and Protect allows Gengar to survive an onslaught of damage from a Sleep Talk Zapdos or Raikou while it waits out the Perish Song turns; this is necessary because these two Pokemon can 2HKO Gengar otherwise. Gengar should run an Electric-type move in the fourth moveslot for two reasons. The first reason is to threaten Skarmory and Roar Suicine, which would otherwise be able to switch in against Gengar and phaze it. The second reason is to keep Perish Song concealed and to maintain the element of surprise; as mentioned previously, without this factor, Misdreavus makes for a better Perish trapper. Thunderbolt is typically preferred for its accuracy given Gengar's low defenses; however, Thunder can be used for the increased paralysis chance, which can be helpful when trying to pull off this strategy against a foe such as Roar Raikou.</p> <p>Above all else, it should be stressed that Gengar needs to utilize the element of surprise to make this set work, lest it be outclassed by Misdreavus. As such, it's probably best to scout the opposing team a bit beforehand by using Thunderbolt or, if you expect a Pursuit Tyranitar to come in, switching out. Furthermore, because most opponents will fear Hypnosis, it is generally not a good idea to run the move if any of Gengar's teammates packs a sleep-inducing move, unless it is absolutely necessary that Gengar incapacitate any phazer that might try to switch into it. If your opponent keeps sending phazers into Gengar, it's a good idea to wear them down and either force them to use Rest, paralyze them, or simply bring them down to Gengar's KO range before you bring it out again. If your opponent brings in a Sleep Talk user or Snorlax to check Gengar the first time you bring it out, you can try to catch these switch-ins with Mean Look on the next attempt. If all else fails, if you suspect that the opponent's Snorlax does not carry Earthquake, you can switch Gengar in as Snorlax is setting up Curse and see how the opponent reacts. If Snorlax continues to boost, it's liable to try to stall your team out, out and Gengar should be safe to try to KO Snorlax with Perish trap. In general, just make sure you are reasonably certain the opponent is not going to switch a phazer into Gengar as it uses Mean Look, lest you lose the surprise factor for nothing.</p> <p>Gengar could run a couple of other attacking options in its attacking moveslot to hit different threats. Ice Punch is almost always seen on Gengar, and it can be useful to prevent the Ground-type Pokemon that can phaze or OHKO Gengar from switching in. Dynamic Punch, while uncommon, can hit Tyranitar for major damage and confuse other phazers should you need to buy a turn to pull off Perish trap. Fire Punch is even more uncommon, but it can keep Steelix from switching in and stopping you cold. Still, an Electric-type move is Gengar's strongest and most common attacking option, so it will help more than any other coverage move could with keeping this set concealed.</p> <p>This Gengar set also has the option of running two attacking moves; for example, Gengar can forgo Protect in favor of Ice Punch, completing the BoltBeam combination and making it easier to bluff an offensive set. However, without Protect, Gengar cannot withstand enough neutral hits from any reasonably strong STAB move to net a KO with Perish trap. Thus, it becomes difficult to KO Sleep Talk Raikou, Zapdos, and Snorlax, but the latter is still easy to beat as long as it does not have Earthquake.</p> <p>Gengar could use Confuse Ray to mess with phazers or Destiny Bond to try to take certain threats down with it if the opponent knows the set. However, these options leave Gengar either without a damaging move, thereby making this set much more likely to be discovered, or without Protect, which makes the strategy more difficult to pull off.</p>"

Explosion is further complemented by its Electric-type attacks, which scare off most Pokemon that resist Explosion and draw in useful targets such as Hypno, Nidoqueen, and Ampharos. However, Electrode's offensive stats are rather poor, meaning that it generally has to use Explosion to do any major damage, and even Explosion fails to KO bulkier foes. Given that it usually uses Explosion early on to give its teammates as many turns behind its dual screens as possible, it is fairly predictable, so opponents may be able to anticipate when it will use Explosion and switch to Haunter or Omastar to negate it.</p>",

It can hit many notable targets, such as Nidoqueen, Hypno, and Ampharos. Removing or crippling these foes enables fast attackers such as Scyther, Mr. Mime, and Electabuzz. It also immediately ends the turn, allowing free entry for a teammate with a favorable matchup. Electrode can force its way to a good position by outspeeding the foe, setting up the appropriate screen, surviving an attack or two, and, finally, using Explosion. Hidden Power Ice lets Electrode hit Ground-type Pokemon without needing to use Explosion. It is also useful for chipping Nidoqueen into range of an Explosion KO. Thunder Wave is a generally solid option, as it allows Electrode to further cripple the foe, making it even harder for them to respond when its teammate comes in to set up. Electric STAB in Thunderbolt or Thunder allows Electrode to act as a somewhat reliable check to Scyther and hit Haunter and Omastar, which may try to absorb its Explosion. Electrode can also go without any STAB moves, as Thunder Wave is a sufficient deterrent for Haunter and Scyther. However, this leaves Electrode more vulnerable to Omastar. Miracle Berry gives Electrode a safe opportunity to set up screens against Thunder Wave users like Mr. Mime and Hypno without being outsped by Ground-types like Nidoqueen afterwards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electrode best fits on more offensively oriented teams. Baton Pass users such as Girafarig and Ariados appreciate Electrode's dual screens support in helping them set up Agility boosts or Spider Web.

A secondary Electric-type such as Electabuzz or Pikachu can take advantage of Electrode's Explosion weakening checks such as Ampharos, Hypno, and Nidoqueen.

On the defensive side, Exeggutor can serve as a check to threatening sweepers like Vaporeon, Marowak, and Machamp thanks to its resistances to their powerful STAB attacks.

If you'd rather spread as much status as possible, you can forgo a coverage move on the standard set and go double status, taking advantage of your opponent's likely assumption that you will be using a coverage move to land status on something that isn't expecting it. However, having Psychic and Explosion as Exeggutor's only attacking moves means that you are highly likely to run into a Pokemon that resists all of its attacks, such as Steelix, Tyranitar, or Skarmory.</p> <p>Synthesis and Moonlight are possible options for the last slot on the Leech Seed set. They allow Exeggutor to play a more defensive role and stick around longer, although they are both illegal with Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In terms of switching into Exeggutor, RestTalk users tend to be the best options due to their ability to sponge status-inflicting moves. Common ones include Zapdos, Snorlax, and Suicune. Do keep in mind that all of them fear Explosion, so beware of possible mind games such as Explosion on the switch. Baiting the Explosion is also possible, of course, and most Pokemon that resist Normal, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar, can take one rather well. Skarmory is also capable of pulling off a Sleep Talk set that can completely shut down non-Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor. Other notable Explosion mitigators include Reflect Raikou and Charm Umbreon. Umbreon also takes little damage from Exeggutor's other attacks, outspeeds it, and has Pursuit, albeit a rather weak one. Stronger Pursuit users in the tier are Tyranitar and Houndoom, although Houndoom tends to fear status a lot and Tyranitar must play mind games against Giga Drain Exeggutor. Toxic from Umbreon, Suicune, or Snorlax can also significantly reduce Exeggutor's longevity and force it to use Explosion predictably or risk not getting it off at all. Jynx is a terror for Exeggutor to face, resisting Psychic and completely blocking status moves and Giga Drain with its Substitutes, but it loses much of its effectiveness if Exeggutor lands status on it on the switch. Lastly, Forretress with Hidden Power Bug or Toxic can switch in and threaten Exeggutor lacking Hidden Power Fire, although it must beware of status.</p>",

          "description": "<p>First, pick your status move of choiceâ€”opponents won't want to risk a Pokemon without Sleep Talk taking Sleep Powder, so using Stun Spore can be an excellent way to paralyze sleep absorbers such as Zapdos, potentially setting up another sweeper or sleep move user on your team for success. However, Sleep Powder is of course very powerful and is an easy choice if your team lacks another sleep move user. Psychic is Exeggutor's main attacking move, dealing solid damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it and even potentially threatening Snorlax with its chance to drop Special Defense. Giga Drain threatens Water-types and gives Exeggutor a chance against Tyranitar, healing off Crunch or Fire Blast damage and preventing it from trapping Exeggutor with Pursuit. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire disintegrates Forretress and dents Skarmory, which walls Giga Drain variants, although dropping Giga Drain makes Pursuit Tyranitar much more dangerous and comes at the cost of 25 HP, 2 Attack points, and 6 Defense points due to DV requirements. Rounding off the set is Explosion, which can secure OHKOs on most Pokemon that don't resist it (Suicune, one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, takes up to 92% from Exeggutor's Explosion), making switching into Exeggutor quite risky at any point in the game.</p> <p>This Exeggutor set is one of the best enablers in the tier, handily setting up Machamp, Marowak, Charizard, or Tentacruel for a potential sweep with its Stun Spore on Raikou and Zapdos or removing said Electric-types for Vaporeon with its Explosion. It can be used as a lead to begin spreading status immediately or even attempt to take something out with its Explosion on turn one. While it is more of an offensive Pokemon, it can also be put to use as a check against Machamp (although it should be noted that Machamp Speed ties Exeggutor and can have Hidden Power Bug), Vaporeon, Marowak, Rhydon, or Steelix and find ways to wreak havoc from there. A well-played Explosion Exeggutor can literally blow through an opponent's defenses, leaving them open to a wide variety of possible threats.</p>"

          "description": "<p>This set can be a one-man army against some teams when coupled with Spikes support. The classic combination of Substitute and Leech Seed enables Exeggutor to stay in against even Pokemon that hit it super effectively, thanks to the Speed drop from Stun Spore ensuring Exeggutor can always put up Substitute first. While Leech Seed in GSC only deals damage immediately after the seeded Pokemon attacks rather than at end-of-turn, it still forces switches like nobody's business. Very little can take repeated hits from Exeggutor's Psychic while also losing an eighth of their HP per turn from Leech Seed, so theoretically, Exeggutor can freely spread its Stun Spore across the enemy team as the opponent helplessly tries to run Exeggutor out of PP, all the while taking significant residual damage. Exeggutor can also drop Substitute for Explosion, potentially catching a crucial Pokemon by surprise and also raising Exeggutor's utility significantly in the event something goes wrong.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, because this Exeggutor is one of the most effective paralysis spreaders in the tier, slow but powerful sweepers such as Machamp and Marowak or Belly Drum users such as Snorlax and Charizard make excellent choices.</p> <p>There are good reasons this is not Exeggutor's main set, however. Phazers that aren't hit hard by Psychic, such as Steelix, Skarmory, and Tyranitar, can put an end to its antics even if it has a Substitute up. This can be a problem, since Exeggutor sometimes struggles to find a good opportunity to come back in. Spikers and spinners like Forretress and Starmie may also be eager to take advantage of Exeggutor's lack of coverage to gain an advantage in the Spikes game, particularly if they are supported by Heal Bell users that can undo all of Exeggutor's hard work such as Blissey and Miltank.</p>"

  "Qwilfish": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Qwilfish fills two crucial niches in GSC UUâ€”it is the best Spiker and has a fast Haze. It has just enough power behind its STAB attacks that it can occasionally pose a realistic threat to opposing teams, especially because it outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoqueen, which is arguably the best Pokemon in the tier. Its typing is both a blessing and a curse; its immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water make it difficult for spinners to wear it down, but its weaknesses to common types such as Psychic and Ground and middling defenses can leave it struggling to find opportunities to lay Spikes down in the first place.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Qwilfish can use Hidden Power Ground to hit opposing Qwilfish harder and make it a more plausible recipient for Attack boosts from Baton Pass Scyther. However, it must sacrifice some of its bulk to do so due to DV requirements. Qwilfish's decent Speed also makes it possible for it to use Swagger somewhat effectively, which can give it a chance at breaking through some foes it might otherwise be very unlikely to, such as Slowbro. However, Haze is typically more useful and reliable than either of these options. Rest can also be used to give Qwilfish some extra longevity against Pokemon that are unable to hit it hard like Blastoise, Slowbro without Psychic, and opposing Qwilfish. However, Rest should only be used alongside a very solid defensive lineup due to the free turns it provides to the opposing team. Sleep Talk can also be used alongside Rest with Spikes and Haze or a STAB attack, but while this increases Qwilfish's durability, it must be noted that important coverage is being given up, which may result in it being used as setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro easily switches into any of Qwilfish's attacks and can deal massive damage to it with Psychic. It can also shrug off a potential poison infliction from Sludge Bomb with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Qwilfish</strong>: Opposing Qwilfish can take advantage of your own Qwilfish to set up Spikes, as it resists both STAB attacks. To avoid damage to more valuable members of the team, opposing Qwilfish can also choose to slowly wear your Qwilfish down with its STAB attacks before finishing it off with a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Kadabra outspeed and deal massive damage to Qwilfish with their STAB Psychic, although they don't want to switch into Sludge Bomb. Other Psychic-types such as Hypno and Slowking are not quite as good at fighting Qwilfish due to getting outsped and having lower Defense than Slowbro, but they can hit it hard with STAB Psychic and will usually beat it one-on-one. Girafarig is also notable because it is a Baton Pass user that threatens Qwilfish with Psychic and Thunder, meaning Qwilfish can find it difficult to use Haze to stop it from passing boosts.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos, Magneton, and Lanturn make for decent answers to Qwilfish, although if they are hit on their weaker defensive stat on the switch, they will take a large chunk of damage. Electabuzz outspeeds Qwilfish but does not enjoy getting hit by it on the switch. Ampharos, Magneton, and Electabuzz all OHKO Qwilfish with Thunder, while Lanturn does 93% at minimum.</p> <p><strong>Blastoise</strong>: With a RestTalk + Rapid Spin set, Blastoise has the defenses and typing to outlast Qwilfish and keep its Spikes off the field as long as it avoids a critical hit from Sludge Bomb at the wrong moment. Blastoise will struggle to keep Curse Qwilfishâ€™s Spikes off the field, however. It can also try to take Qwilfish by surprise with Zap Cannon, although replacing any of Blastoise's moves will reduce its ability to consistently remove Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter outspeeds Qwilfish, takes negligible damage from Sludge Bomb, and threatens to 2HKO Qwilfish with Psychic and Thunder. It doesn't like taking Hydro Pump, though.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Spiker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is what separates Qwilfish from GSC UU's plethora of other Water-type Pokemon and provides constant extra damage, which can prove crucial to securing KOs; notably, Nidoqueen gains a chance at 2HKOing Slowbro with Thunder with Spikes up. Once Qwilfish has put Spikes down, unless there is a spinner on the opposing team, it very often becomes the go-to choice when fodder is needed for taking a status move or strong hit, as its main purpose has been served. That is not to say that it is useless other than for setting Spikesâ€”far from it. Sludge Bomb is a surprisingly powerful attack, especially with its 30% chance to inflict poison. It is handy for threatening Grass-types like Jumpluff and Bellossom and is also good for hitting other Water-types and neutral targets. Hydro Pump is key for hitting the many Ground-types in the metagame hard, especially Nidoqueen, which Qwilfish can beat one-on-one. Haze makes Qwilfish a solid check to all kinds of setup sweepers. Qwilfish has high Speed relative to most of the tier, so it can outspeed and erase the boosts of Pokemon like Granbull, Kabutops, Victreebel, Quagsire, and Politoed. It also Speed ties with Pinsir, another dangerous Swords Dance user. Curse is an alternative that gives Qwilfish the ability to boost Sludge Bomb's power against targets like Blastoise, which may try to outlast Qwilfish to keep its Spikes off the field. It can also be useful against Pokemon like Scyther and Pinsir, which can struggle to beat Qwilfish once it has a Curse boost. However, a boosted Qwilfish will still lose to many common Pokemon, including Curse Granbull, Slowbro, and Haunter. Nidoqueen's matchup against Qwilfish also improves if it uses Curse due to its reduced Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Qwilfish has such great utility with Spikes and Haze that it can be used on almost any kind of team. The extra damage granted by its Spikes can be taken advantage of most by offensive Pokemon, particularly those with immediate power and good coverage like Nidoqueen, Electabuzz, Mr. Mime, Gyarados, and Dodrio. Pokemon that can force switches with Roar, Whirlwind, or Swagger such as Piloswine, Gyarados, Dodrio, and Arcanine also make good use of the extra damage from Spikes. While not strictly necessary, Belly Drum users such as Quagsire, Politoed, and Poliwrath appreciate the additional chip damage Qwilfish's Spikes provides; notably, Quagsire's +6 Earthquake becomes much more likely to OHKO Slowbro with Spikes on the field. Many defensive teams also opt to add Spikes to their team to ensure they have a reliable source of long-term damage, especially those with more passive Pokemon like Chansey, Blastoise, and Bellossom. Leech Seed Jumpluff and Bellossom are great at forcing switches, so Qwilfish's Spikes makes it an important teammate. Jumpluff has particularly good synergy with Curse Qwilfish, which can better keep Spikes up against Blastoise, whereas Jumpluff's Encore compensates for Qwilfish's lack of Haze. Qwilfish can struggle to find early-game opportunities to lay Spikes down against Psychic-type leads such as Mr. Mime and Slowking, so leads such as Electrode, Scyther, and Pinsir can be used to force them out and get Qwilfish in on a less dangerous foe. Finally, Haunter can be useful alongside Haze Qwilfish as a spinblocker to help ensure Qwilfish's Spikes can be kept on the field when facing Blastoise.</p>"

Any Electric- or Psychic-type can also get rid of Qwilfish with ease (though with their typically-low Defense, they'll take a nice hit from Sludge Bomb).

      "overview": "<p>Lions and Tigers and Raikou, oh my! With blistering base 115 Speed and Special Attack, great special bulk, Roar, and only one weakness, Raikou has the qualities most phazers and tanks wish they had. This combination of factors allows Raikou to come in on a slew of special attackers and either tank them with a blazing fast RestTalk combo or phaze them with Roar. Speaking of Roar, Raikou is one of the most dependable phazers in OU. Unlike many of its phazing brethren, Raikou has both significant offensive prowess in Thunder as well as amazing Speed. With Spikes support, Raikou can become a true terror. Good base 90 HP and 100 Special Defense give Raikou some serious special bulk, but its low Defense is a bit of a drag, especially with a weakness to the ubiquitous Earthquake. Raikou's movepool is shallow, and it can do little to the most common Pokemon in OUâ€”Snorlax. However, beyond these few issues, Raikou is easily one of the most dependable Pokemon in OU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crunch on the RestTalk set is a more effective way to damage opposing Raikou and Exeggutor, and the possiblity of a Special Defense drop gives it a chance to force foes such as Snorlax and Raikou out, potentially creating an opportunity to hit something hard with Thunder. However, the reduced damage against the tier's many Ground-types is a major disincentive to dropping Hidden Power. Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice or Water will give Quagsire a nasty surprise. Golem, Rhydon, and Marowak are also covered by Hidden Power Grass. However, losing out on Hidden Power Ice's coverage against Nidoking and Exeggutor, Quagsire's scarce usage, and the substantial loss of bulk caused by the DV drop make it a worse option in most cases. Toxic is a possibility to wear down and force Rest from foes such as Snorlax and opposing Raikou. However, it is difficult to fit without losing coverage or Roar, which are highly desirable alongside Toxic. Without Hidden Power, Nidoking and Steelix can switch into Toxic Raikou without fear, and without Roar, it is more difficult to take advantage of Toxic's chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax, especially RestTalk variants, can switch in with near impunity due to its great special bulk. Although Thunder deals a solid blow and can inflict paralysis, it does not pose a realistic KO threat, whereas Raikou is heavily threatened by Snorlaxâ€”Earthquake variants have a good chance of 2HKOing Hidden Power Ice Raikou and almost always 2HKO Hidden Power Water variants, and Double-Edge is a reliable 3HKO against any variant. Snorlax's high damage output with unboosted attacks also dissuades Raikou from using Roar on turns that Curse or Belly Drum is anticipated. Even Reflect Raikou is not truly safe, as it risks being outright OHKOed by a critical hit Double-Edge or Earthquake and struggles to outpace Snorlax's damage output due to Thunder's shaky accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: All Ground-types can switch into Raikou as it uses an Electric-type attack or Rest and threaten it with Earthquake. This is one of the biggest downsides to using Raikou over Zapdos. However, if Raikou has the right Hidden Power, it can potentially deal significant damage before they can attack. Golem can force Raikou out with Earthquake in order to remove Spikes using Rapid Spin, although Raikou is not OHKOed by Earthquake and can deal heavy damage if it has Hidden Power Water. Rhydon fears super effective Hidden Power even more than Golem due to its terrible Special Defense, but it can punish Raikou's team with its powerful attacks. Marowak is the only Ground-type that can threaten a reliable unboosted OHKO on Raikou, which can often grant it an opportunity to use Swords Dance as Raikou is forced to switch. Additionally, Raikou cannot threaten a 2HKO with any of its attacks, which can sometimes put additional pressure on it to avoid using Thunder or Rest. While Nidoking lacks the high Attack of the aforementioned Ground-types, it makes up for it with its powerful array of coverage and disruptive move options, which can devastate the defensive teams Raikou often finds itself a part of. Steelix also makes for an especially good check to Raikou due to its Ice neutrality and its access to Explosion, which allows it to threaten Raikou's teammates. However, it can be quickly worn down and forced into a difficult position by Hidden Power Water variants. Piloswine is a more defensive option that can easily switch into Hidden Power Ice Raikou and threaten a freeze with Ice Beam against Raikou's teammates. However, like Steelix, it is susceptible to Hidden Power Water. Quagsire is unique as a Ground-type that is weak to neither Ice nor Water. It can put Raikou into a tough position by simultaneously threatening immediate heavy damage with STAB Earthquake and threatening to sweep by setting up with Belly Drum. It only fears the rare Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Opposing Raikou can force an effective stalemate against Raikou in the absence of Spikes. RestTalk variants make particularly good checks, as they fear paralysis less than Roar variants. However, if Spikes are up on the foe's side, Roar Raikou can apply significant pressure against opposing Raikou. In situations where both Raikou have Roar, the slower one can prevent its foe from phazing it, limiting the foe's options significantly. Jolteon resists Thunder and can use RestTalk Raikou as an opportunity to set up Agility or Substitute, then Baton Pass to a recipient such as Marowak or Snorlax. However, these Jolteon variants will have a tough time against Roar Raikou, as it can only fish for paralysis until Raikou is forced to use Rest. It also fears paralysis from Raikou's Thunder. Growth Jolteon with Rest is another option that can potentially turn the tables on teams that rely on Raikou, as it should beat Raikou in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey takes virtually no damage from Raikou and can threaten an OHKO with Present in return. It also has access to Light Screen, which can allow Ground-types and Snorlax to switch in with much less to fear.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor fears Hidden Power Ice and prefers not to risk paralysis from Thunder, its access to Thief, Stun Spore, Explosion, and Sleep Powder makes it a threat to Raikou and its team. If Raikou is the designated sleep absorber for its team, Exeggutor's unpredictability may make it difficult to successfully take sleep without having its Leftovers stolen by Thief, getting paralyzed by Stun Spore, or suddenly being KOed by Explosion. With Spikes up, Psychic also has a chance of 3HKOing Raikou, and the potential for Special Defense drops puts it at further risk.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can find many opportunities to switch in against defensive Pokemon, and Raikou is often the safest option against Gengar, as it takes a pittance from Gengar's attacking moves besides Explosion. However, Gengar has access to disruptive moves such as Thief and Hypnosis, and it can even potentially take a weakened Raikou down with Explosion or pull off a Perish trap. With Raikou crippled or removed, foes such as Vaporeon, Charizard, and Zapdos will be harder to deal with.</p>",

        "Phazer": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>When it comes to dependable phazers, it doesn't get much better than Raikou. This set will stop numerous special attackers and setup sweepers such as Growth Vaporeon, Zapdos, Gengar, Suicune, and Growth Jolteon. Raikou will also serve as an effective check to any Misdreavus trying to Perish trap. While Roar phazes foes and racks up entry hazard damage, Raikou can also threaten them with STAB attacks. Thunder's extra power allows it to force out RestTalk Zapdos more easily and comes with a crucial 30% paralysis chance, which can help it cripple opposing Raikou and Grass-types such as Exeggutor. However, Thunderbolt is more reliable, especially against foes that can significantly threaten it in return such as Growth Vaporeon. Hidden Power Water and Ice are used to hit Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak as they switch in. Hidden Power Water has the additional benefit of hitting Golem and Rhydon 4x effectively as well as dealing super effective damage to Steelix, but leaves Raikou without an option to hit Exeggutor, requires Raikou to use a lower HP DV, and slightly reduces Raikou's ability to reliably take out Zapdos. Alternatively, Reflect can be used to halve the damage from physical sweepers such as Snorlax, Marowak, and Heracross, making it easier to switch out to a counter or safely burn sleep turns. Reflect will also greatly benefit Snorlax trying to set up Belly Drum, but without Hidden Power, Raikou will be unable to threaten Exeggutor and Ground-types, so a coverage attack is generally recommended. Rest is in the fourth slot to keep Raikou healthy. Status, especially paralysis, will still be a pain, and without Sleep Talk, Raikou will be unable to threaten any foes until it wakes up. Raikou also has the option of reducing its Speed EVs in order to prevent faster foes such as opposing Raikou with maximum Speed from phazing it, even while it's asleep, as phazing moves require the user to move second in order to work. However, this leaves it at risk of losing to Starmie with Substitute and potentially Nightmare, which it would usually perform well against due to having equal Speed. It's also worth noting that while the EVs listed will allow Raikou to outspeed Gengar, they will have equal Speed when they're both paralyzed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raikou is easily one of the best offensive phazers in OU. With Spikes support, it will easily rack up damage from forced switches and offensive pressure. Cloyster makes a great partner because it has Spikes, super effective STAB against most Ground-types, high Defense, and Explosion to open holes in the opponent's team. Forretress is a less solid teammate because of its lesser ability to check Ground-types, but it is better geared towards providing long-term Spikes support for Raikou. Both Skarmory and Suicune are excellent phazing partners. Skarmory's high Defense, Ground immunity, and ability to wall Snorlax complement Raikou's strong special bulk and ability to damage some of Skarmory's key checks, namely Zapdos. Suicune offers great mixed bulk and can blanket check foes with strong coverage, such as Nidoking and Tyranitar. Raikou, Suicune, and Skarmory form a potent defensive combo that few threats will be able to break through. Raikou is a common target of Explosion users such as Gengar, Cloyster, and Exeggutor, but its high Speed and strong damage output keep them at bay. However, this makes Raikou especially vulnerable to paralysis and other status conditions. Without Sleep Talk, it really appreciates Heal Bell support to remove sleep from Rest. Miltank is arguably the best choice as a Heal Bell user, since it boasts high Defense and instant recovery in Milk Drink.</p>"
        },
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With its excellent base 115 Speed, Raikou is the second fastest Pokemon in OU behind Jolteon. This means that Raikou will almost always have a chance to hammer the opponent before they can fire back. Incredibly fast recovery in Rest and the ability to continue attacking opponents with Thunder once asleep make Raikou a potent tank. Rather than phazing common special threats, this set aims to maximize Raikou's great tanking ability. This Raikou set will also prevent Skarmory, Starmie, and Suicune from phazing, or spinning in Starmie's case. Switching into this set can be tricky, as Raikou can hit hard twice before foes can even move. The choice of using Thunder or Thunderbolt comes down to the classic argument of accuracy versus raw power. Thunderbolt will provide more consistency but Thunder will provide the power necessary to muscle through tanks such as Zapdos. The paralysis chance from Thunder is beneficial in general, but its low accuracy and PP are a pain, especially in longer matches. Hidden Power Ice provides reliable damage against Zapdos and super effective coverage against Exeggutor, Ground-types, and Dragonite. However, Hidden Power Water will hit certain Ground-types such as Golem, Steelix, and Rhydon much harder. One side note regarding Hidden Power Waterâ€”the DV drop from using Water over Ice will cause many moves to KO Raikou more quickly. For example, Gengar will OHKO Hidden Power Water Raikou more often with Explosion and Snorlax will 2HKO it more often with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raikou is a powerful tank, but there are a few threats it has trouble beating, namely Snorlax, Quagsire, and Steelix. Whirlwind Skarmory makes a great Snorlax check and has defensive synergy with Raikou. Suicune provides additional support against any pesky Ground-types and mixed attackers. Sleep Talk allows Raikou to avoid the downtime that prevents Roar Raikou from fitting well on offensive lineups, so offensive teammates are also welcome. Using RestTalk Raikou to check Zapdos on an offensive team can free up Snorlax from some of its defensive duties, making it more effective with offensive sets such as Curse + Earthquake or even Self-Destruct or Belly Drum. A set such as Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax can eliminate Skarmory for Curse Heracross, which can also withstand Ground-type attacks aimed at Raikou. Not only does Exeggutor resist Earthquake and heavily threaten all Ground-types, it also has Explosion to remove Snorlax for Raikou, making it a fantastic teammate. Golem can check Snorlax with Roar and Explosion as well as use Rapid Spin to remove Spikes. The paralysis rate from Thunder can help out slower attackers such as Marowak and Rhydon. Physical threats such as these will also give Raikou's team an option against opposing Raikou and Blissey. Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress is also nice, as the additional damage against threats like Exeggutor and Ground-types is very welcome.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Entei's main function in GSC is to break through the opposing team's defenses with its powerful sun-boosted Fire Blast and complementary Solar Beam. Unlike its more powerful Fire-type competitor Moltres, Entei is quite bulky, has no Electric weakness, and has base 100 Speed, which makes it possible for it to defeat Zapdos and Raikou, two of the best Pokemon in the tier. Unfortunately, even with sun up, Entei fails to land the crucial guaranteed 3HKO on Snorlax that Moltres can achieve. Additionally, Moltres's immunity to Ground gives it a chance to defeat Nidoking and allows it to destroy most Steelix sets, whereas Entei struggles to switch in.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A RestTalk set with Rest / Sleep Talk / Sunny Day / Fire Blast can function as a durable attacker that performs as an excellent answer to Gengar, Exeggutor, and Jynx due to not fearing status from them, and it can separate itself from Moltres with its better bulk and Electric neutrality, letting Entei have a better time against Electric-types. However, Moltres still mostly outclasses this set due to its significantly higher Special Attack which lets it 3HKO Snorlax under sun, as well its Ground immunity which gives it immunity to Spikes and allows it to handle Ground-types better. Additionally, this set's lack of coverage makes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar, Vaporeon, and Rhydon significantly more dangerous.</p> <p>Roar can replace Hidden Power Fighting to allow Entei to gradually wear down its counters with Spikes support, and it is especially useful if the opponent has many Fire-weak Pokemon on the same team.  Unfortunately, Roar has poor synergy with Sunny Day, and the removal of Hidden Power Fighting makes it more difficult to take down Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Houndoom. Entei's Fire typing also lacks useful resistances and gives it weaknesses to common types in Ground and Water, so it's not a very good user of Roar despite its good bulk. Entei can use Charcoal to usually 3HKO Snorlax with sun-boosted Fire Blast, but losing Leftovers recovery means Entei becomes less durable; notably, it is 2HKOed by Zapdos's Thunder after Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's incredible HP and great Special Defense leave Entei incapable of doing any significant damage even under sun, while Curse can make Hidden Power Fighting too weak to threaten Snorlax. Snorlax can also take Entei down with Earthquake or STAB-boosted Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite's great bulk and resistance to all of Entei's coverage moves leave Entei completely incapable of getting past it, and Dragonite can paralyze Entei with Thunder Wave to try to defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: With the notable exception of Cloyster, Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, Thunder Wave Starmie, and Tentacruel pose serious threats to Entei. Vaporeon can heal any damage taken with Rest and use Entei as setup fodder. However, Entei can still possibly take down Vaporeon with Solar Beam, especially if Vaporeon switches in on Sunny Day and is asleep. Tentacruel is similar to Vaporeon in that it is able to use Entei as setup fodder, but it is especially notable in that it is neutral to Solar Beam and resists Hidden Power Fighting, which leaves Entei completely incapable of doing anything to it. Starmie can paralyze Entei with Thunder Wave and stall out sun turns with Recover. If sun has not been set up, Quagsire can threaten Entei with its STAB-boosted Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Marowak and Nidoking can switch in on Sunny Day, survive a sun-boosted Fire Blast, and threaten to maim Entei with Earthquake. Specifically, Marowak has a high chance to OHKO it, and Nidoking can 2HKO it. Nidoking is notable in that it has Lovely Kiss to put Entei to sleep, letting it easily beat Entei. If sun has not been set up or Entei does not have Solar Beam, Rhydon and Golem will crush it, since they resist Fire Blast and take little from Hidden Power Fighting. If sun has been set up, however, Solar Beam easily dispatches the two.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Status Spreaders</strong>: Bulky Pokemon with status-inducing moves such as Blissey, Suicune, Umbreon, and Porygon2 can easily stall out both Entei and Sunny Day. Specifically, Blissey, Umbreon, and Suicune can use Toxic against Entei and then heal off damage, although Suicune and Blissey are likely to be 3HKOed by Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fighting, so they aren't completely consistent. Moonlight Umbreon is notable in that its recovery move is strengthened by Sunny Day, which makes it easier for it to wall Entei. Porygon2 can use Thunder Wave to paralyze Entei and stall it out with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Charizard and Moltres</strong>: Charizard and Moltres resist Fire Blast along with all of Entei's coverage. Charizard can take Entei down with Earthquake, and Moltres outdamages Entei and often runs RestTalk. These Pokemon can also take advantage of sun if Entei sets it up.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Sunny Day": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sunny Day boosts the power of Fire Blast and allows Solar Beam to charge instantly while weakening Water-type attacks and lowering the accuracy of Thunder to 50%, giving Entei the advantage against Zapdos and Raikou. Fire Blast hits common threats like Exeggutor, Steelix, Forretress, and Jynx. Solar Beam beats Pokemon like Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire that would otherwise wall Entei while usually 3HKOing Water-types, which gives it a better matchup against them than Moltres. Hidden Power Fighting has a very high chance of 2HKOing Tyranitar and a decent chance of 4HKOing Snorlax, which means if the latter is forced to Rest without a Curse boost and doesn't have Sleep Talk, it can't safely burn sleep turns against Entei because it risks eventually being taken out by a critical hit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Exeggutor is a good partner for its Ground and Water resistances and lack of weakness to Rock. Exeggutor can also spread status and use Explosion on threats Entei dislikes such as Snorlax and Water-types. Spikes support is very useful for Entei, as it helps compensate for its somewhat underwhelming damage output; thus, Cloyster and Forretress are valuable teammates. Raikou and Snorlax are helpful if Entei is against a Water- or Electric-type without sun up, as they are bulky enough to switch into many Water- or Electric-type Pokemon and take them down with STAB or coverage attacks. Machamp, especially Fire Blast variants, forms a good offensive core with Entei, as sun helps Machamp with many of its typical checks such as Zapdos, Suicune, Starmie without Psychic, Heracross, and Skarmory, and Machamp can also check Snorlax and Tyranitar and lure in Pokemon like Skarmory and Exeggutor so Entei can set up sun. Nidoking can lure in Entei's checks such as Zapdos, Snorlax, and Water-types and put them to sleep with Lovely Kiss or take away their Leftovers with Thief so they become less reliable in checking Entei; most notably, Snorlax has a harder time checking Entei if it has been put to sleep or has its Leftovers taken away. Nidoking is also a solid check to Tyranitar if it's not running Earthquake or much less common coverage moves like Surf and Ice Beam. Other Fire-types like Charizard, Houndoom, and Moltres greatly appreciate Entei's ability to set up sun, since it boosts their Fire-type STAB moves, and Entei can help overwhelm checks they have in common.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Suicune is one of the best blanket check Pokemon in the GSC OU metagame, using its impressive defensive stats to check many threats such as non-Curse Snorlax, Nidoking, Marowak, Tyranitar, and Charizard. Suicune's lack of physical weaknesses makes it great against most physical attackers, and it also fares quite well against mixed attackers, as they are typically vulnerable to Toxic when dropping Rest for status moves or coverage attacks. It will sometimes draw comparisons to other Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Starmie. However, while Vaporeon can also run a RestTalk set, its lack of physical bulk means it is a far inferior wall and should instead focus on setting up with Growth. Starmie is very effective and versatile with Rapid Spin, a resistance to Fighting, Recover, and even STAB Psychic for Gengar. STAB Thunder OHKOes it, however, and status greatly hinders it unless there is Heal Bell support. Also, since Suicune's combination of Surf and Toxic hinders almost every Pokemon in the metagame, it has a surprising offensive presence of its own for such a defensive Pokemon. However, the prevalence of RestTalk Zapdos and Raikou limits its offensive potential and often relegates it to a defensive role.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat Suicune can withstand even powerful special attacks like Thunder from Zapdos and OHKO it in return. However, this comes at the cost of most of Suicune's health and requires it to be healthy. Additionally, it decreases Suicune's effectiveness against physical attackers and foes such as Cloyster. This compromises its usefulness on defensive teams; however, if appearing among offensive teammates, Suicuneâ€™s presence may trigger increased caution from an opponent. Overall, using Mirror Coat is costly but can be worthwhile. Another option is to use RestTalk and Roar together. Overall, this tends to decrease Suicune's effectiveness against most foes, as Roar replaces a coverage or status move and fails when called by Sleep Talk against a slower foe, but the set could work for teams in need of a status-absorbing, phazing bulky Water-type.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is the greatest threat to Suicune, easily 2HKOing it with its powerful Thunder. RestTalk Zapdos can easily deal with Toxic Suicune, and its Spikes immunity means that it won't take consistent damage while switching in. While Ice Beam does 3HKO Zapdos, Suicune must risk a lot to attempt a KO. Non-RestTalk Zapdos can also take advantage of Suicune being forced out to paralyze its checks with Thunder Wave or rack up Spikes damage with Roar or Whirlwind, although it must beware of Toxic if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Raikou</strong>: Raikou 2HKOes Zapdos with Thunder and Thunderbolt, whereas Suicune cannot even 4HKO it in return. RestTalk variants have virtually nothing to fear from Suicune, as they can easily cure themselves of poison. However, Roar variants fear Toxic, as they can be taken advantage of by Suicune's teammates when forced to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel is not as common as Zapdos or Raikou, but it is one of the greatest threats to RestTalk Suicune. Its immunity to Toxic and high Special Defense allow it to switch in with impunity and set up Swords Dance or Substitute. However, Roar variants of Suicune, while still not able to harm Tentacruel, can readily prevent it from setting up. Rapid Spin variants can easily remove Spikes against Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: While Suicune is a common initial switch-in to Snorlax, it primarily serves to scout without having to send in a more passive Pokemon such as Skarmory. Taking Toxic puts Snorlax in the undesirable position of having to use Rest, and even a +1 Double-Edge generally can't bring Suicune dangerously low. However, in the long run, and especially if Spikes is on Suicune's side of the field, Snorlax has chances to KO with a critical hit Double-Edge or set up Curse or Belly Drum while it's sleeping. Roar Suicune is capable of preventing setup temporarily, but, as with RestTalk + Toxic Suicune, Snorlax has the advantage in the long run. It also completely dominates Suicune with neither Roar nor Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Growth Sweepers</strong>: Espeon and Vaporeon can break through Suicune's bulk by setting up with Growth. Suicune's Surf is only a 4HKO on Espeon, and Espeon can potentially 3HKO with +1 Psychic, heal off Surf damage with Morning Sun, block Toxic with Substitute, and use Baton Pass to send Special Attack boosts to a teammate. Vaporeon takes a pittance from Surf and usually has Rest to heal itself of Toxic or Baton Pass to pass Special Attack boosts to a teammate. At +5 Special Attack, Vaporeon can 3HKO Suicune with Surf. However, if Suicune has Roar, Vaporeon cannot use Suicune as setup fodder or achieve anything offensively until it is the last remaining Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor fears Toxic and Ice Beam from Suicune, it takes little from Surf and can regain any lost health with Giga Drain if Suicune stays in. Giga Drain has a solid chance of 3HKOing Suicune, which makes it risky for Suicune to stay in and fight. If Suicune is its team's primary status absorber, this can cause problems, as being forced to switch lets Exeggutor cripple its teammates. Explosion also does huge damage to Suicune, which could pave the way for a Rock-, Ground-, or Fire-type to wreak havoc.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is quite annoying for Suicune, as it is one of the few Toxic-immune Pokemon that has an advantageous matchup. Its Thunder or Thunderbolt always 3HKOes Suicune, and the threat of Thief, Hypnosis, and Explosion targeting either Suicune or its teammates makes it risky to deal with. A full health Suicune can, however, take one hit from Gengar safely and hit it for substantial damage in return with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Explosion and Self-Destruct</strong>: While Suicune's bulk lets it withstand all but the strongest of attacks, Pokemon with Explosion and Self-Destruct can instantly KO it with minimal chip damage or bring it to very low health. Exeggutor, Golem, Gengar, Cloyster, Forretress, Steelix, Snorlax, and Muk all pose serious threats to Suicune for this reason. With Suicune out of the picture, threats like Charizard, Nidoking, Tyranitar, Marowak, Moltres, and Dragonite can easily get out of hand, so Suicune should tread carefully when facing the aforementioned threats. It should pay close attention to what teammates appear alongside them to determine whether its health can be risked.</p> <p><strong>Thief</strong>: Thief is dangerous to Suicune's usual defensive teams, so it is important to be generally wary when against common Thief users, such as Nidoking, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Gengar, and try to determine which teammate's item is least critical in that particular game. If Suicune's Leftovers are stolen, it will be much less effective at checking foes such as Snorlax, Machamp, and Nidoking, especially if Spikes are on the field.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Defensive Tank": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is designed to wall some offensive threats and threaten them in return with powerful attacks and Toxic. +6 Return from Snorlax and +2 Earthquake from Marowak never OHKO it, unboosted Double-Edge from Snorlax never 3HKOes it, and +1 critical hit Cross Chop from Machamp only OHKOes it 10.3% of the time. Suicune is a wall, to be sure, but it is surprisingly challenging to switch into without entering a disadvantageous position. Its ability to threaten Steel- and Ground-types and its general offensive presence distinguish it from other defensive wallsâ€”most notably Umbreon, which it often draws comparisons to.</p> <p>Suicune is perhaps the best Toxic spreader in GSC OU. Toxic deters threats that lack Rest, such as phazing Zapdos and Cloyster, and it is even problematic for Curse Snorlax, which will be forced to use Rest not long after it becomes poisoned. Additionally, the combination of Toxic and a Water-type move is effective against almost all Pokemon in the metagame, especially those that lack RestTalk. The only notable exception is Tentacruel. Landing Toxic on integral Pokemon like Starmie and Cloyster can make an enormous difference in determining whether your team can keep Spikes up. Additionally, spreading poison on an opposing team in tandem with Roar or Whirlwind from Suicune itself or a teammate, such as Raikou, Zapdos, or Skarmory, makes for a nasty combination to inflict passive damage consistently.</p> <p>However, Ice Beam can replace Toxic for a few good reasons: hitting Grass-types such as Exeggutor hard, hitting Zapdos and Dragonite hard, and taking advantage of Suicune's longevity to possibly inflict freezes, which are immensely crippling in GSC. Additionally, Ice Beam gives a 2/3 chance for Suicune to get an offensive move when using Sleep Talk. This is especially helpful to contend with Pokemon that threaten stall teams like Nidoking and Marowak. However, dropping Toxic makes Suicune setup fodder for Cloyster and Snorlax, which are two of the most common Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p>Sleep Talk prevents foes from having free turns while Suicune is sleeping and lets Suicune effectively absorb sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon like Jynx, Nidoking, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. It is especially crucial for Nidoking, whose Lovely Kiss is standard on many sets, Thunder usually 3HKOes Suicune, and Thief threatens to substantially reduce Suicune's longevity. Alternatively, Roar can prevent offensive Pokemon like Vaporeon and Snorlax from boosting, and, in tandem with Toxic, wear them down over time. Roar can make Suicune a threatening force if paired with Spikes support, particularly since so much of the metagame struggles against the combination of Toxic and Surf. However, without Sleep Talk, Suicune's inevitable Rest will provide free turns to dangerous foes such as Marowak and Nidoking, against which it is usually the first line of defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raikou is the best check to Zapdos and Raikou, which are very powerful and present threats to Suicune. In return, Suicune can easily withstand any attacks from Ground-types. An option to consider is RestTalk Raikou, which lets it continuously impact the game while still handling Zapdos and Raikou. Raikou can also give a team more offense through powerful attacks and Roar alongside Spikes support. Once Suicune poisons Pokemon like Snorlax and Raikou, Raikou can later catch them on the switch with Roar, stacking Spikes and poison damage without letting them recover. Raikou also threatens every Spikes-immune Pokemon, racking up switches and passive damage.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is desirable with Suicune, as consistent damage via Spikes can leave it worn down quickly against dangerous foes such as Nidoking, Marowak, and Rhydon. Golem is one of the most reliable spinners, as its STAB Earthquake deters spinblockers from switching in. It can also absorb numerous attacks from non-Earthquake Snorlax and threaten foes such as Zapdos with Explosion. Cloyster and Forretress can set Spikes to help Suicune and its team create longer term pressure. However, Cloyster and Suicune stack an Electric weakness, which can be dangerous against common offensive combinations such as Gengar + Zapdos. Forretress is immune to Toxic and has a useful defensive typing against Snorlax and Explosion users, but it can struggle to safely remove Spikes against spinblockers and is specially frail. A Ghost-type in Misdreavus or Gengar can spinblock to preserve Spikes and nullify Explosions that are aimed at Suicune, which becomes easier when Suicune has poisoned the Explosion user. Non-Roar Suicune sets will appreciate a phazer teammate, such as Raikou, Golem, Skarmory, or Zapdos, to increase Spikes damage, deal with boosted Curse Snorlax, and avoid being trapped by Mean Look Umbreon or Misdreavus. Skarmory also provides excellent defensive coverage against the most physically powerful foes, including Belly Drum Snorlax, Curse + Earthquake Snorlax, and Curse Heracross, and it serves as a backup check to Marowak and Machamp.</p> <p>Miltank is another good Suicune partner. While Suicune is excellent at dealing with Snorlax without Curse, it can struggle against Curse variants. Using Toxic against Curse Snorlax often works in the short term, as this compels it to use Rest; however, in the long run, Suicune is not able to endure Snorlax's boosted moves. To address this, Miltank's Growl can counteract Curse and stall Snorlax out of PP. Moreover, unlike Skarmory, Miltank can take on Curse Snorlax that have Fire- or Electric-type coverage. It also provides excellent support via Hell Bell. This is particularly helpful if Suicune lacks Sleep Talk. Blissey is another good Heal Bell support option, and unlike Miltank, it can fend off Pokemon with powerful special attacks like Zapdos.</p> <p>For a more balanced team, Nidoking can provide the needed offensive prowess. Its immunity to Electric makes it a good pivot against Zapdos and Raikou, which can help teammates such as Snorlax and Raikou avoid taking a hit and potential paralysis from Thunder. Nidoking's Thief can also cripple a key foe limiting Suicune such as Zapdos or Snorlax.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Weezing is among the tier's most viable tanks, as its naturally high bulk and access to powerful moves such as Sludge Bomb, Fire Blast, and Thunder make it an unpredictable threat that is hard to deal with. Furthermore, its access to Explosion makes it a literal time bomb, granting it the ability to take down threats with it that might be otherwise unable to defend against or to target its own checks to open up the opponent's defenses for its teammates. Its Poison typing is a blessing and a curse, as Weezing can take advantage of the common presence of Fighting-types like Primeape and Hitmonlee, but it is extremely susceptible to the top threat Xatu's STAB Psychic. Weezing's primary STAB move in Sludge Bomb has a high chance of inflicting poison, which can punish many checks that try to switch into it, such as Xatu, Dugtrio, and Sudowoodo, by setting them on a timer. Thunder similarly has a high chance of inflicting paralysis, which makes Weezing even harder to switch into safely. On top of this, it lands a guaranteed 2HKO on Xatu and also hits bulky Water-types hard.</p> <p>The last move depends on whichever benefit the player would like to have: greater coverage, the ability to stop opposing Pokemon from setting up, or longevity. Fire Blast threatens to KO Pineco from full and becomes guaranteed with any slight chip, preventing it from safely setting up Spikes. Fire Blast also lands an OHKO on Magnemite and does massive damage to Gloom, which can otherwise freely paralyze Weezing with Stun Spore or repeatedly use Curse and force Weezing to sacrifice itself with Explosion to take Gloom out. The combination of Sludge Bomb and Thunder tends to leave Weezing open for Ground- and Rock-types such as Dugtrio and Sudowoodo to come in and threaten it with Earthquake, so Weezing can opt for Hidden Power Water, which hits both for significant damage and OHKOes Graveler, but it comes at the cost of some bulk due to DV requirements. Haze nullifies any attempt at setting up and can shut down a potential sweep from any setup sweeper, such as Wigglytuff, Dunsparce, or Meditate Primeape. Lastly, not having any instant recovery moves can leave Weezing in a difficult spot when repeatedly switching into attacks, especially with Spikes down. Thus, Pain Split is a viable option, since it is the only instant recovery move that Weezing learns and can help to prolong the period of time before it is forced to use Explosion.</p> <p>Some of the Pokemon that benefit the most from having Weezing as a teammate are those that like to have Xatu removed by Explosion, such as Primeape, Hitmonlee, and other Xatu. Primeape, in turn, can threaten the majority of the slower, more defensive Pokemon that Weezing struggles to deal with, such as Pupitar and Sudowoodo. Primeape also threatens Normal-types, especially ones that give Weezing a hard time like Stantler and Wigglytuff, with Stantler having Earthquake and Wigglytuff being able to Curse up and force Weezing to explode on it rather than a different Pokemon like Xatu.  Defensive Pokemon such as Dewgong and Sudowoodo fear the presence of Primeape on the opposing team and benefit greatly from Weezing's solid matchup against it. Dewgong is also a phenomenal switch into Xatu, taking little from its attacks and hitting back hard with Ice Beam while staying healthy with RestTalk. Water- and Grass-types like Octillery or Gloom with a Grass move can threaten Ground- and Rock-types like Dugtrio and Sudowoodo, which are otherwise solid switch-ins to Weezing as if they avoid poison from Sludge Bomb they can comfortably take Fire Blast and Thunder.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rati-who? Yeah... you know all those annoying rats that attack you in the grass of RBY and GSC? This is the evolution of those things. I will admit, Raticate sees almost zero playing time because it's quite frankly not all that good. Its typing is not unique (in fact it is one of the most common), all of its stats are really subpar or borderline average, and its movepool isn't exactly something to drool over when compared to others on Pokemon with better stats. However, there is hope for this cool-looking rodent yet. Super Fang puts huge dents all over the place, which is hard to do with UU teams that go up against OU teams. Raticate makes a decent UU lead with its Speed, and it can steal fun stuff like Spikes and Sleep Powder with Mimic. It's definitely not the best Normal-type of the bunch, but it is somewhat cool and usually very unexpected. Plus it can always wave around the fact that it can 2HKO Blissey.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>You can also generalize Raticate a bit more and follow the format of Super Fang; a STAB move of choice such as Return, Frustration, or Double-Edge; Shadow Ball; and filler that works with the moves above. You can always use Hyper Beam after Raticate strips the foe of half its health with Super Fang, but don't really expect a guaranteed OHKO. An Endure + Reversal set isn't promising, but it's there for its other options. Thief, Toxic, and Screech give Raticate that element of surprise, but just using Raticate is already surprising, and Super Fang is a much bigger hindrance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There's so many, to be honestâ€“Raticate's weak defensive stats make anything an easy kill. Any strong attacker hits Raticate hard. The move Counter is always something fun to use against Raticate... Pokemon like Nidoking can't OHKO Raticate with Earthquake, but they can if they use Counter after Raticate's Super Fang.</p>",
      "sets": {"Super Fang": {"description": "<p>Super Fang makes Raticate worth using. Raticate has a lot of Speed, so on the first turn it can come out and set up a Substitute against certain other leads. If it's a Spikes user, Raticate can pick up Spikes with Mimic and proceed to set them up itself. If Raticate just avoided a Toxic or Thunder Wave, or better yet a Sleep Powder, while setting up Substitute, throw that status move right back at the foe with Mimic. Body Slam is on the set because Speed is important when toying around with Substitute, and there are a lot of threats out there just barely faster than Raticate with its annoying base 97 Speed.</p>"}}

  "Fearow": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Fearow is one of the deadliest Pokemon in the tier, with its solid Attack and scarcely-resisted STAB Double-Edge allowing it to deal massive damage to most foes. Its amazing Speed lets it revenge kill the likes of Xatu and Primeape while making it harder to revenge kill. Its Speed also lets it use Rest before it gets KOed, allowing it to stay healthy over the course of the game. Fearow is elevated to a whole new level of danger with Spikes, allowing it to break bulky Pokemon like Dewgong even more easily. Fearow's Ground immunity also gives it an immunity to opposing Spikes, which gives it immense longevity while also allowing it to check Dugtrio in a pinch and punish RestTalk Stantler for using Rest.</p> <p>However, Rock-types hinder Fearow's effectiveness, as it struggles to hurt them much. Graveler in particular is a big problem for Fearow, as it receives relatively free entry and spins away the Spikes Fearow loves so much. Fearow relies heavily on its teammates to wear down or lure Rock-types. Its weaknesses to Ice and Electric also hinder its defensive utility, especially against Xatu, which uses either Hidden Power Electric or Ice, and Octillery, which uses either Hidden Power Electric or Ice Beam, and guarantees both of them good Sleep Talk rolls versus it. This also makes it unable to switch into Dewgong, Weezing, Chinchou, and Magnemite, which other Normal-type RestTalk users such as Stantler and Wigglytuff are often tasked with doing. Double-Edge recoil also adds up quickly, meaning that Fearow often gets put into KO range of many attacks quite quickly. All of these factors mean that, despite its massive threat potential, Fearow is slightly harder to fit onto a team than other Normal-types.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wallbreaker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Fearow's primary STAB move, dealing massive damage to foes that don't resist it. Despite the recoil, its extra power over Return is very important. For example, Double-Edge has around a 50% chance to 2HKO Hidden Power Electric Octillery with Spikes up, while Return only has a 5.3% chance to do the same. Drill Peck lets Fearow revenge kill Primeape, hit Grass-types very hard, and attack when it's afraid of recoil. Drill Peck also 2HKOes Pineco, not giving it easy Spikes. This is a unique trait for a Normal-type, as every other Normal-type can only 3HKO Pineco at best. Fearow's Sleep Talk rolls are one of the most consistent in the tier, as both attacking moves threaten the same Pokemon. RestTalk keeps Fearow alive over the course of a game, mitigates Double-Edge recoil, and makes it less afraid of status. Fearow's Speed and Spikes immunity means RestTalk gives it significant longevity and lets it deal damage over the course of a battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pineco is a very important teammate for Fearow, as it sets up the Spikes that wear down Fearow's checks. Toxic, Giga Drain, or Hidden Power Water on Pineco lets it lure in and cripple Graveler and Pupitar, making them unable to switch into Fearow over the course of a game. Pokemon that can lure in and wear down Rock-types can also make it easier for Fearow to break through them. Since Rock-types rarely run Rest, Weezing is good at weakening them for Fearow. It can poison Rock-types with Sludge Bomb or even lure them in and deal massive damage with Hidden Power Water. Its Explosion can also make it easier for Fearow to break through Rock-types or bulky Pokemon like Wigglytuff. Wigglytuff can set up with Curse and whittle Graveler down with repeated attacks, potentially even paralyzing it if using Body Slam, quickly forcing Graveler to use Explosion. Wigglytuff can force Sudowoodo in and repeatedly use Curse, getting into a Curse war with Sudowoodo. Eventually, Wigglytuff forces Sudowoodo to use Self-Destruct, due to Sudowoodo being worn down by repeated attacks and not 3HKOing Wigglytuff back. It also switches into Dewgong nicely, a threat many Fearow teams struggle to switch into. Octillery is important to switch into Graveler and Sudowoodo and threaten them out with Surf, while it appreciates Fearow's ability to take advantage of Grass-types. If the opponent chooses to use Explosion on Octillery with their Rock-type, they will leave their team wide open to Fearow. Pokemon that take advantage of Spikes such as Xatu, Dugtrio, and Stantler can form a formidable offensive core with Fearow, either breaking holes for it to clean up or cleaning up after it blows a hole in the opposing team.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Return is an option over Drill Peck to give Fearow more favorable Sleep Talk pulls against neutral targets while also being a better attack to throw around if it can't afford recoil damage. However, Fearow becomes much worse at revenge killing Primeape and Hitmonlee, one of its most unique and valuable traits over other Normal-types. Return also makes it worse against Pineco and leaves it walled by the admittedly rare Gastly. Hidden Power Ground lets Fearow more directly make progress against the Rock-types and especially Magnemite, but it means Fearow lacks Drill Peck to revenge kill Primeape and Hitmonlee and lowers its HP and Attack DVs, also generally making it far more vulnerable when sleeping due to Hidden Power Ground being a terrible Sleep Talk roll. A 3 attacks set with Substitute and Hidden Power Ground gives Fearow maximum coverage while also scouting switch-ins; however, the lack of RestTalk severely lowers its defensive utility and makes it far too vulnerable to being worn down by Double-Edge recoil.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Graveler switches in and spins away Fearow's team's Spikes, making it difficult for Fearow to wear it down long-term. Sudowoodo is more physically bulky than Graveler and can break holes in Fearow's team with Curse and Self-Destruct, but it can't spin away Fearow's team's Spikes, so it's slightly easier to chip down. Pupitar is frailer than Graveler and can't spin away Spikes, but it's still only 5HKOed and is more threatening offensively, since it outruns Octillery. The rare Shuckle struggles to deal immediate damage to Fearow, but it completely walls Fearow while PP stalling it with Defense Curl.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: Magnemite resists Double-Edge and can scare Fearow away with Thunder. However, its poor HP means it's vulnerable to being pushed into 2HKO range after taking just one Double-Edge after Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong</strong>: Dewgong only gets 3HKOed by Double-Edge, can severely damage Fearow with Ice Beam, and can stay alive with RestTalk. However, it's vulnerable to getting chipped down by Spikes and doesn't OHKO Fearow from high health, meaning it's often forced to use Rest after switching in.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Although Weezing does not resist Double-Edge, its bulk lets it only get 4HKOed by Fearow without Spikes, and it can threaten Fearow out with Thunder or Explosion afterwards. RestTalk, although rare on Weezing, also makes it much sturdier against Fearow if used. However, Weezing is 3HKOed with Spikes on the field, still takes a lot of damage without Spikes, and is slower than Fearow.</p>"

Its +2 Earthquake is capable of 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, even bulky Pokemon such as Blastoise and Slowbro. Its Ground typing and great Defense also allow it to come into common Pokemon such as Ampharos and Scyther. Unfortunately, it is on the slow side, lacks reliable recovery, and doesn't have very good Special Defense, meaning it requires careful play or support from teammates.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If Sandslash wishes to spread its own paralysis, Body Slam is an option over Substitute, although generally teammates should provide paralysis support due to Sandslash's frailty and Body Slam's unreliability. Protect is an option over Substitute for maintaining health and avoiding certain KOs. Counter is an odd option that can be useful against Scyther and its Swords Dance + Baton Pass recipients, as well as Granbull. It should be noted that Sandslash has access to Rapid Spin, but its illegality with Swords Dance, combined with Sandslash generally being outclassed in this role by Blastoise and Graveler, makes it a mediocre option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bellossom and Jumpluff</strong>: Bellossom resists Earthquake and is bulky enough to avoid the 2HKO from Rock Slide while 2HKOing Sandslash with its STAB moves. However, it should watch out for Hidden Power Bug. Jumpluff can switch into Earthquake, Substitute, and Swords Dance and lock Sandslash into those undesirable moves with Encore or status it. A healthy Jumpluff especially is one of the best Sandslash answers.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: RestTalk Bulky Water-types, especially Blastoise and Slowbro, match up well against Sandslash due to their ability to threaten 2HKOs against it. Blastoise can also remove its boosts with Haze. However, Sandslash can break through them if they are paralyzed. Feraligatr and Gyarados also work as more offensive Sandslash checks, as Gyarados is immune to Earthquake and both threaten a 2HKO with Hydro Pump, but both have less longevity and have trouble fitting Rest.</p> <p><strong>Gligar</strong>: Gligar is one of the best Sandslash answers due to its Earthquake immunity and neutrality to Rock Slide, as well as good physical bulk and Counter to fend off boosted Rock Slides. Gligar also outspeeds Sandslash and almost always breaks its Substitute with Earthquake.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake is Sandslash's best STAB move and can hit Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Ampharos, and Haunter for super effective damage. Rock Slide is mandatory for hitting Flying-types, such as Scyther, Dodrio, Gyarados, and Jumpluff, while also hitting Pinsir. Swords Dance lets Sandslash 2HKO almost the entire metagame after a single boost, notably including Slowbro and Granbull. Lastly, Substitute works especially well with paralysis support, letting Sandslash fish for full paralysis. It also works well against foes that might try to pivot around Sandslash's attacks, as well as Counter Gligar and Toxic Crobat. Substitute also improves Sandslash's odds of breaking through Water-types using Sleep Talk. Alternatively, Hidden Power Bug hits Bellossom, which otherwise is a great answer to Sandslash, but it is limited beyond that.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Paralysis support is incredibly useful due to Sandslash's low Speed and benefit from a potential free setup turn, meaning Pokemon such as Jumpluff, Mr. Mime, and Hypno pair well with Sandslash. Jumpluff and Mr. Mime can both use Encore to let Sandslash switch in for free, and Hypno can support it with Light Screen and Reflect. Other setup sweepers such as Scyther, Pinsir, and Kabutops can be paired alongside Sandslash for an offensive assault that can be tough to wall for defensive teams, especially when supported by screens. Slowking, Chansey, and Hypno are useful teammates due to their good special bulk and ability to take Water-type attacks aimed at Sandslash. They also reinforce its strengths; Hypno and Slowking provide more consistency against Nidoqueen, and Chansey does the same against Electric-types. Scyther can support Sandslash by passing Swords Dance or Agility to it with Baton Pass. Electrode supports Sandslash well, as it can spread paralysis, set up screens, and use Explosion to provide Sandslash a free switch in. Bellossom can spread paralysis for Sandslash, sponge Water-type attacks, and notably lure in and paralyze Qwilfish. Ampharos can support Sandslash with screens or Thunder Wave and also switch into Water-types. Ampharos also lures in Nidoqueen, which can give Sandslash a setup opportunity if Nidoqueen lacks Lovely Kiss. Finally, Spikes support from Qwilfish maximizes the pressure that Sandslash exerts. Curse Qwilfish can also make progress against Blastoise if it tries to spin away Spikes.</p>"

Once its Attack is boosted, Sandslash can do some decent damage to many of the slow, tankish Pokemon that are often played in GSC. With paralysis support, this thing does usually pretty well.</p>",

Sand Attack is an option for annoyance purposes against walls like Skarmory who will attempt to Whirlwind Sandslash out. Counter is a cool move since it works on all types of Hidden Power, so a sweeper like Hidden Power Zapdos can get Countered for the KO since Sandslash has enough Special Defense to take the blow and still be usable. Sandslash could use Hidden Power Bug for Grass-types, but the hit would have to be on the switch. Sandslash can make some use of Rapid Spin but there are generally better Pokemon for this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Water-types, such as Quagsire, have good Defense with which to take Earthquake, and while Sandslash's Defense is great, its Special Defense is not. A strong Surf or Ice Beam will knock it out quickly. Grass-types like Meganium and Tangela are resistant to Earthquake and can also reply with super effective attacks.

    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Ninetales is a Pokemon with massive highs and deep lows. It is one of the best checks to Xatu, Weezing, and Magmar as it outspeeds all three, takes their attacks very well, and deals solid damage, especially to Weezing. Weezing in particular is one of the hardest Pokemon to switch into in the tier, so being one of the most reliable switch-ins to it is an incredible trait to have. Ninetales can 3HKO common offensive threats such as Xatu, Weezing, and Stantler with its STAB Flamethrower while crippling Water-type Pokemon with Sunny Day, or bulkier Pokemon with Toxic. Its amazing Speed lets it revenge kill Xatu and Primeape in a pinch, while also making it very easy to pull off a Rest. Ninetales's Flamethrower means that Pineco cannot take advantage of it while Resting, making it even easier for Ninetales to Rest and making it a solid lead to prevent early Spikes. Ninetales's Ice resistance and Electric neutrality also means that it stonewalls the likes of Magnenite, Dragonair, and BoltBeam Porygon, making it one of the best specially defensive Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p>However, while Ninetales is amazing against many of the tier's top threats, it's horrible against another: Octillery. Unlike other Pokemon weak to Water such as Graveler, Sudowoodo, Pupitar, Flareon, and even Rapidash, Ninetales struggles to deal any sort of immediate damage to Octillery, giving it free turns. Octillery is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier, and thudding against it is not an easy flaw to compensate for in the teambuilder. Ninetales is also easily revenge killed by Dugtrio, and is threatened greatly by Rock-types like Graveler as well. Ninetales also gives free switch-ins to Fire-types like Rapidash and Flareon, the latter of which is an especially bad threat to give free turns to, thanks to its wallbreaking and Baton Pass capabilities. While Ninetales is threatening to frailer targets, it struggles to threaten other bulky RestTalk Pokemon like Wigglytuff, Hitmonlee, and Dewgong. Ninetales also faces competition from the aforementioned Fire-types: Rapidash and RestTalk Flareon, which can threaten Octillery with their much stronger Double-Edge, with the latter even 3HKOing it. Rapidash is also fast enough to outrun and revenge kill Fearow.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Grass is Ninetales's strongest move to hit Octillery with, but it's still not that strong, gives it worse DVs, and gives it worse Sleep Talk rolls against Xatu. Hidden Power Electric rectifies the Xatu issue and has better DVs, but it's completely useless against Rock-types. Both Hidden Power options are also generally outclassed by the utility Sunny Day provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Octillery, Dewgong, and Chinchou consistently switch into Ninetales with minimal damage and turn it into an opportunity to fire off their dangerous attacks. However, Dewgong is directly beaten by Ninetales under sun, Chinchou is severely hampered by Surf being weakened and Thunder's accuracy being lowered, and Octillery's Surf is significantly weakened.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio outspeeds Ninetales and can revenge kill it if it is weakened. However, it does not enjoy switching into Flamethrower and is ruined by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Pupitar all takes Ninetales's Flamethrower easily and hit back hard with their STAB attacks. However, they all hate Toxic and the rarer Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Rapidash and Flareon</strong>: RestTalk Rapidash and RestTalk Flareon endlessly wall Ninetales while not being walled back thanks to their access to Double-Edge. Both can even take advantage of Ninetales's own sun. Growth pass Flareon can also use Ninetales as an opportunity to pass Growths provided it doesn't have Roar.</p> <p><strong>Wigglytuff</strong>: Wigglytuff easily shrugs off Ninetales's unboosted Flamethrowers and Toxics and can boost through Reflect with Curse. However, it's cleanly 3HKOed in sun.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Flamethrower is its main STAB move and is used over Fire Blast for the extra PP and perfect accuracy. Since Ninetales is primarly a defensive Pokemon, it values reliability more than power. Rest consistently keeps it healthy to check Xatu and Weezing, while Sleep Talk prevents it from letting in dangerous threats in for free while sleeping. The last move gives Ninetales more utility. Sunny Day severely weakens Octillery and Chinchou, allowing the likes of Pineco to set up Spikes on them or enabling Pokemon like Stantler and Wigglytuff to duel with it safely. Sunny Day also allows Ninetales to win the one-on-one against Dewgong instead of losing to it, neuters Thunder accuracy from the likes of Weezing, Primeape, and Chinchou; turns a 3HKO from Flamethrower against various Pokemon like Xatu, Fearow, and Stantler into a 2HKO; and lets it 3HKO Wigglytuff, which would otherwise set up Curse on it. Toxic can be used to force a Rest from Pokemon like Octillery, Dewgong, Flareon, and Rapidash, while completely ruining Porygon, Curse Light Screen Stantler, Dugtrio, Kingler, and Rock-types. Reflect lets Ninetales punish Pokemon like Dugtrio and Rock-types for switching in while also letting its team switch in more safely against many Pokemon, such as Fearow, Kingler, Stantler, and Wigglytuff.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that take advantage of Octillery are imperative to Ninetales's success. Grass-types like Gloom, Exeggcute, and Bayleef handle Hidden Power Electric variants of Octillery and Dugtrio, while appreciating Ninetales's ability to check Xatu and Weezing. The Grass-types especially enjoy Reflect from Ninetales, as it temporarily neuters threats they let in for free, such as Fearow, Stantler, and Wigglytuff. Octillery itself, when equipped with Hidden Power Electric, takes care of Ice Beam variants of Octillery, Rapidash, and Flareon, while appreciating Ninetales's ability to take care of Grass-types. Chinchou is the best punisher of Octillery, which also appreciates Reflect Ninetales keeping it safe against Dugtrio. Pokemon that check Dugtrio like Dewgong are required for Ninetales as well. Dewgong also appreciates Ninetales using Toxic on Curse + Light Screen Stantler, a Pokemon that takes advantage of Dewgong very well. Pokemon that struggle with Weezing such as Primeape, Hitmonlee, and the aforementioned Grass-types appreciate Ninetales's defensive services. If using Sunny Day, Pokemon like Stantler and Wigglytuff are great partners. Both can take advantage of Octillery in sun but struggle to do so outside of sun. Wigglytuff also answers Chinchou, which is another major threat to Ninetales. Rock-types can be used to deal with the Fire-types that Ninetales lets in for free. Graveler spins away spikes, making it easier for Ninetales to stay healthy. Sudowoodo and Pupitar appreciate sun, as it lets both survive a Surf from Octillery. Sudowoodo and Pupitar are also decent checks to RestTalk Flareon and Rapidash, which wall Ninetales.</p>"
        },
        "Roar": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Roar gives Ninetales unique offensive and defensive utility. On the offensive side, it lets Ninetales rack up Spikes damage on its checks, especially Octillery. Ninetales is an especially good user of Roar given its great matchup against the most common Spikes-immune pokemon in the tier: Xatu. On the defensive side, Roar lets Ninetales act as an emergency stop to dangerous setup sweepers, like Growth Pass Flareon and Curse Wigglytuff. Roar Ninetales is notably the best way of stopping Growth Pass Flareon, as it is the only decent Pokemon that can fit Roar on its set, and it isn't threatened by a +1 Fire Blast at all. Roar's main downside is not being able to be used with Sleep Talk, as Roar will fail if called by Sleep Talk. This makes this set more vulnerable to giving free turns to dangerous Pokemon like Dugtrio, makes Ninetales more vulnerable by status, and makes it a worse check to Xatu and Weezing. Rest keeps Ninetales healthy, while Toxic lets Ninetales shut down Curse Porygon and Rock-types like Graveler, which do not use Rest. Toxic pairs especially well with Roar because if a poisoned Pokemon switches in as Ninetales uses Roar, it will take poison damage and not get Leftovers recovery as it gets phazed. Sunny Day is an option over Toxic Roar in the face of Octillery and be much more threatening to Pokemon like Wigglytuff, but Toxic's interactions with Roar make it the generally preferred option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pineco is a mandatory teammate on this set, as it makes Ninetales's Roar a threatening offensive weapon. Passive Pokemon that are vulnerable to being set up on such as Dewgong and Gloom appreciate Ninetales's ability to stop setup sweepers. Late-game cleaners such as Xatu, Fearow, and Curse Stantler also appreciate its ability to wear down the opposing team with Roar in combination with Spikes. Octillery and Dugtrio checks are extremely important as well: Chinchou and Gloom help against the former, Dewgong helps against the latter, and pure Grass-types like Exeggcute helps against both. Octillery itself help against both while being more able to break holes in teams thanks to Ninetales racking up Spikes damage with Roar. Octillery also appreciates Ninetales taking advantage of the Grass-types that wall its Hidden Power Electric set. Dugtrio also keeps up the offensive pressure that this set demands.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Gloom is a fantastic Pokemon in GSC NU due to its ability to play several important roles effectively. Its Grass typing allows it to handle Water-types that commonly run Water- + Electric-type coverage, such as Chinchou and RestTalk Octillery. In doing so, it also provides the user with an excellent opportunity to spread paralysis. The threat of boosting its STAB Sludge Bomb with Curse or Swords Dance can easily force the foe to flee to a counter such as Xatu, a critical target that can be crippled with paralysis from Stun Spore as it switches in. Once paralyzed, if the opponent fails to respect Gloom, it can at times even muster enough power to sweep a crippled team. Sludge Bomb's high chance to inflict poison is also useful for its potential to cripple Pokemon like Magmar and Flareon and can potentially force Xatu to use Rest. On top of this, Gloom also makes for an excellent check to Primeape, one of the tier's most threatening attackers. Even Primeape that run coverage moves for Poison-types usually elect to use Hidden Power Ground to hit Weezing, which Gloom conveniently takes neutral damage from. It is particularly effective at this role with Curse, which can allow it to take on Meditate variants more safely. To allow Gloom to better deal with foes such as Substitute Graveler and Dugtrio, Hidden Power Grass is also a viable option over boosting moves.</p> <p>However, Gloom has some glaring flaws. It is fairly passive and weak before it boosts its stats, which means that Pineco can easily switch in to lay Spikes against it. For this reason, it is advised to use a Pokemon that can withstand Pineco's Explosion alongside Gloom, such as Sudowoodo. RestTalk users such as Ninetales and Xatu can potentially switch into Gloom to regain their health when weakened without having to fear paralysis too much. If not paired with a bulky Water-type like Dewgong, Octillery, or Azumarill, it can struggle against Water-types that have Ice Beam as a coverage move. Furthermore, while Gloom makes for a fantastic Chinchou check, should it become afflicted by paralysis from Thunder or Thunder Wave, it will become a much shakier check to Primeape. One of Gloom's biggest problems is that it struggles with Magnemite, which can be a huge pain to deal with due to the lack of viable Pokemon that can handle a powerful Electric-type attack that is paired with Hidden Power Ice coverage. However, Gloom can adapt to this by using Hidden Power Ground to surprise Magnemite and take it down unexpectedly. This also doubles as a coverage move for Poison-types such as Weezing, Arbok, and the rare Gastly, and it hits Fire-types slightly harder than Sludge Bomb. As Hidden Power Ground is difficult to fit on a set without dropping Moonlight, an alternative solution to the Magnemite problem is to use a sturdy Fire-type such as Ninetales to take on the cyclopean magnet. Pokemon that can take advantage of Gloom's ability to spread paralysis, such as Swords Dance Kingler, Curse Sudowoodo, Curse Stantler, Substitute Primeape, and Graveler, also make for good teammates.</p>"

Thief is actually a good choice with Parasect's sparse movepool. You might want to consider Stun Spore + Spore + Thief + Reflect / Light Screen as an all-out support Parasect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Parasect has the unfortunate trait of being both extremely slow and weak to many types of attacks. Sleep is not nearly as valuable in GSC as it is in other generations, and the variety of Pokemon with RestTalk detracts from the only advantage Parasect has in Spore. Parasect is 4x weak to Flying and Fire attacks, so something like Arcanine or Fearow will easily OHKO. Also not helpful are Parasect's Rock and Ice weaknesses. Additionally, Parasect isn't a very strong attacker either, so basically anything that resists Hidden Power Bug beats it. Basically, any decent team can handle Parasect.</p>",

If you used Stun Spore, you should have the Speed advantage, so enjoy that while it lasts. Giga Drain can dent Rhydon, Quagsire, and Golem, if they decide to switch in that is.</p>"},

Hidden Power Fire covers Steel- and Bug-types, whereas Ice covers Flying-types (especially Dragonite, should you use Parasect in OU). Both hit enemy Grass-types. You could use Hidden Power Rock for the inevitable Fire-type switch-in. Hidden Power Rock is a better choice than the special Hidden Power Fire because you will not be hitting them after using a Growth (when you use Growth, they just switched in, are faster than you, and OHKO), meaning you'll have to whittle them down on switches. With Hidden Power Rock, you can use Parasect's superior Attack stat. This also lets you hit Flying-types on the switch. The only advantage of Hidden Power Water is if you have paralysis support, or are using Parasect in OU for some reason and need to hit Steelix harder.</p>"

Persian can still work fine in the UU tier, though, and its high Speed really helps it out. It's also a ghetto SkarmBliss counter with an Electric move which is cool. Poor guy, never recovered from the RBY era.</p>",

You can pair Nightmare with Hypnosis or just use it to hurt RestTalk Pokemon. Iron Tail can be used to hit Rock-types who will otherwise wall Persian, but it does nothing for the Steel-types that do the same. Roar is kind of stupid with all that Speed and no real defenses to speak of behind it, but if you need a UU phazer it can do that. Thief is of note because Persian is so fast. Using Curse is always nice, but it ruins Persian's only great stat, and Bubble Beam will really nail a Rhydon coming in and is RBY nostalgia as well. Persian can utilize Charm against Curse users, but unless Persian has Roar, it has nothing to take out their high Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Rock and Steel Pokemon that aren't weak to Electric wall Persian badly, as do Gengar and Misdreavus as long as Persian doesn't have Shadow Ball. RestTalk Pokemon such as Zapdos and Raikou, the latter of which ties in Speed with Persian, will stop Persian's most crippling move, Hypnosis.

Return vs. Body Slam is paralysis vs. power, you could use Double-Edge too but it's not really worth the recoil. Zap Cannon vs. Thunderbolt is paralysis vs. accuracy really; don't use Zap Cannon with Body Slam obviously. Hypnosis is just a nice status move it gets, which is always good to put something to sleep that can beat Persian, since Persian will usually be faster.

      "overview": "<p>Primeape is one of the most dangerous physical attackers in the metagame. Boasting an astronomical Attack stat, a great Speed stat that ties it with Xatu, and a powerful STAB Cross Chop backed up by solid coverage, Primeape makes for a great choice for wallbreaking or cleaning on many teams. Furthermore, that same Cross Chop comes with the coveted trait of being super effective against the common and dominant Normal-types, potentially OHKOing threats like Stantler, Persian, and Porygon and dealing massive damage to Wigglytuff; it also takes a heavy chunk out of Dewgong, Sudowoodo, and Graveler. Cross Chop even has a potentially game-breaking increased critical hit rate that can slice right through a Wigglytuff or Porygon that has used Curse several times. However, Primeape has some very debilitating issues. Move accuracy is its biggest problem, turning what would otherwise be KOs from Primeape's Cross Chop or Thunder into potentially unreliable tools. Primeape is also plagued by the presence of Xatu, Fearow, and Weezing, three of the best and most common Pokemon in the tier, which are all great answers to it. Primeape is also quite frail, having difficulty switching into its targets repeatedly, so it can be difficult to find entry for it. Primeape is also easily revenge killed by Fearow and Xatu after some chip damage.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide can be used instead of Double-Edge on the Substitute set to hit Xatu and Fearow for close to 50% and Pineco for a 3HKO while being far more accurate than Thunder. It also hits just as hard against Fire-types as Cross Chop while being more accurate. However, it comes at the cost of having to use Cross Chop rather than Double-Edge against low health targets like Octillery, which can result in a miss. Without Double-Edge, Primeape is also completely walled by Gloom and has to repeatedly use Thunder to attempt to hit Weezing for meaningful chip damage. Counter can be used over Double-Edge on the Substitute set in order to surprise threats like Weezing, Dugtrio, and, if healthy enough to survive a Drill Peck, Fearow with heavy damage or even a KO; however, it comes at the cost of another move like Double-Edge and is ineffective against Xatu. Using Counter unsuccessfully will also remove all surprise factor and cause it to become significantly less useful. Thief can be used over Substiute or Double-Edge to steal Leftovers from Weezing, Gloom, or Xatu. A combination of Rest and Mint Berry can even be used alongside Thief to give Primeape a one-time full heal and then proceed to take Leftovers away from one of its walls. However, this comes at the cost of Double-Edge or Substitute, which reduces reliability, and RestTalk is often a better version of Mint Berry + Rest + Thief, as it does not require this setup process and gives Primeape the ability to continually heal throughout a game. Meditate can be used over Thunder on the Substitute set to boost Primeapeâ€™s Attack even further, letting it deal heavy damage to Weezing in short succession; however, it struggles against Xatu and will be KOed quickly, so it should be used alongside Houndour or a Pokemon that can take advantage of a chipped Weezing such as Hidden Power Rock Kingler. Protect allows Primeape to gain additional Leftovers recovery and potentially block an Explosion from the likes of Graveler and Pineco, though it compromises coverage further or means Primeape has to forgo Substitute. Screech can be used to force Spikes damage on the foe and break past Weezing and Gloom with an effectively +2 boosted Double-Edge with enough chip damage, though it comes at the cost of a moveslot, takes a turn to use, and has a 15% chance to miss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Weezingâ€™s phenomenal bulk means it takes less than 30% from Primeape's Thunder and Double-Edge, the former of which can miss and the latter of which can grant relatively free entry to Xatu. Leftovers combined with Primeape often not wanting to stay in once Weezing has switched in means Weezing is able to heal off a lot of the damage it takes in the process, and Weezing can use Primeapeâ€™s presence to gain entry and fire off its own powerful attacks. Gloom takes far more damage from Double-Edge, but it has Moonlight to keep itself healthy enough to handle Primeape throughout the battle and has Stun Spore to paralyze Primeape. However, both Weezing and Gloom can slowly be worn down by Primeape over time, especially with Spikes on the field, and both hate paralysis from Thunder. Weezing and Gloom are also often tasked to handle other threats, such as Fearow and Octillery, respectively. While Gloom has Moonlight, it only has 8 PP, which can run out in longer games when it is tasked with repeatedly switching into Primeape and other threats like Octillery.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Xatu possesses a 4x resistance to Cross Chop and can hit Primeape for upwards of 80% with STAB Psychic. Fearow, meanwhile, does not resist Cross Chop but outspeeds Primeape and easily 2HKOes it with Drill Peck. Both Xatu and Fearow also run RestTalk to keep themselves healthy and stay able to handle Primeape throughout a game. However, Primeapeâ€™s Thunder is favored to 2HKO both Fearow and Hidden Power Electric Xatu, and if Thunder lands and paralyzes them as they switch in, Primeape can use Thunder again or use Rock Slide and easily knock them out; Primeape can also win the Speed tie against Xatu. Substitute also ensures Primeape gets an opportunity to land a Thunder instead of using Cross Chop as Xatu comes in. Despite this, Thunder still has a relatively high chance to miss and can result in Primeape doing nothing against Xatu and Fearow.</p> <p><strong>Pineco</strong>: Pineco resists Cross Chop, almost always avoids a 3HKO from Double-Edge, and is only 3HKOed by the inaccurate Thunder and Rock Slide. In return, it can use Primeape to set up Spikes or use Rapid Spin to clear away the Primeape trainer's Spikes. However, Primeape can freely set up a Substitute that Pineco typically has no way to break other than by sacrificing itself with Explosion, although it will still likely mean that Pineco can use both Spikes and Rapid Spin relatively easily.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Primeape is not running RestTalk, poison from Weezing and Gloomâ€™s Sludge Bomb and Ninetalesâ€™s Toxic is incredibly limiting for Primeapeâ€™s staying power. Paralysis from Magnemite and Chinchouâ€™s Thunder, Wigglytuffâ€™s Body Slam, and Porygonâ€™s Thunder Wave is also incredibly detrimental, especially because these Pokemon are all prime candidates for Primeape to come in on and threaten out, since Primeape needs its high Speed stat intact to make up for its frailty and take advantage of its great Attack stat and superb coverage.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>RestTalk improves Primeape's longevity significantly, giving it more freedom to switch into Pokemon like Dewgong, Stantler, Porygon, and Chinchou, as a Primeape without RestTalk wants to preserve its health for late in the game and cannot afford to be paralyzed by Chinchou's Thunder or Porygon's Thunder Wave. Thunder provides the best possible coverage alongside Cross Chop, having the ability to 2HKO Xatu and Fearow and potentially paralyze Weezing, helping Primeape pose a serious threat even when facing its checks; it can also fish for paralysis against Gloom and Exeggcute, which otherwise wall this set. Thunder additionally retains the ability to hit Octillery and Dewgong hard and has a small chance to threaten Curse Porygon with paralysis while Primeape is sleeping, providing additional reliability when using Sleep Talk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Primeape works best on teams that want Primeape's powerful Fighting-type offense but need to better handle threats like Dewgong, Chinchou, and Porygon, such as on the popular Xatu + Dugtrio Spikes teams, which tend to struggle against these threats. RestTalk Primeape also works well on Graveler + Gloom teams, as it appreciates Graveler shutting down Pineco and checking Weezing as well as Gloom spreading paralysis; in return, Primeape can switch into Dewgong and Porygon for the two. Ninetales is a perfect defensive partner, as it struggles with Dewgong, Chinchou, and Rock-types like Sudowoodo, which Primeape can check. In returm, Ninetales provides a reliable switch into Weezing and Gloom for Primeape. Pineco is a solid option for a teammate, as its Spikes down Weezing and Gloom.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Cross Chop is Primeapeâ€™s strongest choice of STAB move and comes with an increased critical hit rate, letting it come close to if not outright OHKOing most Pokemon that do not resist it. Thunder is Primeapeâ€™s strongest option to hit Xatu and Fearow, and the 30% paralysis rate can be ruinous to them as well as Gloom and Weezing, provided the move hits. Double-Edge is a generally powerful neutral move to use against Gloom and Weezing or for the 100% accuracy against a low health target; it's also useful for preserving Cross Chop PP. Substitute allows Primeape to safely scout switch-ins and force the foe to attack it, reducing prediction in scenarios where Primeape needs to decide whether to use Cross Chop to hit the Pokemon in front of it, like Stantler, or use Thunder to hit an incoming Xatu. Substitute also allows Primeape to block Explosion and Toxic from Pineco which cannot otherwise threaten Primeape, or block Explosion from a Graveler or weakened Weezing trying to trade with it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pineco is a great partner for Primeape, setting up Spikes to help wear down opposing Weezing and Gloom throughout a game and helping Primeape break through them. Weezing can lure in Xatu and opposing Weezing and damage them by using Thunder on the switch or using Explosion to trade and clear the way for Primeape. Ninetales can wall Weezing, Gloom, and Xatu, and if Weezing chooses to use Explosion to eliminate Ninetales, then it means it will not be present to handle Primeape. In return, Primeape can switch into Sudowoodo and Dewgong for Ninetales and threaten them out. Sudowoodo and Graveler wall Fearow, take advantage of Pineco, are solid switch-ins to Weezing that lack Hidden Power Water, and can use Self-Destruct and Explosion, respectively, to take out a bulky threat like Octillery or Xatu. Dewgong walls Xatu and Gloom and in a pinch can switch into Fearow, threatening to deal heavy damage to all three with Ice Beam. Xatu can switch into Gloom, and to an extent Weezing, and force them out. Both Xatu and Dewgong, along with other special attackers like Chinchou and BoltBeam Porygon, appreciate Primeape being able to severely threaten Wigglytuff; Chinchou and Porygon can also spread paralysis for Primeape. Xatu and other powerful wallbreakers like Stantler and Dugtrio are also very effective at spreading damage and weakening the opposing team for Primeape to clean late-game, especially with Spikes up.</p>"

Thief can cripple a bulky Pokemon such as Hypno or Ampharos that attempts to switch into Kadabra. Hidden Power Dark can be used alongside Fire Punch and Psychic; these three moves hit every viable Pokemon in the metagame for neutral damage, although this makes Kadabra worse off against Slowbro due to its low chance to 3HKO with Hidden Power Dark. Substitute can be used to exploit Thunder's low accuracy from Pokemon such as Magneton and Lanturn and lets Kadabra safely avoid potential status inflictions from non-Seismic Toss Hypno.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Psychic-types</strong>: Hypno takes negligible damage from anything Kadabra can use against it and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or set up Light Screen for its teammates. Mr. Mime threatens Kadabra with paralysis and a 3HKO from Thunder while not being hurt much in return, although Mr. Mime fears Thunder Wave from Kadabra. Slowking is only 4HKOed by Thunder Punch and can hit Kadabra hard and Thunder Wave variants can cripple Kadabra. RestTalk Psychic-types are also a significant challenge for Kadabra to deal with, especially since Encore fails against Sleep Talk. However, all of these Pokemon dislike Thief Kadabra and can be forced out by Encore Kadabra if it switches in on a resisted attack or recovery move, or when the foe uses Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Ampharos and Lanturn are only 4HKOed by Psychic and can hit Kadabra very hard in return with Thunder. Bellossom is similarly 4HKOed and can cripple Kadabra with Stun Spore while keeping itself healthy with Moonlight. Chansey takes pitiful damage from Kadabra and can threaten it with Present or paralysis from Zap Cannon, although it can be forced out by Encore.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: Jumpluff outspeeds Kadabra and can lock it into an undesirable move with Encore or cripple it with Stun Spore, although variants without Synthesis can be worn down by Psychic and Jumpluff greatly fears paralysis from Thunder Wave or Thunder Punch. Electrode is faster, can set up Light Screen, and can threaten Kadabra with Explosion. Lastly, Scyther and Electabuzz Speed tie with Kadabra and can hit it very hard; Electabuzz can even Pursuit trap Kadabra and Scyther can OHKO with Hidden Power Bug, although they are both 3HKOed by Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton resists Psychic and Thunder Punch and deals heavy damage with Thunder, although it must watch for Fire Punch, which can 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Although they cannot switch in safely due to their middling Special Defense stats, physical attackers such as Granbull, Piloswine, and Pinsir pose a significant threat to Kadabra if they switch in as it uses Encore or Recover. Granbull comes close to OHKOing with unboosted Frustration, Piloswine deals over 70% with Earthquake, and Pinsir OHKOes with unboosted Hidden Power Bug.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Kadabra's high Speed and Special Attack to make it an offensive threat with crucial utility in Encore or Thunder Wave. STAB Psychic 3HKOes a significant proportion of foes that don't resist it. Thunder Punch is important for hitting Slowbro and Slowking, which otherwise completely wall Kadabra. The extra power is also appreciated against other bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Gyarados, and Politoed, which are not 3HKOed by Psychic. Recover gives Kadabra greater longevity when battling threats such as Slowbro. Encore can lock a foe into an undesirable move, such as Rest for passive Pokemon or a boosting move for setup Pokemon. However, this is very risky due to Kadabra's frailty, especially against Scyther, with which Kadabra Speed ties. Encore can also help immensely against Baton Pass teams, since Kadabra's fast Encore lets it disrupt the momentum of Mr. Mime. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can support slower wallbreaking teammates such as Sandslash and Granbull and cripple foes such as Jumpluff, Scyther, Electabuzz, Bellossom, Hypno, and Chansey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Qwilfish is crucial for maximizing pressure from Kadabra. Nidoqueen pairs well with Kadabra, since bulky Electric-types like Magneton and Ampharos are reliable switch-ins to Kadabra, and Nidoqueen can switch into them easily while maintaining offensive momentum. Pokemon that can check Dodrio, Scyther, and Pinsir, such as Fire Blast Nidoqueen and Haunter, can help Kadabra with its defensive issues. Setup sweepers such as Scyther, Granbull, Pinsir, and Kabutops can take advantage of Encore from Kadabra to acquire a risk-free opportunity to switch in; ideal scenarios include locking Chansey into Soft-Boiled and locking Hypno into Light Screen. Haunter is a good partner for Kadabra, as the two have the same Psychic- and Electric-type coverage and similar checks, meaning Haunter can cripple them with Thief, Hypnosis, Explosion, or Destiny Bond. Mr. Mime can be used as a secondary offensive Psychic-type that supports Kadabra with Thunder Wave, Encore, Thief, Hypnosis, or a passed Substitute. Pokemon that can take advantage of Hypno, such as Granbull, Hidden Power Bug Scyther and Pinsir, and specially bulky RestTalkers such as Ampharos are appreciated. Finally, secondary checks to Slowbro and Slowking such as Electabuzz work well, since Kadabra generally doesn't want to be stuck using Recover versus their Surfs; this can give them a free opportunity to switch out, and Kadabra is vulnerable to critical hits.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>With Snorlax being the king of GSC, Machamp seems like a pretty good idea given its mighty Fighting STAB. However, it takes as much as 49% switching into Snorlax's Double-Edge, making it a shaky check for the big lug. However, while Machamp is a shaky Snorlax check, on offense it's a monster -- half of the Pokemon on most teams are weak to Fighting-type attacks, severely limiting what can switch into Machamp. Furthermore, a few teams do not even have a Fighting resist, allowing Machamp to steamroll these teams when it comes across them if it manages to OHKO Skarmory with a +1 critical hit Cross Chop. Cross Chop has a 20% critical hit rate after factoring accuracy, so going for the critical hit is a viable strategy and not just a pipe dream. Machamp also has decent 90 / 80 / 85 defenses, allowing an all-out attacker much more leeway to switch in than the similar Marowak, and permitting the use of a more defensive RestTalk set to tank mixed sweepers. Machamp does have its flaws, though. Its low Speed, Spikes vulnerability, lack of useful resistances, and good-but-not-great defenses make it extremely vulnerable to simply being beat down upon, and it's also often the victim of bad luck and PP issues thanks to Cross Chop's 80% accuracy, meager 8 PP, and dependence on the critical hit to break walls such as Skarmory.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Earthquake or Body Slam over one of the coverage options on the Curse sweeper set is a possibility, but generally an inferior possibility because it deprives Machamp of crucial coverage against either the ultra-common Zapdos or Exeggutor. In addition, the Curse sweeper could also ditch one of the coverage moves in favor of Rest to permit it to setup, break a wall, then Rest off damage and status for later carnage, but this is not recommended without Heal Bell support as Machamp is dead weight while asleep. Counter, too, is a good option for Machamp, but honestly it's only really viable on the all-out attacker set as, again, the Curse sweeper relies on its specific coverage moves to get past common threats. Counter allows Machamp to KO Skarmory or even Zapdos going for the Drill Peck, and also punishes foes such as Nidoking and Heracross trying to wear Machamp down with Earthquake and Seismic Toss, respectively. However, while Counter can catch these foes off guard, Machamp's vast attacking movepool, excellent Fighting STAB, and huge 358 Attack stat mean that it's usually better off using an attacking move to maximize coverage rather than waiting to catch something off guard with Counter. Meditate is an interesting option over Curse on the Curse sweeper set to allow Machamp the opportunity to boost its Attack without lowering its Speed. Generally, the extra Defense from Curse is preferred to allow Machamp to tank Drill Pecks from Skarmory and Double-Edges from Snorlax as it attacks, but not suffering a Speed drop can be useful if Machamp is being passed Agility boosts or for preserving the Speed tie against Exeggutor and allowing Machamp to OHKO with a +1 Hidden Power Bug with a 50% chance of not having to take a Psychic in return. Hidden Power Rock can be used over Rock Slide if Machamp isn't using an anti-Psychic Hidden Power. Hidden Power's perfect accuracy can be preferred over Rock Slide's 90% accuracy, whereas Rock Slide is not likely to be flinching anything relevant. A particularly interesting, but generally not very effective, gimmick would be the use of Berserk Gene over Leftovers on the all-out attacking set. The +2 Attack boost without setup can sometimes catch opponents off guard, and if Machamp gets lucky and consistently hits past confusion it can quickly take one or two Pokemon down with it before it succumbs to confusion damage and damage sustained from attacks by faster foes. However, Berserk Gene gives Machamp one shot at making a difference, as once Machamp is switched out, Berserk Gene is consumed, leaving Machamp a regular all-out attacker but with much less longevity thanks to the lack of Leftovers. Furthermore, the 50% likelihood during any given turn of simply having Machamp smack itself for non-trivial damage makes Berserk Gene a very high-risk item that generally isn't worth it. Along the lines of gimmicks that generally aren't worth it, Vital Throw and Light Screen fall into this category. Vital Throw is often prized for its -1 priority, thereby preventing Machamp from being phazed after a Curse. The problem is that Vital Throw is so very weak compared to Cross Chop's raw power, and the phaze immunity hardly matters to Machamp as most phazers aren't able to safely phaze with the threat of a +1 Cross Chop looming over them. In addition, Vital Throw's negative priority can screw Machamp over if it needs to outspeed Snorlax (e.g., after a Belly Drum) and KO it with its STAB Fighting move. Light Screen, on the other hand, is often seen as a good move as the biggest threats to a Machamp sweep are STAB Psychic users and accumulated damage from STAB Surfs and Thunders. However, giving up a coverage move on Machamp itself is not a good way to set up Light Screen for Machamp, as it reduces the impact of Machamp once it does get a Light Screen boost. Rather, Light Screen is best used by a teammate, such as Blissey or Zapdos, to permit Machamp the best use of its attacking movepool while still enabling it to tank Psychics and other powerful special moves when a teammate pseudo-passes Light Screen to it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Starmie is widely considered the most dependable check to Machamp, and for good reason. It resists Cross Chop, avoids being 2HKOed by an unboosted Hidden Power, and can 2HKO back with Psychic. Of course, without Psychic, Starmie risks having RestTalk Machamp set up on it, as Surf is only a 4HKO, and also risks being KOed by any Machamp with Curse and Hidden Power; after a single Curse, Machamp 2HKOs Starmie without a defense boost, and after 3 Curses, which Machamp can easily set up in the face of Starmie's Surf, Machamp can 2HKO even Starmie behind a Reflect. Exeggutor is also a prime Machamp check, being able to switch in easily on a Cross Chop or Curse and 2HKO with Psychic. However, Exeggutor must be wary of Hidden Power Bug, which 2HKOes without a Curse boost and OHKOes after Machamp uses Curse. Zapdos is another Pokemon that acts as a soft check to Machamp; it 3HKOes with Thunder or Thunderbolt and resists Cross Chop, although most Machamp carry Rock Slide specifically for Zapdos and will be able to 2HKO after a Curse boost. Suicune can repeatedly smack Machamp with Surf for the 4HKO; this isn't enough to guarantee Machamp is killed before it is able to kill Suicune in return though, because Suicune is 3HKOed by non-critical hit Cross Chop, it will usually be enough to weaken Machamp to where it won't be able to accomplish anything else after killing Suicune, and might be enough to flat out beat Machamp if Cross Chop misses. All-out attacking Machamp is walled much harder by Suicune, as it fails to be 3HKOed by an unboosted Cross Chop, whereas RestTalk Machamp will outright beat any Suicune without Roar due to its ability to use Rest to restore health lost to Surf. Skarmory is another check that works well against non-Fire Blast Machamp; it can use Curse to match Machamp's boosts and threaten to 3HKO in return with STAB Drill Peck. Critical hit Cross Chops or the uncommon Fire Blast can beat it, though. The observant should notice a pattern with these checks: Machamp has some way of beating them all. Still, all of these checks can go up against Machamp well enough to ensure, at the very least, Machamp is too crippled to do more than break that one check, and at best, they abuse Machamp's propensity to beat itself with Cross Chop's low accuracy and PP.</p> <p>Machamp also has a few other checks that are more situational and less common than those listed above. Most Machamp do not use Earthquake because it's generally a poor coverage move to run alongside Cross Chop, which is excellent news for Muk as a Machamp counter. Without Earthquake, Machamp really has no way of getting past Muk, as Muk can match Machamp's attempts to Curse up and beat it while being able to deal heavy damage to Machamp with STAB Sludge Bomb. Heracross makes a solid check to Machamp as well. It resists Cross Chop, Machamp rarely has a coverage move specifically for dealing heavy damage to Heracross, and Heracross can slowly but surely 5HKO Machamp with Seismic Toss, or use Curse to match Machamp's boosts. Curse Heracross, unlike Seismic Toss variants, can also wall Sleep Talk Machamp and out-PP it thanks to Cross Chop's meager 8 PP. Fire Blast Machamp threatens to 3HKO Heracross, though, but Fire Blast, much like Cross Chop, is fairly easy to stall out of PP. Nidoking and Tentacruel can also check non-Earthquake Machamp to an extent by virtue of their Poison typing, the former being able to use Lovely Kiss to incapacitate Machamp and the latter being able to outpace Curse's defense boosts with Swords Dance. Machamp ultimately beats both of these threats with enough Curse boosts in spite of their ability to resist Cross Chop, rendering RestTalk Machamp thoroughly uncheckable by these particular Poison-types. However, while RestTalk Machamp gets credit for matching up well against Heracross and non-Cursing Poison-types, the fact that it can only attack using Cross Chop renders it incapable of touching Ghost-types entirely. Machamp can't afford to PP stall Gengar, as Cross Chop has terrible PP, and Gengar can always play for the freeze with Ice Punch or kill Machamp with a timely critical hit Thunderbolt. Misdreavus, on the other hand, immediately forces Machamp to switch out. In addition to hardwalling RestTalk Machamp, Ghosts are also good checks to Machamp variants lacking Earthquake or Hidden Power Ghost, as Machamp can only 3HKO with Rock Slide after a Curse boost, whereas Gengar can severely wear Machamp down with Thunderbolts and a full-health Misdreavus needs to be 2HKOed to guarantee that it fails to kill Machamp with Perish Trap. Meganium makes another uncommon but effective Machamp check. Behind Reflect, with Leech Seed sapping Machamp's health, and with Synthesis to provide instant healing, Meganium acts to thoroughly outstall Machamp. Slowbro rounds out the list of uncommon checks, but it certainly is a good one; it can use Growl or Reflect to neutralize Curse variants, or threaten to outright kill Machamp with Psychic. Its reliance on Rest for recovery coupled with its Hidden Power weakness can render it beatable by Machamp, though.</p>",

        "Curse Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>Machamp is one of GSC's deadliest attacking threats, mostly thanks to its 358 Attack-backed STAB Cross Chop. Cross Chop is not only an incredibly useful Fighting-type STAB move, which is super effective or at least neutral against most of GSC's big players, but it also has a 20% critical hit rate after factoring accuracy, adding to its already devastating strength. Curse is what really allows this Machamp set to shine, as after a Curse boost, Cross Chop is able to OHKO even the vaunted Skarmory with a critical hit. As a pure physical attacker, being able to kill Skarmory, much less in one hit, is an impressive feat indeed. Furthermore, even though it's a Curse sweeper, Charm Umbreon and Growl Miltank can't just switch in to stall it thanks to its super effective Fighting-type STAB. A few teams fail to carry a Fighting resist; for these teams, Skarmory is often all they have to attempt to wall Machamp, and Skarmory will die if it gets hit by a boosted critical hit Cross Chop, forcing the team to crumble shortly thereafter.</p> <p>Of course, there are several common Fighting-type resisting Pokemon that can step in to serve as more capable Machamp walls. Even then, though, Machamp gets a slew of coverage moves to handle them. Rock Slide 2HKOs the ever-present Zapdos after a Curse boost, whereas the choice of Hidden Power is able to 2HKO other defensive threats. An unboosted Hidden Power Bug 2HKOs the common Exeggutor. An unboosted Hidden Power Ghost on the other hand is able to 2HKO the Ghost-types on average while still retaining the ability to 3HKO Exeggutor. Hidden Power Bug is usually preferred because Exeggutor directly forces Machamp to switch out with its STAB Psychic whereas Ghost-types still take a lot of damage from Curse-boosted Rock Slides and can't threaten direct damage to Machamp to force it out easily. Regardless of which Hidden Power is chosen, they both also give Machamp some recourse against its number one check: Starmie. Starmie without Reflect are 2HKOed by Hidden Power after a Curse boost, and Reflect variants are 2HKOed after three Curse boosts, which are easily obtainable without taking too much damage from Surf if Machamp Curses on the turns that Starmie switches in and uses Reflect. Thanks to the combination of Curse and Hidden Power, in addition to the fact that Starmie's Surf only 4HKOes Machamp, Starmie needs to run Psychic to consistently scare Machamp into switching out with the threat of the 2HKO, and even then Machamp can still kill a weakened Starmie (62-73% health) with a Curse-boosted Hidden Power while being able to tank a single STAB Psychic with plenty of health to spare. Even considering all of this, though, Machamp could simply rely on its team to clear out Starmie for it and instead use Fire Blast in the last slot, which handily 3HKOes Exeggutor and allows Machamp to easily KO Skarmory without burning through precious Cross Chop PP attempting to score the critical hit.</p> <p>Machamp's ability to tank hits, especially STAB Water-type attacks, constitutes one of its main selling points over the similar Swords Dance Marowak (the other being the raw wallbreaking potential of a boosted critical hit Cross Chop). However, while Machamp has an easier time setting up because of its ability to take hits, it shouldn't be switching into attacks very often, as if it does, its lack of resistances or a recovery move means that it will simply be worn down without being able to use that extra bulk to set up. Because of this, it needs to be played similarly to Marowak in that it needs to be switched in judiciously on predicted non-attacking turns on the opponent's part, preferably on predicted switches to Snorlax to nab a free turn to set up Curses or predict switches to Exeggutor as the opponent will undoubtedly switch out to avoid taking the possible STAB Cross Chop. However, while Machamp isn't immediately forced out by anything with an attacking move and a modicum of Defense the way Marowak is, it does rely on a much less accurate, less reliable, and more PP-starved STAB move than Marowak does. Indeed, as often as Cross Chop can win games by breaking key walls with timely critical hits, it can also disappoint with untimely misses, forcing Machamp to become worn down without accomplishing anything on the offensive, even if played perfectly.</p> <p>Curse sweeping Machamp, much like Swords Dance Marowak, loves plenty of support to help it get in position to break walls. Paralysis is first and foremost the biggest assistance to this Machamp. A paralyzed Skarmory is unable to use Curse after switching in on Machamp's Curse, rendering it unable to stall out Machamp's Cross Chop PP as it attempts to score a critical hit. Furthermore, paralyzed Umbreon cannot switch in on a turn that Machamp uses Curse to neutralize Machamp by setting its Attack stage to -1; Machamp can't afford to waste Cross Chops on turns when its Attack stage is so low, as even against Umbreon, which takes super effective damage, a -1 Cross Chop fails to 2HKO without a critical hit. In general, paralysis is great even against the foes Machamp is supposed to set up against and beat; it prevents Machamp from being worn down every turn that it chooses to attack, and can transform the possible Cross Chop miss from a potential sweep-ender to a minor inconvenience. Some of the better paralysis-spreading partners for Machamp include Stun Spore Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, Thunder Wave Zapdos, and Body Slam Snorlax.</p> <p>Other support that is appreciated by Machamp includes Pokemon that can bait its counters to switch into Explosions. Cloyster is probably the best at this, as it can bait Starmie in to spin away its Spikes, only to subsequently Explode on it and free up Machamp to rampage. Exeggutor and Steelix often end up catching foes such as Zapdos and Suicune that can otherwise wear Machamp down with their STAB special attacks. Machamp usually beats these foes if it Curses on the turn that they switch in, but it takes a lot of damage in the process, so being rid of the likes of Zapdos and Suicune beforehand is a great help to Machamp's sweeping efforts. Further support includes Pursuit users. Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom are all adept at catching Exeggutor, which otherwise causes Machamp problems by forcing it out with STAB Psychic. They are also all good at forcing Ghost-types to take residual damage to put them in +1 Rock Slide 2HKO range if Machamp opts for Hidden Power Bug over Hidden Power Ghost. Furthermore, Tyranitar can severely weaken Zapdos with Pursuits on the switch out, whereas Umbreon can use the combination of Toxic and Pursuit to force Starmie into +1 Hidden Power OHKO range before it can switch in to combat Machamp. Finally, Rapid Spin support from Starmie can be a great help to give Machamp more leeway to predict opportunities to switch in. However, it's not absolutely necessary for Machamp, as it can often restore the health lost to Spikes with Leftovers as it stays in to set up, whereas other heavy-hitters such as Marowak and Rhydon need Rapid Spin support much more because they are usually limited to using one attack before being forced to switch out.</p> <p>While this Machamp is well-tailored to take on its most common checks, there are still a few things it will struggle mightily to get past. Nidoking resists everything it has except for the weak Hidden Power Ghost, although its offensive nature means that it lacks a recovery move itself, and its moderate attacking stats mean that it won't be able to do much damage to Machamp in return, thereby allowing Machamp to set up fairly safely against Nidoking unless it has yet to use Lovely Kiss. Heracross poses a bigger problem to Machamp; it resists Cross Chop and can either Curse up alongside Machamp or wear it down with Seismic Toss. A +2 Rock Slide will 3HKO an unboosted Heracross, though, as will an unboosted Fire Blast should Machamp be using it, so Seismic Toss will not KO Machamp in time if it Curses on the switch unless Heracross gets lucky and consistently hits Rest and Seismic Toss with Sleep Talk at critical moments. Muk is probably the toughest thing for Machamp to deal with, as it resists Cross Chop, Curses up alongside Machamp, and can dish out heavy damage in return with Sludge Bomb. However, Muk is usually on a suicide mission and often uses Explosion to take itself out of commission, thereby effectively dealing with itself to allow Machamp an opportunity to sweep. These threats are far less common and effective as Machamp checks than the likes of Zapdos and Exeggutor, and as a result, using moves such as Earthquake and Fire Blast to deal with these threats is rare and generally not worth the trouble.</p>"
        },
        "Pure Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>This Machamp gives up the ability to set up with Curse in return for more coverage. While being able to set up Curse is helpful for beating the likes of Suicune and weakened Starmie, in most cases Machamp doesn't even need to set up to threaten major damage against most threats, and the extra moveslot gives Machamp another coverage move to help it beat what it normally couldn't. Cross Chop is the obvious STAB move, running off of Machamp's ludicrous Attack stat, having a high critical hit rate for breaking walls, and having a great STAB typing for hitting half of most teams for super effective damage. However, not having Curse to boost its power means that Machamp must waste a lot of Cross Chop's PP looking for the critical hit if it's beating Suicune or Skarmory with it. Rock Slide is another non-negotiable moveslot, as it guarantees a 3HKO on Zapdos, something that otherwise walls Machamp entirely. The other two moveslots ultimately depend on what threats you want Machamp to be able to handle. Earthquake is an excellent move that isn't usually considered a good coverage move alongside Fighting STAB. However, it does hit Poison- and Ghost-type switch-ins hard, and it's a 100% accurate 100 Base Power move that helps to preserve Cross Chop's PP against Ground-weak foes and that ensures low-health foes can be finished off. Body Slam could also be used to paralyze Starmie switch-ins, which otherwise walls Machamp completely and is very adept at avoiding paralysis. The last moveslot depends further on what Machamp wants to be able to hurt. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move, as it preserves Cross Chops against Steel-types (most notably Skarmory), and can also be used to handily 3HKO Exeggutor and to 3HKO Heracross on average. Using one of the Hidden Powers in this slot is also an option; Hidden Power Bug 2HKOs Exeggutor switch-ins, whereas Hidden Power Ghost can 2HKO Ghost-types if Earthquake is foregone for Body Slam. If Body Slam is used as the third move, using Hidden Power in the last slot allows Machamp to both paralyze and KO Starmie on its own, which other sets cannot accomplish.</p> <p>As always, Cross Chop can be very annoying with its unreliable accuracy and meager 8 PP. However, Machamp sporting Earthquake and Fire Blast can preserve its Cross Chop PP in many situations, including against Steel-types and Raikou, and Earthquake also allows Machamp to finish off low-health foes with a reliable 100% accurate move that, unlike Hidden Power, is actually strong enough to ensure reasonable KOs. As a result, all-out attacking Machamp isn't as dependent on the use of Cross Chop as other Machamp variants are, although it is still just as likely to miss against Snorlax in a critical moment to lead to Machamp being KOed by Double-Edge as it is to score the timely critical hit to KO Suicune. Also, like the Curse sweeper, this Machamp needs to be played cautiously to ensure it doesn't take too much damage on the switch in. All-out attacking Machamp is more of a hit-and-run type of Pokemon than it is a set-up-and-sweep Pokemon, so it isn't as desperate to be at full health to ensure it can set up. Regardless, it's still slow and doesn't have any resistances to common attacks, so it can be quite an easy task to wear down Machamp before it can break anything if one isn't judicious about when Machamp is switched in. This means no switching Machamp directly into Snorlax's STAB moves, but rather switching Machamp into predicted Snorlax switch-ins.</p> <p>This Machamp, while less impactful on offense, is more self-sufficient and therefore doesn't require as much support to ensure some kind of setup. Its goal is simply to come in, hit something, switch out, then repeat until the opponent's team is dented enough to go for the kill. Still, Machamp's low Speed means that paralysis support from Stun Spore Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, and Body Slam Snorlax is still extremely appreciated so that Machamp, upon switching in, might be able to force walls such as Zapdos and Suicune to take two hits upon switching in, thereby vastly improving Machamp's ability to KO these walls or to force the opponent to either predict around Machamp or sacrifice a Pokemon to get their wall in safely. Paralysis support also allows Machamp to outspeed Umbreon to prevent it from switching in on a predicted non-Cross Chop turn and subsequently neutralizing Machamp with Charm. In addition, using Explosions to take out Machamp's walls is probably more important for this set than it is for the Curse sweeper, as this Machamp can't just use Curse to muscle its way past threats that resist its attacks. In particular, using Cloyster or even Steelix to Explode on Starmie is key to allowing Machamp to do relevant damage to other Pokemon, especially if it forgoes Body Slam for broader coverage against other threats. Steelix and Exeggutor can help Machamp out by targeting Suicune and Zapdos with Explosion, as they otherwise make life difficult for all-out attacking Machamp. Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom also helps Machamp immensely against Exeggutor, and Tyranitar has the added bonus of being able to chip away at Zapdos. Umbreon is a poor partner for the all-out attacking Machamp set, as it doesn't do enough to Starmie with Pursuit on the switch out to ensure it will be KOed by an unboosted Hidden Power as it switches back into Machamp, not to mention that all-out attacking Machamp might not even be carrying Hidden Power. This set also appreciates Rapid Spin support a lot more than Curse Machamp does, as this Machamp is more of a hit-and-run Pokemon and is therefore not likely to get a lot of Leftovers recovery to restore health lost to Spikes. Having its own Spikes to aid in getting kills is also more appreciated by all-out attacking Machamp, as it's a much more opportunistic killer than the Machamp that sets up with Curse, and Spikes makes it much more likely that walls switching into all-out attacking Machamp are either put into KO range, or are limited to the Spikes-immune Zapdos and Skarmory to ease prediction.</p>"
        },
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>Machamp has pretty decent defensive stats to accompany its mammoth Attack and Fighting STAB; this set aims to take advantage of this bulk by using it for longevity and allowing Machamp to act as a mixed wall, rather than simply using it to allow Machamp the leeway to switch in and set up a sweep. This Machamp, thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk, is an excellent Snorlax check, being able to Rest off Double-Edges on the switch, force Snorlax to switch out with the threat of Cross Chop, and be constantly available thanks to Sleep Talk. Sleep Talk also allows Machamp to get around one of its biggest downfalls by conserving Cross Chop PP via PP-free uses of the move with Sleep Talk turns. Curse rounds out the set by allowing Machamp to match Snorlax's Curses and to allow it to Curse up and sweep when Fighting-resisting Pokemon have been cleared out of the way. This Machamp set does not have the coverage options that other sets have, and as such, having Cross Chop as its only attacking move means that it will be unable to touch Ghost-types and will either be beaten or outstalled by Fighting-type resisting Psychic- and Flying-types as well. Still, once these Pokemon are defeated, this Machamp set absolutely ravages opposing teams and cannot be killed very easily in return.</p> <p>RestTalk Machamp is not a purely offensive being; in fact, it's more defensive than offensive by virtue of the many things that wall it. It's bulky enough to avoid being 3HKOed by the big 3 mixed attackers: Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite without Hidden Power Flying (which is most Dragonite). Furthermore, it scares them out with the threat of a Curse-based setup, and manages to, unlike other mixed walls, force Snorlax to switch out by virtue of STAB Cross Chop (and beats last-Pokemon CurseLax to boot). While this set struggles to get past any Fighting-type resisting Pokemon (and is therefore less offensive than other variants), this Machamp can brutalize those few teams that fail to use a Fighting resist because it not only has the ability to set up with Curse and KO walls such as Skarmory with a critical hit Cross Chop, but also the ability to stick around with Rest and Sleep Talk unlike sweeping Machamp sets. Still, though it has incredible offensive setup potential by virtue of its longevity, this Machamp's main selling point is its aforementioned defensive virtues, as a single Ghost-type will render it useless, and any Fighting-type resist should be able to beat it fairly easily.</p> <p>While Sleep Talk does help Cross Chop's PP problems to an extent, it still only has a paltry 8 PP, making it fairly easy to stall out, and it also still has a very unreliable 80% accuracy. Because of this, Machamp usually needs to use a couple of Curses before it begins firing off Cross Chops so that it has enough power to minimize its Cross Chop PP consumption and also to minimize the impact of misses by being able to KO most Pokemon in a single hit. However, Machamp can't start Cursing while Fighting-immune Ghosts or Fighting-resisting special attackers such as Exeggutor or Zapdos are on the field; these foes will either threaten Machamp into switching out or stall Machamp out of Cross Chops. Because of this, this Machamp set appreciates Pursuit support much more than other sets that have coverage moves specifically for beating these threats. Tyranitar, as always, is an excellent partner, being able to Pursuit trap Ghosts and Exeggutor while also being able to chip away at Zapdos. Houndoom also traps Exeggutor and Ghost-types with Pursuit, and Umbreon shines against Exeggutor but can struggle to Pursuit trap Ghost-types because it fails to KO them with Pursuit before Perish trap manages to kill it. Using Explosion with Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Steelix to bait and kill the likes of Starmie and Zapdos is also solid support to wipe out Machamp's checks and clear its way for a sweep. Having paralysis support from the likes of Stun Spore Exeggutor and Body Slam Snorlax is, as with all Machamp sets, very valuable, as Skarmory can safely switch in and match Machamp's Curses otherwise, and Umbreon can switch in on a predicted Curse and Charm Machamp's Attack down to effectively waste any Cross Chops to follow. Additionally, Rapid Spin support is very handy for this Machamp, as it is very slow and lacks good resistances. It normally walls the big 3 mixed attackers because it fails to be 3HKOed by any of them, but it is outsped by all of them and there is no guarantee that it will be able to take Spikes damage on top of two Nidoking Earthquakes or Dragonite Double-Edges as it switches in. Having Spikes cleared means that Machamp is also guaranteed to avoid being 2HKOed by Snorlax's Double-Edge if it manages to mispredict and switch into it, thereby giving Machamp the leeway to switch in and deter Snorlax from setting up.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>As a Water-type, Tentacruel distinguishes itself from its competition thanks to its secondary Poison typing and access to Swords Dance and Rapid Spin. With the former move, Tentacruel can act as a dangerous sweeper due to its good Speed and ability to exploit a lot of passive Pokemon like Forretress, Umbreon, and Blissey as well as other Water-types like Vaporeon and especially the omnipresent Cloyster. As a spinner, Tentacruel has a great matchup against the two best Spikes users in the metagame in Cloyster and Forretress thanks to its Toxic immunity and resistances.</p> <p>However, Tentacruel's mediocre offensive stats mean that even with a Swords Dance boost, it fails to 2HKO important Pokemon like Snorlax and Zapdos. Additionally, crippling weaknesses to Electric, Psychic, and Ground mean that you cannot rely on Tentacruel to check the likes of Steelix, Marowak, Nidoking, and Rhydon, something you would typically want from your Water-type. These factors also mean that Tentacruel is plagued with a large number of checks like Raikou, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Starmie. Starmie is also a huge competitor to Tentacruel as a spinner due to its Speed and secondary Psychic typing, which allows it to better deal with common spinblocker Gengar and check Machamp much more effectively. Furthermore, Tentacruel cannot use Swords Dance and Rapid Spin on one set, forcing the player to choose what they feel will be most beneficial.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat can be game changing if you successfully pull it off against Zapdos, Raikou, or Gengar, but it is incompatible with both Swords Dance and Rapid Spin. Giga Drain is an option on the Rapid Spin variant to directly threaten Cloyster. Rest can be considered on the Rapid Spin set if you're looking for increased longevity, but using it will grant the opponent an opportunity to create pressure with Spikes, which it is the entire purpose of Rapid Spin Tentacruel to avoid.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Just like almost every Water-type in the metagame, Tentacruel suffers from the popularity of Electric-types like Zapdos, Raikou, and to a lesser extent Jolteon, although their reliance on Thunder to deal with it can bite them if Swords Dance Tentacruel avoids the attack.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus have a weaker Thunder and aren't as bulky, but they still remain solid answers due to their resistance to Sludge Bomb and immunity to Rapid Spin. However, Misdreavus needs to watch out for Toxic and can fail to take on a Tentacruel that keeps spamming Substitute thanks to its higher Speed and Thunder's poor accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: While not as common, faster Psychic-types like Starmie, Espeon, and Alakazam are big threats to Tentacruel due to their powerful STAB attacks and access to instant recovery. They fear potentially being poisoned by Sludge Bomb or Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Other bulky Pokemon like Snorlax, Miltank, and by a smaller margin Skarmory can interrupt Tentacruel's attempts to sweep. Snorlax is so strong and bulky that Tentacruel will often lose even if Snorlax switches in as it uses Swords Dance, whereas Miltank will not go down quickly and threatens Tentacruel with Body Slam paralysis. Skarmory doesn't care how many Swords Dance boosts Tentacruel has acquired, and it can phaze Tentacruel in exchange for a blow from Tentacruel's Water STAB attack. This is disadvantageous for Skarmory in the long run, but poses difficulties for Tentacruel early on.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Although Tentacruel doesn't look like an offensive threat with such average offensive stats, it's surprisingly one of the most effective Swords Dance users in the metagame, mostly due to the many opportunities it has to set up throughout the match. Substitute makes this task even easier, as it discourages Cloyster and Forretress from using Explosion in front of Tentacruel to trade, prevents Pokemon like Umbreon from using Charm or Growl, and allows Tentacruel to exploit the overuse of Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, Raikou, and Misdreavus due to the move's accuracy. Sludge Bomb is Tentacruel's best physical STAB attack, and the added probability to inflict poison to the opposing Pokemon can prove to be very handy. Hydro Pump is another important STAB attack that deters all of Tyranitar, Steelix, Marowak, Nidoking, Rhydon, Golem, and Piloswine while hitting Skarmory, Gengar, and Misdreavus relatively hard. Surf is an alternative that lacks Hydro Pump's low PP and accuracy, but you'll miss the guaranteed 3HKO on Skarmory, Gengar, and Misdreavus and the 2HKO on Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even though Tentacruel can take advantage of the popularity of Thunder with Substitute, Zapdos and Raikou remain two big annoyances. Hence, Pokemon that can check them like Steelix and Snorlax or bait them in like Exeggutor and Gengar are teammates of choice. Likewise, Gengar and Misdreavus usually pack an Electric move, making the aforementioned Steelix, as well as Pursuit users like Tyranitar, Houndoom, and Umbreon, good partners too; Umbreon also deals nicely with another Tentacruel nemesis in Starmie. Outside of those with a natural typing advantage, Tentacruel's enemies include other bulky Pokemon with the ability to damage it significantly or phaze it such as Snorlax, Skarmory, Miltank, and Roar Suicune. Therefore, Pokemon that can cripple most of these like Zapdos, Misdreavus, and Gengar should be considered. Most of Tentacruel's problems are naturally fast Pokemon; thus, it's a good idea to pair it with paralysis spreaders like Exeggutor and Porygon2, which are suited to lure out most of the above targets. This improves Tentacruel's matchup against these significantly, especially if they rely on Thunder to deal with it, as they will be even less likely to break the Substitute. Finally, Tentacruel not only needs to have its checks crippled or out of the picture if it wants to sweep, it also requires a setup opportunity, namely on Pokemon like Cloyster, non-Acid Armor Vaporeon, non-Roar Suicune, Forretress, and Blissey, something greatly appreciated by the likes of Tyranitar and, once again, Steelix, as they tend to draw in most of these Pokemon for Tentacruel to take advantage of.</p>"

        "Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Even if it doesn't act as a sweeper that enjoys the popularity of Cloyster and Forretress, Tentacruel remains a big nuisance to these two with this set. They have no way to keep Tentacruel from getting rid of their Spikes with Rapid Spin, and the best they can do against it is trade themselves for it with Explosion after Tentacruel clears the field. Surf reliably hits Ghost-types neutrally and prevents Ground-types like Marowak and Nidoking from taking advantage of Tentacruel.  Sludge Bomb, when used in tandem with Screech or Curse, allows Tentacruel to directly threaten the likes of Exeggutor and check non-Acid Armor Vaporeon. Screech tends to be more effective against the likes of Snorlax, as Tentacruel doesn't want to fight a Curse war against it; however, Curse still holds some merits, like boosting Tentacruel's Defense and making it a potential wincon in some scenarios. On the other hand, you can opt for a less offensive approach by using Toxic, which bothers just about any Pokemon that isn't a Steel- or Poison-type itself, including Misdreavus, which will have a harder time spinblocking Tentacruel if poisoned. Protect has some desirable features, especially when coupled with Toxic, like stalling for free Leftovers recovery, punishing a reckless Cloyster or Forretress trying to trade with Explosion, and scouting the opposing Pokemon's moves while burning its PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Unlike Starmie, Tentacruel has a hard time against Gengar, which can spinblock it without much trouble; hence, Dark-types like Tyranitar and Umbreon are teammates of choice due to their ability to severely damage Ghost-types with Pursuit. Tentacruel tends to invite dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon in due to its tendency to use Rapid Spin every time it switches in, so Pokemon that can reliably handle them, such as Skarmory, Misdreavus, and Raikou, make for excellent teammates. However, keep in mind that you can cripple all of the aforementioned Pokemon with Toxic. This is something to take into account if you're playing the likes of Nidoking, Zapdos, and Machamp alongside Tentacruel, as they will greatly appreciate having these annoyances poisoned or forced into using Rest.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Graveler is a staple on balance and defensive teams, thanks to its access to the rare Rapid Spin. Spinning away Spikes makes threats such as Xatu and Dugtrio much easier to handle for the defensive teams Graveler fits on. Graveler's ability to scare away the tier's Spiker, Pineco, and the tier's only spinblocker, Gastly, means that it generally doesn't find it difficult to pull off Rapid Spin. Graveler supplements its spinning ability with terrific defensive and offensive utility. On the defensive side, it checks the likes of Fearow and Weezing while absorbing dangerous Normal-type attacks, including Explosion and Self-Destruct. On the offensive side, it has a powerful Earthquake, a very good complementary STAB type in Rock, and the tier's most powerful Explosion. Its Explosion is especially deadly due to how Graveler threatens every Normal-resistant Pokemon, such as Sudowoodo and Magnemite, with its Earthquake. Graveler can use Explosion on common switch-ins such as Octillery, opening a path for teammates such as Xatu and Ninetales.</p> <p>However, Graveler is crippled by a 4x weakness to Water, and thus it needs to run away from Octillery and Dewgong, at least one of which is found on almost every serious NU team. This weakness also means that it can be lured in by Pokemon it's supposed to check, as Weezing can use Hidden Power Water and Pineco can use any of Giga Drain, Toxic, and Hidden Power Water, which can prevent Graveler from safely using Rapid Spin. Graveler also has a severe vulnerability to status, namely Toxic, due to not using Rest. Pokemon that it otherwise checks well such as Ninetales and Persian can cripple it with Toxic and Hypnosis, respectively. Graveler's poor special bulk means it struggles to take hits from Xatu and makes it far less reliable at checking Fire-types. Lastly, Graveler faces competition from other Rock-types; Sudowoodo is much bulkier and lacks 4x weaknesses, while Pupitar is faster than Octillery and uses Screech to answer Curse Normal-types such as Wigglytuff far better than Graveler can.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Earthquake is Graveler's main STAB move, able to at minimum 3HKO every neutral target other than Dewgong and 2HKO frailer Pokemon such as Hitmonlee. Hidden Power Rock is Graveler's secondary STAB move, 2HKOing the likes of Xatu and Pineco and threatening a 3HKO on Dewgong. It has excellent synergy with Earthquake, since it hits every single Ground-resistant and -immune Pokemon for super effective damage, outside of the rare Grass-types. Rapid Spin is Graveler's main niche in the tier and makes it easier for its team to take attacks. Explosion lets Graveler trade itself for an almost guaranteed KO and gives it opportunities to open a path for its teammates if it uses Explosion on the correct target.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that give Pineco opportunities to set up Spikes, such as Gloom, Porygon, Stantler, Primeape, and non Double-Edge Wigglytuff, synergize well with Graveler. In return, Gloom can keep Hidden Power Electric Octillery and Dugtrio in check, while Porygon and Wigglytuff can switch into Dewgong. Gloom is an especially great partner, as it can paralyze Xatu, making it even more scared of switching into Graveler, while checking other major threats to it such as Primeape. Graveler also takes on non-Hidden Power Water Weezing and Fearow for Gloom. Octillery and especially Dewgong love Graveler's ability to keep Spikes off the field, while both can switch into Xatu and Ice Beam Octillery for it. Hitmonlee, Primeape, and Kingler all threaten Octillery and Dewgong and appreciate Rapid Spin support. Houndour Pursuit traps Xatu, which makes it easier for Graveler to spam Earthquake. Houndour also pairs well with other Pokemon that appreciate Graveler, like Gloom and Hitmonlee. Ninetales loves Graveler's ability to lure in and use Explosion on Octillery and can ease pressure off it to check Weezing. Weezing works well with Graveler, as its Explosion in combination with Graveler's Explosion is an amazing form of offense, and Weezing loves not having to deal with Spikes due to not using recovery. Pineco can work well with Graveler, but the two are hard to fit together, as the offensive teams Pineco fits on usually prefer Dugtrio or Pupitar as their Ground-type, while the balance teams Graveler fits on struggle to fit Pineco over a more individually useful Pokemon. However, having Spikes on the opposing side of the field while not having them on your own side can be a massive, sometimes game-winning advantage, making it well worth the teambuilding struggles.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Rest keeps Graveler safe from Toxic, but it leaves it unable to spin away Spikes for two turns and forces it to let in key threats. Curse can let Graveler beat Curse + RestTalk Normal-types, such as Wigglytuff. However, Graveler will sorely miss Explosion, and Sudowoodo is often better at using Curse.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Octillery and Dewgong can immediately threaten out Graveler with their STAB moves. However, both take heavy damage from Graveler's STAB moves and are usually defensive pillars of their team, making it risky to lose them to Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Graveler doesn't use RestTalk, making it vulnerable to status conditions. Pineco can lure it in and cripple it with Toxic, and it can struggle in other otherwise good matchups like Persian, Ninetales, and Weezing due to their ability to poison it or, in Persian's case, shut it down with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although rare, pure Grass-types like Exeggcute and Bayleef resist Earthquake, can take Hidden Power Rock, and scare Graveler away with their STAB moves. Gloom doesn't resist Earthquake but can still threaten a swift OHKO with a Grass-type move or cripple it with Stun Spore or poison from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Although 2HKOed by Hidden Power Rock, Xatu can switch into Earthquake and threaten huge damage due to Graveler's poor Special Defense. Xatu's presence alone makes Graveler hesitant to spam Earthquake at times.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon can outspeed Graveler, is only 3HKOed by Earthquake, and can threaten a cold 2HKO with Ice Beam, set up Curse on it, or Recover stall its Earthquakes. However, Graveler can pressure Porygon to repeatedly use Recover, giving easier switch opportunities to its teammates, while also having the option to trade itself with Explosion. Graveler can also get a critical hit to break right through a Curse-boosted Porygon with its ample opportunities to use Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Graveler's 4x weaknesses to Water and Grass mean that certain Pokemon such as Weezing, Pineco, and Magmar can lure it in and blow it away with Hidden Power Water or Grass.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Although it gets 2HKOed by Earthquake, Dugtrio can easily switch into Hidden Power Rock or Rapid Spin and 2HKO Graveler with Earthquake.</p>"

Rapidash is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, importantly outspeeding Xatu, Fearow, and Primeape, and it hits them and other targets like Stantler and Weezing hard with STAB Fire Blast. Double-Edge allows Rapidash to smack both Octillery and other Fire-types for solid damage, especially with Spikes up. With RestTalk, Rapidash is a good check to Xatu and Weezing, can check Primeape well when used in conjunction with Pineco and Xatu, and shuts down Ninetales and Magmar. It is also a good switch-in to Magnemite, Pineco, and Gloom, with its Gloom-checking capabilities being extra important if Rapidash's teammate Xatu forgoes RestTalk.</p> <p>Rapidash primarily struggles with a lack of power without Spikes in comparison to its fellow Fire-types. Rapidash does not have the same raw power as Flareon and Magmar or the bulk that Ninetales has, and it heavily struggles to break through Octillery, Dewgong, Pupitar, and Graveler without Spikes support, making the aid of Pineco or Delibird practically mandatory. Xatu is one of Rapidash's best partners, pairing to put pressure on essential targets like Octillery, Dewgong, Porygon, and Wigglytuff. Xatu can further exemplify its capability to spread damage by slotting Thief and Confuse Ray over Rest and Sleep Talk, which can potentially nail Dewgong or Porygon and enables both it and Rapidash to break better. Xatu also checks Kingler fairly well, which otherwise gets free setup on Rapidash and poses a serious threat. Hidden Power Electric Octillery is another strong teammate for Rapidash, working as a decent switch-in to opposing Octillery and Rock- and Ground-types like Sudowoodo and Graveler while stacking on another strong offensive threat. RestTalk Stantler, Primeape, and Wigglytuff are all solid switch-ins to Chinchou and especially Dewgong, which might otherwise be difficult for Rapidash to handle. Primeape is an especially effective choice alongside Rapidash because it can heavily pressure opposing Normal- and Rock-types like Stantler, Wigglytuff, and Graveler, and it appreciates Rapidash's ability to check Weezing and Xatu. Dewgong is an alternative to Octillery that, although it loses out on a significant amount of power, makes for a more robust defensive core against Fearow, Flareon, Graveler, Pupitar, and Dugtrio. Dewgong also enjoys Rapidash checking Primeape and Sunny Day Ninetales, which Dewgong is usually a liability against.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Slowbro is one of the most powerful Pokemon in GSC UU. Its bulk and typing allow it to switch in and sponge attacks, while its base 100 Special Attack means that it can fire off powerful hits too. Access to Thunder Wave limits what even Pokemon with super effective moves can safely do against it. These factors mean that Slowbro can both offensively and defensively check many of the Pokemon in GSC UU. It can stick around for a long time with Rest and Sleep Talk, which allow its presence to be felt for most of the games that it is used in while also being able to absorb status-inducing moves for its teammates. When constructing teams and while playing games, one must always consider how to threaten an opposing Slowbro.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally speaking, Slowbro's standard options are too great to pass up; however, with the right team support, certain moves can be dropped. Instead of Thunder Wave, Zap Cannon can be used to help against opposing Slowbro and provide paralysis support for teammates. There are other coverage moves such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam that can be used to surprise Grass-type Pokemon that are not weak to Psychic and also to allow Slowbro to hit Scyther harder. If Slowbro drops Sleep Talk, Swagger can be used alongside Thunder Wave to increase the chances of putting offensive Pokemon out of commission, while Counter may be used to take advantage of some boosted physical attackers that may think they can break past Slowbro, such as Granbull. However, these options are quite gimmicky, as Counter will likely only fool your opponent once and leave Slowbro weakened, and Swagger runs the risk of the opposing Pokemon not hitting itself in confusion. Additionally, either of these moves would most likely replace Sleep Talk, so Slowbro's ability to absorb status would be reduced. Reflect means that Slowbro has a better time against Granbull and non-Hidden Power Bug Scyther and can provide good general team support. Belly Drum makes for an interesting option, but there are more viable users of this move in the tier. Finally, Toxic can also be used in order to force other Slowbro to use Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: All Electric-types can pressure Slowbro offensively with a hard hitting Thunder or Thunderbolt, and aggressive play from these Pokemon with Spikes support can pressure Slowbro by forcing it to switch and take residual damage. Electabuzz can Pursuit trap Slowbro too, which applies even more pressure to it. However, Magneton and Electabuzz can have trouble switching into Slowbro as Surf 3HKOes both, and Electabuzz especially does not appreciate the risk of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: While Nidoqueen loses to Slowbro one-on-one, if Slowbro tries to switch in, Nidoqueen can punish it by predicting the switch and using Thunder, which has a chance to 2HKO Slowbro with Spikes damage and can also inflict paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Slowbro, Slowking, and Chansey</strong>: Opposing Slowbro and Slowking can force a stall war with Slowbro, while Chansey can threaten Slowbro with Present and set up Light Screen for its teammates that would usually find difficulty in beating it one-on-one like Granbull. In the common Slowbro versus Slowbro or Slowking matchup, the aim is typically to waste the foe's PP until they no longer want to risk using any more, or else the Pokemon becomes useless. This can generate potential free switches once the opponent begins to conserve Sleep Talk's PP. Thunder Wave also puts PP wars in your favor and makes it much more difficult for the opposing Slowbro or Slowking to check their usual threats.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance-boosted Physical Attackers</strong>: While Granbull finds difficulty taking on Slowbro by itself, if it recieves an Attack boost from Scyther, it can punch through Slowbro with its Return. Pinsir and Scyther can also force Slowbro out with the threat of a boosted Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Lanturn is perhaps the best Slowbro counter in the game, fearing nothing from it and threatening it with STAB Thunder. Gyarados can threaten to 3HKO Slowbro with Thunder but should avoid coming in on Psychic or Thunder Wave. RestTalk Blastoise and Politoed are bulky enough to avoid the 3HKO from Psychic, but both will be forced out by Special Defense drops or potentially KOed by a critical hit, and they don't pose an immediate threat back to Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types not weak to Psychic like Jumpluff and Bellossom check Slowbro well in the short term, provided that they avoid Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Hypno and Mr. Mime can beat or outlast Slowbro one-on-one. Hypno can come in on Slowbro, set up Light Screen and shrug off hits with Rest, and Mr. Mime can hit it with a powerful Thunder.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slowbro can maintain its offensive and defensive presence with only its STAB attacks, which makes it a great candidate for a Sleep Talk user. Psychic offers a chance to drop the foe's Special Defense while Surf has a slightly higher Base Power; together, these two moves hit the entire tier neutrally save for opposing Slowbro and Slowking. Rest and Sleep Talk grant Slowbro longevity so that it can sponge hits and dish out attacks more consistently while also reducing the disadvantages caused by status ailments. Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative to one of Slowbro's STAB attacks, as it offers support for Slowbro's teammates and threatens to cripple sweepers such as Scyther. However, because Thunder Wave does nothing against Nidoqueen, it can sometimes be a liability when selected by Sleep Talk, reducing Slowbro's consistency. Slowbro will also have a harder time threatening Poison-types such as Qwilfish if it drops Psychic or Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime if it drops Surf.</p> <p>If Slowbro is running dual STAB attacks, it has a favorable matchup against both Nidoqueen and Granbull. Nidoqueen is unlikely to 2HKO Slowbro with Thunder after Spikes, and Sleep Talk is guaranteed to pull a useful attack against it. Granbull fails to 3HKO Slowbro before using Curse and fails to 2HKO after a Curse, whereas Slowbro reliably 3HKOes Granbull in return with its STAB attacks. Dodrio, opposing Slowbro, and Slowking are also some notable Pokemon that Slowbro checks along with Ground-types like Sandslash and Piloswine. Scyther, however, is not checked by Slowbro, as it can Baton Pass Attack boosts to Granbull, allowing it to 2HKO Slowbro.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbroâ€™s ability to sponge hits and still have some firepower of its own mean that it can fit on most playstyles, so it has many viable team options; however, there are certain Pokemon that can help Slowbro be a more dominant presence. Pokemon that can switch into Electric-type Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Ampharos, Bellossom, and Quagsire, are great partners for Slowbro. Pokemon that can pressure opposing Slowbro and Slowking, such as Nidoqueen, Ampharos, and a boosted Granbull, pair well with Slowbro, as those two foes wall it. Many of these Pokemon also function well in tandem with Slowbro's ability to spread paralysis. Finally, Slowbro is also a great partner for the rare Growth + Baton Pass Flareon, as a Special Attack boost lets Slowbro exert more offensive pressure.</p>"

  "Magnemite": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Due to Magnemite's amazing Steel typing, high Special Attack, and difficult-to-resist STAB Thunder, it can make for an excellent long-term defensive answer to Xatu and Fearow that's capable of repeatedly switching in on them to fire off attacks, battering away at the opposing team. On the surface, Magnemite may seem difficult to justify over its fellow Electric-type, Chinchou, which is much faster, has STAB-boosted Surf, and resists Water, allowing it to switch into Octillery and Dewgong unlike Magnemite with its low Special Defense. The primary reason for Magnemite's use is that it is arguably one of the best answers to Xatu and Fearow, two of the strongest and most dangerous offensive forces in the tier; it also answers Persian remarkably well. However, Magnemite is plagued by common Pokemon that take advantage of its weaknesses, such as Ninetales, Rapidash, Dugtrio, and Primeape. Magnemite isn't completely helpless against these threats, though, as Thunder paralysis is extremely crippling and Dugtrio does not want to repeatedly switch into Magnemite in fear of Hidden Power Ice. However, Magnemite has some severely crippling and unavoidable issues, namely Thunder's poor 70% accuracy and often being forced into predicting what the right move to use is, such as whether to use Thunder on the Octillery right in front of it or Hidden Power Ice to hit the Dugtrio that may come in.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is an option over Thunder to more reliably check threats like Stantler and Kingler that can take advantage of a miss, but it makes Magnemite weaker against Wigglytuff, and the lower power and paralysis chance are undesirable. Reflect can be used over Hidden Power Ice to assist with a team's ability to switch into threats that take advantage of Magnemite, like Dugtrio and Stantler; however, Magnemite completely loses out on the ability to harm foes like Dugtrio and Gloom that resist Electric, and Reflect generally does very little when called by Sleep Talk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Dugtrio punish Magnemite for using Thunder and can come in freely to scare it out and deal damage. Dugtrio also packs Substitute, which uses the turn given to hide behind cover and ease prediction; however, Dugtrio takes quite a lot of damage from Hidden Power Ice and does not want to repeatedly come in, especially with Spikes on the field or when the opponent has a healthy Octillery or Dewgong to handle it. Due to the way Magnemite can often be forced into using Hidden Power Ice to not let Ground-types in for free, other Pokemon can use that to come in and threaten Magnemite, improving on a team's ability to play around Magnemite. Pupitar and Graveler can also handle Magnemite, though Pupitar is generally niche and uncommon, while Graveler is slower than Magnemite and has even worse Special Defense than Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ninetales counters Magnemite, as it is bulky to the point where it can almost avoid a 3HKO from Thunder, is faster, packs Rest and often Sleep Talk to heal off any damage or paralysis, and has STAB Flamethrower to melt Magnemite; however, Ninetales can still be afraid of switching straight into a Thunder with Spikes up, as if it gets paralyzed, it may be in range of another Thunder. Rapidash is a very similar story, though it has less bulk, instead being more offensively dangerous to compensate and even directly taking advantage of opposing Ninetales attempting to switch into Magnemite to fire off a strong Double-Edge and potentially overwhelm the opponentâ€™s answers to Rapidash, primarily Octillery and Dewgong. Magmar and Flareon do not pack recovery moves, so they are less eager to switch into Thunder but are much more offensively dangerous than either Rapidash or Ninetales.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Primeape and Hitmonlee are able to come in easily on Hidden Power Ice and outspeed and OHKO Magnemite with Cross Chop and High Jump Kick. Primeape can even use Substitute to take advantage of the free turn given by Magnemite switching out. Meanwhile, Hitmonlee has RestTalk to heal off any damage or paralysis. However, Primeape is 2HKOed by Thunder and utterly despises paralysis, while Hitmonlee can easily be chipped into 2HKO range of Thunder and also doesn't enjoy paralysis. Weezing has easy entry on Hidden Power Ice and can tank a Thunder or twoâ€”bar if it is paralyzedâ€”and is both faster and often uses Fire Blast for Magnemite, though coming in on it repeatedly wears Weezing down quickly, especially if it eats a Thunder, and Weezing is often forced into choosing the right move on the switch in fear of giving free entry to Xatu or Dugtrio. Stantler has Earthquake to deal with Magnemite, is faster, and almost always uses Light Screen + Curse or RestTalk to improve on its longevity and threat level, though it takes massive damage from Thunder on the switch and, if paralyzed, may fall to a second Thunder. Kingler, and occasionally other Pokemon like Gloom, can use Hidden Power Ground to deal with Magnemite. Kingler even runs Substitute often, which takes advantage of any Rest, Hidden Power Ice, or Thunder miss pulled by Sleep Talk, and it is much faster than Magnemite and learns Swords Dance to become a major threat to boot. However, Kingler cannot switch directly into Magnemite in fear of being OHKOed by Thunder.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunder is preferred to Thunderbolt to hit switch-ins harder; it 2HKOes Rapidash and Stantler after Spikes, hits Octillery and other Electric-weak targets for a potential OHKO, more reliably paralyzes foes, and is capable of 3HKOing bulky Normal-types like Wigglytuff. Hidden Power Ice is the best coverage option Magnemite has to hit Pokemon that resist Electric such as Dugtrio, Graveler, and Gloom, and it also provides a second way to hit Flying-type Pokemon with perfect accuracy or while using Sleep Talk. RestTalk keeps Magnemite healthy throughout the course of a game to take advantage of its useful defensive typing, primarily making it a strong long-term check to Xatu, Fearow, and Persian that can consistently use them as an opportunity to fire off Thunder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnemite's favorite partner is Xatu, which can cover for Pokemon that can threaten Magnemite, including Weezing, Primeape, and Dugtrio; in return, Magnemite can defeat Wigglytuff, Fearow, and Porygon. Magnemite adores Pineco's Spikes because its main answers, Dugtrio, Rapidash, and Ninetales, all take damage from Spikes, wearing them down and making it easier for Magnemite to muscle through them over time, especially with paralysis from Thunder. Both Graveler and Pineco can use Rapid Spin to clear opposing Spikes so that Magnemite doesn't take damage itself. Ninetales and Rapidash take on Fire-types like opposing Ninetales and Magmar as well as other Magnemite, which Magnemite can struggle with. Magnemite appreciates Rapidash especially, as it can severely threaten Ninetales and forces Water-types like Octillery and Dewgong to use Rest often, giving Magnemite a potential free entry to fire off an attack. Octillery and Dewgong are also prime candidates for partnering with Magnemite, being roadblocks for Dugtrio and acting as better checks to other Octillery and Dewgong than Magnemite, as it does not resist Water and thus takes significant damage from Surf. Weezing and Fearow both handle Primeape and Hitmonlee and assist with pressuring Stantler. Fearow also forces Octillery and Dewgong to use Rest more often, providing entry points for Magnemite, similarly to Rapidash. Primeape and Hitmonlee themselves also enjoy Magnemite's presence, as it can cover for their weaknesses to Xatu and Fearow while in return threatening Stantler. Hitmonlee additionally deals with Octillery, Dewgong, and Chinchou well. Dugtrio also synergizes well with Magnemite, threatening Fire-types like Rapidash and Ninetales and appreciating its ability to take on Xatu and pressure Octillery.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Magneton is a really cool Pokemon, but it's also kind of an oddball. Like Ampharos and Lanturn, Magneton lacks the distinguishing Speed of most Electric-types. Gaining a Steel typing gave it a few more resistances, and it has good Defense, but it also has horrible HP (also, its Special Defense leaves something to be desired). Its movepool is pretty limited, but it does have awesome Special Attack and STAB on Thunderbolt. Magneton is a good choice for a UU team, as it can counter all of those Curse + RestTalk Pokemon with Reflect and repeated Thunderbolts. In order to work in OU, however, Magneton needs support to take out those special walls that will almost always block it. Once they are out of the way, however, Magneton can actually be a formidable opponent, and that resistance to Normal attacks can always come in handy.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The type of Hidden Power you use can vary widely; in addition to Water, viable choices include Ice for most Ground- and Grass-types, Grass for most Ground-types, and Fire for Grass-types and Steelix. Reflect is good to pass around the team, and if your team is cut out for it, you can use Toxic on special walls (Snorlax especially) and make them take damage every turn. The poison damage Snorlax takes in addition to a Thunderbolt will translate into a good chunk of its health.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Prediction, really. Anything that has a Ground, Fire, or Fighting move will kill Magneton, but make sure it can absorb a strong Thunderbolt or Hidden Power. The most obvious counters are Blissey, Snorlax, and Fire Punch Electabuzz and Ampharos.</p>",
      "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>No Magnet Pull here, but Magneton can still manage. The general idea is to Substitute when you get in to prevent any kind of status afflictions, and then go from there. Hidden Power Water is optimal for the super effective coverage on Nidoking, Steelix, Rhydon, and Golem. If your opponent sends in Exeggutor or a special wall, Thunder Wave will ensure that they don't leave completely unscathed. If you're using Magneton in a completely UU environment, you might want to opt for Hidden Power Grass for a cool 4x coverage on Quagsire.</p>"}}

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>With solid special bulk, an excellent STAB combination, and good utility moves, Dewgong is an excellent tank in NU. Its dual STAB combination of Surf and Ice Beam keeps a large chunk of the metagame at bay, dealing at least neutral damage to all Pokemon that aren't Water-types while threatening passive Water-types with an Ice Beam freeze. It also hits a wide variety of common threats super effectively, including Xatu, Magmar, Rapidash, Pupitar, Dugtrio, and Gloom. Dewgong is one of the most solid answers to Xatu, the top threat of NU, as it is only 5HKOed by Psychic and threatens a 2HKO against Xatu with Ice Beam, which most specially bulky Pokemon cannot hope to achieve. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk gives it longevity, the ability to absorb status, and a chance to damage any check that might try to take advantage of its sleep turns to switch in. Dewgong can also run Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass to deter Water-types. The former deals a heavy blow to Mantine, while the latter chips the threatening Chinchou. However, while they are useful against Kingler and its low Special Defense, they are typically inferior to the standard attacks, as bulkier Water-types like Dewgong and Azumarill just shrug them off regardless, and losing a STAB move makes Dewgong a liability against either Fire- or Grass-types.</p> <p>Dewgong and Gloom synergize with each other very well; while Gloom can deal with threatening Pokemon Dewgong can't handle such as Primeape, Hitmonlee, and Chinchou, Dewgong is able to threaten Xatu and opposing Fire-types that can 2HKO or OHKO Gloom. Its ability to switch into Xatu makes Dewgong a good supporting Pokemon for Fighting-types like Primeape, a very dangerous sweeper that typically wants to avoid Xatu. Dewgong requires support in the form of an offensive presence towards the Pokemon that tend to take advantage of it. Xatu's STAB Psychic functions as a deterrent for Water-types like the threatening Kingler that can endure Dewgong's STAB moves and set up with Substitute and Swords Dance. Dewgong's moveset and defensive traits won't quite cut it on their own to stop the metagame's physical Normal-types from running over a team. Stantler and Fearow have a high damage output and outspeed Dewgong, while Lickitung, Dunsparce, and Wigglytuff can withstand a few attacks and slowly set up with Swords Dance or Curse. It's only natural that Normal-resistant Pokemon can come to its aid. Sudowoodo can take a few hits from Stantler and non-Belly Drum Lickitung and threaten to remove them with Self-Destruct. Shuckle is another valid option due to its phenomenal defenses and typing, which let it sit in on anything that Normal-types may throw at it and stall them out. One of Dewgong's key flaws is its weakness to Rock-type attacks, so it can be effective to pair Dewgong with another Water-type, such as Kingler or Octillery.</p>"
        },
        "Toxic Support": {
          "description": "<p>GSC NU's fast-paced metagame can sometimes leave Dewgong with RestTalk lagging behind: Curse Normal-types can set up in its face, Kingler easily takes advantage of it, and even Fire-types can set up Sunny Day in its face to take reduced damage from an already fairly weak Surf. Nevertheless, Dewgong can make use of its bulk and unique movepool to punish some of its more audacious foes. Many of the Pokemon that can take advantage of Dewgong, such as Primeape, Kingler, Sneasel, and Sunny Day Magmar, despise getting poisoned. Ice Beam as the chosen STAB move allows Dewgong to threaten Xatu and Gloom while using Toxic to put pressure on most everything else. Protect lengthens Dewgong's lifespan and has good synergy with Toxic while also granting the player a chance to scout moves. Certain variants of Toxic Dewgong may include Surf as a means to threaten Magnemite and RestTalk Sudowoodo, which can otherwise take advantage of Dewgong. Encore is used to punish setup Pokemon and other foes that think they can take advantage of Dewgong, such as Kingler, Wigglytuff, and Sunny Day Fire-types. Dewgong can even switch into Surf from Chinchou and prevent it from using Thunder on the next turn thanks to its higher Speed stat. Rest can work even without Sleep Talk, as Dewgong can withstand a few hits from foes such as Xatu and Octillery. This makes Dewgong a bit less susceptible to status, but sleep makes it easier to take advantage of, so Protect is preferred in most circumstances.</p> <p>Of all the support Pokemon that Dewgong likes to pair with, Gloom is definitely one of the better options. Gloom is immune to Toxic and resists all STAB moves from two of the biggest threats to Dewgong, Primeape and Chinchou. Gloom and Dewgong form a very solid defensive core to counterbalance the common Xatu + Fire- and Fighting-type offensive archetypes, and an even greater synergy forms when Ninetales is added to the mix. Ninetales is a specially bulky Pokemon that can help defend against Xatu if Dewgong is low on health, hinders Sunny Day teams by virtue of its typing, and has Roar to shut down any Baton Pass users that may switch into Gloom, such as Flareon and Ledian. Since Dewgong's lack of Surf can make it weak to opposing Rock-types and incapable of threatening Magnemite, the only Steel-type in the tier with access to a powerful Thunder, Pupitar can be effective to initially check these threats. Weezing is another solid teammate that can take on Primeape and has Haze to prevent setup sweepers from breaking through the defensive core. It has solid offensive coverage in Fire Blast and Thunder and can take potential threats down with Explosion. Other Pokemon that like Dewgong's support are Hitmonlee and Xatu. Dewgong can handle Xatu for Hitmonlee, which can remove Spikes with Rapid Spin and also take on Chinchou for it. Xatu benefits from Dewgong defending against faster Pokemon like Dugtrio and Rapidash, while it can use its STAB Psychic to threaten Fighting-types like Hitmonlee and Primeape, dangerous threats such as Kingler, and Weezing, which might use Explosion to remove Dewgong. Pineco grants offensive utility with Spikes to a team that might rely too heavily on stalling out the opponent. Reflect also allows Pineco to support its team against the aforementioned Fighting-types, and Rapid Spin can keep Dewgong from being worn down by Spikes.</p>"
        },
        "Growth Pass Recipient": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Dewgong is one of the scariest Growth recipients in the tier, since it is extremely bulky and fast enough to outspeed threats to it such as Weezing and Chinchou. It is able to 2HKO or 3HKO every Pokemon in the tier at +1 Special Attack, with the exception of other Dewgong, which still cannot deal significant damage back unless they run Toxic. Ice Beam threatens to OHKO common Pokemon such as Xatu, Fearow, and Gloom after a boost. Ice Beam also makes sure Dewgong cannot be answered by Grass-types like Stun Spore Gloom and Tangela. Surf, meanwhile, is important so that Dewgong is not answered by Fire-types like Ninetales and Magmar, as if it chose to run a set with Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, and RestTalk, Dewgong would fail to do meaningful damage to them, and the Growth pass attempt would be wasted. Hidden Power Grass hits opposing Water-types like Octillery and other Dewgong; while it has worse DV requirements than Hidden Power Electric, Hidden Power Electric cannot hit Chinchou super effectively. After a boost, Dewgong is favored to 2HKO Chinchou and is guaranteed to 3HKO Octillery with Hidden Power Grass, and although it only has a miniscule chance to 3HKO other Dewgong, RestTalk Dewgong cannot do meaningful damage back and will fall to an eventual high roll or critical hit. However, Toxic + Encore sets can shut down even a boosted Dewgong fairly easily. Flareon can also potentially pull off using Growth twice before executing a Baton Pass to Dewgong, in which case all Pokemon that only get 3HKOed by a +1 Dewgong will now be 2HKOed. Protect is crucial for blocking a use of Explosion by Weezing or Pineco that attempt to take down Dewgong before it can do any more damage. Protect also allows Dewgong to freely gain additional Leftovers recovery and is a large part of making Dewgong so frustrating to take down, with it seemingly staying alive for so long and causing so much havoc despite taking several hard hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aside from the mandatory Growth + Baton Pass Flareon, Weezing makes for a strong partner, as Primeape and Hitmonlee aren't 2HKOed by a +1 Dewgong and outspeed it to 2HKO back with Cross Chop and High Jump Kick, respectively. Primeape even has an increased chance to land an OHKO on Dewgong due to Cross Chopâ€™s boosted critical hit rate. Weezing hard counters the Fighting-types and uses them to fire off attacks, and it can make for a short-term Fearow switch-in or a lure for potential threats to Growth pass like Dugtrio, Ninetales, and Wigglytuff, being able to eliminate them with Explosion. Xatu also helps out with the Fighting-types and complements Dewgong nicely, as it is the main recipient of Growth when encountering a team with a Fighting-type thanks to its Speed and STAB Psychic, while Dewgong is the main choice of Growth recipient into most other teams, especially ones with Fearow. Lead dual screens Dragonair makes starting off the game with a Flareon setup and using Baton Pass to pass Growth to to Dewgong safely much easier, allowing Dewgong to act as a wallbreaker early-game. Curse Wigglytuff and Stantler are effective choices on a Growth pass team to take advantage of the huge holes broken in the opposing team by a boosted Dewgong before it goes down, often being able to overwhelm the opponent and clean up the rest of the game. They are also able to switch into Chinchou and, to a lesser extent, Magnemite, which would otherwise be problematic for Growth pass teams because they usually forgo an Electric-resistant Pokemon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Muk is by no means a fantastic Pokemon, but it has a few unique traits that distinguish it as viable. Its large HP, Attack, and Special Defense allow it to have decent matchups versus Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune. Furthermore, its access to Curse and ability to outpace Snorlax mean that it has the potential to hold its ground against it in a one-on-one matchup. Muk's access to Explosion makes it a decent fit on offensive teams centered around the move, and with Curse, Muk is one of the best Pokemon at forcing at least a trade, similarly to Curse + Explosion Steelix and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax.</p> <p>However, Muk has a bad Speed tier, and its typing doesn't grant it many useful resistances. Besides Machamp without Earthquake and Heracross, it doesn't check any offensive threats well. If Muk has been worn down, many faster Pokemon are capable of revenge killing it. Muk can also have a hard time dealing with non-Steel-type Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb and Explosion like Gengar, Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon. These flaws make it difficult to justify Muk's place on offensive teams over other Explosion users like Exeggutor and Gengar, which offer significantly more defensive utility and are more effective at luring Pokemon like Raikou, Snorlax, and Zapdos. However, Muk distinguishes itself by majorly threatening stall teams with its coverage, Toxic immunity, and ability to boost with Curse.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giga Drain is Muk's most viable other option, enabling it to hit Rhydon and Golem for massive damage. Since Muk is faster than both of these Pokemon, it can even force them out if they're hit on the switch; it also hits Cloyster super effectively. However, without Curse, Muk will not be able to pressure Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, Misdreavus, Vaporeon and even Psychic-less Starmie nearly as effectively. While Giga Drain alleviates pressure from the likes of Golem and Rhydon and can even serve to bait in these Pokemon, it can make Muk significantly less dangerous overall and force it to use Explosion to go for a trade much earlier in the game.</p> <p>Besides Giga Drain, Muk doesn't have many other viable options. Dynamic Punch could be used to bait Tyranitar, other Rock-types, and also deal significant damage to Snorlax. Zap Cannon and Thunder can be used to spread paralysis and hit Skarmory and Cloyster, but other Pokemon are significantly better at doing this, and Fire Blast is much more consistent, especially against Forretress and Steelix. Thief can be used with no item on hand to steal a foe's item, but the loss of a coverage move or Curse is almost never worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Ground-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Rhydon, Golem, Nidoking, and Marowak resist Sludge Bomb, shrug off Fire Blast, and can all threaten Muk with a powerful Earthquake; Rhydon, Golem, and Tyranitar additionally resist Explosion, but they would hate to get poisoned unless they carry Rest. If Tyranitar doesn't carry Earthquake, it might not be immediately threatening against Muk, which could stay in and try to inflict poison with Sludge Bomb. Rhydon and Golem resist Explosion, but they don't want to take a Giga Drain in the rare case that Muk is carrying it. Marowak and Nidoking need to watch out for Explosion, and Muk can also inflict poison on the former. There are also a few niche defensive Rock-types that can check Muk quite well or at worst trade with it. Shuckle, Omastar, and Aerodactyl shrug off Muk's common attacks, resist Explosion, and carry Rest to cure poison from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory and Steelix resist Explosion and are completely immune to Sludge Bomb. They need to watch out for Fire Blast, but can take one hit from it if necessary. While Steel-types don't check Muk well overall, they can still be very useful due to their Poison immunity and resistance to Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are immune to Explosion and shrug off all of Muk's other attacks, although Sludge Bomb can poison Misdreavus. Gengar and Misdreavus can threaten Muk with Hypnosis and even a combination of Mean Look and Perish Song, but Perish trap Misdreavus should only check Muk as a last resort, since it doesn't want to be poisoned. Without these moves, Misdreavus will struggle versus Muk because a +1 Sludge Bomb from Muk does more damage to Misdreavus than a Psychic does back to Muk. Gengar's Thunder does about as much damage to Muk as its Fire Blast does back, so this matchup without earlier-mentioned moves is about even until they trade when Gengar decides to use Explosion, assuming neither Pokemon switches out.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor and Jynx can hit Muk with a strong Psychic or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder and Lovely Kiss. Neither of these Pokemon wants to take a Sludge Bomb or Explosion, however, so they must be careful when trying to check Muk. Starmie can switch into Muk relatively well and can 2HKO it with Psychic after Spikes while not minding Poison that much thanks to Recover; however, it risks trading itself with Muk, as Muk can often be paired with sweepers that want Starmie gone, like Vaporeon. Overall, Psychic-types can offensively threaten Muk but none can switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune can use Rest to cure poison from Sludge Bomb and wear down Muk to the point at which it will either use Explosion or be easily revenge killed by another teammate. That said, this can often be to the Muk user's advantage, as it often aims to trade with these Pokemon. Only use Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune to check Muk if you don't mind trading with it or if you have no other checks on your team.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: RestTalk Umbreon can reduce Muk's Attack with Charm and check it quite well; however, it risks trading itself for Muk if the Muk user decides to use Explosion as Umbreon switches in.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster has very high Defense, so it can take advantage of Muk by setting up Spikes early-game; however, Muk could use Cloyster to set up Curse, potentially forcing it to use Explosion. Although Cloyster's Explosion doesn't OHKO Muk after one Curse boost, it still deals a large amount of damage.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to maximize Muk's potential versus top threats in the metagame like Snorlax, Zapdos, and Raikou while also trying to cover as much ground as possible. Sludge Bomb has strong neutral coverage, can be quite powerful with a Curse boost or two under its belt, and can spread poison decently well. Fire Blast can hit Skarmory and Steelix on the switch with high odds to 2HKO them and also hits Forretress for an OHKO. Explosion can be used in a pinch to remove most Pokemon from the battle. Curse gives Muk decent odds versus Snorlax in a one-on-one matchup and can also enable Muk to threaten Vaporeon, Machamp, Suicune, Misdreavus, and Electric-types with Sludge Bomb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Muk fits best on offensive teams centered around Explosion. Cloyster is an important teammate that lays down Spikes for Muk, making it more difficult to switch into, and forces Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon out, like Rhydon and Golem. Vaporeon fits well with Muk, as it appreciates Muk's decent matchup versus Electric-types and ability to use Explosion. Tyranitar can use Pursuit to trap Gengar and Misdreavus, which can be nice because both Pokemon are immune to Explosion. If you're using Muk with a Pursuit trapper, a Snorlax set with Curse, Lovely Kiss, Double-Edge / Body Slam, and Rest can work effectively because Muk can serve as an emergency backup check for Electric-types in case Snorlax gets pressured while asleep. While Muk can take Thunder from Raikou and Zapdos reasonably well, it would prefer to only switch into it if necessary, as it would be forced into Explosion mind games earlier than it'd like. Muk also has some potential as a breaker on a more defensive team alongside Skarmory and Raikou, which works due to the lack of Pokemon that are able to completely wall it. Muk can support Curse Snorlax with a Fire-type move quite well, as it can often inflict poison on common checks like Rock-types and Misdreavus.</p> <p>Houndoom is a niche pick, but it has decent offensive synergy with Muk because it can trap Ghost-types as well as Exeggutor and Jynx with Pursuit while resisting both of their STAB moves. In return, Houndoom appreciates Muk's Explosion to remove threats like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, and Vaporeon. Using Houndoom alongside Muk compounds a Ground-type weakness, however, so proceed with caution.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is one of the most important Pokemon in GSC Ubers mainly due to its access to Spikes, although it also has other virtues. Spikes gives teammates like Zapdos and offensive Mewtwo some extra help in threatening Pokemon like Snorlax and Raikou. Cloyster excels at providing offensive utility in other ways as well, with its decently strong STAB Surf dealing damage to every Pokemon that resists Normal that would try and pivot into Explosion, namely Tyranitar, Steelix, Golem, and Gengar. Furthermore, Cloyster's access to supportive moves like Toxic, Icy Wind, and potentially Rapid Spin gives it surprising depth in what it can do to support its team.</p> <p>However, while Cloyster's Defense stat is gigantic, it cannot switch in constantly on physical attackers like Snorlax during longer games. Because of this, it faces direct competition with Forretress, as the latter's Normal resistance and, more importantly, Toxic immunity mean that it can come onto the field with more ease and excel in longer, drawn-out games, whereas Cloyster excels at fast-paced offense. Cloyster's Special Defense is abysmal and, due to it being very common, teams are prepared for it and may run special attacks on their physical attackers, namely Thunder on Mew and sometimes even Snorlax. Lastly, different status conditions like poison and paralysis can force Cloyster to go sooner on the offensive with Explosion, with Cloyster usually trading poison with another Cloyster. This worsens Cloyster's ability to be a mid-game switch-in to Snorlax, Golem, and Tyranitar.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icy Wind can be used over Toxic if Cloyster wants to slow down foes switching into it like Mewtwo, Zapdos, Celebi, and Gengar; Icy Wind allows Cloyster to play mind games with the opponent, as Explosion will KO every slowed Pokemon bar Gengar. This, however, makes Cloyster unable to make significant progress against boosted Curse users like Snorlax.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Surf for Cloyster to deal heavy damage to Zapdos while having the chance to freeze foes. However, by running Ice Beam, Cloyster becomes checked by Forretress and Tyranitar, making the Cloyster user lose important momentum and role compression.</p> <p>Rest makes Cloyster more durable for bulkier teams that need its ability to constantly keep Spikes off the field. However, using Rest means that Cloyster will have to give up Toxic, which makes Cloyster incapable of making progress against foes like Snorlax, Zapdos, and Celebi.</p> <p>Cloyster can run Protect on Rapid Spin sets to take advantage of Leftovers's passive recovery while having the added benefit of potentially blocking Explosion and Self Destruct from the likes of Mew and Snorlax. It is best used with Heal Bell support from Celebi and Blissey because Cloyster will often be using Rapid Spin against opposing Cloyster, getting hit by Toxic in the process.</p> <p>Screech is an option that Cloyster can run to take out even Defense-boosted Pokemon like Snorlax. This works best on playstyles like paralysis spam that prefer spreading status other than poison while still needing Cloyster's ability to switch into Snorlax and threaten Tyranitar.</p> <p>Clamp is an option alongside Screech if Cloyster wants to trap and KO boosted Pokemon. However, it is very unreliable and might not guarantee taking out what it is supposed to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rapid Spin users</strong>: Starmie is one of the greatest annoyances for Cloyster as it threatens to remove its Spikes while also threatening Cloyster with a powerful Psychic or Thunderbolt. Forretress is another Rapid Spin user that, while not as good as Starmie at keeping Spikes off the field against Cloyster, can still use Toxic on it alongside Protect to wear it down. Lastly, if Cloyster is poisoned with Toxic, Golem will also be an annoyance for it, as it can always use Rapid Spin for free as Cloyster switches into it.</p> <p><strong>Special attackers</strong>: Due to Cloyster's abysmal Special Defense, Pokemon like Mewtwo, Jolteon, Zapdos, Raikou, and Gengar all threaten to OHKO Cloyster and force it out. Ho-Oh can also switch into Surf and threaten to take out a Cloyster at half HP. However, Ho-Oh must be careful of Icy Wind and Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic from the likes of opposing Cloyster heavily punishes Cloyster by wearing it down quickly, making it more likely it will need to use Explosion as it loses more HP from poison. Furthermore, a poisoned Cloyster will have a tougher time keeping Spikes on the field if the opposing team has a Rapid Spin user.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are immune to Explosion and can force Cloyster out with Thunder and Thunderbolt. Gengar is immune to Toxic and is not hurt too badly by Surf, meaning that it will be switching regularly into Cloyster and posing a threat to its team. They can also potentially block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers with Electric-type coverage</strong>: Because Cloyster is extremely common, physical attackers like Mew may slot Thunder onto their moveset to lure it in. Albeit uncommon, Tyranitar can use Thunderbolt to always 2HKO Cloyster. Lastly, Snorlax can also use Thunder to KO Cloyster in conjuction with Double-Edge.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is a fantastic progress maker for teams because of its guaranteed chip damage against every foe bar Flying-types. Pokemon like Mewtwo, Zapdos, and Mew all become far more threatening to consistently check for the opposing team with Spikes up. Surf is Cloyster's main STAB move that hits Pokemon that might switch into it, like Gengar, for decent damage. It also allows Cloyster to check Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon like Tyranitar, Golem, Steelix, and Marowak. Toxic is Cloyster's main tool for making progress against Flying-type Pokemon like Zapdos and Lugia. It is also used to force Rest users like Snorlax and Tyranitar to use Rest, making them lose precious offensive momentum. Rapid Spin is an option for Cloyster to remove Spikes against opposing Cloyster in order to support teammates like Marowak. This is best used on bulkier styles of teams that appreciate Cloyster's ability to check Pokemon like Tyranitar and Marowak while also functioning as a pivot against Snorlax. However, Rapid Spin is illegal alongside Explosion.</p> <p>Miracle Berry can be an option over Leftovers if Cloyster wants a one-time immunity to Lovely Kiss from Snorlax. This is best used in the lead slot, as lead Cloyster will not miss Leftovers's passive recovery as much.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster is a good facilitator for offensive teams that appreciate its Spikes in order to more easily net KOs. As such, strong attackers and setup sweepers like Mewtwo, Mew, Zapdos, Snorlax, Gengar, and Vaporeon are good partners. Pokemon with access to Explosion and Self-Destruct are good partners as well, as they mesh well with Cloyster's offensive capabilities; as such, having Mewtwo, Mew, Gengar, Steelix, Exeggutor, and Golem as teammates is appreciated. If Cloyster is running Rest, teammates with access to Heal Bell like Celebi are appreciated as well. Checks to special attackers, such as Snorlax, Celebi, and Raikou are also appreciated, as Cloyster's abysmal Special Defense makes it a target for common special threats. Phazers like Whirlwind Zapdos, Tyranitar, Steelix, and Lugia make for great partners as well for their ability to take advantage of Spikes to force chip damage onto the opposing team.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a top pick for a reason: it's one of the very few Pokemon blessed with Spikes, a very important move in a metagame filled with Pokemon that heavily benefit from the extra chip damage. It distinguishes itself from other Spikes setters thanks to its Water typing; coupled with excellent physical bulk and a powerful and relatively fast Explosion, this allows it to check Ground-types like Steelix and Marowak and act as a tricky-to-play-around offensive threat, since its decently powerful Surf keeps most Pokemon that resist Normal at bay that otherwise would be tempted to take the Explosion. Furthermore, Cloyster can further expand its utility thanks to its access to Rapid Spin, a very useful tool in a metagame where Spikes are so rampant, although it unfortunately cannot be used alongside Explosion.</p> <p>However, while Cloyster remains the premier Spikes setter and Water-type in the tier, Forretress sports a typing with more resistances and an immunity to Toxic, which usually grants it more opportunities to set up Spikes than Cloyster. As a spinner, Starmie has a much easier time taking on Gengar thanks to its secondary typing and less trouble using Rapid Spin throughout the game by virtue of its access to Recover. Finally, due to its abysmal special bulk and subpar defensive typing, Cloyster is outclassed as a pure defensive Water-type by Suicune.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is a secondary STAB option that pairs well with Hidden Power Electric and puts a big dent in powerhouses like Zapdos, Exeggutor, and Dragonite, but the lack of Surf puts Cloyster at a disadvantage if the opponent happens to use Forretress. Icy Wind can prove to be a very effective tool, as you can potentially keep Spikes up against Starmie and Rapid Spin Tentacruel with the right support, but its power is lacking, and other moves may be more optimal. Hidden Power Fire can eliminate Forretress quickly so its Rapid Spin is no longer an issue, but it doesn't OHKO Forretress, is too situational to warrant a moveslot most of the time, and comes with an even bigger IV issue than Hidden Power Electric, so much so that the Defense and HP loss means that a Swords Dance-boosted Marowak can now potentially OHKO Cloyster. Clamp traps the foe and ensures that Explosion cannot be avoided, and it can work well in tandem with Screech, which enables Cloyster to ideally trap a target like Snorlax, nullify its Defense boosts from Curse, and remove it from the game. However, there is no guarantee that the Pokemon you aim to trap will stay in against Cloyster, and once you've revealed Clamp, the opponent will be more careful. Rest is an option on Rapid Spin variants to improve their longevity and ability to clear and lay down Spikes throughout the game, but it should only be used on stall teams alongside a cleric, as Cloyster will have a hard time staying healthy for two turns and has to give up the very valuable Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Spinners</strong>: Since Cloyster's purpose revolves around Spikes, keeping these away is the best way to check it. Starmie is widely regarded as the best spinner available, mainly because it does a good job of clearing Spikes after Cloyster has set them up. While Cloyster can choose to use Explosion, Starmie remains faster and is likely to accomplish its job most of the time. Forretress has more trouble using Rapid Spin against Cloyster, since it's slower and takes a lot of damage from Surf, but it can potentially retaliate with Toxic and Giga Drain, which may be enough to significantly hinder Cloyster and to clear the field afterwards. Although far less common, Rapid Spin Tentacruel might be even better than Starmie at preventing Cloyster from keeping Spikes up, since its immunity to Toxic means that Cloyster can't do anything against it bar Explosion. Swords Dance Tentacruel, on the other hand, cannot use Rapid Spin, but it remains a nuisance, since it can freely set up on Cloyster as long as it uses Substitute to avoid Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Cloyster aims to make good use of Explosion or Rapid Spin once Spikes are up. Therefore, Ghost-types like Gengar and Misdreavus can prove to be very annoying with their Normal immunity preventing Cloyster from accomplishing anything else along with their fast Thunder to force it out. However, Gengar has trouble taking Surf too often, whereas Misdreavus badly wants to avoid Toxic unless it carries Rest, and it can still be worn down with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Thunder</strong>: Fast Thunder users like Zapdos, Raikou, Nidoking, Jolteon, Dragonite, and even Starmie all threaten Cloyster, in most cases for a guaranteed OHKO; Starmie in particular might take Cloyster by surprise, thus nullifying its impact on the game.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Exeggutor and the rarer Meganium also deal heavy damage to Cloyster with their STAB attacks, but they should be wary of the potential Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with strong special attacks</strong>: Pokemon such as Jynx, Espeon, and Thunder Snorlax threaten to 2HKO Cloyster with their powerful special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Toxic users</strong>: Toxic spreaders like Suicune, Umbreon, and Blissey will wear down Cloyster, urging it to use Explosion sooner and making it more predictable and easy to play around as a result. Poisoning Cloyster will also make it much easier to keep Spikes off the field with spinners.</p>",

        "Spikes": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The chip damage Spikes provides can be extremely beneficial for offensive and defensive teams alike. A single layer of Spikes makes offensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Nidoking significantly more threatening and provides defensive teams with a way to wear down the opposing team in the long run. Cloyster is widely considered the best source of Spikes available due to its other attributes. Surf is the preferred STAB option, as it is very likely to 3HKO Forretress, a common spinner that would be tempted to get rid of Spikes, and heavily damages the likes of Steelix, Marowak, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem, allowing Cloyster to act as check to these and prevent Golem from using Rapid Spin. Toxic is Cloyster's best tool besides Explosion to cripple important targets like Starmie, Snorlax, and opposing Cloyster. The added residual damage can be very effective when coupled with Spikes. Nonetheless, since the opposing team carrying a Cloyster of their own is a common scenario, Hidden Power Electric is a good option to weaken the opposing Cloyster quicker. It is preferred over Hidden Power Grass, since it offers a decent chance of breaking Tentacruel's Substitute, which is a more important target than Quagsire, the only other noteworthy Pokemon covered by Hidden Power Grass, and doesn't force Cloyster to give up as many HP IVs. However, the loss of HP IVs is still pretty substantial, and it's still unlikely to 2HKO opposing Cloyster unless they run the move as well. Explosion forces the opponent to be careful, as it gives the ability to remove valuable targets like Zapdos and Raikou from the game instantly. It is especially scary to deal with because most Pokemon that resist it like Steelix, Tyranitar, and Skarmory have a hard time taking Surf. In addition, Explosion's immediate raw power and its ability to prevent slower Pokemon from moving on the turn it is used makes it a great tool for stopping dangerous threats like Curse or Belly Drum Snorlax and Growth Vaporeon. However, you can forgo the threat of Explosion in favor of Rapid Spin, which might be more beneficial for defensive teams or some teammates that really benefit from having Spikes removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the tremendous usefulness of Spikes, Cloyster can fit onto practically any kind of team, hence why it sees so much usage. Both Gengar and Misdreavus make good teammates, as they can serve as spinblockers and exploit Spikes with their various disrupting options that force more switches; the former can also absorb Toxic aimed at Cloyster, whereas the latter is fit to prevent Starmie from using Rapid Spin. Other notable Pokemon that can exploit Spikes include phazers, especially those with a significant offensive presence like Raikou and Rhydon. Other forms of residual damage pair nicely with Spikes, since they wear down the opposing team even quicker, so various Toxic and Thief users like Nidoking, Exeggutor, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Jynx do well alongside Cloyster. Overall, every Pokemon with significant offensive pressure like Zapdos, Machamp, and Marowak or with sleep-inducing moves like Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Snorlax tend to force a lot of switches and benefit from the additional damage against bulky foes. Finally, Cloyster has trouble setting Spikes up safely against special attackers like Zapdos, Raikou, Gengar, Nidoking, Exeggutor, and Starmie, many of which can OHKO Cloyster with a powerful Thunder. As a result, Pokemon suited to take these assaults like Snorlax, Steelix, Blissey, Umbreon, and Raikou make good backups for Cloyster. Raikou in particular tends to attract opposing Steelix and Snorlax, two Pokemon that are Spikes bait for Cloyster most of the time. This trait can also be exploited by Zapdos, since just like Raikou it can threaten most relevant spinners, doesn't have any counter immune to Spikes, and is a magnet for Ground-types for Cloyster to take advantage of. Due to this, the core of Cloyster + Electric-type is extremely common and metagame defining.</p> <p>Explosion variants of Cloyster are a good asset for offensive teams, as they can lure in Starmie, Zapdos, and Raikou and get rid of them, opening the field for sweepers like Machamp and Vaporeon. Therefore, Cloyster finds a solid place on Explosion-based teams, since Electric-types are usually primary targets for this archetype. Rapid Spin variants, on the other hand, find their support greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Marowak and Belly Drum Snorlax, which want to avoid any kind of damage before setting up. A field cleared of Spikes is also very beneficial for stall-oriented teams because they won't face nearly as much pressure when switching.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Haunter is one of the stronger offensive threats in GSC UU, with very good Special Attack, great coverage options in Psychic and Thunder, and access to rare moves like Thief and Explosion that let it circumvent some of its checks. It has enough Speed to outpace all of the bulkier Pokemon commonly seen, as well as being able to use its Ghost typing to check the threatening Granbull. However, there are a number of shortcomings that stop it from being a more consistent wallbreaker. Its pitiful bulk leaves it either 2HKOed or 3HKOed by most neutral hits, and common Ground- and Psychic-types like Nidoqueen, Piloswine, and Slowbro threaten to OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves. It also often needs to use Explosion in order to break other teams and give partners opportunities to make progress, leading to Haunter being somewhat difficult to use to its full potential. Lastly, while its Speed tier of 95 is solid, it is outsped by numerous other offensive Pokemon including Scyther, Dodrio, Electabuzz, and Kadabra, the last of which can OHKO it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Destiny Bond is an alternative to Explosion that doesn't KO Haunter immediately if you predict incorrectly, but it is relatively easy to play against once it has been revealed and can give opposing walls like Chansey free turns to recover. It can also be run over Hypnosis or Thief if you want to take greater advantage of Haunter's ability to force trades. Haze can be useful as an emergency button versus sweepers that get out of hand, while Perish Song can also be used to force them out and win last Pokemon scenarios. Mean Look can be used in conjunction with Explosion, Perish Song, or Destiny Bond in order to give Haunter a way to trap and KO a foe, but it has to give up the utility of a status move or Thief to do so. Haunter also has other niche coverage options. Shadow Ball provides a way to hit the frailer Psychic-types like Kadabra and Mr. Mime even off Haunter's pitiful Attack stat, Giga Drain hits Omastar and Quagsire, while Hidden Power Ice nails Jumpluff and Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is one of the sturdiest switch-ins to Haunter, taking little from Psychic and Thunder and being able to either set Light Screen or threaten Haunter with its own Thunder. Magneton may be less sturdy than Ampharos overall, but it resists both Psychic and Explosion, making it one of the safest switch-ins to Haunter overall. Electabuzz has a little bit more trouble switching in, but it does have the advantange of being faster and 2HKOing Haunter while also being able to trap it with Pursuit. Lanturn is another solid option that can safely come in and threaten it with its STAB moves or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Most Psychic-types can safely switch into Haunter at least once barring Explosion, with Hypno being the best choice for something with longevity. Kadabra with Recover doesn't fear anything except paralysis from Thunder, and Mr. Mime can force Haunter out as well, but both do have to be careful about the rare Shadow Ball. Slowking very slightly risks a 2HKO from Thunder but can otherwise come in and threaten an OHKO. Explosion can deter most of these switch-ins, but it comes at the cost of Haunter's life.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Some of the tier's Ground-types can make an effective Haunter check, with Piloswine being the bulkiest option available. It is also commonly carrying Sleep Talk, which makes Hypnosis less of an issue for it. Quagsire can force Haunter out and threaten to set up a Belly Drum. Nidoqueen has to fear Psychic, but it can come in on Thunder when healthy and forces the player to make predictions.</p> <p><strong>Bellossom and Jumpluff</strong>: Bellossom and Jumpluff have both the bulk and recovery to switch into Haunter consistently. Both can paralyze it or put it to sleep, while Jumpluff's higher Speed lets it use Encore against Haunter to prevent Explosion as well. However, they must both be wary of Hypnosis and paralysis from Thunder, which can prevent them from effectively doing their job.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While Haunter is by no means slow, there are still a good number of potential revenge killers it won't be able to take more than one hit from. Scyther and Dodrio both 2HKO it, but they fear paralysis from Thunder and can only deal with an already weakened Haunter. The less common Electrode resists Thunder while 2HKOing Haunter in return.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can sit on basically everything Haunter has and even takes an Explosion from full health. It can then proceed to either support its team or threaten Haunter with Thunder Wave. However, Chansey usually can't KO Haunter itself, as Haunter is immune to Present and Seismic Toss; furthermore, Chansey must be wary of being put to sleep with Hypnosis and used as setup bait by one of Haunter's teammates.</p>",

        "Offensive Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Haunter is blessed with a myriad of useful attacks to make up for its lackluster offensive typing. Psychic is crucial for being Haunter's strongest option versus Nidoqueen, potentially 2HKOing it with Spikes damage or a Special Defense drop. Thunder hits most of the tier's Water- and Flying-types hard, including Slowbro, Slowking, Scyther, Dodrio, and Gyarados. It can also inflict paralysis on some bulkier switch-ins like Hypno and Chansey. Haunter can make a very effective lead, with both Thief and Hypnosis crippling the foe early. It matches up against Qwilfish well, usually scaring it out from staying in to set up Spikes, and you can either put something to sleep or get an early-game Thief off on your opponent's Haunter switch-in. Thief is a great way for Haunter to support its team by taking Leftovers from one of the opposing tanks, with the aforementioned Hypno, Chansey, and Slowbro all being great targets for this. However, Hypnosis helps more when facing offensive teams and gives Haunter more free turns to attack. It also makes it risky for Haunter checks without Sleep Talk to switch in, which reduces the number of counters it has to a handful of Pokemon. Explosion is a way to get some more value out of Haunter if it either can't break through the opposing team or is low on health, threatening to OHKO Chansey and Hypno after Spikes damage while also doing big damage to Nidoqueen and Ampharos. It can also be used as an emergency button versus threats that have gotten out of hand like Swords Dance Pinsir and Victreebel. However, if Haunter is being depended on as a stop to Curse Granbull, it is wise to preserve it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes are the best thing to help Haunter break opposing teams, so Qwilfish is an almost mandatory partner. Once Qwilfish sets up Spikes, Haunter can block Rapid Spin for it in return. While Blastoise, the most common spinner, has a small chance to 2HKO Haunter, it is slower and threatened by both Thunder and Explosion, letting Haunter switch into it safely at least once if it is healthy. Baton Pass teams are well equipped to enjoy Haunter's utility as well, as it can use its unique attributes to keep Spikes up, put something to sleep with Hypnosis, and use Explosion to give free setup opportunities. Pokemon that can take advantage of bulky Psychic-types like Scyther and Pinsir can potentially get free turns of setup after Haunter forces said Psychic-types to Rest. Haunter commonly runs the same offensive coverage as Mr. Mime and can lure in Pokemon that would also wall Mr. Mime to eliminate them with Explosion. Many strong Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Granbull appreciate Haunter stealing Leftovers or using Explosion on checks they have in common like Hypno, Magneton, and Slowking. Other fast offensive threats like Electabuzz and Dodrio will appreciate Haunter's early-game wallbreaking to help them clean weakened teams.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Hypno is perfectly equipped for the role of supporter with a vast array of status moves, screens, and disruptive options at its disposal. Its great Special Defense stat also allows it to perform the role of special wall, and its pure Psychic typing leaves it with few exploitable weaknesses and a useful resistance to Psychic. However, while its attacking options leave little to be desired, it has relatively low attacking stats, meaning that one must be patient when trying to actually KO Pokemon with Hypno as opposed to crippling them for a teammate.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno has no shortage of options and can utilize many of them effectively; in particular, the third and fourth moves on the supporter set are quite flexible. It learns all three of the elemental punches, and they are all at least somewhat useful. Fire Punch hits Magneton for respectable damage and also hits Pokemon like Scyther, Pinsir, and Bellossom a bit harder than Psychic. Ice Punch maintains this super effective coverage against Scyther and Bellossom and also hits Jumpluff and Gligar hard. On top of this, it has a low chance to freeze the foe, which can be useful for breaking stalemates against opposing special walls. Thunder Punch can be used to do a bit more damage to Slowbro. However, it should be noted that all of these moves have low Base Power, and Hypno has relatively low Special Attack, so keep expectations low when using them. Hypno learns both Swagger and Flash, which are particularly effective when combined with paralysis. Reducing the foe's chance to attack will force the opponent to switch or risk allowing a more dangerous Pokemon free setup. This forced switch will give Hypno an opportunity to paralyze an additional Pokemon. When used in conjunction with Hypnosis, Nightmare can also be used in a somewhat similar manner to try to force the opponent to take status with something other than a status absorber. Disable can also be used to eliminate an attack from the foe's options, but has poor accuracy and requires the foe to have used the attack previously.</p> <p>Some additional status moves Hypno has at its disposal are Zap Cannon and Toxic. Both of these are great when they aren't expected, but they are a little unreliable due to accuracy and how common status absorbers are. Counter is also an option that works when the opponent does not see it coming. It has the potential to surprise KO major threats like Scyther, Granbull, and Kabutops, but it requires Hypno to take a heavy hit in exchange and can very easily backfire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Scyther and Pinsir</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir can use their powerful STAB Hidden Power Bug to quickly eliminate Hypno, although neither wants to take status.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Curse Granbull can take anything Hypno can throw at it and easily overcome it with powerful STAB attacks. Heal Bell Granbull can also cure any status Hypno has inflicted.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can take any of Hypno's usual attacks barring Hypnosis and cure its team of status afflictions with Heal Bell. It can also threaten Hypno with Present.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users</strong>: Hypno has no way to threaten RestTalk users such as Slowbro, Slowking, Ampharos, Blastoise, and opposing Hypno, and they can attempt to PP stall it. However, supporter Hypno can take advantage of their passivity to set up an opportunity for a teammate, and Curse Hypno will beat them in the long run barring Ampharos, which can potentially beat Hypno with its powerful Thunders.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Piloswine and Quagsire are immune to Thunder Wave and can beat Hypno with their STAB Earthquake, although if they lack Rest, they can easily get worn down if Spikes are up, and they are vulnerable to Hypnosis if they lack Sleep Talk.</p> <p><strong>Other Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers can target Hypno's middling Defense stat and overcome it with their STAB attacks. Sandslash can switch into Thunder Wave and set up Swords Dance, and +2 Earthquake will easily 2HKO Hypno. Dodrio can do a huge amount of damage to Hypno with STAB Double-Edge, potentially 2HKOing if it has Pink Bow. If it has RestTalk, it is also in a better position to take status from Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Omastar, Magneton, and Haunter</strong>: Curse RestTalk Hypno struggles to get past these three Pokemon, doing no damage at all to Haunter, failing to 4HKO Omastar with +6 Body Slam, and potentially getting 3HKOed by Magneton's Thunder. Other Hypno variants will have a good matchup against Omastar and Haunter but may struggle to contain Magneton.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypno is highly effective at setting up opportunities for its team with this set. Thunder Wave is very useful for slowing down the enemy team and reducing their chances of attacking. The opponent will usually try to contain the spread of paralysis to a few Pokemon, usually RestTalk users. Once they are paralyzed, Hypno can proceed to set up a screen and then switch out to a Pokemon that will then often have an easy setup opportunity. Hypnosis can also be used to disrupt Ground-type Pokemon that might think they can switch into Thunder Wave; however, it is less effective against RestTalk users than Thunder Wave. Psychic is the preferred attacking option in most cases, especially alongside Thunder Wave, to prevent Nidoqueen from coming in freely. However, having Psychic as Hypno's sole attacking option leaves it without an option for hitting opposing Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Girafarig, which can cause problems through their use of Baton Pass. Thus, Seismic Toss can be used to stop them from taking too much advantage of Hypno. Rest is the usual fourth move so that a weakened Hypno can recover its health, and Hypno's screens and paralysis can assist in ensuring it can then wake up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a supporter, Hypno is an excellent choice for teams that have at least a couple of setup sweepers, such as Scyther, Pinsir, Sandslash, Kabutops, and Victreebel. It can also work with Pokemon like Growth or Belly Drum Politoed, Curse Granbull, and Gyarados. Hypno's paralysis support can be taken advantage of by Substitute users such as Sandslash and Pikachu and can also work effectively with Swagger users, including Pokemon like Gyarados and Dodrio. Finally, Baton Pass users like Girafarig can take advantage of Hypno's screens and paralysis support to find opportunities to set up and get recipients like Quagsire and Poliwrath in safely.</p>"

        "Sleep Talking Wall": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypno is one of the most resilient Pokemon in the tier, and its lack of relevant weaknesses and solid neutral coverage make it an ideal status absorber and RestTalk user. Psychic is used to ensure it can hit Haunter and so that Nidoqueen can't simply spam Earthquake against it, and Seismic Toss is typically chosen for its stable and consistent damage output. Thunder Wave can be chosen over Seismic Toss to make Hypno more of an immediate threat to Pokemon like Scyther and Jumpluff, but it comes at the cost of coverage against Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Magneton. This set is difficult to take down without using Explosion or setting up a physical attacker, and it is great at chipping sweepers down as they switch in. It makes a fantastic check to Pokemon that can otherwise be difficult to check due to their coverage, such as Electabuzz, Mr. Mime, Gyarados, and opposing RestTalk users like Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The main draw to using Hypno for this role over Slowbro or Slowking is its lack of an Electric weakness, so it works best on teams that need an answer to threats like Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Electabuzz. It is much worse off against Granbull and slightly worse off against Nidoqueen than Slowbro, so it is a good idea to pair it with solid answers to these; Omastar, Haunter, and Magneton are good checks to Granbull, while Gligar and RestTalk Granbull can handle Nidoqueen. Jumpluff is a good teammate for its ability to counter setup with Encore and spread status, particularly against Bug-types such as Scyther and Pinsir that may try to take advantage of Hypno's relatively low damage output. In general, most kinds of teams enjoy Hypno's presence due to the widespread use of status moves in the metagame and Hypno's ability to absorb them for its team.</p>"

        "Curse Sleep Talk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Hypno's high Special Defense to boost up with Curse and attempt to sweep the opposing team. Early-game, Hypno is unlikely to find an opportunity to set up due to the likely presence of Pokemon like Curse Granbull, Omastar, and Haunter on the opposing team. However, later in the game, as the opposing team gets worn down, the opponent may not have any remaining options to deal with this set, as it has relatively few reliable counters. Body Slam is the best attacking option because it can be used throughout the game to potentially paralyze any Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Hypno's low initial damage output. One of the key benefits of using this set is that Hypno will eventually beat enemy RestTalk users such as Slowbro and opposing Hypno through Curse. Against these and many other foes, Hypno can also do a reasonable job of its usual roles of special wall and status absorber despite not having a reliable source of damage. Additionally, Nidoqueen can struggle to wear it down because it is difficult to force out once it has Defense boosts, especially with RestTalk keeping it healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Hypno set is relatively easy to wall and beat with the right Pokemon, such as Omastar, which is not even 4HKOed by +6 Attack Hypno. It is therefore a good idea to ensure other offensive measures are present on one's team, such as Spikes from Qwilfish, which can help to wear down Pokemon that have an advantage over Hypno, such as Piloswine. Of absolutely critical importance is that this set is accompanied by a reliable answer to Curse Granbull, which easily sets up against this set and will virtually always beat it. Omastar is the most reliable Granbull counter, but Haunter and Magneton will also suffice. Hypno will also require support to deal with Bug-types such as Scyther and Pinsir, especially if they have Hidden Power Bug; Jumpluff and Gyarados are useful choices in this regard. Fire Blast Nidoqueen can also cover Hidden Power Bug variants of these two reasonably well, as they cannot have Hidden Power Ground on the same set. Defensive Electric-types such as Ampharos and Magneton can potentially threaten Hypno with their very powerful Thunders, so it is also a good idea to use Hypno alongside Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Piloswine.</p>"

  "Kingler": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Kingler is an incredibly dangerous setup threat, being by far the best Pokemon that learns Swords Dance in the tier. Kingler uses its good physical bulk, solid Speed that lets it outrun the likes of Dewgong and Weezing, and strong Water typing to set up and become able to 2HKO or OHKO almost every Pokemon in the tier. Kingler's typing lets it easily set up on Rapidash, Flareon, Ninetales, Dewgong, and Ice Beam Octillery, while its bulk lets stomach hits from common threats like Dugtrio, Fearow, Stantler, Graveler, Hitmonlee, and more in a pinch. Kingler's power after a Swords Dance makes it one of the best Pokemon to punish slower, bulkier teams, as these teams often forgo threats like Xatu and opt to use more passive Pokemon like Dewgong. Kingler is also the single most brutal punish to stall, as it can take advantage of Dewgong and Shuckle to use Swords Dance and then Substitute to avoid Toxic or Hidden Power Rock to directly hit hard and proceed to sweep with Swords Dance. However, Kingler has pitiful Special Defense, leaving it at least 2HKOed by every Thunder user, Xatu, Hidden Power Electric variants of Octillery, and Magmar. Kingler also sits at a somewhat awkward Speed tier, being outsped by every common fast offensive threat, meaning taking several hits while attempting to break is nearly unavoidable. As a result, Kingler struggles significantly more against fast-paced Xatu Spikes teams. Kingler can also struggle heavily with breaking through Curse users like Wigglytuff and Porygon without setup prior to their entry.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be used over Hidden Power Ground to let Kingler OHKO Graveler and Pupitar and 2HKO Sudowoodo without having to use Swords Dance prior, which is especially notable because +2 Hidden Power Ground never OHKOes Graveler even after Spikes. Forgoing Hidden Power Ground also increases Kingler's DVs, making it slightly bulkier and stronger and increasing the chances to beat Xatu when at full health. However, without Hidden Power Ground, Kingler is unable to 2HKO a full health Weezing, and it can only 3HKO Magnemite. Amnesia can be used on Kingler to weaken Thunder and attacks from Xatu and Octillery to gain easier setup opportunities or make revenge killing Kingler more difficult. However, it costs a valuable coverage move or utility option like Protect, and it often still loses to threats like Xatu due to needing another turn to set up. Double-Edge can be used instead of or alongside Return or Body Slam to provide a more powerful hit, and while it doesn't take any 2HKOs that Return can't, it can be valuable for taking KOs from foes at higher health percentages, though it comes with recoil and costs a moveslot. RestTalk can be used with Swords Dance and Return, Double-Edge, or Body Slam to give Kingler surprise factor with the ability to heal when being pressured by Fearow and Stantler, and it makes Kingler a solid long-term check to Dewgong, Flareon, Rapidash, Dugtrio, and Ninetales if needed. However, it means Kingler has serious coverage issues, is still beaten easily by Xatu, and suffers from severe competition with other mono-Normal setup sweepers like Wigglytuff and Porygon. Hyper Beam can be used over Substitute or Protect on Hidden Power Ground Kingler to give it the option to OHKO neutral threats like Xatu and Stantler when Kingler is at +2 and paralyzed or at low health. However, the recharge turn means Kingler is committing to be sacrificed, Kingler can be defeated before it uses Hyper Beam, and Hyper Beam can miss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu counters Hidden Power Ground Kingler if awake, outspeeding and 2HKOing with Psychic or Hidden Power Electric while avoiding an OHKO. However, if asleep, Xatu has a 1/3 chance to lose to Kingler by calling Rest from Sleep Talk, increased to 2/3 if it's using Hidden Power Ice instead of Hidden Power Electric. Additionally, Xatu is OHKOed by a +2 Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Primeape</strong>: Primeape is faster than Kingler, can 2HKO with Thunder, and isn't OHKOed from full health by Return or Double-Edge. However, Thunder's accuracy can allow Kingler to beat Primeape, and the matchup is made even worse if Kingler used Substitute or if Primeape is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Persian</strong>: Persian outspeeds Kingler and can put it to sleep with Hypnosis or, if running it, deal heavy damage with Thunder. Double-Edge can reliably break Kingler's Substitute without lowering Persian into KO range of +2 Return. However, Persian is often not at high health, since it usually functions as a highly aggressive lead, and Hypnosis and Thunder both have shaky accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Pidgeot</strong>: Pidgeot is faster than Kingler and can use Reflect to turn +2 Return from a 2HKO into a 4HKO, and then Pidgeot can 3HKO Kingler with Double-Edge. However, this is highly unreliable if Pidgeot is sleeping, and +2 Hidden Power Rock is still a 3HKO with Reflect up. Kingler can also predict Pidgeot using Reflect and use Swords Dance a second time, turning Hidden Power Rock into a 2HKO. Furthermore, Substitute takes greater advantage of a sleeping Pidgeot and burns Reflect turns.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing barely avoids a 2HKO from +2 Return at full health and does massive damage with Thunder. +2 Double-Edge can 2HKO Weezing, but the recoil will knock Kingler into KO range from Thunder. However, Weezing is slower than Kingler, Thunder has poor accuracy, and +2 Hidden Power Ground is an easy 2HKO. Substitute also allows Kingler to repeatedly fish for Thunder misses to easily win the matchup, and it blocks Weezing from safely using Explosion to trade with Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Gloom</strong>: Gloom can use Stun Spore or Sleep Powder to shut down Kingler. The threat of Razor Leaf or Hidden Power Grass also prevents Kingler from safely using Substitute to prevent status, as both moves 2HKO and repeated use of Substitute can lower Kingler into KO range. However, Gloom is still ultimately unfavored, as Gloom is slower, Stun Spore and Sleep Powder have unreliable accuracy, and the Gloom trainer has to guess right between using status or attacking if Kingler has Substitute. Some Glooms also don't use a Grass-type attack at all.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers like Stantler, Fearow, Magmar, Dugtrio, and Hitmonlee all pressure Kingler and can revenge kill it from lower health. Magmar and Stantler are especially notable, as Magmar can revenge kill Kingler with Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Grass if it takes a Thunder or an attack from Xatu prior, and Stantler isn't OHKOed by any of Kingler's moves unlike the other Pokemon mentioned. However, Kingler's solid physical bulk and incredible power after a Swords Dance make all of these poor checks individually, especially if they are asleep and have to use Sleep Talk.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: Magnemite isn't 2HKOed by Surf or +2 Return and can OHKO Hidden Power Rock Kingler with Thunder. However, Magnemite is completely trashed by Hidden Power Ground Kingler.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance + Hidden Power Ground": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's best option to make it as dangerous as possible and is necessary to make it a real threat. Return is an extremely consistent attacking option and reaches a 2HKO against most Pokemon at +2. Body Slam can be used instead to attempt to spread paralysis before committing to a Swords Dance, allowing it to potentially cripple Xatu and KO it without taking a hit, though it is even weaker than Return, potentially eliminating the ability to OHKO threats that are significantly chipped. Body Slam paralysis is also highly unreliable for a Pokemon that doesn't get many chances to gain entry without harm, making it even riskier. Hidden Power Ground perfectly complements Kingler's choice of Normal-type attack, as after a Swords Dance, it 2HKOes Weezing, OHKOes Magnemite, and deals massive damage to Sudowoodo, Graveler, and Pupitar. +2 Hidden Power Ground also blasts Fire-types, OHKOing Magmar and Flareon, having odds to OHKO Rapidash, and being able to do upwards of 95% to Ninetales. Kingler's final moveslot goes towards a utility move, since Normal and Ground have perfect coverage. Substitute can take advantage of paralysis spread by teammates like Gloom and Porygon, lets Kingler fish for Thunder misses from Weezing, gives Kingler additional free turns when Sleep Talk calls Rest or a weak move that can't break Kingler's Substitute like Stantler's Earthquake, and prevents status from the likes of Porygon, Pineco, Persian, Gloom, and Shuckle. Protect, meanwhile, grants Kingler the ability to gain extra Leftovers recovery in one-on-one confrontations, often against Pokemon like Fearow and Stantler, letting it potentially fire off one additional boosted hit. Protect also allows Kingler to safely trade with Xatu, bringing it barely out of range for a 2HKO from Hidden Power Electric, though it still leaves Kingler at extremely low health. A primary benefit of both Substitute and Protect is that they can prevent Kingler from taking an Explosion or Self-Destruct with good prediction, which not only keeps Kingler alive and healthy but also means the opponent sacrificed a Pokemon for nothing. Additionally, Substitute blocks Giga Drain in Generation 2, making Kingler functionally immune to most common Pineco sets, as Hidden Power Grass is extremely rare.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weezing makes for a great pairing with Kingler, handling Primeape and being able to use Explosion on Xatu and other Weezing. Gloom similarly answers Primeape, and though it is generally walled by Xatu like Kingler is, it can paralyze Xatu with Stun Spore to set the stage for a Kingler sweep. Gloom can also paralyze various other targets like Stantler, Weezing, Fearow, and Pineco for Kingler. Pineco can set Spikes to chip down enemies for Kingler and then use Explosion to eliminate an enemy Pokemon, and it can punish Primeape and Stantler short-term. Graveler has Rapid Spin to remove Spikes and keep Kingler at full health, and it also has Explosion. Graveler standing in the way of Pineco can also prevent Pineco from safely trading itself to eliminate Kingler's Substitute later in the game when at high health. Porygon can switch into Xatu if healthy and paralyze opposing Pokemon, often Primeape and Pineco, with Thunder Wave. Primeape has great offensive synergy with Kingler, luring in and wearing down Weezing, Pineco, and Xatu while also effectively handling potential threats like Porygon and Stantler. Ninetales and Rapidash are effective answers to Xatu, Weezing, and potentially Primeape, and they also prevent Magmar from revenge killing Kingler. Other answers to Xatu like Dewgong or even Houndour with its capability to Pursuit trap Xatu can pair well with Kingler, too. Wigglytuff, similarly to Porygon, can answer Xatu and spread paralysis, though it's much less consistent, since it lacks Recover and uses Body Slam for paralysis rather than Thunder Wave.</p>"

        "Swords Dance + Hidden Power Rock": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is essential to make Kingler a serious threat. Return is the best all-around neutral attacking option, 2HKOing most targets after a boost. Hidden Power Rock is Kingler's best option to turn the tables on Xatu, being favored to OHKO Xatu at +2 while leaving Kingler at over half health to fire off another attack, potentially allowing Kingler to win the game immediately. Hidden Power Rock additionally OHKOes Magmar and Flareon, is favored to OHKO Fearow, has a decent chance to OHKO Rapidash, and does massive damage to Pidgeot, Pineco, Ninetales, and Dewgong. Hidden Power Rock also allows Kingler to easily break through Shuckle even after it uses Defense Curl. Since Normal + Rock coverage leaves Kingler walled by Rock-types like Sudowoodo, Surf is the most common choice in the final slot. Kingler can outspeed and 2HKO Sudowoodo and OHKO Graveler and Pupitar with Surf, clearing the way for Kingler to use Return unimpeded. Substitute can be used instead to block status and Explosion, giving Kingler an essentially free win against stall, but it means Kingler cannot break through Rock-types itself and is reliant on team support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hidden Power Rock Kingler makes for a great choice alongside Pokemon that may want Xatu removed from the game, as Kingler naturally baits in Xatu and can surprise it with an OHKO from +2 Hidden Power Rock. Gloom is a prime partner, and it also covers Primeape for Kingler and can spread paralysis with Stun Spore, even potentially paralyzing Xatu so that Kingler does not even have to take a hit before removing Xatu. Weezing similarly appreciates Xatu's absence, as even though it often runs Thunder to hit it, Xatu is still an annoyance. Weezing can check Primeape, trade against other Weezing for Kingler, and use Explosion to break holes and remove threats. Weezing can also take advantage of Kingler luring in and removing Xatu to instead run a potent set otherwise walled by it such as Curse + RestTalk. Pineco can lay down Spikes to put targets like Ninetales and opposing Pineco into OHKO range for Kingler or put a chipped Pokemon barely into range of a +2 Return. Spikes also makes it more likely for Kingler to 2HKO Magnemite with +2 Return, which can turn the tides in Kingler's favor against an asleep Magnemite. Porygon can switch into Xatu and Dewgong when healthy before Kingler is ready to reveal itself and use Swords Dance. Porygon can then paralyze foes, notably Primeape, with Thunder Wave. Since Hidden Power Rock Kingler struggles more against Weezing without a safe option to 2HKO full health Weezing, Kingler appreciates partners that can wear down or wall Weezing. Primeape and Hitmonlee both easily bait in and force damage on Weezing, and they both appreciate Kingler's Xatu-removing capabilities. Ninetales and Rapidash are strong options to defensively handle Weezing long-term, with Ninetales providing more support and Rapidash providing more offense. Both can also handle Primeape to a degree.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Cubone looks useless on paper with its absolutely awful stats, but it has a solid niche thanks to Thick Club doubling its Attack. As a result, Cubone is arguably the best and most dangerous recipient of Baton Passed Agility boosts, capable of OHKOing almost everything in the metagame after it uses Swords Dance. By receiving an Agility boost from Ledian, Farfetch'd, or the less common Ariados, Cubone can very easily end games when it gains +2 Attack and +2 Speed. It also has decent physical bulk, giving it a few opportunities to set up against strong physical attackers like Stantler as well as letting it avoid having its Substitute broken by any resisted Rock- and Poison-type attacks and notably giving it a 49% chance to survive Pineco's Explosion. Cubone is next to worthless outside of its incredible Attack, though, being very slow while also having poor longevity because it is frail and can't hold Leftovers. In addition, its +2 Earthquake fails to OHKO certain Water-types like Azumarill, Kingler, and Dewgong, and other bulky Pokemon like Wigglytuff also have a chance of surviving.</p> <p>Earthquake is Cubone's best STAB attack and threatens to OHKO the numerous Poison-, Rock-, and Fire-types in GSC NU. Rock Slide is also mandatory to hit Flying-types like Xatu and Fearow as well as other threats like Pineco. Swords Dance rapidly boosts Cubone's Attack, turning it into a near unwallable threat at +2. It should be noted that due to how overflow mechanics work in GSC, Cubone should never use Swords Dance more than once, as its Attack stat will overflow and it will do very little damage. Substitute is generally preferred for Cubone's last move, as it lets it dodge status moves such as Gloom's Stun Spore and avoid taking heavy damage from Explosion. Hidden Power Bug is also an option to hit Grass-types such as Exeggcute, Bayleef, and Tangela, but these Pokemon are uncommon in GSC NU, leaving Substitute as the preferred option.</p> <p>Cubone should virtually only be used on Agility + Baton Pass teams, as it is incredibly slow, quite frail, and outclassed by other Pokemon that exploit paralysis like Kingler. Pokemon that can pass Agility are close to mandatory partners for Cubone, and the traditional choices for this role are Farfetch'd and Ledian. Farfetch'd can notably save Cubone a turn, as it can pass Swords Dance to Cubone itself, while Ledian can also pass Barrier or set up Light Screen to help Cubone set up. Ariados is another less common Baton Pass user that can also trap a foe with Spider Web. It is worth noting that Dugtrio is the only Pokemon in GSC NU able to outspeed Cubone at +2 Speed, though it is only capable of 3HKOing it. Spikes support from Pineco is another way of supporting Cubone, as the chip damage notably gives it a chance to OHKO Azumarill and almost guarantees an OHKO on Dewgong, Lickitung, and Dunsparce.</p>"

Furthermore, it gets access to Swords Dance to instantly hit the 999 Attack cap and a STAB Earthquake to run off that impressive Attack stat. However, Marowak is very frail and very slow, and despite its impressive attacking strength, it still fails to guarantee OHKOs against several prominent threats even after a Swords Dance boost. Therefore, a lot of prediction and team support is required to get Marowak to perform well on a team. However, when everything does come together for Marowak to work properly, it can single-handedly demolish the opposing team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Body Slam over Hidden Power on the Swords Dance set allows Marowak to create its own paralysis support, but forces Marowak to miss out on that crucial OHKO against Exeggutor. Fire Blast could be used over Swords Dance and possibly paired with Body Slam to make Marowak an all-out attacker. Fire Blast handily 3HKOes Skarmory without requiring the use of a boosting move beforehand, but that's about all it's good for. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Hidden Power Bug on the Swords Dance set to OHKO Heracross while still 2HKOing Exeggutor and nearly ensuring an OHKO against Exeggutor after a Swords Dance boost. Finally, Marowak can attempt to use a RestTalk set to give it some semblance of longevity. However, RestTalk Marowak hardly compares to other RestTalk users since its defenses, typing, and lack of Leftovers recovery prevent it from switching in very easily. Thus, it's less of a status-absorbing tank and more of a watered-down sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory is one of the best counters to Marowak, as it doesn't fear anything Marowak can dish out aside from Swords Dance-boosted Rock Slides and the uncommon Fire Blast. Even if Marowak has used Swords Dance to threaten with Rock Slide, Skarmory can use Whirlwind to phaze, chip away at Marowak's health with Drill Peck (which only does 22%-26% to Marowak, but every bit of damage counts), or even use Curse to take only 29%-34% damage from +2 Rock Slides (not even a guaranteed 4HKO with Leftovers) while threatening to hit back with boosted Drill Pecks. Suicune is also an excellent Marowak counter, especially with a RestTalk set. Suicune threatens to easily 2HKO Marowak, although it does take heavy damage when switching into an Earthquake. With Sleep Talk, however, Suicune is able to freely use Rest to shrug off those Earthquakes while still threatening to 2HKO Marowak. Cloyster is another good switch-in, but unlike Suicune it takes the same damage from both Rock Slide and Earthquake, so baiting Rock Slides with Zapdos does nothing to make Cloyster's switch in any easier. Furthermore, Cloyster does not last nearly as long as Suicune, so it is much easier for Marowak to wear Cloyster down on the switch. Starmie and Vaporeon are other solid checks that can force Marowak out by threatening to 2HKO with Surf, but they must be wary when switching in, as Earthquake handily 2HKOes them and can OHKO after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Aside from Skarmory and Water-types, Exeggutor can switch into anything except for Hidden Power Bug and then threaten to use Sleep Powder, Explosion, or a strong special attack. If nothing else, Exeggutor poses enough of a threat to Marowak to bait Hidden Power Bug, which in turn makes it much easier for Water-types to switch into Marowak. Heracross resists Earthquake and only really fears Hidden Power Flying while dealing heavy damage to Marowak in return with Megahorn. However, Megahorn is an unlikely 2HKO against Marowak (it deals 45%-52%) whereas, after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak is guaranteed to 2HKO Heracross with Earthquake. In addition, Zapdos is somewhat of a Marowak check. Zapdos's Hidden Power Grass or Ice will do 43%-50% damage to standard Marowak, so it cannot outpace Marowak's damage output in a one-on-one situation unless it gets very high damage rolls, but it can do significant damage to Marowak while avoiding being OHKOed by Rock Slide and baiting Rock Slides to make it easier for other Marowak checks to switch in.</p> <p>In general, the best way to neutralize Marowak is to simply attack it. For example, the 46%-54% Snorlax takes from Earthquake isn't necessarily permanent, but the 41%-48% Snorlax does to Marowak is forever due to the lack of Leftovers and defensive aptitude. Zapdos can recover off the heavy damage it takes from Rock Slide, whereas the Hidden Power damage Marowak takes is permanent. Being able to take \"temporary\" damage to get hits in on Marowak tends to neuter its ability to threaten your team significantly. Just make sure that you don't leave anything in on Marowak that actually does end up being OHKOed.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Marowak is the hardest hitter in the game, and this set takes a very basic approach toward maximizing Marowak's wallbreaking capabilities. Earthquake is the STAB move that guarantees a 3HKO against everything that doesn't resist it. This doesn't sound terribly impressive at first; given how frail Marowak is, you'd expect at least 2HKOs all over the place. However, Marowak doesn't just 3HKO foes, it comes very close to 2HKOs, as illustrated by the following damage calculations. Note that, for these calculations, Marowak's Attack stat is set to 254 (508 after the Thick Club boost) by lowering the Attack DV to 13. Also, be aware that defending Pokemon have maximum values (without a nature boost) for all stats in GSC.</p> <ul> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 46.08% -- 54.01% -- 4.47% chance to 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 32.01% -- 37.77% -- 0.12% chance to 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 45.55% -- 53.44% -- 1.12% chance to 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 41.69% -- 49.13% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 39.93% -- 46.86% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 44.02% -- 51.91% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Tyranitar 86.10% -- 101.24% -- 10.26% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Steelix 63.17% -- 74.50% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 42.49% -- 50.14% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> </ul> <p>Of course, being close to 2HKOs is not ideal, but with some team support and a little bit of residual damage, these KOs can become a reality. Additionally, Marowak runs Rock Slide to 2HKO Zapdos. Hidden Power Bug is the final coverage move, and it allows Marowak to OHKO Exeggutor as it switches in (although it is just short of being a guaranteed KO). However, if Marowak is paired up with Heal Bell support, Hidden Power can be forgone for Rest to allow Marowak the ability to heal off damage and make a second attempt at wallbreaking. Finally, Swords Dance is the move that allows Marowak to transform from an instant offensive threat to a hole-punching wallbreaker by raising its Attack to the 999 cap. However, Swords Dance can be very difficult to set up, and even after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak can miss out on guaranteed OHKOs against important foes, as illustrated in the damage calculations to follow. Note that, in the following damage calculations, Marowak has used Swords Dance to boost its Attack two stages to reach the maximum possible Attack stat of 999.</p> <ul> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 90.25% -- 106.12% -- 38.46% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 60.23% -- 70.94% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 89.06% -- 104.58% -- 30.77% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 81.64% -- 95.78% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 77.89% -- 91.42% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 86.26% -- 101.27% -- 10.26% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 82.44% -- 97.17% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> </ul> <p>Thus, the secret to using Swords Dance is to first put the appropriate support in place; a defensive landscape with a lot of paralysis and residual damage allows Marowak to easily clean up, as do dual screens and passing Agility boosts. However, one crucial moment to consider using Swords Dance without a huge amount of support is when you believe the opponent will be switching to Skarmory. Skarmory takes very little damage from any of Marowak's unboosted attacks, but after Swords Dance boosting Marowak's Attack to 999, Rock Slide does 43%-50% to Skarmory, which is a solid 3HKO. Even if Skarmory tries to use Whirlwind to phaze or Curse to reduce Rock Slide's damage to below the 3HKO threshold (29%-34%), the 27% flinch rate (factoring in accuracy) makes KOing Skarmory possible. However, unless you use Swords Dance on the switch, Skarmory can easily tank whatever Marowak has to dish out while whittling away its health with Drill Pecks, and attempting to play for the flinch against a +1 Skarmory can be risky thanks to its boosted Drill Peck.</p> <p>One thing to note about the Swords Dance set is that, due to a bug in GSC, the Attack stat before the Thick Club boost must be 255 or lower. Otherwise, after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak's Attack stat after the Thick Club boost will roll over to something hilarious like 8 instead of simply capping at 999. That kind of Attack stat barely scares a Level 2 Rattata, let alone the top physical walls of GSC. Using Hidden Power Bug forces the use of a 13 Attack DV (the GSC equivalent to an IV), which automatically sets Marowak's Attack at 254. However, if you decide against using Hidden Power on Swords Dance Marowak for whatever reason, be sure to lower Marowak's Attack stat, either by lowering the Attack DV to 13 or by reducing Stat Experience (roughly equivalent to EVs) to achieve 255 Attack.</p> <p>Marowak has poor HP, low Speed, and no Leftovers. Therefore, if Marowak takes any hits not deliberately planned for, its ability to function goes down the drain. For this reason, Marowak needs to be brought in on predicted double switches to ensure it isn't switching in on attacks. Pokemon that can bait good match-ups for Marowak to switch into are excellent teammates. Gengar and Zapdos are good at baiting Raikou, which is forced to switch out or risk being OHKOed by Marowak's Earthquake. In addition, Rapid Spin from a Pokemon such as Starmie is incredibly welcome support to pair with Marowak, since Spikes damage is terrible for Marowak to be taking every time it switches in. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave Zapdos or Stun Spore Exeggutor is great for mitigating Marowak's poor Speed and preventing it from taking as many hits. Passing Agility to Marowak is another way to mitigate its poor Speed. In early GSC, using Jolteon to pass Agility to Marowak was such a prominent combo that it was dubbed \"JoltWak.\" Finally, passing screens to Marowak, particularly Light Screen, can allow it to tank more hits while setting up Swords Dance and dishing out hits. Light Screen is the recommended screen to use, as it allows Marowak to tank Suicune's Surfs and Zapdos's Hidden Powers, although Reflect support can allow Marowak to do a better job of tanking Snorlax's Double-Edges and Skarmory's Drill Pecks.</p> <p>Of course, Rest can be used to mitigate Marowak's frailty by allowing it to recover from prior damage, something most Marowak cannot do otherwise. This allows you to be a bit more daring with when you choose to bring Marowak in, although you still want to avoid bringing it in on any kind of attacking move if you can. However, if Marowak chooses to forgo Hidden Power for Rest, it MUST be paired with either Miltank or Blissey to provide Heal Bell support. Otherwise, Marowak will never be able to wake up from its nap, as it is too frail. Additionally, it is also a good idea to pair Rest Marowak with Pursuit support from a Pokemon such as Umbreon or Tyranitar. This is because, without Hidden Power, Marowak will not be able to damage Exeggutor switch-ins.</p>"

Its defensive stats aren't so pleasing either. Lickitung can do some damage in UU battles with its physical set, but other than that, it can't do much else sadly. There's nothing saying that you can't use Lickitung, but rather that it's really hard to use Lickitung effectively in any situation. Even in its own common environment it's rarely used.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With the Swords Dance Lickitung, you can easily change it from a Swords Dance Lickitung to a Curse Lickitung. The Attack and Defense pumps are great for Lickitung, and because of how slow Lickitung is in the first place, the Speed lowering flaw of Curse doesn't matter. If you feel that Lickitung needs to deal more damage, go with Double-Edge. Return can substitute in for Body Slam as well if you don't like the recoil of Double-Edge. Though, Body Slam's paralyzing effect is really hard to pass by on. There aren't many other choices for Lickitung using its special set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost-types, Skarmory, and Machamp.

  "Rhydon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Rhydon is a physical juggernaut capable of dismantling an opposing team's defenses with its powerful STAB attacks. Not only is it powerful, but it also fills the valuable defensive niches of Normal-resistant phazer and Electric-immune Pokemon capable of threatening both Zapdos and Raikou. However, its physical Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses and many special weaknesses can hold it back. Moreover, it faces competition with other Normal-resistant Pokemon, namely Golem, Steelix, and Tyranitar, each of which fulfills the same primary defensive roleâ€”checking Snorlaxâ€”while offering defensive and team support capabilities that Rhydon lacks: Golem has access to Rapid Spin and Explosion; Steelix lacks double weaknesses, lacks an Ice-type weakness, is immune to Toxic, and also has access to Explosion; and Tyranitar can check Exeggutor, lacks an Ice-type weakness, and offers Pursuit support. Nonetheless, as a recipient rather than a provider of team support, Rhydon uniquely blends potent wallbreaking ability with defensive role-playing capabilities.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Zap Cannon, Rhydon itself can inflict paralysis and thereby support teammates such as Machamp and Charizard. Thunder is also a worthwhile alternative, since it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes Skarmory a lot more consistently than Zap Cannon, and it has a decent chance of inflicting paralysis to assist with wallbreaking. Counter can deal heavy damage against Snorlax using Earthquake or Zapdos using Hidden Power Ice, although Hidden Power Water threatens to OHKO, and an opponent can switch out instead of attacking. Rhydon is one of the most effective users of Counter against Curse + Earthquake Snorlax, as the fear of being phazed and losing boosts for nothing tends to encourage them to attack once Rhydon shows its face. Rest provides Rhydon with longevity to shrug off damage and poison. This allows Rhydon to fit on a defensive lineup and play the role of an answer to opposing Snorlax that have Fire-type moves, as well as accompany Belly Drum Snorlax in offensive duties, although it competes with Curse Tyranitar, which is less easily forced out by special attackers. Being able to use Rest makes Rhydon a much more reliable long-term check to Curse Snorlax that lack Earthquake, but it can fail to actually KO a boosted Snorlax if it fails to score a critical hit, potentially even losing to Snorlax in a Struggle-off if it comes down to that. Dropping Roar for Rest also leaves Rhydon without a tool it can use to break through sturdy walls such as Skarmory. Hidden Power Bug targets Exeggutor, which can be problematic for standard Rhydon sets. Fire Blast is a decent surprise option that has some merits against Exeggutor and pressures Forretress and Skarmory. Substitute not only helps block status afflictions while Rhydon uses Roar or attacks potential threats such as Snorlax, but it also provides a way to get around Umbreon and Miltank. It is effective with a wide variety of options, including the aforementioned Electric-type moves, and also synergizes with the paralysis inflictions that are a common theme on teams featuring Rhydon. However, it must be kept in mind that in order to use these options, Roar or Curse must be replaced. These moves are not entirely mandatory on Rhydon, but replacing Roar limits Rhydon's defensive capabilities, takes away its ability to use a slower Roar to beat Skarmory, and, barring a critical hit or timely flinch from Rock Slide, actually makes a Curse war against Snorlax a losing proposition. Meanwhile, replacing Curse causes it to struggle to do enough damage to paralyzed or sleeping Umbreon, Suicune, Miltank, and Skarmory, thereby limiting Rhydon's wallbreaking capabilities and forcing it to rely on Spikes and its teammates to avoid being PP stalled.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Cloyster, Suicune, Starmie, and Vaporeon don't resist Rhydon's attacks, they threaten an OHKO with Surf. Cloyster can set Spikes or spread Toxic against Rhydon teams. However, it should be noted that Rhydon is often chosen partly because of its ability to punish switches to Cloyster with its powerful Rock Slide. Suicune has mammoth-like defensive stats, making it an especially reliable check to Rhydon, especially if it is using its RestTalk set. Starmie can predict switch-ins and spread Thunder Wave against Rhydon teams or use Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Earthquake and can use status moves against Rhydon teams. Its STAB moves also deal heavy damage to Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory with Toxic can put Rhydon on a timer. Without Toxic, Skarmory struggles against Rhydon, whose slower Roar makes it impossible to phaze and neutral Rock Slide with Curse boosts threatens heavy damage. However, even without Toxic, Skarmory's immunity to Earthquake and neutrality to Rock Slide still make it a fairly safe option to switch into Rhydon in the event that one must PP stall it or attempt to get a Water-type dragged in by Roar without letting it take a boosted Earthquake on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon and Miltank</strong>: Umbreon can use Charm and Miltank can use Growl to stall out Rhydon. Amusingly, however, Rhydon can check Mean Look variants of Umbreon.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Machamp can 2HKO Rhydon with Cross Chop or set up Curse against it, but it should be wary of taking Earthquake from Rhydon too often.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx cannot switch into either of Rhydon's attacking moves and does not bait Rhydon into switching into its super effective STAB Ice Beam. However, if it switches into Curse or is dragged in by Roar, it can threaten an OHKO and can guarantee one if Rhydon has taken chip damage that has left it at 86% health or less, thereby forcing Rhydon to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Pure Ground-types</strong>: Thanks to STAB Earthquake and higher Speed, Marowak can take advantage of Rhydon, although it struggles to switch directly into Rhydon's Earthquake. Alternatively, Donphan is sturdier and can check Rhydon effectively even if it needs to switch into Earthquake, although it naturally poses less of an offensive threat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Spikes and Toxic from Pokemon such as Snorlax and Misdreavus can wear Rhydon down before it can deal too much damage. This can also open a lane for Snorlax to deal heavy damage to an opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage moves allow Pokemon otherwise threatened by Rhydon to 2HKO or even OHKO it in return. Common examples include Hidden Power Water or Ice from Raikou and Zapdos, Ice Punch from Gengar, Surf or Ice Beam from Tyranitar, Ice Beam from Dragonite, Surf from Snorlax, and Giga Drain from Forretress. Snorlax and Forretress can even switch into Rhydon with minimal prediction if they are carrying the appropriate coverage move, whereas Zapdos and Dragonite can attempt to switch into an Earthquake. To a lesser extent, Ground-type coverage moves such as Earthquake from Snorlax and Tyranitar can also chip away quickly at Rhydon's health in matchups that it would normally relish.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With this set, Rhydon threatens to break walls and can even function as a late-game sweeper. Earthquake and Rock Slide form an unresisted combination of moves that, when both are backed by STAB and Rhydon's high Attack stat, deals high damage to most Pokemon in the tier. Rhydon can boost its Attack stat even further with Curse, which can help it to break particularly resilient physical walls such as Skarmory. With Roar, Rhydon can guarantee that no foe will be slower than it after a Curse, meaning as long as Rhydon uses Roar, it won't be phazed out by Pokemon such as Skarmory. In addition, it can prevent opposing Curse users such as Snorlax from setting up, in fact even allowing Rhydon to threaten to counter-sweep if an opposing Snorlax foolishly engages in a Curse war. The Defense boosts coupled with Rhydon's naturally high physical bulk can even make Rhydon effective against Earthquake variants of Snorlax, provided Snorlax is switching into Rhydon and not the other way around. In addition, Roar allows Rhydon to perform vital defensive duties such as phazing Mean Look Umbreon and Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rhydon fits well on teams that want an offensive phazer that can at least temporarily check opposing Snorlax.</p> <p>Paralysis support is very effective alongside Rhydon, as it allows Rhydon to outspeed checks such as Umbreon, Miltank, Suicune, Vaporeon, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Skarmory then threaten them with boosted Earthquake or Rock Slide. Paralysis also makes it more difficult for Pokemon such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Snorlax to make Rhydon's job complicated with the appropriate coverage moves. Pokemon such as Snorlax, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Starmie, and Porygon2 can use Body Slam, Stun Spore, and Thunder Wave toward this end. Note, however, that paralyzing Skarmory renders it slower than Rhydon even after a Curse and, therefore, able to phaze. However, Rhydon is compensated by the damage output and flinch potential of boosted Rock Slide coupled with the chance of full paralysis, which together affords Rhydon a decent chance to KO Skarmory should it attempt to phaze.</p> <p>Starmie is a particularly potent teammate, as it also carries Rapid Spin, which can be useful because Rhydon tends to get worn down pretty quickly by Spikes; its numerous special weaknesses often force it to switch out before it can heal too much damage with Leftovers, and its defensive role as a check against Snorlax will force it to switch in and take chip damage quite frequently. Other spinners whose typings do not overlap with Rhydon's, such as Cloyster, are also effective teammates for this reason.</p> <p>Spikes and Toxic from Pokemon such as Cloyster can help Rhydon use Roar to whittle down an opposing team. Cloyster can also use Explosion to remove a Rhydon check, such as Starmie, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Vaporeon, Suicune, Umbreon, or even opposing Cloyster. Machamp can chip down Exeggutor with Hidden Power Bug and Skarmory with Fire Blast or a critical hit Cross Chop. Tentacruel can take advantage of some of Rhydon's Water-type checks, such as Cloyster and Suicune, to help it put pressure on Zapdos and Raikou. Vaporeon can similarly help Rhydon apply pressure to the aforementioned Electric-types and can handle threats like Jynx.</p> <p>An effective team with Rhydon also needs teammates that can absorb hits typically aimed at its numerous weaknesses. For instance, Electric-types are good teammates that can handle Water-types. In particular, Raikou, by virtue of its Ice-type neutrality, also offers insurance against opposing Electric-types and Gengar, which can be important because Rhydon takes a lot of damage from their coverage moves. Snorlax works similarly, and, as with all Ground-types, it synergizes well with Rhydon against Zapdos and Raikou; Rhydon goads the Electric-types into using Hidden Power, thereby allowing Snorlax more opportunities to switch into the low-damage coverage move rather than the high-damage STAB move. In addition, Water-types, Exeggutor, and Heracross are good teammates for Rhydon, as they cover the Ground-types to which Rhydon itself is weak. Exeggutor and Starmie are also solid checks to Machamp, whose Cross Chop targets another of Rhydon's physical weaknesses. The additional offensive synergy of Exeggutor and Starmie has been discussed earlier, whereas Heracross can use Seismic Toss to bait Skarmory into taking chip damage, or even a potential 4HKO if either Rhydon or Heracross has forced it to Rest. Additionally, Skarmory itself can check threats such as Exeggutor, Machamp, and Marowak and counters Snorlax with Earthquake coverage to complement Rhydon's ability to check Snorlax with Fire-type coverage.</p> <p>Pokemon that use Heal Bell, such as Blissey and Miltank, are also welcomed teammates, as they allow Rhydon to risk taking a potential Toxic without being put on an inevitable timer. Blissey additionally offers a more reliable Electric-type check to use alongside Rhydon, thereby relieving it of its duty to dissuade Thunder usage so that Snorlax can switch in safely. However, both Heal Bell users are weak to Fighting-type moves, which can often make it difficult to build the rest of the team in a manner that is not too weak to Machamp.</p>"

The other big thing with Kangaskhan is its ability to put up with special attacks too. It can survive 3 Thunderbolts from Raikou, meaning if it Cursed up and Rested on a Raikou switch-in, it could survive the Rest to KO it. Kangaskhan's just not hard to use at all. However, due to the presence of Snorlax, it quietly remains in the shadow of BL.

However, if you have a lot of Pokemon with Stun Spore, Body Slam, or Thunder Wave, then Seaking will not need to make itself fast and won't need to bluff having Surf. As long as you keep Hidden Power Ground or Double-Edge a secret, it is likely that an opponent will hesitate confronting this Pokemon with a Rock- or Ground-type, which is favorable to you. Hidden Power Ground punishes Electric-types, although it will have to be set up nicely before it can be used to your favor effectively. Miracle Berry is to get the jump on any late paralyzing or sleeping Pokemon that are in a last ditch effort to stop you from doing heavy damage to their team.</p>"},

While it won't pack the punch of a sweeper it is worth a mention for UU teams that just need a regular Water-type without any gimmicks.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>With an amazing base 115 Speed, a good Water / Psychic typing, reliable recovery, and a great support movepool consisting of moves like Thunder Wave and the coveted Rapid Spin, Starmie is very much a solid Pokemon. Starmie's access to Rapid Spin is massively helpful for many teams, as it can prevent its team from being worn down over time, and Starmie is easily the most consistent Rapid Spin user in the tier due to its ability to threaten all Spikers and spinblockers. Additionally, Starmie's typing gives it useful resistances to Fighting-, Ice-, and Psychic-type moves. That, combined with its great Speed tier and access to Recover, allows it to counter critical offensive threats like Machamp and Charizard as well as letting it check many important Pokemon such as Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, Marowak, and Nidoking. However, Starmie struggles to do any significant damage to the very common Raikou and Zapdos as well as the ubiquitous Snorlax, all of which pose a massive threat to it. Therefore, Starmie does not usually run offensive sets and tends to run a more defensive set with Rapid Spin and Thunder Wave utility. Unfortunately, this can prove to be problematic due to Starmie's below average bulk and constant need to use Recover or Rapid Spin, which can give free turns to extremely dangerous Pokemon such as Snorlax, Zapdos, and Exeggutor.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder can be used to hit Cloyster, Vaporeon, and Suicune super effectively, but using it over Psychic makes taking down Machamp and Gengar, two crucial Pokemon, much more challenging. Light Screen allows Starmie to become a near-perfect counter to Vaporeon and helps its teammates by doubling their Special Defense. Substitute can make it even harder for Cloyster to keep Spikes up by blocking Toxic or Explosion attempts while also wasting Thunder PP from the likes of Zapdos and Raikou, blocking Giga Drain from Exeggutor, and easing prediction against spinblockers. However, both Light Screen and Substitute remove crucial coverage, so they are less than ideal. Hydro Pump is more powerful than Surf and allows Starmie to land many KOs more easily, notably granting it a guaranteed 2HKO on Tyranitar, a good chance to OHKO Marowak, and a guaranteed OHKO on Steelix. However, Hydro Pump's unreliable accuracy and lower PP mean that Surf is often the better option. Toxic can force typical counters like Snorlax and Zapdos to eventually use Rest, but if it's used over Psychic, Gengar becomes a much greater threat, and Starmie becomes setup fodder for Tentacruel. Reflect can be used to help soften blows from Snorlax, which Starmie allows in almost for free, and can also be used on turns where Explosion is anticipated. It can also support setup sweepers like Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak by putting them out of range of physical attacks, most notably Explosion, in specific situations. However, Reflect leaves Starmie more vulnerable to Gengar, does nothing against Electric-types, which are also common answers, and fails to reliably protect it from Snorlax, as it still risks paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder, sleep from Lovely Kiss, and an OHKO from a critical hit from Double-Edge. Ice Beam lets Starmie hit Zapdos and Exeggutor super effectively, but it results in poor coverage if Starmie is using Rapid Spin, so it is usually only run on Growth Pass recipient sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's absurd HP and Special Defense allow it to sponge Starmie's special attacks quite well. Snorlax can take advantage of this by using Starmie to set up Curse or Belly Drum and threaten to deal significant damage with STAB moves like Body Slam, Return, and Double-Edge; Body Slam also has a 30% chance to paralyze Starmie, which will significantly hinder its capabilities if it doesn't have Heal Bell support.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raikou and Zapdos can tank any of Starmie's moves and can take it down with their super effective STAB moves, and if they are running RestTalk, the threat of paralysis from Starmie is also less of a concern.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Exeggutor and Meganium resist one or both of Starmie's STAB attacks and force it out with their own STAB moves. Exeggutor can also either paralyze Starmie or put it to sleep, which massively hinders or even flat out removes Starmie's ability to remove Spikes and check powerful Pokemon. However, neither of them run Rest, so they should try to avoid switching into Starmie's Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gengar and Misdreavus are able to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. While the standard Psychic Starmie 2HKOes Gengar and 3HKOes Misdreavus, they can switch in on a predicted Rapid Spin before either switching out or attempting to take it on. Specifically, Gengar can OHKO Starmie with Explosion, Misdreavus can annoy it with Pain Split and possibly Perish trap it, and both can put Starmie to sleep with Hypnosis and 2HKO it with Thunder. The potential paralysis from Thunder can also turn the tables on Starmie. However, Gengar needs to come in completely healthy to check Starmie, as it is weak to Psychic and greatly dislikes being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey boasts even higher special bulk than Snorlax, has recovery in Soft-Boiled to scoff at any of Starmie's attempts to damage it, and threatens Starmie with Toxic, Present, or even Thunder or Thunderbolt. Blissey also has access to Heal Bell, which can undo all of Starmie's paralysis spreading efforts.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon's incredible special bulk and immunity to Psychic mean that it completely walls Starmie, and Rest will get rid of any status Starmie inflicts it with. Umbreon can also cripple Starmie with Toxic and Pursuit trap it if it has both moves, or it can Pursuit trap Starmie if it has already been hit with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Vaporeon resists Surf, takes very little damage from Psychic, and is able to cure any status inflicted on it with Rest, which means Vaporeon can sometimes use Starmie as setup fodder. However, Vaporeon needs to be cautious about Special Defense drops from Psychic, and it has difficulties setting up against Starmie if it has Light Screen or Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross threatens to OHKO Starmie with STAB Megahorn and can remove status with Rest. However, it can only safely check Starmie if it doesn't have Psychic, which 2HKOes Heracross.</p>",

        "Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is Starmie's Water-type STAB attack that hits Pokemon like Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Charizard super effectively. Psychic is another form of STAB that allows Starmie to take down Pokemon like Machamp and Tentacruel and makes it more risky for Gengar to try to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. Thunder Wave can be run over Psychic to support Starmie's team, particularly slow but powerful attackers like Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, and Machamp, by slowing down faster Pokemon like Raikou and Zapdos and forcing them to use Rest more often, making them much easier to handle. However, dropping Psychic reduces Starmie's ability to counter Machamp and hurt Cloyster. Rapid Spin removes Spikes from Starmie's side of the field, preventing it and its team from being gradually worn down as the match goes on. Starmie can keep itself healthy throughout the match with Recover, which allows it to consistently check what it needs to, prevents it from being worn down as easily by Spikes and Toxic, and makes it much harder to Pursuit trap.</p> <p>There are three main strategies that Spikers can use to keep Spikes up against Starmie. Toxic can be used to force Starmie to eventually use Recover, which gives the Spikers a window of opportunity to either use Explosion on Starmie or switch to an Electric-type. Ghost-types can switch into a predicted Rapid Spin from Starmie and either attempt to beat it with Hypnosis, Thunder, Thunderbolt, Mean Look + Perish Song, or Explosion or otherwise immediately switch out again to Zapdos or Raikou. This forces Starmie out and preserves both Spikes and the Ghost-type's HP even if Starmie chooses a STAB attack. Lastly, Forretress can use Hidden Power Bug as Starmie attempts to spin, which just barely does enough damage for Starmie to be unable to Recover it off safely in the long run.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow but powerful attackers like Marowak, Belly Drum Snorlax, and Machamp greatly appreciate Starmie's Rapid Spin support, as it increases their longevity; all of these Pokemon also like Starmie's ability to support them with Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats. Since Starmie is heavily threatened by Snorlax, Skarmory makes for a great partner due to its ability to reliably check most non-mixed Snorlax sets, and it doubles as a reliable answer to Heracross. Skarmory appreciates Starmie's ability to remove Spikes against Cloyster, which tends to take advantage of Skarmory to set up Spikes. Starmie also detests Electric-types, so good answers to them like Raikou and Blissey are very helpful. Both of these Pokemon greatly appreciate Rapid Spin support, and Starmie appreciates Blissey's ability to cure it of status with Heal Bell. Another option for a cleric is Miltank, which can also check Curse and mixed Snorlax sets decently. Spinblockers like Gengar and Misdreavus can be very annoying for Starmie, as they prevent it from removing Spikes, so Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Umbreon are greatly appreciated; Tyranitar and Umbreon also double as decent checks to Snorlax.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Scyther is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the GSC UnderUsed metagame. It is almost unmatched in terms of Speed, with the only notable Pokemon that outspeed it being Jumpluff, Crobat, and Electrode. It can pass Swords Dance or Agility boosts to its teammates before the opponent has a chance to properly react, and it also functions very effectively as a standalone sweeper thanks to its high Attack. Of the few viable Haze users and phazers available, an even lower number can take on a Swords Dance-boosted Scyther reliably. The only thing that prevents Scyther from being completely unstoppable is its limited attacking movepoolâ€”the strongest STAB attacks it can use are Hidden Power Flying and Hidden Power Bug, and using these means it can't use Hidden Power Ground.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If Scyther has Hidden Power Ground, it is a reasonable choice to use Light Screen over Baton Pass, which will make dealing with Scyther even harder than usual for Pokemon like Slowbro and Nidoqueen and can also be used to assist a teammate like Sandslash in setting up if Scyther can't do much on its own. Hyper Beam can also be used over Baton Pass as a surprise move to deal a huge amount of damage to an unsuspecting foe, potentially KOing it from a range well outside what Scyther is normally capable of. Scyther is also deceptively bulky and is somewhat likely to survive a follow-up attack on the recharge turn if the opposing team lacks a Rock-type move. Scyther can use Agility with Baton Pass to pass Speed boosts to sweepers like Quagsire, Sandslash, Victreebel, and Politoed. However, it must drop either Swords Dance or a coverage move, which is likely to heavily impact its overall effectiveness and decrease its ability to take on Haze users and phazers. Scyther can try to use a RestTalk set with Swords Dance and an attacking move, but no matter which attack it chooses, it will be nearly certain to encounter foes that wall it completely. Scyther can also drop its item and use Thief in its fourth moveslot, potentially crippling one of its checks by taking its Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Piloswine is one of the most reliable Scyther answers. It threatens Scyther with either a STAB Ice-type attack or a Rock-type attack and can use Roar to phaze it or Curse to ready itself for taking on the Baton Pass recipient if it expects Scyther to pass its boosts away. However, +2 Hidden Power Bug can potentially 2HKO after Spikes damage. Sandslash and Quagsire also 2HKO Scyther with their Rock-type moves, whereas Scyther needs Hidden Power Bug and Spikes support to threaten a 2HKO in return. Gligar is merely 3HKOed by +2 Wing Attack, but it can only 3HKO in return with its own Wing Attack. However, if Scyther attacks it, Gligar can retaliate with Counter, so Scyther will rarely want to risk attempting to take Gligar on.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados can 2HKO Scyther with Hidden Power Flying or 3HKO with Thunder and also gets Roar to phaze it if it attempts to use Baton Pass. In return, a +2 Scyther can only manage a 3HKO with Wing Attack.</p> <p><strong>Jumpluff</strong>: As it outspeeds Scyther, Jumpluff can switch in on a predicted Swords Dance and use Encore to stop Scyther from attacking it or passing its boost away. Alternatively, it can use Sleep Powder or Stun Spore to cripple Scyther. If Scyther anticipates Jumpluff's entry and uses Wing Attack, it is still at risk of being hit by a status move, meaning Jumpluff may be able to safely heal off the damage with Synthesis as Scyther switches to avoid the status. Jumpluff can also run Hidden Power Flying as a means of damaging Scyther that try to take it on or to revenge kill a low health Scyther.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat is the only true counter to Scyther, having higher Speed and access to Haze to remove any boosts, as well as being able to hit it super effectively with STAB Wing Attack or Hidden Power Flying. As Crobat can remove any boosts Scyther has before it can attack, Wing Attack can only muster a possible 5HKO against Crobat, while Crobat easily 3HKOes in return with its own Wing Attack. However, Crobat's effectiveness outside of countering Scyther tends to be quite limited, so it is not particularly common.</p> <p><strong>Kabutops and Graveler</strong>: Kabutops survives a +2 Hidden Power Ground and OHKOes Scyther in return with Ancient Power. However, it has no way to prevent Scyther from using Baton Pass, so this must be taken into account. Graveler survives a +2 Hidden Power Ground and OHKOes Scyther in return with Hidden Power Rock or Rock Slide. It can also use Explosion to attempt to take out Scyther or its Baton Pass recipient in one hit.</p> <p><strong>Hard-hitting Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Curse Granbull, Slowbro, and Omastar don't reliably counter Scyther, but if they are healthy and Scyther lacks a coverage move that hits them super effectively, they pose a threat to both Scyther and many of the Pokemon that Scyther may be intending to pass its boosts to. Granbull's simultaneous Attack and Defense boosting makes it difficult for any common recipient to deal with it; Slowbro is incredibly physically bulky, does solid damage with its STAB attacks, and may have Thunder Wave to cripple Scyther; and Omastar has a hard-hitting Surf that may be paired with Ice Beam, Haze, or even Ancient Power to hit Scyther hard or erase its boosts as it tries to pass them. However, it must be kept in mind that Scyther 2HKOes Slowbro with +2 Hidden Power Bug and 2HKOes Omastar with +2 Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos survives +2 Hidden Power Ground and can OHKO Scyther in return with Thunder. Electabuzz Speed ties with Scyther and has a chance to OHKO Hidden Power Ground variants with Thunder due to the reduced HP DV; however, it is almost impossible for it to OHKO Hidden Power Bug Scyther, and +2 Hidden Power Ground can also OHKO Electabuzz, being particularly likely to do so after Spikes damage. Magneton is easily OHKOed by +2 Hidden Power Ground, but it survives unboosted Hidden Power Ground and OHKOes in return with Thunder. It is also one of the most reliable counters to Hidden Power Bug Scyther, although it must beware of Ground-type Baton Pass recipients. Electrode outspeeds Scyther and 2HKOes it with Thunderbolt, while Scyther requires a high damage roll to OHKO after Spikes with +2 Hidden Power Ground. Electrode can also paralyze Scyther with Thunder Wave or use Explosion to bring it to low health.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Scyther's Swords Dance-boosted Hidden Power Ground can 2HKO Nidoqueen, but Nidoqueen can hit it with Lovely Kiss to incapacitate it before it can finish Nidoqueen off. Hidden Power Ground Scyther is likely to be 2HKOed by Thunder or Fire Blast from Nidoqueen and risks getting paralyzed by Thunder, whereas Hidden Power Bug Scyther is less likely to be 2HKOed but also fails to 2HKO Nidoqueen due to lacking a super effective attack.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "All-Out-Attacker": {},
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance rapidly increases Scyther's already high Attack, transforming it from a relatively weak attacker into a menacing threat. Wing Attack is a low-Base Power but reliable STAB attack that is preferred over other options such as Return due to its ability to land super effective damage on Grass-types like Jumpluff and Bellossom as well as opposing Scyther and Pinsir. Against neutral targets, Wing Attack is marginally weaker than Return, but hitting the aforementioned targets hard is very important. Hidden Power Ground is the preferred coverage move, offering perfect coverage alongside Wing Attack and hitting common Poison-, Electric-, and Rock-types including Nidoqueen, Qwilfish, Haunter, Ampharos, Magneton, Electabuzz, Omastar, and Kabutops for 2HKOs or better after a Swords Dance boost. The alternative is Hidden Power Bug, which can be chosen to deal massive damage to the tier's numerous strong Psychic-type Pokemon, including Slowbro, Hypno, Mr. Mime, and Kadabra, while also offering a small boost in power against neutral targets like Granbull and Piloswine. However, choosing Hidden Power Bug means Scyther will be unable to hit Magneton and will miss out on numerous 2HKOs listed above. When matched up against such foes and in many other cases, Scyther's best choice may be to Baton Pass its boosts to a teammate such as Nidoqueen, Dodrio, Granbull, Gyarados, Quagsire, or Kabutops. These Pokemon can greatly benefit from the additional Attack boost, which may allow them to break past their usual checks. Baton Pass is also great for scouting what Pokemon the opponent might switch into Scyther and reacting accordingly, since it will usually go first due to Scyther's Speed if the foe stays in and will go after the switch if it doesn't.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nidoqueen makes for a good teammate for Scyther thanks to the pair's good typing synergyâ€”Scyther is immune to Ground and makes for an excellent pivot with Baton Pass, whereas Nidoqueen easily takes any Rock- and Electric-type moves aimed at Scyther. Furthermore, Nidoqueen benefits from being passed one or more Swords Dance boosts, which can allow it to get past its usual checks like Granbull and Slowbro. Many Pokemon will try to make Scyther easier to handle by paralyzing it with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore, so it can be helpful to use a Pokemon that can take status moves well such as RestTalk Slowbro or RestTalk Hypno, both of which also happen to serve as decent Nidoqueen checks. Other Hypno sets also make for great status spreaders and supporters in general thanks to Hypno's access to Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Hypnosis. Ampharos is another option for Light Screen support; it can also draw in Ground-types such as Nidoqueen as it sets up the screen, which can give Scyther an opportunity to come in on Earthquake. Granbull, particularly a variant with a coverage move, stands to benefit greatly as a Swords Dance recipient, as almost no Pokemon can take boosted attacks from it for long. Dodrio is likewise an enormous threat when passed a Swords Dance boost, especially considering it outspeeds Qwilfish, one of the tier's most prevalent Haze users. Quagsire and Piloswine are other good Swords Dance receivers that double as Electric-type checks. Gyarados and Kabutops can also become much more challenging to take on once passed Attack boosts from Scyther. Pokemon with Explosion such as Haunter and Electrode can be useful for their ability to break through or weaken some of Scyther's checks, such as Nidoqueen, Piloswine, Sandslash, and Quagsire; they can also support it with screens and status moves. Mr. Mime and Jumpluff are also great at easing setup for Scyther with their status moves and access to screens, and they can also use Encore to lock foes into moves that Scyther can easily switch into. Lastly, Spikes damage can help Scyther to secure some crucial KOs, such as against Electabuzz and Kadabra, so Qwilfish is a useful teammate.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jynx is a high-risk, high-reward type of Pokemon. Its Special Attack, Speed, access to Lovely Kiss, and combination of STAB attacks that is scarcely resisted in GSC OU make it a great sweeper and status inducer. It 2HKOes a huge number of the viable offensive Pokemon in the metagame, which can force somewhat of a passive response, allowing the Jynx user to gain momentum. Jynx is the only sleep inducer that straight up 2HKOes the most common sleep and general status absorber, Zapdos, and can even take it on one-on-one without relying on Sleep Talk rolls going in its favor. In the absence of one of a few specific viable Sleep Talk users, like Snorlax or Vaporeon, opponents must often effectively sacrifice one Pokemon to sleep and then have an additional healthy Pokemon capable of taking Jynx on. However, Jynx also comes with significant liabilities, which are its frailty, due to its poor defensive typing and stats, and its almost total uselessness when inflicted with status. These traits make it difficult to bring in at times. Nevertheless, Jynx has changed the way that offensive teams are structured in GSC OU and has gone from a niche pick to a metagame standard.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mean Look sets must drop Lovely Kiss due to the sleep move + Mean Look ban, but they can be quite threatening, as most phazers don't like switching into Jynx's STAB attacks. Perish Song + Mean Look can take huge advantage of more passive responses to Jynx such as Suicune and already sleeping Sleep Talk Snorlax. However, these sets are somewhat inconsistent due to Jynx being unable to stomach much damage, and foes can threaten it with heavy damage even if they cannot phaze to cancel Mean Look. This set is also harder to bring in than other users of this strategy, such as Gengar, due to its lack of notable resistances or immunities. Counter can be used on some sets to target physically offensive checks to Jynx such as Snorlax. Hidden Power Fire hits Forretress but can be hard to justify over one of the utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Raikou, Suicune, and Snorlax can all switch into Jynx and threaten it out with status or damage. However, they must be wary of Thief or Lovely Kiss along with the threat of the secondary effects from Jynx's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Umbreon, Houndoom, and Tyranitar can all reliably Pursuit trap Jynx, although they can't do this while asleep. Houndoom and Tyranitar threaten it with an OHKO if it does not switch, although Houndoom will fail to OHKO the majority of the time and Speed ties Jynx. Tyranitar takes a sizeable chunk from Ice Beam too. Umbreon's Pursuit does not break Jynx's Substitute, so Jynx can still try to put it to sleep or freeze it.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Forretress</strong>: Starmie and Forretress can both switch into Jynx thanks to their resistances to its STAB attacks, provided Sleep Clause is active, and threaten it out or get a Rapid Spin off. Forretress, though, is especially vulnerable to Thief, and some of its movesets check Jynx better than others.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Snorlax, Raikou, and Moltres can come in on Jynx and absorb the Lovely Kiss to activate Sleep Clause while threatening Jynx back immediately. Jynx can still gain advantages against them through Thief, gradual damage, and secondary effects with STAB attacks.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Lullaby": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The coverage of Ice Beam and Psychic is resisted only by Starmie and Forretress in OU, neither of which commonly run Sleep Talk. Even many special walls such as Blissey and Raikou don't appreciate being put to sleep, although the latter can mitigate this by using Sleep Talk. Substitute allows Jynx to mitigate its frailty and weakness to status, as well as giving it extra turns and safety. These turns better its odds to put something to sleep and let it fish for freezes or Special Defense drops with its STAB attacks, which can allow Jynx to break through its supposed checks. Thief is commonly used over Substitute to steal Leftovers from common switch-ins such as Snorlax, Suicune, Raikou, and Blissey that attempt to wall it. This allows Jynx and its teammates to break through these Pokemon more easily and subsequently inflict sleep on a Pokemon the opponent would rather have kept free of status. Thief Jynx is often used as a lead to steal Leftovers early on, supposing the lead matchup is advantageous. Jynx threatens a lot of common leads such as non-Sleep Talk users, Exeggutor, and Nidoking. Nightmare is sometimes seen over Substitute or Thief to beat down sleeping Pokemon that Jynx cannot 3HKO like Suicune and Snorlax. It can force them into Rest loops, in which they are highly susceptible to Special Defense drops and critical hits, and also punishes Sleep Talk users by putting them at great risk if they call Rest while inflicted with Nightmare. The overall purpose of Nightmare is to force switches, which Jynx is very effective at punishing if the opponent does not have numerous Pokemon capable of taking its powerful special attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jynx appreciates teammates that can keep up offensive momentum. While losing momentum occasionally is acceptable, Jynx teams commonly struggle when the opponent is aggressively playing around them rather than taking them on passively. This means using Pokemon that are very difficult to respond to passively like Cloyster, Whirlwind Zapdos, and Gengar or, if a threat requires a passive response, using Pokemon like Curse Snorlax that similarly force passive responses from the opponent rather than allowing them to gain momentum. Jynx also helps offensive teams overwhelm the opponent's defensive measures by softening up or gaining advantages against defensive Pokemon through Lovely Kiss or Thief, and Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress helps Jynx dish out damage more effectively. Pokemon that can deal with varieties of RestTalk Snorlax complement Jynx particularly well, as it typically draws them in. Gengar is immune to the Curse set and only fears the Earthquake set or a burn from Flamethrower; it also switches into Forretress without Hidden Power Ghost to stop it from getting a Rapid Spin off against Jynx. While Golem still takes super effective damage from Earthquake and the rare Surf from Sleep Talk Snorlax, it can get a Rapid Spin off against it and shuffle the opponent's team with Roar. Pokemon that check Jynx, such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Umbreon, are commonly threatened by Machamp, making it a great partner. A sleeping Snorlax makes an especially great entry point for Machamp, which is typically not a Pokemon you want to give opportunities to. Jynx and Machamp together can also apply pressure on poisoned Starmie by making it switch in and take residual damage. Sweepers that appreciate Raikou being worn down, such as Vaporeon, appreciate Jynx stealing its Leftovers or gradually weakening it. Jynx still appreciates Pokemon that can reliably stomach Thunders from Raikou, though, such as Steelix and Sleep Talk Snorlax. Jynx also makes for an excellent recipient of Special Attack boosts from Baton Pass users such as Vaporeon.</p>"

Electabuzz requires no setup in order to deal a lot of damage, which sets it apart from many other offensive Pokemon in terms of generating offensive pressure. However, due to its lack of bulk, Electabuzz is somewhat of a glass cannon. Its Speed means that it is a viable revenge killer for offensive threats such as Dodrio, Kabutops, and Gyarados, which the other Electric-type Pokemon in the tier underspeed. This black and yellow beast is best played with aggression to shock foes with its offensive prowess.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electabuzz can run RestTalk with Thunder and Psychic to give it some longevity, which it sorely lacks. However, this will leave it easily walled by Pokemon like Bellossom, Chansey, Magneton, and Piloswine, which Electabuzz can usually afford to cover in its other moveslots. Toxic can be used to wear down these Pokemon, forcing some Pokemon like Quagsire and Gligar to use Rest or depleting Heal Bell PP on Granbull and Chansey. Thief allows Electabuzz to steal Leftovers from Pokemon that normally check it quite well like Hypno and Bellossom, which helps to eliminate them more easily later on, but this means that Electabuzz must either sacrifice Pursuit or some coverage options for a one-time usage move. Counter allows Electabuzz to surprise KO some physical attackers like Granbull, but its frailty means that it has difficulty in doing this consistently in a tier where Earthquake is very common. It is also incompatible with Cross Chop and Pursuit. Fire Punch, replacing Ice Punch, lets Electabuzz hit Magneton for super effective damage while doing the same to the Grass-types, though it does considerably less to Jumpluff and Gligar. Reflect and Light Screen can be used to support teammates and allow Electabuzz to partially overcome its lack of bulk, but there are several more viable users of these moves in the tier, and using them comes with the opportunity cost of some offensive pressure, which is Electabuzz's biggest selling point. Thunder Wave gives Electabuzz a more reliable method of spreading paralysis, but it is not a common choice because many Pokemon that will try to switch into Electabuzz are Ground-types, and using it also means that coverage is sacrificed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Piloswine, Nidoqueen, and Quagsire all reliably switch into Electabuzz and threaten it immediately with powerful Earthquakes. However, Piloswine must be careful of Cross Chop, which can 3HKO it, Nidoqueen is forced to recover if hit by Psychic on the switch and thus gives the Electabuzz a free turn, and Quagsire is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass. Sandslash and Graveler can also serve as checks, although they fear Electabuzz's coverage attacks due to their low Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good special bulk, particularly those that resist Electric like Ampharos and Bellossom, wall Electabuzz and can wear it down or inflict status on it. Electabuzz's best chance of breaking through these checks is with status, such as an Ice Punch freeze, Thunder paralysis with timely activations, or the rare Toxic. Hypno, Chansey, and Lanturn can also serve as effective Electabuzz checks with their bulk and access to status moves, but Hypno and Lanturn can be 3HKOed by Thunder after Spikes, and Chansey is 2HKOed by Cross Chop if Electabuzz has it. Shuckle can also wall Electabuzz and either PP stall it or poison it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Electabuzz rarely runs Rest and depends heavily on its high Speed, so it dislikes being statused. Slowbro, Slowking, and Ampharos can catch Electabuzz off guard with a Thunder Wave, and Jumpluff can paralyze it with Stun Spore. Mr. Mime, Haunter, and Hypno can force it to sleep with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton is not a consistent answer against Cross Chop or Fire Punch variants of Electabuzz, but it is a great check otherwise thanks to its resistance to Electric, Ice, and Psychic-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Hitting It On the Switch</strong>: Due to its frailty, Electabuzz is worn down easily by most STAB attacks. Attacking Electabuzz as you anticipate it coming in is an effective method of curbing the damage it can inflict on your team.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunder and Thunderbolt are the obligatory STAB attacks that allow Electabuzz to scare most of the Water-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Slowbro, Qwilfish, and Omastar, and most of the Flying-types, such as Scyther, Dodrio, and Crobat. Psychic is Electabuzz's strongest attack to hit Nidoqueen and deals around 40% to itâ€”with Spikes support, this is enough damage to force Nidoqueen to recover with Moonlight. This allows Electabuzz to aim for a Special Defense drop or switch out to gain a free turn for some momentum. It is noteworthy that Electabuzz avoids an OHKO from Nidoqueen too. Psychic also allows Electabuzz to reliably 2HKO Haunter without having to take the risk with Thunder's accuracy. Ice Punch can be used to hit Grass-types like Jumpluff and Bellossom for super effective damage while also dealing a heavy blow to Gligar, and a chance to freeze should never be scoffed at. Pursuit allows Electabuzz to trap Haunter and Slowbro, weakening them for sweepers that struggle against them like Granbull, Sandslash, and Kabutops. Alternatively, Cross Chop can be used to 2HKO Chansey and Magneton and also hits Piloswine hard. Hidden Power Grass can catch Quagsire off guard and still hit Piloswine. It is important to keep in mind that Cross Chop and Pursuit are incompatible with each other.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electabuzz's aggressive nature and ability to force switches means that Qwilfish, which provides Spikes support, makes a great partner for it. As Electabuzz tends to allow Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Quagsire to switch in, it is wise to pair Electabuzz with Pokemon that can shrug off Earthquake such as Bellossom, Slowbro, and Gligar. Electabuzz's ability to Pursuit trap Slowbro and Haunter effectively means that Granbull, which is usually checked by these Pokemon, can run rampant on enemy teams. Having a secondary answer to Water-types, like Bellossom or Jumpluff, is wise, as Electabuzz's frailty means it cannot switch into Surfs consistently.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt's accuracy is more valuable than the power behind Thunder with Electabuzz electing to play the long game, especially when it comes to checking foes like Gyarados. With Rest, Electabuzz has ample opportunities to trap foes like Haunter with Pursuit. However, it has to be cautious of Hypnosis when trying to recover. Psychic is an alternative to get more chip damage on Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Piloswine and 2HKO Haunter. Despite typically being offensive, Electabuzz can Rest on a solid amount of foes and appreciates nullifying ailments like Hypnosis from Mr. Mime and Stun Spore from Bellossom and Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Electabuzz is best suited for stall teams that complement Electabuzz's longevity and appreciate it being able to both trap Haunter and counter Gyarados. Partners like Blastoise and Hypno cover the Ground-types like Piloswine and Nidoqueen that Electabuzz cannot handle as easily without its usual coverage. Heal Bell support from Chansey to wake it early can be useful, and Chansey can sponge hits from stronger special attackers like Mr. Mime and Magneton. Shuckle makes for an excellent partner to deal with Nidoqueen and physical attackers like Granbull that can often gain free turns off of Electabuzz. Granbull itself is a nice partner, as it can be an additional Nidoqueen answer and win the game once Electabuzz traps Haunter. Crobat can deal with the Grass-types that Electabuzz cannot touch. It also stops Scyther from passing Sword Dance boosts and is a more consistent answer than Electabuzz. In return, Electabuzz traps Slowbro.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Electabuzz has amazing type coverage with its spread of attacks. This, combined with its high Speed, turns it into a real offensive threat. The reason it's not used as much as Pokemon like Raikou is that it is really fragile. This means that you have to predict switches, non-damaging moves, or bring it in on a weak attacker or after one of your Pokemon is KOed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electabuzz can use Thunder Wave to hit enemy Electric-types, but it has two problems. First, Thunder Wave + Cross Chop is an illegal combination, so you cannot hit Blissey, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Umbreon very hard. You can solve this by using Zap Cannon instead of Fire Punch. You do not want to lose Thunderbolt here because, although you would already have Zap Cannon as an Electric attack, you'll find that its consistency of damage is far more useful than hitting Forretress, Piloswine, Scizor, and Steelix, so drop Fire Punch and keep Thunderbolt and Cross Chop. However, this still runs into the other problem of trying to counter Electric-types in this manner. You stop Jolteon and cripple enemy Electabuzz, but the most common Electric-type by far, Raikou, almost always carries Rest, meaning it will just heal itself of status. You can use this to your advantage, however, if you want to set up a Belly Drum Charizard. BellyZard has trouble sweeping if the opponent has a healthy Raikou kicking around on their team, because it's faster than Charizard and easily OHKOs it with Thunderbolt. If you can paralyze their Raikou, when you bring out Charizard later in the game, you can use Belly Drum and not have to worry about them switching to Raikou and forcing you to switch. The other popular Electric, Zapdos, is weak to Ice Punch and doesn't resist Thunderbolt, so it's not as much of an issue.</p> <p>Reflect and Light Screen help both Electabuzz and the team survive. Which one you use depends on what you have problems with. Reflect helps Electabuzz take on Snorlax better, letting it actually take an Earthquake, but Light Screen helps versus those enemy Electric-types that Electabuzz always gives free switch-ins to. Electabuzz can also use Counter, as it survives most physical hits that aren't Earthquake with a little bit of HP, and Counters it back for a near guaranteed OHKO. Electabuzz still has enough Speed after doing this to be useful, unlike, say, a weakened Counter Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Other Electric-types are Electabuzz's best counters, since they can take all three of its main attacks without much trouble. Once you have Electabuzz in, there aren't really any real counters besides said Electrics; it's just that it has a tendency to die quickly and is hard to switch in a lot of the time.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Electabuzz is a dangerous threat because it has such a diverse special movepool with all the elemental punches and STAB Thunderbolt, and Cross Chop to take out any special walls.</p> <p>Electabuzz will generally be using Thunderbolt because of its high Base Power and STAB. Ice Punch hits all Ground-types but Piloswine, Quagsire, and Steelix super effectively. Fire Punch covers Steelix and the rare Piloswine, leaving only Quagsire, who, like Piloswine, is rare. Fire Punch also nails Scizor and Forretress on their 4x weakness as an added bonus. That leaves only Grass- and Electric-types resisting Thunderbolt (all fully evolved Dragons are neutral to Thunderbolt, although Ice Punch still hits Dragonite hard). Grass-types are covered by both Fire Punch and Ice Punch. This means that only enemy Electrics (and the UU Quagsire) can resist your primary STAB attack and not be weak to one of the punches.</p> <p>However, Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon can just wall most special attackers with ease, so if those were Electabuzz's only attacks, then it still couldn't dent them, neutral Thunderbolt or otherwise. This is where Cross Chop comes in. Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon, the three most common special walls in GSC, all share a common weakness: Fighting. Cross Chop has a 25% chance to get a critical hit, so if that goes off once, it will 2HKO Snorlax and potentially OHKO Blissey. It has to roll max damage on both hits to 2HKO Umbreon with one critical hit, but Umbreon isn't as dangerous to Electabuzz as the other two, nor is it as common. Another advantage of Cross Chop is that critical hits ignore stat-ups entirely, meaning that it will do the same damage to a Snorlax that has six Curses as it does to one with no Curses. Cross Chop also nails the common Tyranitar for a cool 60-71%, an easy 2HKO.</p> <p>Leftovers is generally the preferred choice for Electabuzz, because it lets it switch into Thunderbolts, Surfs, and non-STAB Ice Beams more often, and it also lessens the effect of Spikes. Miracle Berry is a sound choice, however, as constant switch-ins to Thunderbolts and Ice Beams give Electabuzz a high risk of being paralyzed or frozen. Electabuzz is too frail for Leftovers to make that much of a difference, so it's not as important as on sturdier Pokemon.</p>"

It can be difficult to wall without Ninetales due to its excellent coverage, letting it hit a lot of the tier quite hard. Magmar also brings decent defensive utility to its team thanks to its usable Special Defense, which means Magmar is notably only 4HKOed by Xatu's Psychic. Magmar is also quite fast for the tier, outpacing threats like Kingler and Hitmonlee. However, Magmar does face competition from other Fire-types that bring more to a team; Ninetales brings huge defensive potential, and Rapidash is an incredibly fast lead with Hypnosis. Magmar's STAB Fire Blast threatens to 2HKO a large portion of the tier, notably Xatu, and can be powered up even more with Charcoal. Thunder Punch damages Water-types such as Octillery and Kingler quite a lot and gives Magmar coverage for Flying-types that won't miss unlike Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass can be used instead, as it OHKOes Graveler, can 2HKO Sudoowodo with Spikes up and additional minor chip damage, and can reduce prediction between deciding to use Thunder Punch to hit Octillery or Fire Blast to hit Dugtrio while barely being weaker than Thunder Punch against Octillery; however, it comes at the cost of significantly reducing Magmar's DVs and losing out on Thunder Punch's ability to hit Flying-types with perfect accuracy. Cross Chop heavily threatens Dewgong, damages Wigglytuff and Dunsparce harder than Fire Blast, and has a chance to land a critical hit through the Normal-types' Curse boosts. Lastly, Sunny Day powers up Magmar's Fire Blast to a staggering degree, notably 2HKOing even the incredibly bulky Dewgong while lowering the power of Water moves and reducing the accuracy of Thunders aimed at Magmar, even allowing Magmar to become a solid answer to Dewgong if it can gain entry on a usage of Ice Beam or Rest. Hidden Power Ground can be used instead to hit opposing Fire-types hard while also 2HKOing Chinchou after Spikes damage, though it still cannot 3HKO the faster and RestTalk-using Ninetales without Spikes. Thief can also be chosen in order to weaken bulky Pokemon like Octillery, Ninetales, and Xatu, making it easier for Magmar itself to wallbreak later in the game while also supporting teammates, though it makes it significantly harder to switch Magmar into battle with Spikes up due to lack of Leftovers before using Thief.</p> <p>Magmar pairs well with Water-types, most notably Chinchou, which beats the Water- and Fire-types that can beat Magmar one-on-one; in return, Magmar beats the Grass-types that wall Chinchou. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct such as Weezing and Sudowoodo can try to take out bulky Water- and Fire-types that give Magmar trouble. Magmar also pairs well with other fast offensive Pokemon such as Fearow, Xatu, and Primeape to overwhelm the opponent's defensive core with Spikes down, as they can force the defensive Pokemon to switch around and take chip damage, which can leave the opponent's team weakened enough to be cleaned up. Finally, Magmar makes for a very good recipient of Baton Pass, especially Growth passes from Flareon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir has one of the highest Attack stats of any Swords Dance user in GSC UU. Its STAB Hidden Power Bug threatens common Pokemon such as Bellossom, Slowbro, Slowking, Hypno, and Mr. Mime. It has relatively few weaknesses, notably lacking the problematic weakness to Electric that its biggest competition Scyther has, and its above average Speed also lets it outrun Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Kabutops, Victreebel, and Politoed. However, Pinsir can be difficult to switch in because of its low HP and Special Defense in a metagame with numerous special threats. Moreover, Pinsir is absolutely stonewalled by Haunter unless it runs the rare Hidden Power Ground and struggles with other common Pokemon such as Fire Blast Nidoqueen, Qwilfish, and Scyther. Lastly, Pinsir faces huge competition from one of the best Pokemon in the tier in Scyther, which is faster, immune to Spikes, has better special bulk, and can do more for its team because of Baton Pass.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground is Pinsir's most viable other option; alongside a Normal-type attack, it gives Pinsir perfect neutral coverage in only two moves and lets it beat Haunter and Nidoqueen more easily, but losing Hidden Power Bug leaves Pinsir worse off against Psychic-types like Slowbro, Hypno, and Mr. Mime. Pinsir can use Rest alongside Mint Berry in order to bring it back to full health and get rid of status. Alternatively, Substitute can potentially be used to block attempts to inflict status on Pinsir and take advantage of Pokemon that are unable to move due to sleep or paralysis. Miracle Berry is an option, although the lack of Leftovers with Pinsir's bad special bulk make it a niche option. Lastly, Pinsir can run a set with Endure and Flail that has sweeping potential when Pinsir is partnered with a Pokemon that can pass Speed to it, but it is next to worthless otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is the best Pinsir check because it 4x resists Hidden Power Bug and is completely immune to Submission and Double-Edge. A Pinsir switching out lets Haunter use Hypnosis on anything that comes in or hit hard with Thunder or Psychic. However, if Pinsir is running Hidden Power Ground, then it can beat Haunter unless it hits Hypnosis or is carrying Destiny Bond, which can force a trade.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: If Nidoqueen is running Fire Blast, then it will beat Pinsir in a one-on-one matchup, although it takes big damage from Hidden Power Ground or Double-Edge after a Swords Dance. In addition, Lovely Kiss is able to disrupt offensive Pinsir's momentumâ€”although this is limited to non-Sleep Talk setsâ€”and Moonlight gives decent longevity against RestTalk variants, but it hates getting paralyzed by Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Qwilfish</strong>: Qwilfish has good Defense, and Haze lets it get rid of any boosts Pinsir has obtained. It also has a chance to 3HKO with Hydro Pump and can put down Spikes when Pinsir switches out. However, Pinsir can deal massive damage to Qwilfish if it manages to win the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Scyther</strong>: Scyther outspeeds Pinsir and 3HKOes with Wing Attack; this can also be brought to a 2HKO if Pinsir takes recoil from Double-Edge. If Scyther finds itself against an unboosted Pinsir, it can generally set up Swords Dance freely. However, Scyther must beware of being paralyzed when switching in, and it can potentially lose to Pinsir if it switches into a full health Pinsir that just used Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Jumpluff</strong>: Jumpluff dominates offensive Pinsir because it is not 2HKOed unless Pinsir sets up and can easily lock Pinsir into Swords Dance. It can also cripple Pinsir with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Some Jumpluff carry Hidden Power Flying, making it an even worse matchup. However, Jumpluff falls flat against RestTalk variants, since Encore fails against called moves from Sleep Talk, and Jumpluff is crippled by paralysis from Body Slam from either Pinsir variant.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat is a very reliable Pinsir check because of its access to Haze, letting it remove any of Pinsir's boosts. It can also take a few Double-Edges because of its decent bulk and 3HKO Pinsir in return with Hidden Power Flying or Wing Attack. However, Crobat hates being paralyzed by Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Omastar, Kabutops, and Magneton all are unreliable when dealing with the offensive set because of Submission, but they all dominate the RestTalk set because of their Body Slam resistance and ability to hit Pinsir very hard, although Kabutops hates being paralyzed by Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While all the Fire-types are rare, they dominate Pinsir one-on-one. Magmar and Arcanine are able to outspeed and OHKO Pinsir and can reliably switch into Hidden Power Bug. Flareon is also able to OHKO Pinsir, but it is hit rather hard by Double-Edge and is slower.</p>",

Double-Edge is Pinsir's most powerful move, notably 2HKOing Nidoqueen after a single Swords Dance. Two alternative options for Double-Edge are Return and Body Slam. The former has more power than Body Slam and retains the ability to 2HKO Nidoqueen if Spikes are up, while the latter doesn't hit as hard but effectively threatens the Pokemon that are often used to check Pinsir, such as Scyther, Jumpluff, and Crobat with paralysis. Submission targets Magneton, Kabutops, and Omastar, which can take both of the other attacking moves, and having a powerful move for Granbull is very handy. Pinsir sets up best against Pokemon it scares out such as Slowbro, Slowking, Hypno, and Chansey, although it must watch for status.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pinsir struggles with Qwilfish, Scyther, and especially Haunter, so Pursuit Electabuzz makes a great partner, as it threatens the former two and traps Haunter. Pinsir's great attacking power after a Swords Dance means the opponent will often have to sacrifice a Pokemon to take it down, which can let powerful attackers such as Nidoqueen and Curse Granbull clean up late-game. Gligar, although a niche Pokemon, is a good Pinsir partner because Pinsir has a good matchup against Ice Beam Nidoqueen variants, while Gligar checks Fire Blast Nidoqueen variants. Blastoise works well alongside Pinsir to spin entry hazards away, making setting up easier and offsetting recoil. Screen setters such as Chansey, Hypno, and Electrode can ease Pinsir's setup and make it harder to handle. Paralysis support is very useful for helping Pinsir beat faster Pokemon without taking too many hits. Pinsir is also great when stacked alongside other setup sweepers such as Scyther and Sandslash to overwhelm the opponent's defensive Pokemon when given screen support.</p>"

This set also lets Pinsir beat Ice Beam variants of Nidoqueen, as it doesn't care about Lovely Kiss and doesn't take too much from Nidoqueen's attacks, letting it beat Nidoqueen in the long run. The point of running Body Slam on this set is to provide neutral damage output on Scyther and Nidoqueen and to paralyze Pokemon that tend to revenge kill Pinsir such as Dodrio, Crobat, and Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Pinsir set is walled by any Normal-resistant Pokemon, it is wise to pair it with Spikes so its counters are slowly worn down. As with the Swords Dance set, Pursuit Electabuzz makes a great partner for this set, as it forces Kabutops and Omastar out and Pursuit traps Haunter. Light Screen support from Electrode, Ampharos, or Hypno is nice for preventing Pinsir from being too overwhelmed by special threats. Granbull makes for an excellent partner, as Pinsir can take on Granbull's role of as a status absorber, allowing Granbull to run a more offensive set. Granbull will then be able to lure in Pinsir counters such as Magneton and Haunter and surprise KO them with Hidden Power Ground.</p>"

What distinguishes Tauros is the fact that it's so fast, meaning that whatever switches in will more than likely have to eat two Double-Edges before being able to act, and by then it may well be too late. When considering Tauros, be sure to have a solid plan to dismantle Skarmory and Forretress, and should they be brought down, let the rodeo begin.</p>",

Forretress will take a really hard hit from Fire Blast, Skarmory not so much, but remember that to have Fire Blast, Tauros will have to sacrifice part of what makes it so good. Aerodactyl works very similarly as a UU counter; Aerodactyl also benefits from being faster than Tauros and can carry Reflect too to buffer Tauros's assaults.</p> <p>Next in line is probably Starmie, but only if it has Reflect; since it's one of the only common Pokemon faster than Tauros, it only has to take one Double-Edge before setting up Reflect and healing off damage with Recover. Raikou can be used similarly, but since it takes a lot of damage from Earthquake and has to Rest instead of Recover, it can't switch in more than once or twice. Note that if Starmie or Raikou get paralyzed, they are no longer legitimate counters.</p> <p>Other options for counters can include Pokemon with high Defense and/or Charm, Reflect, or Growl--Pokemon like Miltank, Umbreon, Donphan, and Suicune are examples--but remember that they'll take two large hits before being able to act.

Tauros also doubles as a nifty switch-in to Nidoking, as Tauros isn't weak to any of Nidoking's attacks. Tauros is a very simple Pokemon to use, but it is very good at what it does.</p>"}}

Moreover, its coverage and bulk make it an adequate check to Scyther and allow it to do just enough damage to the tier's bulkier foes that it can sometimes be difficult to deal with. What prevents Gyarados from being a top-tier Pokemon is its crippling weakness to Electric-type attacks, which are sadly a very common sight in the tier. Its low Special Attack stat also means that it has trouble breaking through bulkier Pokemon like Granbull and Slowking. Furthermore, if it lacks Rest or Heal Bell support, then paralysis is highly problematic, as once paralyzed it has very low chances of beating Moonlight Nidoqueen, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used instead of Hidden Power Flying to do heavy damage to Magneton and hit Haunter and other Electric-types Harder, but it makes Gyarados a poor check to Scyther and Pinsir. Gyarados can use both Double-Edge and Roar and forgo Hidden Power Flying, but similarly to Hidden Power Ground, it makes Gyarados fodder for Scyther and Pinsir.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Ampharos, Lanturn, and Magneton can OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Electric-type attacks. Gyarados can hit them for a 3HKO on the switch with Hidden Power Ground, however. Magneton also risks a potential OHKO from Hidden Power Ground variants.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Most Psychic-types have a favorable matchup against Gyarados thanks to their access to Electric-type moves and lack of weaknesses to Gyarados's attacks. Hypno is very difficult for Gyarados to get past and can wear it down, inflict status on it, or set up a screen. Unlike Slowbro, Slowking is not 3HKOed by Thunder and can therefore take Gyarados on and wear it down with STAB Psychic or paralyze it. Mr. Mime and Kadabra take heavy damage from Double-Edge and Hidden Power Flying but threaten Gyarados with their Electric-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Granbull and bulkier Normal-types like Lickitung lack weaknesses to Gyarados's attacks and are bulky enough that Gyarados fails to reliably 3HKO them. Granbull immediately threatens Gyarados back with its powerful STAB Return and can potentially stall Gyarados out of Hydro Pump with RestTalk; however, it does risk a 3HKO from Gyarados, especially if Spikes are up. Chansey can also take Gyarados on somewhat decently thanks to Soft-Boiled, although if it lacks Toxic and Counter, it may run out of Soft-Boiled PP before it can take Gyarados down. If Gyarados lacks Hidden Power Flying, the high recoil from Double-Edge will at least make Gyarados think twice about trying to take Chansey down.</p>",

        "All-out Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to take full advantage of Gyarados's offensive stats and movepool. Once Gyarados has been brought in on a predicted Earthquake or resisted attack such as Surf from Slowbro or Blastoise, it can fire off the attack that its trainer believes will deal the most damage to the Pokemon it will face that turnâ€”Hydro Pump hits Nidoqueen for a 2HKO and scares out most other Ground-types, Thunder hits most Water-types fairly hard and can inflict paralysis, and Hidden Power Flying does solid neutral damage off Gyarados's impressive Attack stat. Hidden Power Flying also 2HKOes Bellossom, Scyther, and Pinsir. Double-Edge is even stronger against neutral targets than Hidden Power Flying and importantly smacks Electric-types like Ampharos and Electabuzz. Alternatively, if a phazer is absent from your lineup, Gyarados makes for a solid Roar user that can threaten Ground-types and potentially disrupt Baton Pass attempts from Scyther.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Gyarados set functions best on bulky offensive teams that run Nidoqueen for its typing synergy and Pokemon that can absorb status and hits like Hypno and Slowking. Spikes help both Gyarados and Nidoqueen punish the switches they force more effectively, so Qwilfish is also a desirable teammate. As Gyarados and Nidoqueen can both struggle to deal with Curse RestTalk Granbull and Spikes are of great importance to this kind of team's success, Haunter makes for another solid choice with its immunity to Rapid Spin and Return. It also has great offensive synergy with Gyarados, as its Explosion can be used to take down Gyarados checks like Ampharos and Hypno. Gyarados also makes for a decent recipient of Scyther's Swords Dance boosts, as it can take many special hits quite well, unlike other physical attackers.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jack of all trades, master of none. Lapras has incredibly well-rounded stats and a good movepool, but it lacks both a particularly exceptional stat and a particularly exceptional movepool that separates it from its competitors. In most cases, Lanturn is superior to Lapras due to learning Thunder Wave and having STAB on the always-useful Electric attacks. Lapras has a decent Attack stat, but it isn't really enough to warrant using any physical attack on it since Ice Beam will usually cause more damage, in addition to Thunder's paralysis chance eclipsing the usefulness of Body Slam. When considering Lapras, keep in mind the things it has that Lanturn doesn't, namely Reflect and STAB Ice Beam. The transition from RBY stripped Lapras of most of the things that made it great in RBY (no Leftovers, more low-defense Pokemon, 90% Blizzard accuracy, Snorlax with 228 Special Defense), so make sure to use what little it has left.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As with most Water-types, Toxic deserves a mention for its ability to whittle away Snorlax's health, which is indeed very useful; combined with Confuse Ray and a little luck, this can make life very hectic for Snorlax indeed. Let it be noted that Lapras does learn a variety of moves, but only gets good use of some of them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Electric-types handle Lapras well, with the exception of Zapdos who gets hit hard with Ice Beam. Most Pokemon with a high Special Defense with no weaknesses to Lapras's attacks will also pass through easily; these include Umbreon, Snorlax, Blissey, and Hypno. In UU, Magneton is a great option since it resists both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and has a very powerful Thunderbolt. In addition, if Lapras does not sport Surf, many more Pokemon become reliable switch-ins, especially more from the UU and BL tiers such as Scizor, Arcanine, and Typhlosion.</p>",

        "Tank": {"description": "<p>This set blends the subtle combination of support and attacking that Lapras provides. Confuse Ray is a tad underrated as a move, but the 50% chance of incapacitation it provides is quite useful indeed for things like Snorlax. Ice Beam and Thunder, again, is a solid attack combination; Thunder gets the nod here due to its increased chance of paralysis, which makes adding an attack like Body Slam nigh redundant, as either Ice Beam or Thunder will do more to any of Lapras's switch-ins than Body Slam (the exception being Blissey, which Body Slam doesn't damage enough to be useful). The last move is a tossup; Surf grants a bit more attacking versatility against the likes of Tyranitar and Steelix. If the opponent is confused, Lapras has a better chance of not getting hurt while trying to surprise an opponent with Sing. Finally, Reflect is an honorable option which will soften the potential blow that a physical counter like Snorlax can inflict.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>Vaporeon was a mediocre defensive Pokemon outclassed by Suicune for the majority of GSC's history. Its draws over Suicune were access to Reflect and Haze, but ultimately not having that monstrous Defense stat left it unused in OU. Then, the NYPC gods gave Vaporeon and its Eeveelution brethren a gift from Pokemon heavenâ€”Growthâ€”which catapulted Vaporeon into legitimate OU territory. Growth is the only move in GSC that boosts the Special Attack stat, and Vaporeon is by far the best user for a standalone special sweep thanks to its bulk and high Special Attack. Nowadays, while Vaporeon still has the same defensive prowess, Growth boosts its Special Attack, which is high even without a boost but often overlooked, and makes it one of the premier offensive threats in the game. Vaporeon is a threat that must not be underestimated despite its initial lack of popularity.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vaporeon can use other moves effectively in the last moveslot. Thanks to GSC's phazing mechanics, Vaporeon's slower Roar prevents faster phazers such as Roar Suicune from phazing it. Roar also allows Vaporeon to win mirror matches and can also be used to Spikes-shuffle with Vaporeon's ability to force switches. Ice Beam is an excellent coverage option for destroying Exeggutor, Dragonite, and Zapdos. The ability to freeze foes such as Suicune and Blissey can also facilitate a sweep. However, Sleep Talk or Acid Armor is generally the way to go.</p> <p>Vaporeon can also make use of the potent combination of Growth + Baton Pass by dropping Rest and Sleep Talk. In this case, Vaporeon is best off using Acid Armor as a second stat boost to pass, although Ice Beam, Roar, or Protect can also be useful. Good recipients include Jynx, Zapdos, Raikou, Jolteon, Starmie, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Growth boosts the recipient's Special Attack to scary levels, while Acid Armor boosts Defense to render the normally threatening Snorlax unable to do meaningful damage in return. Vaporeon is a great user of Baton Pass because, aside from the rare Roar Suicune, no popular phazer is capable of stopping Vaporeon from passing its boosts without taking a lot of damage from a boosted Hydro Pump or Surf. Even then, Suicune can be beaten by using Roar on Baton Pass Vaporeon. However, Raikou will usually make life difficult for a Baton Pass set. While it can't comfortably use Roar against Vaporeon without taking a lot of damage in return, it will do tons of damage to Vaporeon if it decides to stay in against Raikou, and it can tank most special attacking Baton Pass targets, even at +1. Zapdos is also a tough foe for Baton Pass Vaporeon; it cannot tank +1 special attackers the way Raikou can, but it does heavy damage to Vaporeon if it decides to stay in to use its slower Baton Pass, thereby preventing Vaporeon from trying again later in the match.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zapdos and Raikou</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou are the most common checks and can 2HKO with their STABs. However, they can't take too many Surfs or Hydro Pumps on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is the second most common answer to Vaporeon, but it's a shaky check. Snorlax is 3HKOed by a +1 Hydro Pump and Acid Armor variants of Vaporeon beat it without relying on a move with iffy accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is a good stop-gap against Vaporeon but won't last forever. It's easily targeted by Pursuit, dies quickly to Ice Beam Vaporeon, and if Spikes are down it will eventually be put into +1 Surf or Hydro Pump KO range.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster can outspeed Vaporeon and Explode on it, but Cloyster isn't doing anything to stop Vaporeon without sacrificing itself with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar 3HKOes with an Electric-type attack, and can Explode or use Destiny Bond if things go south, although it struggles to take Vaporeon's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Suicune</strong>: While Vaporeon is usually countered by using high damage output, there are quite a few Pokemon that wall it entirely. Roar Suicune is the most common full stop to Vaporeon, although it fails to stop last-Pokemon Vaporeon or variants that use Roar themselves. Suicune can also play to freeze Vaporeon with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen</strong>: Light Screen Blissey can help teammates such as Zapdos to switch more easily into Vaporeon. It can also try to outstall Vaporeon, but Blissey will usually lose the PP war without a teammate to switch to. Additionally, on the turn after Light Screen wears off, a combination of a high damage roll and a critical hit from a +5 Surf will put Blissey in KO range on the following turn. Vaporeon can also use Ice Beam to freeze Blissey. At the very least, Light Screen Blissey will be difficult to defeat for Hydro Pump Vaporeon and its meager 8 PP. Starmie resists Surf and can use Thunder hoping for three consecutive hits to 3HKO Vaporeon or Light Screen to flat-out stall Vaporeon out of PP. Starmie, unlike Blissey, can outstall Vaporeon because of Rapid Spin's high PP.</p> <p><strong>Meganium</strong>: As for less common walls to Vaporeon, Meganium can wall Vaporeon with Leech Seed, Synthesis, and possibly Light Screen, although Ice Beam Vaporeon can beat it.</p> <p><strong>Kingdra</strong>: In addition, Kingdra can Curse in Vaporeon's face, uses Haze, or even go for the freeze with Ice Beam while only being 5HKOed by +5 Surfs, although it can be 2HKOed by +5 Ice Beams or stalled out by Acid Armor variants.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel resists Surf and sets up a counter-sweep with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite resists Surf and threatens Vaporeon with Thunder and Double-Edge, but loses to Ice Beam variants.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross outspeeds Vaporeon and very narrowly misses out on 2HKOing it at full health, although Acid Armor mitigates this damage and Heracross has trouble switching into Vaporeon.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Vaporeon is a half-decent check to itself. Even after switching in to give the opposing Vaporeon a turn advantage, a Sleep Talking Vaporeon has only slightly less than even odds at beating an opposing Sleep Talk Vaporeon and better odds if the opposing Vaporeon is not a Sleep Talking variant. +4 Surf and +3 Hydro Pump both 3HKO an opposing Vaporeon, so boost this far before you stop setting up and start attacking. Alternatively, you can just use Roar so that you can phaze opposing Vaporeon after you gather a couple of boosts in the Growth war.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Growth Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Vaporeon is a unique offensive Pokemon in GSC OU. It's a legitimate special threat that can take a hit and can set up with Growth. Unlike the legendary Electric-types that are GSC's other prominent special threats, Vaporeon is more geared towards setting up and sweeping rather than scoring opportunistic KOs. Vaporeon sets up on the special side, which makes it immune to stall tactics such as Growl and Charm, as opposed to other reliable setup Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax. Dissimilar to more daring setup Pokemon such as Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak, Vaporeon is able to break stall while having an easy-to-use setup move and the ability to take hits.</p> <p>Vaporeon's STAB is the choice between reliability and power. Hydro Pump is great for wallbreaking. It can 3HKO Snorlax after a single Growth and it also does 36-43% to Raikou without a boost, meaning that if Spikes are down and Vaporeon's Hydro Pump connects, Raikou can only afford to switch in once more before having to use Rest. Surf, on the other hand, isn't going to miss and doesn't suffer from Hydro Pump's horrendous 8 PP. Growth is the whole point of the set, allowing Vaporeon to take advantage of its good defenses and set up the sweep. Rest keeps it alive and gives it the longevity that allows it to play defensively and to set up when needed. As for the fourth move, Sleep Talk is the standard and keeps Vaporeon around to tank hits from Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon. Furthermore, Sleep Talk also minimizes downtime when trying to set up. Acid Armor, however, beats CurseLax in a head-to-head match-up. Acid Armor is also nice for PP wars with its incredible 61 PP, and buffers Vaporeon against other dangerous physical attackers such as Heracross, Machamp, and Explosion users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Umbreon get rid of Exeggutor, a prominent Pokemon with a resistance to Water-type attacks that also has the offensive prowess to force Vaporeon to switch out. Tyranitar in particular can also chip away at Zapdos and Raikou, which force Vaporeon out with strong STAB Electric-type moves, but can be rendered unable to switch in on Vaporeon with some residual damage. Other great partners for Vaporeon are offensive Explosion users; Exeggutor and Steelix frequently target Zapdos with their Explosions, Gengar commonly takes down Raikou, and Cloyster has a good chance of taking out any of these threats. Paralyzing Raikou and weakening Snorlax can also go a long way towards helping Vaporeon pick up the pieces. Thunder or Thunder Wave from Zapdos or your own Raikou can paralyze an opposing Raikou, while the combination of Toxic and Spikes will eventually force Snorlax to Rest, giving Vaporeon an opening to set up against it.</p>"

  "Jolteon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>As a pure Electric-type, Jolteon faces heavy competition from Raikou due to the latter's better bulk and power, which means that it outclasses Jolteon as a special wall and as a phazer. Furthermore, the popularity of other Electric-types such as Zapdos makes Pokemon like Steelix and once again Raikou popular, which hinders Jolteon even more. However, there's still a reason why Jolteon is viable in OU: Baton Pass. With boosting moves such as Agility and Growth, a sky-high Speed stat, and an Electric STAB attack that allows it to pressure common phazers like Skarmory and Suicune, Jolteon makes for a very effective user of this move.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is useful for taking advantage of Gengar and Electric-types that lack phazing moves, as these foes are unable to break Jolteon's Substitutes consistently, which can give it time to set up Growth boosts safely. Although it's outclassed as a defensively oriented phazer, Jolteon can still make good use of Roar by lowering its Speed below 328 in order to be slower than Raikou and prevent it from phazing Jolteon; it can possibly even drop it to 320, since some Roar variants of Raikou lower their Speed for the same reason. Be wary of going further, though; at 319 Speed, Jolteon will merely Speed tie with Gengar if both are paralyzed. This move can also be a pain for other answers like Snorlax and Steelix if used in tandem with Spikes. Rest is an option that allows Jolteon to switch in on Thunder without taking the huge risk of being crippled by paralysis for the rest of the game and improves Jolteon's chances of sweeping late-game with Growth if it has a solid defensive core to back it up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Raikou</strong>: Preventing Jolteon from passing any boosts is the best way to check it. Roar Raikou is arguably Jolteon's worst nightmare, since Raikou can take numerous hits from Jolteon and only really fears paralysis from it. Raikou can also attempt to paralyze Jolteon with its own Thunder, which if successful is a death sentence for Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Other Phazers</strong>: Steelix is another phazer that deals heavy damage with STAB Earthquake if Jolteon tries to stay in, but it takes a significant amount of damage from Hidden Power Water in return. Tyranitar is bulky enough to withstand three Thunders most of the time, enabling it to phaze Jolteon at least once or go for either the 3HKO with Rock Slide or the 2HKO with Earthquake if it carries it, but just like Steelix, it will have to check other Pokemon too and thus can be worn down pretty quickly. Rhydon and Golem also pack Roar most of the time and can be used as emergency checks to Jolteon, since they can both take a Hidden Power Water at full health and threaten Jolteon with their STAB Earthquake, which is an OHKO most of the time. None of these phazers are completely safe against Jolteon, so it is important to always consider the risk of allowing Jolteon to get away with the Baton Pass against the risk of allowing it to land a hit on your phazer. Sometimes it can be best to try to trade hits or to use Explosion instead of phazing Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax, Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Marowak are all common offensive Pokemon that can throw out powerful hits, spread sleep and paralysis, and use Explosion or boosting moves in front of Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire, although far less common, walls Jolteon but isn't as immediately powerful as the aforementioned Pokemon, so it usually doesn't threaten the recipient as much.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Most special walls can shut down Jolteon, since it doesn't hit hard enough to keep them at bay. Blissey can threaten Jolteon and most of its recipients with Sing and Toxic, and it can be very painful for Growth Pass teams to face if it has Light Screen or Present. Umbreon ensures that physically oriented Baton Pass recipients won't pose much of a threat with Charm, but it has to watch out for the potential paralysis from Thunder and for some recipients like Belly Drum Snorlax or other Belly Drum users, which can overpower it.</p> <p><strong>Meganium and Venusaur</strong>: Meganium and Venusaur, although uncommon, can cripple any switch-in with Leech Seed and use either a screen or Sleep Powder to neutralize the foe.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set exploits Jolteon's main advantages over Raikou, with Baton Pass being the selling point. Jolteon itself doesn't benefit from Agility due to its natural Speed; it's meant to be passed to a slower Pokemon that could attempt a sweep. Alternatively, Jolteon becomes more individually threatening with Growth because of its Speed and the damage output of a boosted Thunder. The type of Hidden Power depends on your team, but because Steelix is one of Jolteon's biggest problems, Hidden Power Water is often the preferred option, as it allows Jolteon to 3HKO it, as well as doing plenty of damage to Rhydon and Golem, which are even more threatening offensively. Hidden Power Ice, on the other hand, gives better overall coverage and dents dangerous Pokemon like Exeggutor. Similarly, the choice between Thunder and Thunderbolt is based on personal preference. Thunder hits much harder, especially when boosted by Growth, and is more likely to land paralysis on opposing Pokemon like Raikou, whereas Thunderbolt is a weaker but safer option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jolteon's access to multiple boosting moves can be worrying at first for your opponent, but you must keep in mind that once you've revealed the boosting move, your opponent can get a pretty clear idea of the remaining members of your team if you haven't shown them already. Jolteon is best paired with slow and powerful Pokemon if using Agility or with other special attackers if using Growth. In the former case, common partners include Machamp, Belly Drum Snorlax, and especially Marowak, with which it forms a well-known combination called \"JoltWak\". Growth Jolteon's teammates, like Exeggutor, Gengar, and Jynx, will probably not sweep an entire team at +1, but they will potentially be able to overpower their usual answers, especially if they manage to put them to sleep. Nidoking deserves a special mention for its ability to immediately threaten Raikou, arguably the best special wall overall, while still benefiting from Growth, since boosted Ice Beam and Thunder are much more punishing for Zapdos and Suicune. Finally, Jolteon makes for an excellent addition to dedicated Baton Pass teams alongside Smeargle and to a lesser extent Scizor and Umbreon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Flareon makes its name as by far the best Pokemon that learns both Growth and Baton Pass in NU, becoming a powerful support piece for facilitating strong special attackers. Flareon also has incredible attacking stats itself, allowing it to function as a powerful wallbreaker, whether it be with Growth sets or mixed sets. Flareon also has an amazing Special Defense stat and a resistance to Fire, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Xatu, Magnemite, and Ninetales when using a RestTalk set. However, Flareon is very frail physically and is weak to Rock, Ground, and Water, all very common attacking types; strong STAB Normal-type attacks and Weezing's Sludge Bomb also deal significant damage. Flareon is also quite slow, sitting at only base 65 Speed, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed by a variety of threats like Stantler, Dugtrio, and Dewgong. Flareon can also be difficult to justify putting on teams, as Pokemon like Magmar, Weezing, and Stantler often tend to be better choices for the purpose of wallbreaking without dedicated team support, while Ninetales and Rapidash are usually preferred as RestTalk Fire-types for their much higher Speed stat and better physical bulk allowing them to check threats like Weezing.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out attacking set with Fire Blast, Double-Edge, Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Water, and Baton Pass or Protect can be used to give Flareon maximum immediate coverage and additional utility for pivoting or additional Leftovers recovery. However, RestTalk tends to outclass this set because, while it cannot immediately force significant damage unto Rock-types like Graveler and Sudowoodo, it is significantly sturdier in the long term and is much more resilient to status. Substitute can be used on the Growth Pass set to block status and give a temporary wall to whatever Flareon chooses to Baton Pass to, but it comes at the cost of coverage and can be difficult to pull off successfully.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Octillery takes little damage from Fire Blast and has a chance to dodge a 3HKO from both Double-Edge and Hidden Power Grass, especially if it has Ice Beam rather than Hidden Power Electric, always uses RestTalk to significantly improve its longevity, and hits back hard with an incredibly powerful 105 base Special Attack STAB Surf. However, it is slower than Flareon and is 3HKOed by Double-Edge while not OHKOing in return with Surf, even after Flareon takes recoil damage, so it is very quickly forced to use Rest if switching into Double-Edge; it also means that if Flareon uses Growth as Octillery switches in, it can safely Baton Pass the Growth boost out to something not weak to Water, such as Dewgong. Dewgong itself outspeeds and can either 2HKO Flareon with Surf or use Encore on Flareon's use of Growth, forcing it to switch out, though it takes significantly more damage from Fire Blast due to its part Ice typing. Chinchou also outspeeds Flareon and hits it hard, but its Special Attack stat is so low that Surf cannot 2HKO even Hidden Power Grass variants of Flareon from full health, and Chinchou takes massive damage from all of Double-Edge, Hidden Power Ground, and Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is much faster than Flareon and can hit it with Earthquake for upwards of 90% of its health or use Flareon switching out of battle to set up a Substitute. However, Dugtrio is slammed by Flareon, being 2HKOed by most of its moves, and thus cannot switch directly into it more than once unless on a predicted use of Growth or Protect. The Reflect that Growth Pass Flareon is often paired with also prevents Dugtrio from beating it, though Dugtrio can still use Screech, which will even carry over when Flareon uses Baton Pass.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Sudowoodo resists both Fire and Normal and is bulky enough both physically and specially to where the occasional Hidden Power Ground cannot 3HKO without Spikes, and Flareon needs to use Growth to 2HKO with Hidden Power Grass. Sudowoodo meanwhile can boost up with Curse, hit Flareon hard with either Rock Slide or Earthquake, and even use Self-Destruct, preventing any safe usage of Baton Pass. Graveler and Pupitar are much rarer and take signficantly more damage from Hidden Power Grass, with Graveler even being OHKOed without any boosts, but they are sufficient answers to Flareon sets without Hidden Power Grass, especially since Graveler has Explosion, and Pupitar has Screech to disrupt any Growth Pass antics.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: Stantler, Fearow, Persian, Primeape, Hitmonlee, and Kingler all outspeed and hit Flareon incredibly hard with their STAB moves or super effective coverage. Rapidash uses Double-Edge and Magmar occasionally uses Hidden Power Ground, both of which also deal significant damage to Flareon. However, none of these Pokemon want to switch into Flareon in fear of Fire Blast or Double-Edge, and Flareon can also use Baton Pass as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If not running RestTalk, poison is quite harmful, as Flareon wants to preserve its health as much as possible to be able to come into battle multiple times and take hits from faster Pokemon before attacking. Paralysis is also ruinous, as Flareon needs to be able to outspeed as much as possible, and any full paralysis is extremely detrimental, as Flareon needs to be spending the turns it gets doing something productive, especially if attempting to execute a Growth Pass. Sleep, while much rarer, flat out puts Flareon out of commission. All three status effects are also often dished out by prime targets for Flareon's entry, such as Ninetales's Toxic, Gloom's Stun Spore, Sludge Bomb, or even Sleep Powder, and Magnemite's Thunder, making it risky to try to switch into them when not running RestTalk.</p>",

        "Growth Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is chosen over Flamethrower to give Flareon more use mid-game when it cannot set up a Growth safely, since Fire Blast can 2HKO important targets, such as Xatu and Stantler, that Flamethrower cannot. Hidden Power Grass targets Octillery and Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Graveler, but Double-Edge allows Flareon to threaten Ninetalesâ€”which uses Roar sometimes to counter Baton Passâ€”and also out-damages Hidden Power Grass against Octillery and Chinchou before a Growth boost. It also does not significantly lower Flareon's DVs like Hidden Power Grass does. However, it comes at the cost of not being able to significantly damage Rock-types like Graveler in the short term. Flareon should aim to use Baton Pass after using Growth once or twice and give those boosts to powerful special attackers early-game to break holes, then re-entering the battle again later on to launch powerful Fire Blasts or even execute a second Growth Pass.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The prime candidate for receiving a Growth Pass from Flareon is Dewgong, specifically the 3 attacks + Protect variant. This set is extremely efficient at shredding through multiple pokemon on the opponentâ€™s team, as it has perfect coverage, and Dewgong is difficult to take down quickly due to it being so bulky and having Protect to gain extra recovery from Leftovers. However, it lacks the damage to be able to function effectively without a Growth Pass from Flareon. Dual screens Dragonair is another valuable partner, facilitating a much easier setup early-game while preventing the common Pineco lead from safely using Spikes. Xatu is also an amazing Growth recipient, gaining the power it needs to 2HKO targets such as Octillery and 3HKO bulkier walls like Wigglytuff while also not being vulnerable to Fighting-types like Dewgong is. Hidden Power Electric Octillery also makes for a fantastic Growth recipient, as Octillery is able to grab many 2HKOs when at +1, and it can even 3HKO Dewgong. Magmar can also work as a solid Growth recipient with its incredibly powerful Fire Blasts and superb coverage, though it can be difficult to successfully pass to, as it shares the same weaknesses as Flareon. Wigglytuff can even be a fine Growth recipient due to its great bulk and incredible array of coverage, including Ice Beam, Thunder, and Fire Blast.</p>"

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is essential over Flamethrower, as this set wants all the power it can get without Growth. Double-Edge is Flareon's strongest neutral physical move, primarily being able to 3HKO Octillery and Ninetales. RestTalk grants Flareon great longevity, making it a solid check to Xatu and letting it counter Ninetales, other Flareon that lack a physical attack, Magnemite, and Magmar without Hidden Power Ground, letting Flareon effortlessly use them to fire off attacks. RestTalk also significantly reduces Flareon's vulnerability to status, no longer being afraid of paralysis from Magnemite's Thunder, Gloom's Stun Spore, or Toxic poison from Ninetales and Pineco. RestTalk also allows Flareon to fully utilize the high power of Double-Edge without fearing its recoil damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pineco is RestTalk Flareon's favorite partner, setting Spikes to wear down Rock-types like Sudowoodo and giving threats like Octillery, Dewgong, and Stantler a much more difficult time switching into Flareon. Octillery is another very important partner, taking on the Sudowoodo, Dugtrio, and Graveler that would otherwise use Flareon to their advantage, as well as being able to duel other Octillery if it has Hidden Power Electric. Curse Porygon can accomplish similar feats as Octillery, switching into Sudowoodo and Graveler and appreciating Flareon's ability to handle Ninetales, Magnemite, and Gloom. Dugtrio assists with Sudowoodo and enjoys RestTalk Flareon's pairing with Pineco and efficiency at chipping Octillery and Dewgong. Xatu and Fearow can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and are good teammates of Flareon's for similar reasons to Dugtrio; Fearow, especially when paired with Toxic Pineco, makes for a great core with Flareon that repeatedly forces Sudowoodo and Graveler in and wears them down with repeated hits and Spikes or poison, respectively. Flareon can also be a decent switch-in to opposing Magnemite for Xatu and Fearow. Sudowoodo makes for a solid combo with Flareon, as it tends to use Self-Destruct on Octillery, Dewgong, or some other bulky wall like Wigglytuff, eliminating a potential stopgap to Flareon so that it can cause havoc easier; Sudowoodo also prevents Fearow and Persian from revenge killing Flareon and can Self-Destruct on Dugtrio. Weezing can accomplish similar feats, and Flareon can check Xatu and Ninetales for Weezing.</p>"

  "Porygon": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>In a landscape dominated by strong offensive Normal-types, Porygon appears outclassed and outgunned by all, especially by Wigglytuff, which is the default bulky, recovery-using Normal-type that blanket checks special attackers like Xatu, Dewgong, and Chinchou. However, Recover is a saving grace, being one of the best moves in Generation 2 and single-handedly making Porygon a legitimate pick. Recover's astonishing 32 PP makes Porygon far more resilient a wall than its stats would show, turning otherwise 3HKOs from unboosted attackers like Xatu, Octillery, and Graveler into attacks that never break past a healthy Porygon without critical hits. Recover also frees up a moveslot since Porygon does not have to use both Rest and Sleep Talk. Porygon additionally has a solid movepool outside of Recover, as well as a good Special Attack stat and the overall amazing Normal typing, allowing it to utilize Recover to the fullest. Porygon answers Xatu and Dewgong well, using Recover to heal off any damage while hitting them super effectively or setting up Curse in return. Porygon can also help to answer Dugtrio and Curse Stantler, 2HKOing the former with Double-Edge or Ice Beam and paralyzing the latter. It's additionally a prime candidate for spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, using its solid bulk, Recover, and mere one weakness to slow down offensive threats and support slow but dangerous teammates, such as Kingler. However, Porygon still has plenty of flaws, the main ones being competition and vulnerability to status. Porygon has very low base stats when compared to other Normal-types like Fearow, Stantler, and Wigglytuff, all of which are much better than Porygon, primarily Wigglytuff as previously mentioned. Porygon is also the only recovery-using pure Normal-type that cannot effectively check Chinchou or Ninetales, as, although Recover is generally far better than RestTalk, it also means Porygon can't absorb status, so any Thunder paralysis or Toxic poison will effectively make Porygon useless; Sludge Bomb's poison rate also prevents Porygon from being a decent check to Weezing. Porygon is also incredibly slow; the only common Pokemon slower are Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Pineco, meaning Porygon is incredibly reliant on spreading paralysis and gets forced to repeatedly use Recover, instead of using an attacking move. This massively opens it up to critical hits, Ice Beam freezes, or Psychic Special Defense drops from the likes of Octillery, Dewgong, and Xatu on the switch or if they choose to stay in.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used in place of Thunder Wave on the Curse set in order to let Porygon break past Pupitar, as well as immediately threatening Xatu and especially Dugtrio without worrying about taking recoil. However, this makes it significantly more difficult for Porygon to successfully set up with Curse, as the opposing Pokemon will likely always be faster. Thus, after using Double-Edge, it may be in KO range due to taking a strong special attack before moving, alongside Double-Edge recoil; lacking Thunder Wave also means Porygon can no longer support other slow teammates, like Octillery. Nightmare has potential over Thunder Wave on the BoltBeam set to reduce the safety in switching in an erstwhile wall, especially with Spikes on the field and some prior chip damage, primarily aiming for RestTalk Wigglytuff, Ninetales, Stantler, or Persian. Once again though, it means sacrificing the all-around great utility of Thunder Wave, and Nightmare will likely be useless if BoltBeam Porygon does not encounter one of these foes, as other Rest users like Xatu, Fearow, and Octillery lose to Porygon anyways; Thief also tends to be a superior option against these checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wigglytuff</strong>: Wigglytuff walls the BoltBeam set, not being weak to Thunder or Ice Beam, and Porygon's lack of STAB means it will not significantly damage Wigglytuff, even with Spikes on the field. Wigglytuff, meanwhile, can set up with Curse in its face, easily boosting quickly, breaking past Porygon, and potentially KOing even more Pokemon. However, Double-Edge and Return variants of Wigglytuff stalemate with Curse Porygon, though Body Slam variants can paralyze Porygon and break past it. Wigglytuff does not enjoy Thief Porygon stealing its Leftovers, though Thief also means Porygon will not be carrying Thunder Wave, and will have a more difficult time switching into battle if it has not used Thief yet. Wigglytuff can also be frozen by Ice Beam, though this is highly unreliable, and Wigglytuff will likely be asleep for a notable portion of the time it is in battle, preventing Ice Beam from freezing.</p> <p><strong>Ninetales</strong>: Ninetales with Toxic basically counters Porygon, easily walling BoltBeam variants with its massive Special Defense and lack of weakness to Electric or Ice, and it can essentially reduce Porygon to fodder with poison. Curse Porygon is not walled by Ninetales but hates poison so much that it is still deathly afraid of Ninetales. Ninetales also always carries Rest and commonly Sleep Talk to prevent Thunder Wave paralysis, and if it doesn't pack Sleep Talk, then it will be running Roar, which prevents Curse Porygon from even setting up in the first place. However, Ninetales without Toxic is walled by Porygon, though it still walls BoltBeam variants of Porygon back.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: Magnemite is not weak to any of Thunder, Ice Beam, or Double-Edge and usually runs Thunder, which, if it lands, has a 30% chance to effectively end Porygon on the spot with paralysis. Magnemite also almost always uses Rest and Sleep Talk to heal off paralysis and remain an incredibly dangerous threat while sleeping, and Porygon giving it entry is not ideal. However, Magnemite despises Thief stealing its Leftovers because, with Spikes on the field and no passive healing, it is much more liable to being 3HKOed by Xatu and Fearow on the switch. Thus, it can fail to have any defensive value. While Magnemite can heal off paralysis with Rest, it still does not like being paralyzed; if it is at high health, it will likely have little reason to use Rest and thus can be susceptible to full paralysis, and also it will become slower than everything.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Attacks</strong>: Primeape and Hitmonlee come close to a flat-out OHKO on Porygon with their STAB attacks, and any minor chip damage, usually from Spikes, will push them over the line. They are not weak to either Thunder or Ice Beam, so RestTalk Hitmonlee hard walls BoltBeam Porygon, while Primeape can come in on a usage of Ice Beam or Recover and proceed to set up a free Substitute, blocking Thunder Wave and preventing the Porygon user from effectively switching around predicted moves. Primeape also occasionally runs RestTalk itself, which also lets it wall BoltBeam Porygon. It can even just critically hit right through any Defense boosts from Curse Porygon, as Cross Chop has a boosted critical hit rate of 25%. However, non-RestTalk Primeape despises Thunder Wave, and Hitmonlee does not enjoy paralysis before it uses Rest. Primeape using Cross Chop can also be exploited with a free switch to Xatu or Weezing, and Primeape may even eventually run out of its 8 PP; Cross Chop also has a 20% chance to miss, and both Primeape and Hitmonlee are 2HKOed by a Curse-boosted Double-Edge; they also cannot OHKO Porygon back if it is healthy. Additionally, while not a Fighting-type itself, Magmar has a high Attack stat and access to Cross Chop, which is a guaranteed OHKO on Porygon if it scores a critical hit, a 20% chance after accuracy; however, this is very risky for the Magmar user, as Magmar hates being paralyzed, and Cross Chop can easily miss or not land a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Pineco</strong>: Pineco can switch into Porygon on a use of Recover, Ice Beam, or Curse, proceed to easily use Spikes, and then either poison Porygon with Toxic or eliminate it outright with Explosion. However, Thunder can 2HKO Pineco with even the slightest amount of chip, usually coming from Spikes. If Pineco is paralyzed by Thunder Wave or Thunder as it switches in, the Porygon user can switch to their own Pineco and proceed to spam Rapid Spin until the opponent's Pineco is fully paralyzed. Pineco then can freely use Spikes, proceed to use Rapid Spin until another full paralysis occurs or Toxic is used, then use Explosion and win the Spikes war by a mile.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing is faster than Porygon and does not take significant damage from Double-Edge or Thunder, in return fishing for poison from Sludge Bomb while doing solid damage or outright taking out Porygon with Explosion. However, Weezing taking Thunder Wave or having its Leftovers stolen by Thief, prefers to stay healthy to take hits from faster threats like Fearow and Primeape, and has defensive responsibilities beyond handling Porygon; using Explosion means sacrificing Weezing just to eliminate Porygon, which can leave its team vulnerable to Primeape if Porygon chooses to partner with it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Sudowoodo can use Curse in front of Porygon, as it resists Double-Edge, is not weak to Thunder or Ice Beam, and has plenty of bulk. However, Sudowoodo does not enjoy taking Thunder Wave or having its Leftovers taken by Thief, and has to resort to sacrificing itself with Self-Destruct to take out Curse Porygon, as otherwise it won't do enough back to Porygon and will slowly get whittled down by Double-Edge and full paralysis turns. Even RestTalk Sudowoodo has to try and PP stall Porygon, which can even just result in Sudowoodo getting PP stalled itself. Graveler and Pupitar are immune to Thunder Wave, but Graveler cannot break past Porygon without well-timed critical hits or using Explosion on it due to being slower. Pupitar, meanwhile, is not 2HKOed by Ice Beam from full health, can easily break past Curse Porygon with Screech, and is faster; however, it cannot serve as an effective switch-in to Porygon with Ice Beam, unless it is comfortable trading most of its health to take a large chunk out of Porygon, though Porygon still might be able to heal off any damage later.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse Porygon may appear outclassed by other Curse Normal-types, mainly Wigglytuff and the rare Dunsparce, especially since they also have access to paralysis movesâ€”Thunder Wave or Body Slam and Glare, respectively. Porygon often gets overshadowed by Wigglytuff, but it makes up for this in waves by having Recover, allowing it to find setup and switch-in opportunities far more easily; Recover only using one moveslot also means Porygon can fit both recovery and the valuable paralysis spreading of Thunder Wave, whereas Wigglytuff and Dunsparce solely miss Sleep Talk if using a paralysis move, as their best self-healing move is Restâ€”the exception being Body Slam Wigglytuff, which retains Sleep Talk but can't spread paralysis as reliably. Porygon also differentiates itself from these two by being able to actively switch into Sudowoodo and Graveler, boosting up with Curse and and using Recover to stay healthy, forcing them to use Self-Destruct or Explosion, respectively, to take Porygon out. The combination of Curse, Thunder Wave, and Recover is so notable because Thunder Wave means Porygon will outspeed foes despite lowering its own Speed with Curse, and any full paralysis will be a free turn where Porygon does not have to use Recover, letting it continue powering up with Curse or just launch a boosted Double-Edge. The recoil of Double-Edge is a negligible drawback compared to Return's lower power due to Recover, and Porygon needs as much power as it can get with such a low Attack stat. Curse also importantly makes Porygon a decent switch-in to Stantler if at full health, avoiding a 2HKO even with Spikes up and paralyzing Stantler with Thunder Wave, proceeding to boost up with Curse and beat Stantler. RestTalk Stantler cannot match Porygon's boosts and can just give Porygon ample setup opportunity while Curse + Light Screen Stantler hates being paralyzed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Solid teammates for Curse Porygon are Weezing, Xatu, and Fearow, which can all take on Primeape and Hitmonlee; Octillery shuts down Ninetales and Sudowoodo; Sudowoodo and especially Graveler help prevent Pineco, Wigglytuff, and Weezing from using Porygon to set up or launch attacks; Ninetales stops Weezing and Magnemite. Pokemon that enjoy Porygon's paralysis Xatu-checking capabilities, like Kingler and Primeape, make for good partners as well. Fearow, RestTalk Persian, Fire Blast Weezing, and Sunny Day Ninetales get a special mention as teammates, as they appreciate Porygon's ability to force Sudowoodo and Graveler to sacrifice themselves to beat it.</p>"
        },
        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunder and Ice Beam are the best combination of special attacks to hit the highest number of common Pokemon for super effective damage, such as Xatu, Octillery, Dugtrio, Dewgong, Fearow, and Pupitar. Thunder Wave significantly reduces what can safely switch into and take advantage of Porygon, crippling targets like Magmar, Kingler, Flareon, Weezing, Stantler, and Primeape that lack RestTalk. Thunder Wave also is generally a great move to use into basically anything, as actually outspeeding foes allows Porygon to use its moves much more safely; the same speed control works great to support slow but powerful teammates, namely Kingler, Curse Stantler, Primeape, and Magmar, which appreciate threats like Xatu, Fearow, and Weezing being slowed down and potentially fully paralyzed. This particular Porygon set is a great threat to many Xatu + Dugtrio Spikes teamsâ€”one of the most common and dominant team structures in the tierâ€”as the only Pokemon commonly used on them that can handle BoltBeam Porygon without being ruined by Thunder Wave is Wigglytuff, which is still not on a majority of them. Still, this potential to face Wigglytuff is the main reason why Thief is a good consideration; Wigglytuff's ability to take hits is significantly reduced without Leftovers, especially with Spikes on the field. Also, Porygon has good enough Special Attack and super effective coverage to gradually chip down threats that can answer a Porygon that lacks Thunder Wave, like Weezing, over the course of a game, which are also further being chipped by Spikes. However, Thief of course leaves Porygon without the all-round amazing utility of Thunder Wave, meaning it has to try and fish for paralysis with Thunder, a mere 21% chance factoring in accuracy; Thief can also only steal one item, and not having Leftovers when first attempting to switch in, especially with Spikes on the field, can make finding entry for Porygon more difficult.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weezing is the best partner for Porygon, appreciating Porygon's prowess in checking Xatu and Dugtrio while taking on Primeape and Hitmonlee itself, and it can use Explosion to eliminate a Wigglytuff or Ninetales that walls Porygon. Pineco is also a prime teammate for Porygon, as its Spikes wears down walls like Wigglytuff and Ninetales, which Porygon struggles with. Fearow and Xatu help to check Primeape, Hitmonlee, Gloom, and RestTalk Stantler while appreciating Porygon's ability to take on Dewgong and Graveler; Porygon can also steal the Leftovers from Wigglytuff or Sudowoodo, which helps Fearow and Xatu wallbreak. Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Graveler serve as effective answers to Pineco, Wigglytuff, and Weezingâ€”bar if Weezing has Hidden Power Waterâ€”which can take advantage of Porygon, and Porygon can handle Dewgong andâ€”if at high healthâ€”Octillery for them. Graveler also clears away Spikes with Rapid Spin, making entry for Porygon easier. Octillery itself is a great ally for Porygon, stopping Ninetales and Sudowoodo in their tracks, and Octillery and Porygon can help each other in checking Xatu, other Octillery, and Ground-types like Dugtrio and Graveler so that neither gets overwhelmed too quickly. Good wincons that take advantage of paralysis, such as Kingler, Curse + Light Screen Stantler, and Primeape, like having Thunder Wave Porygon around to facilitate setup and check Xatu. Thunder Wave also makes setup easier for Wigglytuff, as does Porygon checking Sudowoodo and Graveler for it, and Wigglytuff can answer Chinchou, unlike Porygon, which is afraid of Thunder paralysis. Ninetales also has great synergy with Porygon, as Porygon can switch into and threaten out Octillery, Dewgong, and Graveler, while Ninetales walls Weezing and is a great answer to Magnemite. Gloom also works well with Porygon, halting Primeape, Hitmonlee, Chinchou, and Octillery that lack Ice Beam, while Porygon can switch into Xatu and Dewgong for Gloom; the two also combine to form a potentially overwhelming, paralysis-spamming core, with Gloom having Stun Spore and Porygon having Thunder Wave.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Omastar sports an unfortunate weakness to Ground in a metagame with numerous strong Ground-types and lacks the key resistance to Water that other bulky Water-types have. However, what sets it apart is its resistance to Normal and Flying. Granbull is an incredibly powerful threat in GSC UU, and Omastar is the best counter to it by far. Omastar's STAB Surf, solid coverage, and high Special Attack allow it to put a solid dent in almost any foe, an advantage it has over competing Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Magneton, which struggles to hit Ground- and Electric-types hard. However, outside of countering Granbull and Dodrio and checking Scyther without Hidden Power Ground, Omastar's favorable matchups are few and far between, so it can sometimes feel like dead weight if the opponent chooses not to bring them.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is an alternative to Surf that offers even more power, potentially 2HKOing Granbull, Kabutops, and Pinsir, but is much riskier due to its lower accuracy and low PP. Dropping Leftovers and running Thief over Rest trades longevity for greater offensive presence by allowing Omastar to permanently deprive a foe of its passive recovery. Omastar can also use Reflect to boost its Defense against Pokemon like Scyther and help out Pokemon like Electabuzz and Mr. Mime, since they fear powerful physical attacks. Omastar can run Haze to allow it to check Baton Pass users such as Scyther and Girafarig, although most Baton Pass users can threaten Omastar, so it is important to time its use for the moment when it is most impactful. Toxic can be used to put some pressure on Pokemon like Chansey, Slowking, and Lanturn and force them to use Rest or use up Heal Bell PP while also threatening offensive Pokemon with permanent status. Ancient Power can be used to give Omastar sweeping potential if it is lucky enough to activate its secondary effect, and it also allows Omastar to 2HKO Scyther.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Lanturn and Slowking are the most difficult Pokemon for Omastar to overcome. Their resistance to Water and high Special Defense prevent Omastar from dealing significant damage to them, and they can target Omastar's low Special Defense with their STAB attacks to quickly knock it out. Other bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Blastoise, and Politoed also have the advantage over Omastar, although unlike Slowking and Lanturn, Hidden Power Electric can 3HKO them after Spikes, so they aren't completely safe against it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos Speed ties with Omastar, OHKOes with Thunder, and cannot be 3HKOed in return by Omastar's Surf, even after Spikes damage. Ampharos can also set up Light Screen to assist its team in handling a likely Nidoqueen switch as well as Omastar itself. Electabuzz and Magneton pose a similar threat to Omastar offensively, but both take heavy damage from Omastar's STAB attacks, so they cannot safely check it in the long term.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom, Victreebel, and Vileplume can safely counter Omastar that lack Ice Beam, but as the move deals upwards of 40% to them, they must be cautious of being hit by it on the switch, especially if they have been paralyzed beforehand. In return, they can OHKO most of the time with Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass and can threaten to inflict status should Omastar switch out. Jumpluff can also safely check Omastar that lack Ice Beam, but there is a substantial chance it will be OHKOed by Ice Beam if it is caught by surprise.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Mr. Mime, Electabuzz, and Electrode can take a hit or two from Omastar and deal heavy damage in return with their Electric-type attacks. Kadabra, Haunter, and Pikachu also threaten Omastar, but their lack of bulk means that they should avoid switching into Omastar's Surf or Hydro Pumpâ€”there is even a small chance of Pikachu being outright OHKOed by the latter.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can easily force a stalemate with Omastar, as it takes next to no damage from any of its attacks. If Chansey has Present, it also poses a significant threat to Omastar due to its secondary type being Water. If Chansey has Light Screen, it can also allow a more dangerous teammate to switch in and set up.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Omastar's STAB Surf deals massive damage to almost all physical attackers, easily 3HKOing Granbull and coming close enough to a 2HKO that Granbull can find it difficult to perform its usual role of checking Nidoqueen if it takes a Surf. Ice Beam deals a lot of damage to Grass- and Flying-types, 2HKOing Scyther most of the time and sometimes 2HKOing Bellossom after Spikes. Another option is Hidden Power Electric, which hits opposing Water-types that resist Surf quite hard, barring Lanturn and Slowking. Lastly, Omastar enhances its longevity by using Rest, which it can pair with Sleep Talk to remain a threat while asleep and become even harder for Curse Granbull to break, even if it has Lovely Kiss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Omastar's weakness to Electric and the pressure it can put on Granbull make Nidoqueen a good partner. The two Pokemon greatly appreciate extra damage from Spikes to help them pressure bulky foes, so Qwilfish makes for another solid choice of teammate. As Omastar is disadvantaged against other bulky Water-types and is afraid of Bellossom, bulky status absorbers such as Hypno, Lanturn, and Ampharos, as well as Pokemon that can cure status like Chansey and Granbull, make for useful teammates.

  "Kabutops": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Consistent with its terrifying appearance, Kabutops is a unique and dangerous sweeper. With Swords Dance boosting its already high Attack, it can quickly become a terror to deal with, and the looming possibility of an Ancient Power boost can cause opponents to dread confrontations with this freakish fossil. Unfortunately, the fact that Kabutops runs such a move in its standard set should allow one to infer that Kabutops is lacking in the movepool department; notably, it lacks access to Rock Slide and Earthquake. Kabutops also has rather low HP and Special Defense stats, meaning it must move with care to ensure that it has enough HP left after setting up to take one or two foes down with it. Moreover, while its typing and decent Speed stat grant it winning matchups against all three of Nidoqueen, Granbull, and Scyther, it is far from a reliable response to any of these Pokemon. Instead, it is best played aggressively and, ideally, with screen support to maximize its opportunity to break through the opponent's defenses.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Rock can be chosen over Ancient Power for its extra power, but the difference in damage is not all that big, Kabutops must sacrifice a chunk of HP to use it due to DV requirements, and using it means that Kabutops can't use Hidden Power Ground; also, Ancient Power's secondary effect is very useful when it activates. Kabutops can use Surf over Hydro Pump, but it would then miss out on the critical unboosted 2HKO on Nidoqueen. Hidden Power Bug is another alternative that can 2HKO both Slowbro and Bellossom at +2 Attack, although it has worse general coverage and thus can be difficult to fit on a set. Giga Drain is a decent surprise option for hitting Quagsire, Omastar, and opposing Kabutops, although it fails to 2HKO Quagsire consistently. Kabutops learns Rapid Spin, but the move is illegal with Swords Dance, which means that Kabutops essentially loses all of its damage-dealing potential if it uses it. Similarly, Flail is not available with Swords Dance, which severely limits the move's viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom, Victreebel, and Vileplume counter Kabutops as long as they have a Grass-type STAB attack. Not only do they potentially OHKO Kabutops, but Kabutops also fails to come close to OHKOing any of them after a Swords Dance boost, and the Grass-types all have instant recovery to avoid being worn down. However, Jumpluff is usually 2HKOed by Ancient Power and is therefore a shaky check, despite having access to Encore.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electabuzz and Ampharos make for solid answers to Kabutops, easily OHKOing it with Thunder. Both of them also avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ground, although Electabuzz misses the OHKO on Kabutops if it has Thunderbolt and is usually OHKOed by +2 Hidden Power Ground after Spikes. Magneton takes more than 75% from unboosted Hidden Power Ground and should avoid switching into Kabutops, although it usually can survive a +2 Submission. Lanturn can survive a +2 Hidden Power Ground easily, but it can only OHKO Kabutops in return a third of the time, even with Thunder. Although less common, Electrode usually OHKOes Kabutops with Thunder and is rarely OHKOed by +2 Hidden Power Ground. Pikachu easily OHKOes Kabutops with Thunderbolt, but it cannot switch into it safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro deals almost half of Kabutops's health with STAB Surf and is only 3HKOed by +2 Ancient Power around 20% of the time. Slowking also has a solid matchup against Kabutops thanks to RestTalk and its powerful STAB attacks, despite having lower Defense than Slowbro. However, if Kabutops boosts to +4, it reliably 2HKOes Slowking and has good odds to 2HKO Slowbro. Blastoise fares worse, losing to Kabutops if it switches in on Swords Dance most of the time. However, its STAB Surf can still weaken Kabutops significantly before it goes down. Lastly, Quagsire is the most reliable Water-type check of them all thanks to its resistance to Rock and ability to 2HKO Kabutops with Earthquake. However, it is 2HKOed by +2 Double-Edge should Kabutops have it.</p> <p><strong>Mr. Mime and Kadabra</strong>: These two Psychic-types outspeed Kabutops and have numerous ways to deal with it. Kadabra can lock Kabutops into Swords Dance with Encore and hit it hard with Psychic or Thunder Punch. Mr. Mime not only has Encore but also has Hypnosis and Thunder to threaten Kabutops. However, Kabutops can potentially 2HKO Kadabra if it catches it with Ancient Power or Double-Edge on the switch and also hits Mr. Mime fairly hard with its unboosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Qwilfish</strong>: Qwilfish outspeeds Kabutops and can nullify its boosts with Haze. It also hits Kabutops fairly hard with Hydro Pump, so even if Qwilfish doesn't finish the job itself, it can weaken Kabutops for a teammate to finish it off safely.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Kabutops primarily functions as a wallbreaker and sweeper, and its access to Swords Dance allows it to fulfill this role admirably despite its lack of high-Base Power STAB attacks. Kabutops can hit some foes reasonably hard before using Swords Dance, but to break through GSC UU's bulkier foes such as Slowbro and Blastoise, it will need to boost to +2 or even +4 Attack. Once boosted, there are virtually no foes that can reliably put a stop to its deadly mix of physical coverage and STAB Hydro Pump. Its primary physical STAB attack, Ancient Power, is surprisingly powerful, OHKOing Scyther when unboosted and 2HKOing a wide variety of foes that do not resist it after a boost. Kabutops can also realistically sweep an entire opposing team if it manages to acquire the fabled Ancient Power boost, which allows it to survive various attacks, boosts both its physical and special attacks, and allows it to outspeed literally all unboosted foes. Hidden Power Ground allows Kabutops to deal substantial damage to Electric-types such as Magneton and Ampharos as well as Qwilfish, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier and one whose high Speed, deceptively solid bulk, and access to Haze make it difficult for Kabutops to achieve a sweep. Alternatively, Kabutops can use Submission to maximize its chances against Granbull while still dealing decent damage to Magneton and hitting Rock-types such as Omastar and opposing Kabutops for heavy damage. Hydro Pump is recommended as the fourth attack, as it allows Kabutops to 2HKO Nidoqueen without the need to boost its Attack, a trait that is highly valuable. However, Double-Edge can also be used in this slot and is Kabutops's strongest available physical attack aside from Hyper Beam. Without Double-Edge, Kabutops notably fails to 2HKO Quagsire, Blastoise, and Slowking after reaching +2 Attack, although only Quagsire 2HKOes it in return with its standard set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kabutops is a great addition to a team that can make use of an offensive sweeper. It provides little defensive utility, as even with its resistance to Normal, it performs inconsistently against Curse Granbull due to Hydro Pump's imperfect accuracy and Granbull's tendency to run RestTalk. For a more consistent approach to taking on Granbull, Haunter makes for a useful teammate and doubles as a Pokemon that can use Explosion to take down problematic foes like Electabuzz, Ampharos, and Bellossom for Kabutops. Similarly, while a healthy Kabutops can survive a +2 Hidden Power Ground from Scyther, Scyther's access to Baton Pass can foil Kabutops's attempts at threatening it and leave it to fend against a boosted foe that can OHKO it. Therefore, while Kabutops's somewhat useful defensive typing should be taken into consideration, it is Kabutops's offensive prowess that should primarily influence your teambuilding decisions. As one of the best wallbreakers in the tier, Kabutops appreciates being paired with other sweepers such as Pinsir, Scyther, and Sandslash that can take advantage of bulky foes having been weakened or else weaken them for Kabutops. Scyther deserves a special mention due to its ability to pass Swords Dance boosts to Kabutops, although the two of them share a common weakness to Electric, so the support of Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, Piloswine, Quagsire, and Sandslash is also welcome. Hypno and Bellossom are two potential teammates that can provide helpful paralysis, sleep, and screen support to Kabutops and its fellow sweepers. Kabutops particularly benefits from Qwilfish being paralyzed before it attempts a sweep, and Bellossom is great at drawing Qwilfish in for the purpose of paralyzing it. As Kabutops has somewhat respectable bulk for a sweeper and a fairly uncommon 4x weakness, it can also make fantastic use of screen support to mitigate its weaknesses to Ground and Electric. In addition to Hypno and Bellossom, Mr. Mime can also provide this support and potentially create opportunities for Kabutops to switch in with Encore, but it lacks the bulk of other supporters mentioned.</p>"

He has good Attack and Speed, but unfortunately does not have any strong STAB attacks to take advantage of it. Being a Rock-type immune to Earthquake is good, but his defensive stats are weak and he has a myriad other weaknesses. His only option to get an attack boost besides getting lucky with Ancient Power is Curse, which ruins his Speed. Despite all of these contradictions, Aerodactyl is very solid, but only if you know what you're doing.</p>",

Wing Attack has STAB and is a nifty OHKO on Heracross. And finally, should something like Forretress or Skarmory come along, Fire Blast will give them something to think about.

  "Snorlax": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Ever since the dawn of time, Snorlax has been one of the best and most threatening Pokemon in GSC. This holds true even in Ubers, where its absurd power, unpredictability, and hard-to-kill nature are second to none, granting Snorlax a spot on every single competitive Ubers team. Snorlax's sole presence warps the entire metagame around it, forcing teams to pack not only one but multiple answers for it while Snorlax simultaneously checks a wide array of very threatening Pokemon like Mewtwo, Zapdos, and Jolteon. Snorlax is one of the best progress makers in the format with its Curse set, relentlessly forcing its way through the opposition with absurd power and bulk alike, while also having other options like Belly Drum to annihilate defensive or paralyzed teams. Snorlax can do whatever its team needs it to do and does with unmatched game-to-game consistency.</p> <p>However, because of how metagame-warping Snorlax is, teams pack a lot of answers to it, such as Tyranitar, Golem, and Steelix; all three can phaze Snorlax with Roar, with Golem and Steelix even having access to Explosion to make a huge dent in Snorlax's HP. Other ways of dealing with Snorlax include Explosion from Pokemon like Mewtwo, Mew, and Gengar, all of which can KO Snorlax after some chip damage, although Snorlax can survive Explosion if it has enough Curse boosts. More defensive teams pack sturdy checks to Snorlax such as Barrier Mewtwo, Skarmory, and Lugia. Lastly, Snorlax doesn't commonly run Sleep Talk, meaning that once it's been forced to use Rest or put to sleep with Lovely Kiss or Sleep Powder, foes can use this opportunity to freely take advantage of it, as Snorlax won't have ways to punish them.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf and Thunder are both options Snorlax can run on some of its sets. Surf hits Golem and Rhydon harder than any other move in Snorlax's arsenal while still dealing super effective damage to Steelix; however, Snorlax often prefers to run Earthquake over Surf, as Surf is very weak and doesn't hit anything other than the listed Pokemon. Earthquake also hits targets like Tyranitar and Gengar harder, two Pokemon which could wall Snorlax if it's running Surf. Thunder allows Snorlax to hit Skarmory with high chances of 2HKOing it while also KOing Cloyster after it has switched into Double-Edge. Furthermore, Thunder also gives Snorlax the ability to potentially spread paralysis to foes like Gengar. However, running Thunder means Snorlax is hopelessly walled by Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon like Tyranitar, Steelix, and Golem.</p> <p>Rollout is another option to run on Curselax sets, as it is one of the few moves that allows Snorlax to beat certain combinations of Pokemon such as Barrier Mewtwo + Skarmory. However, Rollout won't be useful most of the time because it needs multiple turns to ramp up in power, during which Snorlax can be threatened with powerful attacks or phazed. Running Rollout also leaves Snorlax helpless against Steelix.</p> <p>Lastly, Protect is an option Snorlax can run to recover HP and scout Explosion and Self-Destruct from Pokemon like Mewtwo, Mew, Cloyster, and opposing Snorlax. It's best used on Drumlax sets, as Snorlax will be at half HP after using Belly Drum. Furthermore, this also allows Snorlax to take advantage of Leftovers and Belly Drum when below 50% HP to boost its Attack to +2. However, it doesn't offer much else, meaning Snorlax would much prefer running other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: By virtue of its incredible bulk, typing, and access to Curse, Rest, and Whirlwind, Skarmory is the best available counter to Snorlax and thus is one of the most common defensive answers to it, being a staple on more defensive teams. However, it must be careful of Flamethrower and Fire Blast, which 3HKO and 2HKO it, respectively, and Self-Destruct, which can either severely damage Skarmory for a teammate to finish off or outright OHKO it after some chip damage. Because of this, making sure Skarmory is not paralyzed is key to beat Snorlax one-on-one, as is having enough Curse boosts and HP to ensure Self-Destruct can't take it out.</p> <p><strong>Other Normal-resistant Phazers</strong>: Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon are more offensive Snorlax checks that can reliably phaze it, having enough physical bulk to not mind Earthquake too much; however, they all get 3HKOed on the switch and 2HKOed after a Curse boost. Steelix is another phazer that tanks a +1 Earthquake and can phaze Snorlax. Golem and Steelix also have access to Explosion, giving them a way of dealing critical damage to Snorlax for a teammate to take it out; however, this only works if Snorlax doesn't have too many Curse boosts, so all of the mentioned Pokemon would rather tank a hit and phaze Snorlax than use Explosion. Lastly, obscure Pokemon like Omastar can negate Snorlax's boosts with Haze, although it must be careful of Earthquake, as it 3HKOes Omastar unboosted and 2HKOes it at +2.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Barrier Mewtwo will cause massive trouble for Snorlax, as it can comfortably stall its attacks out of PP while not minding critical hits too much because of Recover. Mewtwo must be careful of Lovely Kiss and Self-Destruct variants, however, as those two can overwhelm it fairly easily. Offensive variants of Mewtwo can potentially threaten Snorlax with Psychic while also threatening Snorlax with a devastating Dynamic Punch and Self-Destruct of its own, both of which severely dent Snorlax. Body Slam paralysis can annoy Mewtwo greatly, however, as getting fully paralyzed will mean it loses one-on-one against Snorlax. As such, it must be kept at relatively high HP.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is one of the best offensive checks to Snorlax and is a Pokemon that will be switching into it across the early- to mid-game. Cloyster's raw bulk means it is only 4HKOed by an unboosted Double-Edge and 3HKOed by a +1 Double-Edge. Cloyster can thus set Spikes and force Snorlax to eventually use Rest with Toxic, giving away key momentum. However, one small adaptation Snorlax can make is to keep boosting with Curse in front of Cloyster, allowing it to potentially overwhelm it. The drawback of this is that, if Curse is used too much, Snorlax will be forced to use Rest to negate Toxic, meaning it must decide between boosting or attacking. Although very uncommon, Cloyster also needs to be careful of Thunder, as the move can KO it if it has already taken a Double-Edge from Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Some Snorlax variants might have more trouble defeating others; for example, Body Slam variants of Snorlax will be troubled by Double-Edge variants, as Body Slam only 4HKOes Snorlax whilst Double-Edge 3HKOes it. Lovely Kiss variants will beat slower variants of Snorlax since it doesn't commonly run Sleep Talk, meaning that a sleeping Snorlax will be a punching bag for up to six turns. Lastly, Self-Destruct can either outright OHKO or severely damage most Snorlax variants, making it a good panic button in case the opposing Snorlax is getting out of hand with its Curse boosts.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are the only Pokemon in the game immune to Snorlax's STAB moves, giving them a special niche in checking Snorlax. Gengar can hit Snorlax with Destiny Bond, Explosion, and Ice Punch, the latter of which can even potentially inflict freeze, making it a good temporary hard stop to Snorlax. However, it must be careful of Earthquake, as Snorlax 2HKOes it while unboosted and OHKOes it at +1. Misdreavus can annoy Snorlax with the combination of Toxic, Protect, and Pain Split or Rest, PP stalling Monolax sets one-on-one and potentially forcing Curselax to use Rest. However, Misdreavus needs to be careful of Belly Drum variants, as those can OHKO it with Earthquake. Similarly, Misdreavus can succumb to Curselax if it allows too many Curse boosts.</p> <p><strong>Explosion and Self-Destruct Users</strong>: Explosion is one of the most common ways to offensively deal with Snorlax, as a faster Pokemon that uses Explosion will make the turn end and thus leave no room for Snorlax to heal the damage off. Common Explosion users include Mewtwo, Mew, Cloyster, Forretress, Gengar, Steelix, and Exeggutor. Snorlax itself can also use Self-Destruct to seriously dent opposing Snorlax, as the Snorlax mirror matchup is rather common, and Self-Destruct is not very common on Snorlax, meaning that hitting the opposing Snorlax with it is a viable way of keeping it in check.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Umbreon is physically bulky enough to take on most Snorlax variants one-on-one with the combination of Growl, Toxic, and Rest. However, it must be careful of Belly Drum, Lovely Kiss, and Self-Destruct variants, as those can all overwhelm Umbreon either by boosting too much for Umbreon to negate, by putting it to sleep, or by outright OHKOing it. Miltank can negate Snorlax's Curse boosts with Growl and has access to Heal Bell to offset Lovely Kiss, although it must be careful of Belly Drum sets and Self-Destruct. Defense Curl Celebi works similarly to Miltank, being able to withstand Snorlax's attacks with Defense Curl while offsetting Lovely Kiss with Heal Bell, although it must be similarly careful about Belly Drum and Self-Destruct sets. Both Miltank and Celebi don't appreciate absorbing Lovely Kiss themselves either, so having another Pokemon that can absorb that for them before checking Snorlax is key. Lugia can comfortably sit on Snorlax, as Curse, Recover, and Whirlwind can beat every Snorlax variant one-on-one barring Self-Destruct. However, Lovely Kiss Snorlax can potentially break through Lugia, so making sure a different teammate is asleep first is key for Lugia.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Monolax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Monolax combines consistency and power to be the standard Snorlax set in Ubers. Double-Edge is the default choice as Snorlax's STAB move. It is vastly preferred over the other options due to its high damage output against threats like Mewtwo, Zapdos, and Mew, Pokemon that Snorlax 3HKOes unboosted and 2HKOes at +1. Body Slam is the other option, allowing Snorlax to spread paralysis against common switch-ins to it, giving room for teammates like Mew and Marowak to benefit from it. However, it must be noted that Body Slam is an inferior option in terms of damage, missing the benchmarks that Double-Edge achieves; Body Slam Snorlax also cannot 3HKO opposing Snorlax in the mirror matchup and thus relies on paralyzing it to beat it, unlike Double-Edge, which consistently 3HKOes opposing Snorlax. Furthermore Body Slam versions of Snorlax are completely helpess against Tyranitar and are reliant on slower teammates that appreciate paralysis like Golem, Exeggutor, and Marowak to beat it, whereas Double-Edge variants can potentially overwhelm it with Lovely Kiss. Curse allows Snorlax to dish out powerful attacks, nearly 2HKOing common switch-ins to it, such as Cloyster, Celebi, and Mewtwo, at +1; Curse also makes Snorlax significantly bulkier, allowing it to tank hits more easily while also increasing Snorlax's firepower, forcing its opponent to react quickly to it before it gets out of hand, with common answers being phazing it or poisoning it with Toxic to force it to use Rest. Rest allows Snorlax to stay healthy and consistently check threatening Pokemon, like Zapdos and Mewtwo. Lastly, Lovely Kiss gives Snorlax a tool to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, potentially allowing it to power through its checks with boosted attacks. Snorlax has a very potent sleep-inducing role because common users of Sleep Talk in the format, like Zapdos, don't appreciate tanking Snorlax's hits, meaning that there are no good absorbers of Lovely Kiss and thus no good checks to it.</p> <p>Sleep Talk is an option over Lovely Kiss, sacrificing Snorlax's ability to induce sleep but giving it a massive advantage against very powerful attackers, like Zapdos and opposing Lovely Kiss Snorlax. Sleep Talk Snorlax is one of the very few Pokemon that can deal with an opposing Lovely Kiss Snorlax, as it can tank hits while benefitting from each and every one of the Sleep Talk rolls being favorable for it, either by getting stronger and bulkier with Curse, recovering HP with Rest, of by attacking.</p> <p>Monolax can be played both offensively and defensively, depending on what its team needs. Snorlax's attacks are tough for foes to tank without consistent walls, so one should try and scout what the opponent's main switch-in to Snorlax is, either by using Curse or by attacking. If the situation demands it, however, Snorlax should fearlessly use its other moves to counter-attack the threats it has in front of it; for example, against Growth + Baton Pass teams, Snorlax should utilize its superb bulk and access to Lovely Kiss to put a stop to the opposing Mewtwo that has been passed Growth for a teammate to phaze it afterwards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snorlax is extremely flexible, being able to fit on all kinds of teams. Pokemon that can deal with the Rock- and Steel-types that annoy Monolax, like Celebi and Zapdos, respectively, are good teammates for it. Additionally, Explosion and Self-Destruct are also used to take down Snorlax, with every team having one or more Explosion users; because of this, Pokemon that can take these hits, like Steelix and Gengar, pair nicely with Snorlax on offensive teams. Tyranitar and Steelix are especially nice alongside Monolax, as they all share common checks in Barrier Mewtwo, Skarmory, and Cloyster, meaning that they can work together to take them down; Tyranitar additionally can potentially lure in checks to Monolax, like Skarmory and Forretress, and heavily damage them with Fire Blast. Other Pokemon that carry Fire-type moves, like Mewtwo and Exeggutor, are also good partners for Monolax, as they can help Snorlax by taking out checks to it like Steelix, and Exeggutor also helps against Tyranitar, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar. Monolax appreciates Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress because most of its checks are grounded. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Houndoom are also good teammates, as Monolax appreciates Ghost-types like Gengar being taken down.</p>"
        },
        "Curselax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curselax can bait and lure in checks to itself and hit them with super effective moves, where Monolax must land Lovely Kiss to beat them. This allows Snorlax to deal with common checks to itself without using up other team slots or hoping the opposing Pokemon stays asleep for long enough. Double-Edge is the preferred STAB option, as it 3HKOes Mewtwo, Zapdos, Mew, and Ho-Oh even when unboosted while giving Curselax a consistent high-damage move to use against opposing Snorlax. Body Slam is the other option if paralyzing checks to Snorlax, like Tyranitar, Steelix, Mewtwo, Cloyster, and Forretress, is preferred. The choice of coverage move depends on what Snorlax wants to beat, and what its team needs. Earthquake hits Tyranitar, Golem, and Steelix quite hard and works perfectly alongside Body Slam's chance of paralysis, as the aforementioned Pokemon will be slower than Curselax after paralysis; this allows Snorlax to outspeed and 2HKO Tyranitar and Golem while dealing up to 46% to Steelix at +1. Earthquake also targets Gengar, an otherwise hard counter to Snorlax, for devastating damage, 2HKOing it unboosted and OHKOing it at +1.</p> <p>One of Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be used over Earthquake in case Snorlax wants to lure in other Pokemon. Flamethrower allows Snorlax to deal critical damage to Forretress, a Pokemon that usually stays in on Snorlax to use either Spikes or Toxic; however, it barely stops short of OHKOing it. Flamethrower also hits Skarmory, one of the best counters to Snorlax, for a 3HKO and retains the super effective hit on Steelix. Fire Blast is a more powerful move that outright OHKOes Forretress and 2HKOes Skarmory and Steelix, but the low accuracy might be off-putting; Fire Blast also only has 8 PP, which makes it prone to getting PP stalled after it's been revealed. Furthermore, Forretress can be potentially taken down with the combination of Double-Edge and Flamethrower, rendering Fire Blast an inferior option. Overall, Fire-type coverage Curselax is better against defensive or stall teams due to these carrying one of Forretress or Skarmory to check Monolax, both of which get cooked by Fire-type coverage, while Earthquake Curselax is better against offensive teams due to them oftentimes having only Tyranitar and Cloyster as defensive Snorlax checks, both of which get heavily damaged by +1 Earthquake and Double-Edge, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Curselax's best teammates depend on what coverage option it's running, although there are Pokemon that enjoy having any Curselax variant as a teammate. For example, Pokemon like Tyranitar and Mew are good teammates because they share common checks with Snorlax, namely Cloyster, Steelix, and Barrier Mewtwo. Earthquake Snorlax can take out Steelix with boosted attacks, while Tyranitar beats Barrier Mewtwo one-on-one with the combination of Curse, Roar, and Rest while also 3HKOing Cloyster with Rock Slide. Mew, on the other hand, can break through Snorlax's checks with either a booster Explosion or a boosted Earthquake. Ideally, Curselax will want to be paired with strong attackers or setup sweepers like Marowak, Mewtwo, and Jolteon that can double down on the offensive presence that Curselax offers. Cloyster and Forretress are also good teammates, as Curselax appreciates Spikes wearing down its checks. Both of them can also support Curselax via Toxic and Explosion. Rapid Spin support from Golem and Forretress is also appreciated, as Curselax might be troubled switching into Zapdos if Spikes are up; Golem's Electric immunity can also help with pivoting.</p>"

        "Restless Snorlax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax can run more offensive moves over Rest, changing the dynamics of how it is played entirely. Unboosted Double-Edge 3HKOes Mewtwo, Mew, and Zapdos while giving Snorlax a consistently strong option against opposing Snorlax. Body Slam is an option if spreading paralysis on checks like Tyranitar, Steelix, Skarmory, and Golem is preferred; unfortunately, the drop in damage is very noticeable, as Snorlax cant 3HKO the aforementioned Pokemon and can no longer threaten opposing Snorlax in the mirror matchup. However, Snorlax can KO Skarmory and Lugia with Self-Destruct more easily if they switch into Body Slam and gets paralyzed. Curse Snorlax is both offensively threatening, as +1 Double-Edge can 2HKO Zapdos, Mew, and Mewtwo and also 2HKO Cloyster after chip damage, and defensively impenetrable. Belly Drum can be used instead if more immediate power is desired; +6 Snorlax can consistently OHKO the entire metagame aside from a few select Pokemon like Skarmory and Lugia, and even Lugia has a change of getting OHKOed by +6 Double-Edge. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-type checks like Tyranitar, Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix. It is worth noting that every listed check gets OHKOed by +6 Earthquake, so paralyzing them with Body Slam lets Snorlax take them down with ease. This allows Snorlax to play a supportive role by weakening checks to teammates such as offensive Mewtwo. Running Self-Destruct trades Rest's consistency and the ability to check Zapdos with the ability to annihilate even the bulkiest of Pokemon, like Skarmory and Lugia, after a boost. Snorlax can also lure and remove Zapdos and opposing Snorlax with Self-Destruct for its teammates. Lovely Kiss can be an option over Self-Destruct to give Snorlax a tool to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, potentially allowing it to power through its checks with boosted attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Restless Snorlax commonly sees itself on more offensive teams, as it cannot consistently switch into threats like Zapdos and wall them due to the lack of Rest. It should be used to wallbreaker, hopefully trading two-for-one against the opponent with Lovely Kiss and Self-Destruct. Pokemon like Jolteon, Vaporeon, Heracross, and Lugia are good partners for Self-Destruct Snorlax, as they benefit from Snorlax weakening their checks like Skarmory, Zapdos, and opposing Snorlax. Cloyster sets Spikes for Snorlax and provides its own Explosion to complement the offense. Other Pokemon with access to Self-Destruct or Explosion, like Mewtwo, Mew, Gengar, Steelix, Golem, and Exeggutor, are also good partners.</p>"

        "DrumLax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Belly Drum provides Snorlax with the most immediate offensive power possible, giving it the possibility of destroying teams with very little effort. Body Slam is preferred over Double-Edge due to Double-Edge's recoil forcing Snorlax to use Rest more often and wasting turns. Body Slam spreads paralysis on faster foes like Mewtwo, Cloyster, and Tyranitar, leaving room for Snorlax to potentially overpower them later after Belly Drum. Return is an option over Body Slam if more damage is preferred; Return has chances to 3HKO Zapdos, one of the few Pokemon that can threaten Snorlax with Thunder. Lovely Kiss helps Snorlax beat Pokemon like Skarmory, which gives it trouble even at +6 Attack, and it can also deny Spikes from Cloyster and Forretress and phazing from Lugia, Tyranitar, and the aforementioned Skarmory. Earthquake can be used instead to give Snorlax an option to OHKO Rock- and Steel-types like Tyranitar and Golem and Steelix after one round of Spikes damage; Earthquake also allows Snorlax to hit counters like Gengar and Misdreavus. Lastly, Rest gives Snorlax much needed longevity and allows it to use Belly Drum again later in the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>DrumLax fits on teams that can spread paralysis and need an immediately wallbreaker, meaning it can fit on both offensive and defensive teams. Offensive teams can support a DrumLax sweep with teammates like Thunder Wave Mew, Thunder Wave Mewtwo, Thunder Wave Zapdos, Tyranitar, and Cloyster; Tyranitar removes Steel- and Ghost-types that can annoy Snorlax if it is not running Earthquake with Fire Blast and crunch, respectively, while Cloyster sets Spikes for DrumLax to net certain KOs against Pokemon like Steelix. On more defensive builds, teammates like Barrier Mewtwo, Celebi, Lugia, and Skarmory can switch into threatening attacks for Snorlax. Paralysis spreaders like Starmie, Steelix, Blissey, and the rarer Miltank are also good teammates to help DrumLax overcome its middling Speed. Spinners like Forretress, Cloyster, and Golem are appreciate, since Spikes hurt DrumLax's ability to set up.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Behold, the single most dominant Pokemon in any OU tier in history. Snorlax combines power and resilience with deadly unpredictability, a set of traits that lands it a spot on virtually all serious teams. Its presence defines the GSC metagame, all but forcing teams to play one or more sturdy Normal-resistant Pokemon while simultaneously killing off the viability of manifold special attackers with its enormous HP and sky-high Special Defense. Snorlax is a constant threat to offensive teams as a Curse sweeper, a team-sweeping machine as a Belly Drum user, a relentless battering ram as a mixed attacker, and a reliable wall as a RestTalk user. However, it isn't completely unstoppable. Snorlax's Defense stat is on the low side, meaning that despite its massive HP stat, Explosion from common OU Pokemon like Cloyster and Exeggutor is enough to take it out with minimal prior damage. It will usually be forced to use Rest if it gets poisoned, giving the opposing team a reprieve that they can use to gain an advantage. Defensive teams will nearly always have Skarmory for Snorlax and usually pair it with a semi-reliable counter to mixed Snorlax as well, which can sometimes leave Snorlax unable to do any meaningful damage by itself. However, make no mistake: these constitute but minor flaws among Snorlax's array of overwhelmingly powerful attributes.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While the sets above represent most of what Snorlax can do effectively, there are times when using other sets makes sense. A Snorlax with a STAB attack and two coverage attacks alongside Rest is a viable option, particularly on more defensive teams where a different mixed attacker such as Nidoking cannot easily be used to capitalize off of Spikes support, or where Toxic would be wasted on Snorlax due to its teammates' ability to spread paralysis. Some attack combinations that can be used include Double-Edge / Thunder / Fire Blast, which punishes both Cloyster and Forretress and only falters against Rock- and Ghost-types; Double-Edge / Earthquake / Flamethrower or Fire Blast, which can get past all but the sturdiest physical walls given enough free turns; and Double-Edge / Earthquake / Thunder, which is also very difficult to stop in the long run and is better at getting past sturdy Pokemon with Thunder's paralysis chance, but such a combination takes much longer to KO Forretress, a trait that can cause problems in longer games. Lovely Kiss can also be utilized over one of the coverage moves for the surprise factor, which can be extremely effective due to the long potential sleep duration. However, these sets can be less reliable than those with just two coverage moves, as their effectiveness relies in part on surprising an opponent with more coverage than anticipatedâ€”once the set has been revealed and the opponent is able to work out a plan regarding how to check these mixed sets, Snorlax's inability to boost its stats or trade with Self-Destruct can limit its effectiveness during the later phases of a game, particularly when it comes to fighting opposing Snorlax. Moreover, relying on coverage rather than Toxic forces one to land multiple Earthquakes rather than a single Toxic to wear down Misdreavus and Rock-types.</p> <p>A variation of all-out attacker Snorlax that can be used to surprise particular kinds of teams is Curse / Double-Edge / Fire Blast / Self-Destruct or Lovely Kiss. This variant is particularly effective at taking apart teams that depend on Miltank or Umbreon + Skarmory to handle Snorlax, since they depend on Lovely Kiss Snorlax not having coverage for Skarmory. However, this set has major issues against Ghost- and Rock-types and is therefore not a common choice.</p> <p>Dropping Rest for a move other than Self-Destruct is also an option for numerous other sets, though this removes much of Snorlax's defensive capabilities and is very risky due to the possibility of being inflicted with poison. Nonetheless, it can prove to be a very effective option if utilized well. One moveset that does this is Curse / Lovely Kiss / Double-Edge / Earthquake. To get the most out of this set, it is best to find an opportunity for Snorlax to come in unscathed and to have hopefully weakened or at least identified the opponent's initial answers to Curselax, which are often Spikers with Toxic. If the opponent has Skarmory, this set is much less likely to work, but landing Lovely Kiss on it may induce your opponent to switch to a secondary Normal-resistant Pokemon, at which point Snorlax should have enough Curse boosts to inflict heavy damage with Earthquake. Many more offensive teams will only have a single Normal-resistant Pokemon, in which case this set is particularly effectiveâ€”they will likely be forced to use multiple Explosions to avoid being swept by your boosted Snorlax. To avoid potential coverage woes against Skarmory, this set can also use Fire Blast over Lovely Kiss, but the risk of being poisoned is extremely high, so it is worth considering using it alongside a Heal Bell user.</p> <p>Another variant of the set uses Lovely Kiss / Belly Drum / Return / Earthquake. This set works best on teams that can pass Speed boosts to Snorlax with Baton Pass, but it can also be used on teams with very sturdy defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and a spinner. Once Snorlax receives a +2 Speed boost from a teammate, the only OU Pokemon it is outsped by are Gengar, Raikou, and Starmie, and there are few Pokemon it can't OHKO. On defensive teams, it is used to sweep the opposing team once the opponent's offense has been neutralized or an opportunity arises otherwise. The advantage this set has is that it is almost completely unstoppable defensively as long as Lovely Kiss hits Skarmory, but the disadvantage is that Snorlax is entirely reliant on Leftovers to recover its health. This can be made easier by using Protect instead of Lovely Kiss, an option that functions best with Body Slam as the complementing STAB attack. This set works well on more aggressive teams as a general offensive threat, but it faces major issues against Skarmory. With Protect, Snorlax can nullify Explosions aimed at it after it has used Belly Drum. This set is also quite good at using Belly Drum to gain +2 Attack when under 50% health thanks to its ability to get extra Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Snorlax can also use Curse together with Belly Drum, which theoretically allows it to boost its Defense against a Growl or Charm user before boosting to 999 Attack. Additionally, once you have shown Curse, no one will expect that Snorlax's last move is Belly Drum under any normal circumstances, so there is surprise value to be gained from using both boosting moves. However, the downside is that this restricts Snorlax to using a STAB move as its only attack, meaning Normal-resistant phazers will easily dispatch of Snorlax.</p> <p>Belly Drum Snorlax can also make use of Mega Kick over Return when receiving a Speed boost to secure a few extra notable OHKOs, such as against Suicune and Umbreon, as well as gaining a chance to OHKO Cloyster. Double-Edge has the same power as Mega Kick, but the recoil makes it a poor choice on a Belly Drum Snorlax that lacks Rest and is going all-in on a sweep. The obvious downside to Mega Kick is having to rely on an attack with imperfect accuracy. Counter can also be used on Snorlax as a surprise option that can potentially take out opposing Snorlax and do more damage than expected to many physical attackers thanks to its high HP. Counter also comes with the added benefit of preventing any faster Pokemon from phazing Snorlax, which can be used to regain Snorlax's health against non-Toxic Skarmory and force it to use a lot of PP to get rid of Snorlax. However, this comes at the very significant cost of a moveslot, and the benefits of the move are mostly reliant on surprise value, so it is far from a standard option.</p> <p>Finally, Snorlax can use Defense Curl with Rollout, a combination that many defensive teams will fail to prepare for due to its obscurity. This is one of the only Snorlax sets that can best combinations such as Curse Skarmory + non-Perish Song Misdreavus as the last remaining Pokemon, although Snorlax will struggle to contribute anything other than being a glorified punching bag prior to when it can no longer be phazed. For a fourth move alongside Rest, Snorlax can use Amnesia to ensure that Growth users, Pokemon like Zapdos, and Pokemon that can lower its Special Defense with Psychic can't get past it. Alternatively, Counter gives it a fighting chance against Pokemon that can boost with Curse alongside it like Machamp, Heracross, and opposing Snorlax. No matter which option is chosen, there will be some strategy that beats it, so going with this set is a risky decision and thus not recommended in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Due to its high Defense, resistance to Normal, and immunity to Earthquake, Skarmory is considered the best answer to Snorlax. This unique combination of traits virtually necessitates its inclusion on defensive teams. Almost any purely physical Curselax variation is soundly beaten by standard Curse Skarmory. However, it is unable to contain Snorlax that target its weaker Special Defense with Fire Blast, Thunder, or Flamethrowerâ€”the former two are likely to 2HKO Skarmory, whereas Flamethrower guarantees a 3HKO. Even without Curse, Skarmory still fares well against Curselax, since it can simply phaze Snorlax to nullify any Curse boosts. However, if Curselax is the last remaining Pokemon, Skarmory will have no way of stopping it from boosting to maximum power, so it's wise to have a contingency plan, such as running Growl Miltank, Charm Umbreon, or Perish Song Misdreavus. Skarmory is also the best defensive check to Drumlax, although it is not a safe counter by any means. +6 Body Slam from Snorlax is a 3HKO on Skarmory and threatens to paralyze it, whereas +6 Double-Edge can 2HKO an unboosted Skarmory and potentially 3HKO it at +1 Defense. Consequently, it is crucial to time Skarmory's Rest such that it will wake up before Drumlax can KO it. Snorlax can also utilize Lovely Kiss alongside either Curse or Belly Drum to help it overcome Skarmory. One adaptation Skarmory can make against Lovely Kiss Snorlax is to run Sleep Talk and Curse, although this typically entails forgoing Whirlwind. Lastly, Snorlax is capable of luring Skarmory and using Curse with Self-Destruct to land a surprise KO, which can pave the way for Pokemon like Curse Heracross to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Other Normal-resistant Phazers</strong>: Pokemon that resist Normal such as Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem make for solid checks to Snorlax with their high Defense and powerful STAB attacks. However, they struggle to beat Earthquake Curselax when switching in, meaning it is often most practical to take a hit and phaze away its boosts with Roar. Steelix takes less damage from Earthquake than its Rock-type counterparts but has a weakness to Fire, making it particularly susceptible to Curselax that have a Fire-type move. Both Steelix and Golem have access to Explosion, which they can use to deal heavy damage to Snorlax,  but if Snorlax has one or more Curse boosts, Explosion may be insufficient to put it into the KO range of a teammate's follow-up attack. Tyranitar can use Dynamic Punch to deal an unexpectedly large amount of damage to Snorlax, but its low accuracy makes it very unreliable. When used on defensive teams, Rock-type Pokemon are often paired with Skarmory due to their ability to cover Snorlax with Fire-type moves, while Skarmory can cover Earthquake Snorlax. However, sets such as Toxic Snorlax can be used to overcome this combination in the long run if the Rock-type is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Forretress</strong>: Cloyster and Forretress are often among the first Pokemon to switch into Snorlax early in the game due to the possible opportunity to lay down Spikes. Although neither of them actually beat Snorlax one-on-one with their standard sets, their extremely high Defense stats can make it difficult for Snorlax to take them out quickly, and they pose a threat to Snorlax with Toxic and Explosion. Even if Snorlax sets up numerous Curse boosts in the face of Cloyster or Forretress, if it is poisoned and Spikes are up, Snorlax will be forced to use Rest or risk being unable to switch in safely for the remainder of the game. However, Cloyster must beware of the threat of Double-Edge + Thunder from Snorlax, the combination of which has a high chance to KO it. Forretress must likewise beware of an outright OHKO from Fire Blast, whereas Flamethrower also does very heavy damage. Snorlax can also use Lovely Kiss to potentially deny Spikes entirely. While both Spikers are very physically bulky, Cloyster still takes hefty damage from a boosted Snorlax's STAB attacks, whereas Forretress takes little damage from everything other than its Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are very useful to have against Snorlax thanks to their Normal immunity. Gengar can threaten Snorlax with Dynamic Punch, Explosion, Hypnosis, Thief, and Destiny Bond, and if Snorlax lacks Earthquake, it can attempt to inflict a devastating freeze by using Ice Punch repeatedly. Misdreavus poses a big threat to Snorlax with Mean Look + Perish Song, especially considering even +1 Earthquake from Snorlax doesn't reliably 2HKO it. Apart from Perish trapping, Misdreavus also threatens Snorlax with Toxic and Thief, which diminish Snorlax's longevity through negating its Leftovers recovery. Neither Gengar nor Misdreavus take much damage from any of Snorlax's attacks other than Earthquake, but Misdreavus tends to be better equipped to take Snorlax on in the long run, having the option to choose between Pain Split and Rest for recovery, whereas Gengar can get worn down by mixed Snorlax's special attacks and typically runs Explosion rather than a recovery move. If Misdreavus has Rest, not even Toxic Snorlax will be able to wear it down, and in general, Snorlax without Earthquake will have to rely on Pursuit support, which is far from a reliable method to take down either of the Ghost-types. Gengar is also notably the only common Explosion user that outspeeds a Snorlax that has been Baton Passed +2 Speed, which can allow it to shut down a Snorlax that might otherwise be able to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Miltank and Umbreon</strong>: Miltank and Umbreon both have the bulk to take any of Snorlax's attacks on the switch, can negate any Curse boosts with Growl or Charm, and can recover off any damage with Milk Drink or Rest. While they sometimes fear paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder, they can cure themselves with Heal Bell and Rest if they avoid full paralysis, and Miltank can even cure its teammates of status inflictions. Miltank must beware of Lovely Kiss, but Umbreon makes for a solid check to Lovely Kiss Curselax if it has Sleep Talk. However, Snorlax is capable of getting past them in the long run with timely critical hits, especially if it has Double-Edge. Additionally, Drumlax can bypass Growl and Charm entirely and instantly become an existential threat to one's team, so it is best to have Skarmory as a contingency plan and stay wary of the possibility that Snorlax may have Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: While it doesn't want to switch into Snorlax's powerful STAB attacks, Machamp poses a unique threat to Snorlax due to its access to Cross Chop, which has a 25% chance to critical hit and OHKO Snorlax regardless of how many Curse boosts it has set up. Even if it fails to score a critical hit, Machamp's unboosted Cross Chop scores a 2HKO on +0 and a 3HKO on +1 Defense Snorlax, a feat that few other Pokemon can achieve. Aggressively switching Machamp into a boosted Curselax about to use Rest can therefore prevent it from safely burning any sleep turns, which is key to preventing Curselax from regaining momentum after it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: Explosion is an extremely powerful tool that is often crucial to beating Snorlax without having to resort to using a momentum killer like Skarmory. Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Gengar all struggle to deal much damage to Snorlax with their special attacks, but Gengar's Explosion does at least 68% to an unboosted Snorlax, while Cloyster and Exeggutor can possibly OHKO it outright. Golem, Steelix, and Forretress don't have special attacks for Snorlax to try to wall, but they are useful for reacting to Snorlax's attempts to set up and forcing the Snorlax user to guess whether they will use Explosion or simply phaze, poison, or attack it. Another Explosion user that fits into neither category is Muk. Its Explosion is likely to be more telegraphed against Snorlax, but it can be used as a deterrent nonetheless. The fact that Explosion used by a faster Pokemon prevents the opposing Pokemon from moving that turn also contributes to its effectiveness against Snorlax, preventing the possibility that Snorlax could predict it and Rest the damage off. Explosion is particularly effective against Drumlax, since it must sacrifice half its health to set up and Explosion can easily finish it off, which can lead to some high-stakes mind games. It is less effective against a Snorlax that has already set up a Curse boost, but it will often do enough damage that a teammate will be able to finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Suicune, Porygon2, and Dragonite can be used to neutralize or stall out some Snorlax variants. Toxic Suicune makes for a decent initial answer to an unknown Snorlax because it can inflict itâ€”or another Pokemon that switches inâ€”with poison and is not significantly impeded by any possible surprise move that Snorlax may be running, such as Fire Blast or Lovely Kiss. Porygon2 can use Curse and Recover to stall out an opposing Snorlax's attacking PP thanks to Recover's 32 PP. Even a critical hit will not be enough to take out a full-health Porygon2, meaning that unless Snorlax has a method of inflicting status on Porygon2, it will usually be unable to break through Porygon2's defenses. Dragonite can use a RestTalk set with Reflect and Haze to neutralize any of Snorlax's boosting attempts and set up opportunities for its teammates. However, Dragonite is susceptible to being taken out by a critical hit from Double-Edge due to its partial reliance on Sleep Talk choosing the correct moves, its complete lack of offensive presence, and Reflect not reducing critical hit damage. Lastly, Vaporeon is not particularly bulky and should definitely not be switching into Snorlax, but with the combination of Growth and Acid Armor, it can become one of the few special attackers that can beat Snorlax one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Snorlax</strong>: Some Snorlax variants have distinct advantages over others. For example, a Curselax with Body Slam is highly unlikely to be able to beat a Curselax with Double-Edge because Body Slam fails to 4HKO once both Snorlax have maxed out their stats. Lovely Kiss Snorlax can be very effective against opposing Curselax by outspeeding it and putting it to sleep for up to six turns. Lastly, Snorlax's incredibly powerful Self-Destruct is easily enough to take out an opposing Snorlax in a single hit, although this comes with the downside of losing one's own Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Marowak and Heracross</strong>: Marowak and Heracross are two of the most powerful physical attackers in the tier and can hit Snorlax hard with their powerful STAB attacks. Neither of them are very good at switching into Snorlax, but Heracross's Megahorn 3HKOes it and Marowak's Earthquake has a small chance of 2HKOing it at +0 and about a 50% chance of OHKOing it at +2. This makes them excellent choices for switching in at the same time Snorlax does or when Snorlax is about to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos does not check Snorlax effectively, but its presence can be key for offensive teams in keeping Snorlax from becoming overbearing. Its powerful Thunder does up to 32% damage to Snorlax and can also inflict paralysis. The fact that Zapdos can do so much damage to Snorlax regardless of how many Curse boosts it may have accrued is often depended on to finish off a Snorlax that has been weakened by Explosion. It also has a strong influence on when Snorlax decides to use Rest, since if it has Double-Edge and is at around 70% health, it will have to be careful to avoid getting KOed by two Thunders from Zapdos in combination with Double-Edge's recoil. Moreover, if Snorlax chooses to use Rest and then switches out without burning any sleep turns, it can no longer switch into Zapdos's Thunder safely due to potentially being 4HKOed before it can wake up. While unlikely, it's notable that Zapdos is also capable of 3HKOing Snorlax with Thunder if one lands a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Thief</strong>: Pokemon such as Jynx, Gengar, Nidoking, Exeggutor, and Skarmory can enter battle with no item and then proceed to steal Snorlax's Leftovers, which sharply decreases its longevity, makes it a much shakier check to numerous special attackers, and makes it more susceptible to being worn down with residual damage from Spikes and Toxic.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curselax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curselax is the standard Snorlax set, and for good reason. Before using Curse, Snorlax is already hitting hard and can trade hits quite well with the majority of Pokemon. After a Curse boost, Snorlax can dish out 2HKOs against nearly any foe that doesn't resist its STAB Double-Edge or Return or threaten to paralyze the opposing Pokemon with Body Slam and outspeed it. Not only does it become a menace offensively, but it also becomes nigh impenetrable defensively, raising its previously low Defense stat higher than its formidable Special Defense. For Pokemon that resist or are immune to Snorlax's STAB attacks, its diverse pool of coverage attacks has something for every Pokemonâ€”just not all at once. A solid choice for its coverage move is Earthquake, which can be used to get past Rock- and Steel-type phazers like Tyranitar, Steelix, and Rhydon. After a Curse boost, it OHKOes Gengar and sometimes 2HKOes Misdreavus. However, should Curselax hope to get past Skarmory, Earthquake will not be enough. Fire Blast usually 2HKOes Skarmory and OHKOes Forretress while still hitting Steelix hard, although its low PP and imperfect accuracy leave Snorlax susceptible to being PP stalled by a clever opponent. Flamethrower is an alternative that misses the aforementioned benchmarks and is therefore harder to get surprise KOs with, but given its greater accuracy and PP, it is more certain to get the job done in the long run. Unfortunately, these Fire-type moves leave Curselax without a good option against Rock-types such as Rhydon and Tyranitar and can cause it to struggle against Gengar and Misdreavus. Yet another option for Skarmory is Thunder, which also has the major benefit of potentially landing a KO on Cloyster if it switches into Double-Edge and can inflict crippling paralysis on Ghost-types. However, it comes with the major drawback of leaving Snorlax without a useful attack against Steelix, Rhydon, Golem, and Forretress. Lovely Kiss is another option that provides both offensive and defensive utility. Although it comes at the significant cost of coverage, Curselax's ability to muscle its way past common Sleep Talk users like Zapdos and Suicune makes it possible to land crippling sleep on a desirable target, something other sleep move users sometimes struggle to do. Furthermore, despite its lack of coverage, Lovely Kiss Curselax can potentially break through even Normal-resistant Pokemon by chipping away at their health while they sleep. Moreover, to a greater extent than other Curselax variants can, Lovely Kiss Curselax can check opposing Snorlax by putting it to sleep. Finally, Rest is needed to keep Snorlax healthy. Unlike most Pokemon in GSC OU, Snorlax has the defensive stats needed to pull off the turns of passivity required for Rest without Sleep Talk, especially with a Curse boost under its belt.</p> <p>Snorlax's choice of a STAB attack comes down to the rest of your team and how you intend to use your Snorlax. Double-Edge is considered the default choice due to its high power, reliably 3HKOing Zapdos when unboosted and coming close to a 2HKO on Cloyster at +1 Attack. It is also the optimal choice for facing opposing Curselax in the common mirror match, substantially decreasing the odds that the opposing Snorlax can switch in on Curse and come out the winner and guaranteeing that an opposing Curselax with an equal number of Curse boosts will be KOed in three hits if one of them is a critical hit. However, Return has its merits when trading hits with mixed attackers and strong special attackers, as the recoil from Double-Edge can sometimes turn attacking into a risk. This is especially relevant when Snorlax is using a special coverage attack and therefore only has one powerful physical option against threats like Nidoking and Raikou. Lastly, Body Slam can be incredibly useful with its ability to inflict paralysis, especially when paired with sweepers that benefit from it such as Machamp and Marowak, but it should be kept in mind that it is a substantially weaker option. For example, unboosted Body Slam cannot 3HKO Zapdos. Moreover, Snorlax with Body Slam relies on paralysis to defeat opposing Curselaxâ€”unlike Return and Double-Edge, when both Curselax have maxed out their boosts, Body Slam has no chance to 3HKO the opposing Snorlax with just a single critical hit.</p> <p>One final notable attribute of Curselax is its effectiveness when it is the last remaining Pokemon on one's team. If Curselax is healthy and the opponent is lacking the means to remove it quickly, Pokemon that rely on phazing it to beat it will falter, potentially allowing Curselax to overcome many of its usual counters, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar that don't have Curse, despite lacking a coverage move to hit them with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Being the most popular set on the most popular Pokemon in its tier, Curselax is naturally a very flexible Pokemon and can be used on all kinds of teams. Once its fourth move is revealed, however, it tends to become a lot less threatening against more defensive teams, which tend to ensure Curselax variants are covered thoroughly. Defensive teams also often depend on Snorlax as a major source of offensive pressure, which can lead them to choose to use Snorlax variants that are harder to handle than Curselax. An exception to this is Fire Blast or Flamethrower Curselax, which can theoretically muscle through the majority of its counters, especially with Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Umbreon, or Houndoom and Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress. Lovely Kiss Curselax similarly appreciates Pursuit support and can potentially help ensure an opposing Ghost-type goes down by putting it to sleep.</p> <p>When used on more offensive teams, Curselax appreciates being paired with Pokemon that can be used to take Explosions aimed at it, such as Steelix, Tyranitar, and Gengar. It similarly appreciates Pokemon that can take a Cross Chop from Machamp and threaten it in return, such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. Additionally, as Curselax can rarely break a defensive core on its own, it helps to pair it with a Spiker and mixed attackers such as Nidoking, Tentacruel, and Tyranitar, or boosting sweepers such as Machamp, Marowak, and Vaporeon, which can then either help Snorlax become relevant offensively by pressuring Snorlax's checks or fall back on Snorlax's defensive capabilities when they find themselves in an unfavorable matchup. Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor and Fire Blast Machamp also make for good choices when trying to help an Earthquake or Lovely Kiss Snorlax become offensively potent against an opposing team with Skarmory.</p>"

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set functions by augmenting Snorlax's already-incredible defensive capabilities with Sleep Talk. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk provides Snorlax with greater ability to sponge the myriad special attacks in GSC OU, including those from Zapdos, one of the tier's premier threats. Without Sleep Talk, Snorlax cannot switch repeatedly into Zapdos's Thunderâ€”especially with Spikes upâ€”without having to use Rest, putting it out of commission for two turns and leaving its user in a precarious position against various threats. This set reduces the burden of having to take Zapdos's Thunder for one's team by reducing Snorlax's downtime while asleep. In addition, Sleep Talk turns Snorlax into an excellent status absorber, allowing it to check major threats like Nidoking and Jynx. It can also take Sleep Powder from Exeggutor, though it must be wary of Explosion. With Curse as its fourth move, it also performs better than most standard Curselax variants in a mirror match, as its ability to use moves while asleep denies the opposing Curselax as many opportunities to gain unanswered boosts or land unanswered critical hits. It should be noted, however, that even if a RestTalk Snorlax has Curse and Double-Edge, it typically matches up poorly against a Curse + Lovely Kiss Snorlax, which has a degree of control over when RestTalk Snorlax goes to sleep and can also take advantage of the uncertainties of random sleep duration and Sleep Talk rolls.</p> <p>Double-Edge is the preferred STAB option on this set due to the increased pressure it puts on Zapdos and other bulky Pokemon. Body Slam could also be used for its ability to inflict paralysis, but it comes at the major cost of a disadvantage against opposing Double-Edge Curselax, as well as being unable to 3HKO Zapdos without a Curse boost. The standard option for the fourth move on RestTalk Snorlax is Curse, which provides it with a solid matchup against most variants of enemy Snorlax and lets it serve as an excellent late-game winconâ€”a last-Pokemon Snorlax cannot be phazed, which reduces the number of Pokemon that can take it on significantly. However, with only a Normal-type STAB move, Snorlax can't hope to make much progress early-game, as it is all but certain to run into a Normal-resistant Pokemon with high Defense or a Ghost-type. There is no single coverage move that will allow Snorlax to get past all Pokemon that resist Normal, so a dual attack RestTalk Snorlax must choose a coverage move that best suits its team. Thunder can allow Snorlax to surprise a major threat in Cloyster, KOing it after Double-Edge more often than not. It also hits Skarmory hard and is the special attack that poses the biggest immediate threat to Gengar with its chance to inflict paralysis. However, using Thunder comes with the major downside of being unable to touch Steelix, Rhydon, and Golem while also offering little for Forretress. Flamethrower can be used to hit Steelix and Forretress hard and is preferred over Fire Blast on this set due to its higher PP, but it fails to offer coverage against Rock-types and poses only a moderate threat to Gengar and Misdreavus. Surf is another alternative that hits all of Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem super effectively, making it an attractive option against offensive teams, which typically rely on one of these Pokemon to handle Snorlax. The main downside to Surf is that although it can potentially force Skarmory to use Rest, it can't hope to ever KO it. Earthquake is a similar option that does less damage to Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix but is a much larger immediate threat to Gengar and Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Snorlax is typically chosen for its defensive attributes, but it fits well on many team archetypes. Offensive teams enjoy having RestTalk Snorlax to fall back on against the many special threats in the tier, particularly Jynx and Zapdos. Having RestTalk Snorlax as a status absorber can free up Zapdos to use a Thunder Wave or phazer set, making it even more of a threat. Machamp works well with RestTalk Snorlax thanks to its ability to threaten Normal-resistant Pokemon. This combination can be made even more effective through the addition of Pursuit support for taking out Gengar and Misdreavus. Another very useful partner for RestTalk Snorlax is Gengar, which can prevent Forretress and Rapid Spin Cloyster from taking too much advantage of Snorlax's limited coverage while also nullifying Explosions aimed at Snorlax.</p> <p>If used on a more defensive team, RestTalk Snorlax serves as both a powerful attacker and reliable wall but runs the risk of encountering a Pokemon that walls its limited coverage. It can therefore be prudent to try to pair it with Pursuit support for the Ghost-types that can slow down mixed and mono-attacking variants, particularly due to the heightened threat posed by Perish trap Misdreavus. Sets that cannot beat Skarmory are best paired with an Electric-type for the immediate threat to Curse Skarmory and Spikes support to ensure that the enemy team can eventually be worn down in the long run.</p>"
        },
        "Drumlax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Just when you thought you had Snorlax covered with your Skarmory and Tyranitar, enter the Drumlax. A single misstep against Belly Drum Snorlax often means at least one Pokemon goes down, or possibly even an entire team. Body Slam is used to scout for counters and soften the opposing team, putting them into KO range of Snorlax's Body Slam off 999 Attack and hopefully inflicting some paralysis along the way. Then, given an opportunity, Snorlax will immediately boost itself to the maximum possible Attack stat with Belly Drum and commence the annihilation of the enemy team. Body Slam misses many relevant OHKOs at +6, including against Miltank, opposing Snorlax, and Zapdos, so Return can be used as a more powerful alternative, but not being able to inflict paralysis is a major drawback. Still, Return does have the benefit of potentially 3HKOing Zapdos without any Attack boosts. Zapdos is one of the few special attackers that can remove more than 56% of Snorlax's health in two hits, making this potential 3HKO quite appealing. Double-Edge is another option that can be used to break through Skarmory more easily, being very likely to 2HKO an unboosted Skarmory and 3HKOing +1 Defense Skarmory about half of the time at +6. However, due to recoil, it usually can't sweep a team without first recovering off damage with Rest, so the other options tend to be preferred unless your team is lacking in ways to break through defensive teams. The most reliable choice of a fourth move is Earthquake, which gives Snorlax a tool to get past Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types. With a STAB attack and Earthquake, the only Pokemon Snorlax cannot at least 2HKO after using Belly Drum is Skarmory, which, without Defense boosts, is reliably 3HKOed by Body Slam or Return. The main alternative to Earthquake is Lovely Kiss, a highly versatile move that Snorlax can use to break through Pokemon it would otherwise have difficulties with, such as Skarmory. The move also provides a fallback option for when opposing Pokemon get out of hand, and it can even be used to prevent the opposing team's Spiker from setting up. The main downside to using Lovely Kiss is that Snorlax will have no way of touching Gengar or Misdreavus and must rely on Pursuit support to get past them. Rock- and Steel-types also become much better Drumlax answers when Earthquake is dropped. Fire Blast can also be used over Earthquake to help Drumlax beat Skarmory and Forretress more easily, but the lack of coverage against Ghost- and Rock-types is a major downsideâ€”being completely walled after sacrificing half of Snorlax's health is far from desirable. Rest is the typical last move and is used to restore Snorlax's health once it gets worn down or inflicted with status so that it can prepare to set up another Belly Drum later in the battle.</p> <p>When using Drumlax, one must remember that it doesn't have any method of boosting its Defense, so heavy-hitting physical attackers as well as Pokemon with Explosion remain a constant threat and can easily force Snorlax to use Rest or dissuade it from using Belly Drum. Drumlax will ideally set up against a paralyzed foe, as this will usually force the opponent to sacrifice it or another member of their team in order to send out a Pokemon that can finish off Snorlax in one hit. It is also important to remember that Snorlax can boost to +2 Attack with Belly Drum when it is at 50% health or lower at no HP cost; with this, it can suddenly become a huge threat when at around 40% HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drumlax is typically used on more defensive teams because they tend to have more Pokemon capable of taking hits that Drumlax would prefer not to and can also more readily remove Spikes and provide Heal Bell support, all of which helps Drumlax considerably in its efforts in finding an opportunity to set up. In return, Drumlax provides outstanding offensive capabilities that can break a stall deadlock like few other Pokemon can. Pokemon such as Raikou and Blissey can provide relief against Zapdos. Skarmory pairs fantastically with both of those Pokemon and can stomach hits from Heracross, Machamp, Marowak, and opposing Snorlax while also providing an option for sponging Explosions aimed at Snorlax. Ghost-types are similarly helpful at nullifying predicted Explosions. Spinners such as Starmie and Forretress are also much appreciated, as they enable Snorlax to regain its health via its Leftovers through clever switches, which can create opportunities to use Belly Drum twice without having to use Rest. When it does have to use Rest or is inflicted with status, Miltank or Blissey can provide Heal Bell support. This will decrease the amount of recovery time the opposing team gets after neutralizing Drumlax. Paralysis support is excellent for Drumlax; Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Starmie, Body Slam Miltank, and Thunder Raikou fit the role of a paralysis spreader. Lastly, Lovely Kiss Drumlax very much enjoys Pursuit support from Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Houndoom, and Umbreon.</p>"
        },
        "All-out Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's multitude of options and overall strength lend greatly to its unpredictability, and none of Snorlax's other sets take advantage of that unpredictability more so than this one. Snorlax's STAB Self-Destruct is the most powerful attack in the game, OHKOing any and all Pokemon that don't resist it and heavily denting those that do. The fact that Snorlax can reasonably run Rest or another attack alongside any of the coverage moves listed here means that, at least until Snorlax has revealed a special attack, the opponent may not anticipate Self-Destruct. This can be used to take out a key piece on the opponent's side, such as the enemy Snorlax or Zapdos, or, if Snorlax is using the Body Slam / Earthquake / Curse / Self-Destruct set, even an opposing Skarmory. For STAB, Snorlax usually wants Double-Edge for maximum power unless using the aforementioned Skarmory lure set. Without Double-Edge's power, non-Curse Snorlax will find it a lot more difficult to pressure bulky Pokemon with recovery like RestTalk Zapdos and opposing Snorlax. Aside from Self-Destruct and its other STAB attack, all-out attacker Snorlax is typically focused on causing as much damage as possible by maximizing its coverage against Normal-resistant Pokemon. Earthquake is used to hit Rock- and Ghost-types such as Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Gengar, which Snorlax would otherwise struggle against. It can be dropped for Lovely Kiss, although without Earthquake, Snorlax will struggle to take out the aforementioned Rock-types even while they are asleep, which means that if Snorlax gets worn down, it may be unable to pull off an effective Self-Destruct. Snorlax could theoretically use both Lovely Kiss and Earthquake together, although this leaves Snorlax helpless against Skarmory and in a bad position against Toxic Forretress, so it is preferable to have a special attack alongside either option. Thunder is mainly used to potentially land a surprise KO on Cloyster that switch into Double-Edge while also covering Skarmory and offering a decent chance of inflicting paralysis. However, using Thunder means that Snorlax will be lacking coverage for Forretress and relying on unboosted Earthquake for Steelix, which takes only moderate damage from the move. Fire Blast OHKOes Forretress and 2HKOes Steelix while also hitting Skarmory, making it the option with better coverage overall. However, due to how common Cloyster is and how valuable it can be to remove it, Thunder is typically the preferred choice.</p> <p>All-out Attacker Snorlax's gameplay typically involves coming out early in the game or leading and weakening the opposing team with heavy hits until it finds itself in an unfavorable matchup. If things go right, Snorlax can gain a huge advantage for its team by weakening or KOing key Pokemon and then taking out a valuable Pokemon with Self-Destruct. One of the key targets for Self-Destruct is an opposing Curselaxâ€”if the foe uses Curse on the turn your Snorlax uses Double-Edge, it is typically committed to staying in the next turn, unless you have given the opponent reason to believe Snorlax might have Self-Destruct. This provides an easy opportunity to trade your Snorlax for theirs with Self-Destruct, which makes it much easier for fast special attackers such as Gengar and Jynx to wreak havoc.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>All-out attacker Snorlax requires very little support to function and can theoretically fit on a variety of teams as a tool to take out or weaken key opposing threats. However, as it does not run Rest, it is less often seen on defensive teams, which generally prefer to have the option to use Snorlax as a general wall if needed. Its knack for trading two-for-one makes it a common choice on Explosion-heavy teams, since they can then \"trade down\" and simplify the game by reducing numbers on both sides. As Snorlax will often attempt to trade itself for the opposing Snorlax, Pokemon that can wreak havoc when Snorlax is out of the way make for good partners, such as Jynx. Lacking Rest means Snorlax must be more wary of taking Toxic or being put to sleep. Having a status absorber such as RestTalk Zapdos is helpful in mitigating this threat. If Snorlax is being used to bait and KO Skarmory with a Curse + Self-Destruct set, Pokemon that can set up to sweep opposing teams once Skarmory is gone such as Curse Heracross are excellent choices for partners.</p>"
        },
        "Toxic": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>When used on a defensive team, Snorlax typically plays the role of a wallbreaker while doubling as a backup check for special and mixed attackers. This Snorlax set excels at this role and differs from other Snorlax sets through its use of Toxic to whittle foes down, putting them on a timer before they are either knocked out or forced to use Rest. The raw power of Double-Edge is enough to KO most Pokemon that don't resist it within the three to four free hits granted by the foe using Rest, while Flamethrower handles Steel-types such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress. Rock- and Ghost-types that typically pose a problem for Snorlax with Fire-type coverage are worn down by Toxic or, in Gengar's case, repeated hits from Flamethrower.</p> <p>With the notable exceptions of teams that use a Rock- or Ghost-type with Rest, this Snorlax set has good odds of breaking through an entire enemy lineup should the opponent have insufficient means to threaten or remove it. Even some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, such as Suicune, Umbreon, and Miltank, will typically eventually fall to a critical hit from Double-Edge or three Double-Edge hits and Spikes damage, or run out of PP to cure themselves of Toxic. Toxic Snorlax also brings benefits in terms of Spikes pressureâ€”a grounded Pokemon that is inflicted with poison will take as much as 25% when switching in, except after a KO or when dragged in by a phazing move. With some clever maneuvering and double switching, this can quickly turn into a death sentence. This can be particularly effective against Cloyster and Golem, which are critical pieces in terms of keeping Spikes on and off the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Snorlax gives up Snorlax's Attack-boosting potential to play a war of attrition, and its teammates should support it in doing this. Ample defensive measures are highly recommended, such as Skarmory for opposing Snorlax and other physical attackers and Raikou as a primary answer to Electric-types and Growth sweepers such as Vaporeon. Roar Raikou with Spikes provided by Cloyster or Forretress will provide not only extra damage for Snorlax to keep the pressure on, but also a secondary form of offense through residual damage. To keep Spikes on the field and provide a switch-in for Explosions and Cross Chops aimed at Snorlax, Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gengar also make for good teammates. They can also potentially contribute to breaking an opposing team open with their numerous support options, such as Thief and Mean Look + Perish Song. Mean Look + Perish Song Misdreavus in particular is excellent at taking advantage of phazers that have been forced to use Rest due to Toxic from Snorlax or its teammates, which leaves them helpless against the strategy.</p>"

Dragonair has decent bulk, a comfortable Speed tier backed by Thunder Wave, and unique typing that grants it a resistance to all of Electric-, Water-, and Fire-type moves, giving it ample opportunity to take advantage of almost any opposing Pokemon and set up screens. Importantly, Dragonair is one of the best ways for frail setup-based offensive teams, like those centered around Growth + Baton Pass Flareon or those that stack physical boosters, to handle Magmar and Hidden Power Electric Octillery. Even most Pokemon that take little from Fire Blast and often run RestTalk like Xatu, Stantler, Primeape, Octillery, and Rapidash are still heavily hindered by screens and paralysis from Thunder Wave. These foes are often forced to use Rest, and if left undamaged while paralyzed, are severely exploitable, facilitating easier setup for teammates. Lastly, Fire Blast is used to threaten severe damage on Pineco and prevent it from safely using Spikes. Fire Blast also does solid damage to Magnemite, which threatens the frail teams Dragonair is often found on, and is also the best move available to force chip damage on Weezing. Surf can also be used instead to hit Ground-types like Dugtrio and Graveler that are immune to Thunder Wave and take little from Fire Blast, but usually it isn't worth being taken advantage of by Pineco.

Fire Blast hits Pineco, Magnemite, and Grass-types like Gloom, Surf hits Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Flareon, Dugtrio, Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Rapidash, and Thunder hits Octillery, Xatu, Fearow, and Dewgong. However, Dragonair is reliant on super effective hits and Thunder Wave to make progress, so it should be used alongside Pineco for Spikes, Primeape to handle opposing Stantler and Wigglytuff, and Weezing or Gloom to handle opposing Primeape and Hitmonlee, the four of which pack RestTalk and are not weak to any of its moves.

      "overview": "<p>Dragonite's excellent all-around stats and large movepool may make it seem like a top-tier Pokemon. Unfortunately, Dragonite lacks a good and reliable STAB move, which hampers its offensive prowess significantly and makes other wallbreakers like Nidoking and Machamp some serious competition. Additionally, Dragonite's 4x Ice weakness is very exploitable for some powerhouses like Zapdos, Raikou, and once again Nidoking.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Dragonite still has some perks that make it worth using. Its excellent offensive stats and its solid bulk and typing give it a much more favorable matchup against bulky threats like Snorlax, Vaporeon, and non-Ice Beam Suicune than most of its competitors, most notably Nidoking. Furthermore, its defensive stats coupled with its resistances and Haze make Dragonite a usable defensive Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Light Screen improves Dragonite's matchup against Electric-types, as it turns 2HKOs from attacks like Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos and Raikou into 4HKOs. However, it takes up an important moveslot and doesn't guarantee that Dragonite will beat them, as they can simply use Rest and Sleep Talk and stall until the effect of Light Screen goes away. Fire Blast invalidates Heracross as a check to the offensive variant while dealing more damage to Steelix and Exeggutor than any other move in Dragonite's arsenal. Hidden Power Flying provides a physical STAB attack without significant drawbacks that OHKOes Heracross, 2HKOes Machamp, and 3HKOes Misdreavus and Gengar. However, dropping one of the standard coverage options for these will result in losing super effective coverage against key Pokemon like Zapdos, Tyranitar, or Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou is Dragonite's biggest threat, as it doesn't fear any of Dragonite's coverage moves, outspeeds it, and 2HKOes it with Hidden Power Ice. Zapdos also threatens Dragonite in the same manner, although it has to be wary of Ice Beam, which can 3HKO it. Neither like being paralyzed by Thunder Wave but they can heal it off with Rest afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Heracross and Misdreavus are 4HKOed at best by Dragonite's usual attacking moves and can slowly wear it down while recovering with Rest and Pain Split. However, the former is completely countered by defensive Dragonite, whereas the latter wants to avoid Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Suicune, Snorlax, Miltank, Umbreon, and Porygon2 all force Dragonite to rely on its inaccurate moves to threaten them and can reduce its threat level by crippling it with status or reducing its Attack, or otherwise KO it outright. However, bar Suicune, which needs Sleep Talk and Ice Beam to reliably check Dragonite, all of the listed Pokemon can be 2HKOed by Dynamic Punch after Spikes, and Thunder Wave hinders them all. Steelix deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Thunder Wave and can survive three Dynamic Punches, but most of the time it lacks a move other than Explosion that can beat Dragonite, so it should be used as a pivot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Although it has trouble switching into Dragonite, Jynx swiftly OHKOes it with Ice Beam. Nidoking and Gengar have more opportunities to come in and dent it with their Ice-type attacks, but Nidoking takes a lot from Ice Beam and Gengar is badly crippled by Thunder Wave.</p>",

        "All-Out Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Dragonite is often underprepared for and can be extremely painful to face for some teams. Thunder Wave inflicts paralysis, which is crucial against some bulky Pokemon like Raikou, Zapdos, Umbreon, and even Snorlax, as it allows Dragonite and its teammates to potentially defeat their supposed answers by outspeeding them or forcing them to use Rest. Double-Edge forgoes paralysis support in exchange for a decently powerful and reliable physical attack, which can be very helpful in some scenarios, for instance against a weakened Snorlax or Machamp. Ice Beam 3HKOes Zapdos and does a nice amount of damage to Exeggutor, Marowak, Nidoking, Rhydon, and Golem. Thunder deals over 85% to Cloyster, 2HKOes Skarmory and Starmie, and 3HKOes Suicune, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon. Thunder notably makes Dragonite a pretty nice check to Vaporeon and also has a chance to inflict paralysis, although its accuracy is iffy. Dynamic Punch is even less reliable, but Fighting-type coverage is invaluable on this set, since it hits important targets like Tyranitar very hard and 3HKOes Snorlax, Umbreon, and Miltank, all of which have to beware of the potential 2HKO after Spikes damage. The added confusion effect can be very awkward for the opponent, especially in tandem with the paralysis induced by Dragonite's other moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite greatly appreciates Spikes support from Cloyster and Forretress, as it secures some notable KOs mentioned above, while additional chip damage makes Dragonite more threatening in general. Even though it can cripple them via Thunder Wave and Ice Beam, Dragonite still needs some support against Raikou and to a lesser extent Zapdos, so typical Electric-type answers like Steelix, Snorlax, and Raikou itself as well as Explosion users like Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Gengar make good partners. However, Dragonite can perform pretty well with other Pokemon that also struggle against Electric-types like Vaporeon and Tentacruel, since they can weaken or paralyze their common nemeses, which may end up leaving them overwhelmed by trying to check two offensive threats. Other notable Thunder Wave targets include Snorlax, Umbreon, Miltank, Suicune, Misdreavus, and Heracross, most of which have to be wary of Dragonite's coverage moves as well. Dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax, Marowak, and Nidoking will have a much easier time breaking through the opposing team once Dragonite has paralyzed these annoyances.</p>"

        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Dragonite is gifted with very solid all-around bulk, useful resistances to Water and Fighting, and an immunity to Ground, making a defensive set perfectly usable, albeit very passive, as it struggles to fit an attacking move. Haze is a key move to this set's success, as unlike phazing moves it isn't plagued with negative priority, allowing Dragonite to erase all stat changes before slower Pokemon like Snorlax, Vaporeon, Machamp, Marowak, and -1 Heracross have a chance to hit it with a boosted attack. This makes Dragonite one of the best available answers to the fearsome Belly Drum Snorlax. Reflect is another important move, since the boost in Defense is invaluable against most of the aforementioned Pokemon. It also enables Dragonite to shrug off most Explosions, helps its teammates switch in more safely, gives it some insurance while it is asleep, and makes it almost unbreakable with physical attacksâ€”even Rock Slide from Rhydon fails to 4HKO Dragonite behind Reflect most of the time. Rest is Dragonite's sole form of recovery. It can be paired with Sleep Talk so Dragonite can serve as a pretty reliable sleep absorber against Exeggutor and Lovely Kiss Snorlax without becoming dead weight while asleep. However, this comes at the cost of not having any offensive move and makes Dragonite extremely passive and reliant on PP stalling, although it will win PP wars thanks to Haze's high PP count more often than not. Choosing Body Slam or Dragon Breath instead makes the use of Rest much riskier but permits Dragonite to actually damage its foe and potentially spread paralysis. Body Slam deals a bit more damage in general aside from some Pokemon like Marowak and Exeggutor, whereas Dragon Breath ensures that Dragonite isn't completely helpless against Ghost-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dragonite variant fits on most stall teams, which can afford to pack very passive Pokemon. They often include cleric support from Blissey and Miltank, which can cure Dragonite's sleep status and reduce the need for Sleep Talk, essentially freeing up the last moveslot. Blissey can also sponge attacks from Raikou, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jynx aimed at Dragonite, whereas Miltank deals nicely with Nidoking and Porygon2. Other Pokemon like Raikou, Steelix, and Umbreon that check most of the aforementioned threats can also be considered. Umbreon and Tyranitar can provide Pursuit support, something that can be very helpful if Dragonite is unable to touch Gengar and Misdreavus because it stops them from coming in on it fearlessly. Aside from these, having additional answers to offensive threats such as Snorlax is useful, since Dragonite usually can't do much back to its foe and will therefore often have to take numerous hits, making it susceptible to critical hits.</p>"

  "Mewtwo": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Mewtwo's incredible stats and deep movepool grant it tremendous versatility and power. Its ridiculously high Speed, solid defenses, and access to Recover and Barrier make it one of the sturdiest checks to physical attackers that lack phazing moves, such as Mew and Earthquake Lugia. Offensively, its monstrous Special Attack, amazing coverage, and status moves allow it to threaten broad swathes of the metagame. Nothing is entirely safe from Mewtwo, though it may need to sacrifice itself with Self-Destruct to consistently eliminate the foe. Unlike most other threats of its magnitude in GSC, Mewtwo requires no setup before it can start blasting away. Mewtwo's flaws are few and far between, but the most exploitable is perhaps its lack of ways to deal with status. Paralysis is a death sentence for Mewtwo, which puts it in an awkward situation against foes with Thunder, Body Slam, or Thunder Wave. However, Self-Destruct gives Mewtwo a way to salvage even poor situations. Mewtwo is so difficult to handle that, oftentimes, players must resort to controlling it through Self-Destruct or Explosion, as a trade is usually preferable to continually enduring its attacks or being perpetually walled.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Instead of relying on Thunder to inflict paralysis, Mewtwo can instantly paralyze its foes with Thunder Wave. This is particularly useful when combined with Dynamic Punch and setup sweeper teammates such as Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, Curse Tyranitar, and Swords Dance Mew. However, it comes at the cost of coverage and the most likely target of Thunder Wave, opposing Mewtwo, can potentially trade itself with Mewtwo with Self-Destruct to avoid the disadvantage of being paralyzed. Mewtwo can use Curse along with Submission or Dynamic Punch to deal serious damage to specially bulky foes such as Snorlax, Blissey, Umbreon, and Tyranitar. It can also potentially use Shadow Ball to hit Psychic-types such as Mewtwo, Mew, Lugia, and Celebi for boosted damage. However, using Curse and physical attacks makes it difficult to retain sufficient special coverage; for example, without Thunder, Mewtwo will struggle to deal with Forretress, Ho-Oh, and Cloyster, and without Ice Beam, it will struggle against Zapdos and Steelix. Even if Mewtwo uses Curse, a physical attack, and two special attacks, it will need to forgo Recover and Self-Destruct. Curse Mewtwo therefore requires specific circumstances and extensive support in order to be most effective. Mewtwo's ample pool of HP makes it a capable user of Counter, which can catch foes such as Swords Dance Mew and Curse Snorlax and instantly KO or deal massive damage to them. On top of this, its high Speed and access to Self-Destruct and Recover mean that it won't be entirely useless after executing this strategy. However, Counter is a higher risk strategy than simply dealing with these foes using Barrier or Self-Destruct, as it relies in part on surprise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Although it must be wary of Self-Destruct and Dynamic Punch, Snorlax can dominate most Mewtwo sets with its common sets. Its massive special bulk allows it to easily withstand Mewtwo's special attacks, allowing it to set up with Curse or cripple Mewtwo with Body Slam paralysis before setting up with Belly Drum. Lovely Kiss also gives it a way to bypass even Barrier Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Mew and Mewtwo</strong>: Mew and Mewtwo are both very bulky, which allows them to withstand numerous attacks from opposing Mewtwo before potentially healing the damage with Soft-Boiled or Recover. With a small amount of chip damage, they can also reliably OHKO it with Explosion or Self-Destruct. Mew can set up with Swords Dance to boost its Shadow Ball or Earthquake and then deal heavy damage to Mewtwo. However, Mewtwo will often have Barrier or Self-Destruct to neutralize the threat from Mew, and it can potentially inflict status with Toxic, Thunder, or Thunder Wave, so it must be dealt with cautiously. Generally, a clash between these titans of the tier tends to end in an exchange of status inflictions or a trade via Explosion or Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou tends to be one of the safest checks to Mewtwo, as Mewtwo often drops Psychic for other moves with better super effective coverage and Ice Beam is only a 5HKO against it. In return, Raikou threatens Mewtwo with crippling paralysis from Thunder, which can allow teammates such as Curse Snorlax to fight Mewtwo with less risk of being suddenly KOed by Self-Destruct or getting walled by Barrier. Zapdos is weak to the common Ice Beam, but in the absence of Ice Beam and Psychic, Zapdos also does well against it thanks to its powerful Thunder and access to Thunder Wave. Jolteon should generally avoid switching into Mewtwo before scouting, but it can fight against Barrier variants adequately thanks to Speed tying with Mewtwo and having Growth to boost its Special Attack. Jolteon's +1 Thunder is a 2HKO on Mewtwo, whereas Mewtwo's Flamethrower or Ice Beam is a 4HKO against Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Umbreon is one of the best at neutralizing Mewtwo thanks to its formidable bulk and solid defensive typing. While it is lacking in powerful direct damage options, it can chip away at Mewtwo with Toxic and Pursuit, put it in an awkward position with Charm, and threaten to trap it with Mean Look. Curse Tyranitar is one of the biggest problems for Barrier Mewtwo, as it commonly runs both Roar and Rest to negate the effects of Barrier and Toxic. Specially, Tyranitar has a powerful super effective STAB Crunch alongside Pursuit, which can put Mewtwo that lack Fighting-type coverage in an awkward position. While Crunch does not 2HKO Mewtwo, it deals enough so that Mewtwo is under serious threat from potential Special Defense drops and critical hits, even with Recover. Tyranitar also resists Self-Destruct, which means that, unlike with most foes, Mewtwo is unlikely to be able to achieve a trade. Unlike most Pokemon that resist Normal, Tyranitar also has good special bulk, which allows it to take coverage attacks from Mewtwo that other Normal-resistant Pokemon are afraid of. However, Dark-types need to be cautious around Mewtwo sets that have Fighting-type coverage moves, especially Tyranitar with its 4x weakness.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross has decent special bulk and access to STAB Megahorn, the only unboosted attack in the game that can reliably 2HKO Mewtwo aside from Self-Destruct and Explosion. If Mewtwo lacks Psychic- and Fire-type coverage, Heracross has a good matchup against it and will generally be able to force Mewtwo to switch out or trade with Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can take on variants of Mewtwo that lack Dynamic Punch reasonably safely, as even Submission fails to 2HKO it. It can undo the status spreading that Mewtwo has done with Heal Bell and even pose a significant threat to it with Present or Toxic. However, as with most Mewtwo checks, it must be wary of Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: RestTalk + Growth Vaporeon or Growth + Baton Pass Vaporeon can take advantage of Mewtwo sets that lack Thunder, such as the common Flamethrower + Toxic + Barrier set. However, it is risky to take Mewtwo on with Vaporeon before its set is revealed.</p> <p><strong>Shuckle</strong>: Shuckle is a fairly reliable answer to Mewtwo variants that lack Psychic, as none of its other attacks can reliably 4HKO it. It threatens Mewtwo with Toxic and can PP stall it without risking being KOed by Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire can switch into Thunder and Flamethrower, which are Mewtwo's most commonly used attacks, and take next to no damage. It can then either attempt to stall Mewtwo with a RestTalk set or, if Mewtwo is paralyzed, set up with Belly Drum. However, it is 4HKOed by Ice Beam, which leaves it vulnerable to critical hits or confusion from Dynamic Punch, and it is easily 3HKOed by Psychic.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Recover": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo's extremely high Speed and 32 PP of Recover let it use Barrier to wall any physical attackers that lack phazing moves and disruptive secondary effect chances on their attacks, such as Swords Dance Mew, Earthquake Lugia, and certain Curse Snorlax and Mewtwo variants. Even a +6 Shadow Ball critical hit from Mew will only deal up to 70.3% to +6 Mewtwo, and because Mewtwo outspeeds and has Recover and Leftovers, Mew must land four consecutive critical hits to take a full health Mewtwo down. Mewtwo's effectiveness as a physical wall is compounded by the fact that many Explosion and Self-Destruct users only OHKO it some of the timeâ€”only Golem and Snorlax always OHKOâ€”and if Mewtwo survives other foes' Explosions, it can restore its health with its fast Recover. However, Mewtwo is not a flawless physical wallâ€”even without the less common Self-Destruct, Snorlax can pierce Mewtwo's defenses with Lovely Kiss and potentially use Body Slam, Mew can use Thunder Wave or potentially allow a teammate to sweep by removing Mewtwo with Explosion, and Curse phazers such as Tyranitar, Lugia, and Ho-Oh can remove its Defense boosts after accruing boosts. However, Swords Dance Mew is a massive threat, and Barrier Mewtwo is one of the safest ways to reliably handle it. In addition to walling foes, Mewtwo threatens its foes in return with its remaining two moveslots. The combination of Toxic and Flamethrower is an excellent way to ensure Mewtwo can pose some threat to a majority of foes, as Pokemon immune to Toxic generally take heavy damage from Flamethrower. Toxic also has the advantage of dealing sustained damage while Mewtwo does its stall routine. Ice Beam can be used over Toxic so that Mewtwo can threaten Zapdos, which is one of the most common RestTalk users in the metagame, and it also lets Mewtwo possibly freeze foes. Flamethrower can be replaced by Thunder, which has great coverage alongside Ice Beam, allows Mewtwo to hit foes such as Ho-Oh and Starmie, and threatens to paralyze foes such as Mewtwo, Mew, and Lugia. Another alternative is Psychic, which hits bulky foes such as Snorlax and Raikou for heavy damage and is an especially powerful option with Growth boosts from Baton Pass. When combined with Barrier, Growth boosts can turn Mewtwo into a near-invincible powerhouse; however, Psychic can also be used alongside BoltBeam coverage to retain heavy damage against foes such as Ho-Oh and Forretress.</p> <p>Mewtwo can also take a more offensive approach by running other attacking moves instead of Barrier. Self-Destruct retains some efficacy in dealing with Mew and can break through opposing status absorbers, such as Rest Snorlax. It is also somewhat unexpected alongside Recover, which could allow Mewtwo to grab a surprise KO against an unsuspecting foe. Dynamic Punch is a good option for dealing with Dark-types such as Umbreon and Tyranitar while also providing a chance to break through Snorlax and Blissey without relying on Self-Destruct. However, it should be noted that Dynamic Punch sets with Recover over Self-Destruct may lack the firepower to deal with opposing Mewtwo and Mew.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Recover Mewtwo is exceptionally susceptible to status, so status absorbers and clerics are critical to its success. Rest Snorlax is a great general tank and can take a beating from most Pokemon that could paralyze Mewtwo with Thunder or target it with other moves that may inflict status. Blissey can likewise take virtually any special attack and offers Heal Bell support, which can allow Mewtwo to accept a degree of risk, such as fighting a Pokemon that uses Thunder, Body Slam, or Thunder Wave. Rest Jolteon can take potentially-paralyzing hits from Electric-types and threaten a sweep with Growth boosts. Baton Pass Jolteon can likewise threaten a sweep by passing boosts to Mewtwo or its teammates, which is especially effective if Mewtwo has multiple attacking moves. Spikes and Rapid Spin support is also recommended in order to go toe to toe with defensive teams; Forretress and Cloyster both make for excellent Spikes users and can also use Rapid Spin if the team requires it, whereas Golem can provide additional defense against Snorlax and pivot into Electric-type attacks aimed at Mewtwo alongside its Rapid Spin support. Measures against Curse + Whirlwind Lugia and Ho-Oh such as Zapdos and Raikou are a necessity. Both of these Electric-types provide a lot of offensive presence and defensive utility; offensively, they offer high damage output and a paralysis threat with STAB Thunder, as well as the potential to run Roar or Whirlwind with Spikes support to rack up passive damage against bulky foes. Defensively, both are effective as RestTalk users and perform very well against Lugia, one of the most important threats to deal with. An alternative to the Electric-types is Crunch Tyranitar, which offers both heavy damage against Lugia and other Psychic-types as well as a useful resistance to Normal-type moves such as Explosion and Snorlax's STAB attacks.</p>"
        },
        "All-out Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>As an all-out attacker, Mewtwo focuses on maximizing coverage while holding the threat of a sudden Self-Destruct over the foe's head. Thunder is essential to threaten Cloyster with an OHKO, as well as threatening Lugia, Ho-Oh, Mew, and Mewtwo with heavy damage and paralysis. Ice Beam is the best choice for its second move, as it threatens a 2HKO on Zapdos and Golem while also providing the possibility of a game-changing freeze. This BoltBeam coverage is best complemented with a Fighting-type move for Snorlax, Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Blissey. Dynamic Punch is an inconsistent but extremely dangerous option thanks to its accompanying confusion, which substantially increases Mewtwo's chances of getting past Snorlax without having to use Self-Destruct. The presence of Self-Destruct on the set also offers a way to recoup lost ground if Dynamic Punch fails to connect. Submission is weaker and comes with recoil, but its reliability gives it some appeal, and it still hits the aforementioned targets for substantial damage. Psychic is a solid alternative to Ice Beam, as it hits all of Snorlax, Zapdos, and Raikou for solid damage while threatening to drop Special Defense. This solid neutral damage on key foes also allows Mewtwo to run Fire Blast for the OHKO on Forretress, 2HKO on Celebi, and more reliable damage against Mew and opposing Mewtwo. Self-Destruct is a key weapon in Mewtwo's arsenal, allowing it to instantly remove nearly any foe after one prior hit. This can be used to deal with Swords Dance Mew, opposing Mewtwo, and Snorlax, potentially putting a teammate such as Zapdos or Jolteon into a position to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mewtwo is very commonly paired with Mew, as the two are excellent at breaking apart defensive cores with Self-Destruct and Explosion. If Mewtwo succeeds in taking down a specially bulky foe such as Snorlax, Blissey, or Raikou, this may allow a threat such as Growth Jolteon or Zapdos to wreak havoc with STAB Thunder. Jolteon can also potentially send its Special Attack boosts to Mewtwo with Baton Pass, making it nigh unstoppable. Mewtwo also appreciates Spikes support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Cloyster, as this helps it break through bulky foes such as Snorlax and Umbreon more easily. To potentially avoid having to trade such a valuable offensive weapon for its doppelganger on the opposing team, one can aim to status the opposing Mewtwo and then take it down with teammates such as Crunch + Pursuit Tyranitar, Explosion Steelix, Curse Lugia, Swords Dance Mew, and Curse Snorlax. In case Curse Snorlax gets out of hand against Mewtwo, it is useful to have at least one Normal-resistant phazer such as Steelix, Tyranitar, or Golem, or a Normal-resistant Defense booster such as Curse Skarmory, Reflect or Curse Forretress, or Defense Curl Shuckle.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Mew is one of the most threatening Pokemon in GSC Ubers thanks to its insane versatility that lets it perform an important variety of offensive roles. As a lead, Mew matches up perfectly against common leads like Snorlax and Mewtwo, consistently beating them with the combination of Swords Dance, Thunder Wave, and Explosion, with Miracle Berry further helping Mew against them by providing a one-time status immunity that lets it set up freely. Mew's Explosion is one of the strongest attacks in the game, capable of potentially breaking through even the bulkiest of Pokemon, like Lugia, Skarmory, Barrier Mewtwo, and Tyranitar after a Swords Dance boost, making Mew one of the best offensive facilitators for teammates like Snorlax, Tyranitar, and offensive Mewtwo.</p> <p>When used in the back, Mew takes advantage of its good natural bulk to annoy offensive Mewtwo, Zapdos, and Gengar, matchups that can be further improved if Mew is running Soft-Boiled in its moveset. Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and Gengar's Explosion don't come close to OHKOing Mew, meaning that it can recover the damage done with Soft-Boiled or survive with enough HP to attack the next turn.</p> <p>However, Mew can be reliant on paralysis to effectively remove Barrier Mewtwo; Mewtwo's higher Speed allows it to reach +4 Defense as Mew uses Swords Dance once, thus making Explosion's chances to OHKO it lower and lower as Mewtwo racks up more boosts. Mew's Speed stat also leaves it outsped by Jolteon and the aforementioned Mewtwo, two Pokemon that can reliably revenge kill a low-HP Mew. Finally, Mew, while having access to an ocean of a movepool, cannot beat every check to itself with four moves, and thus, if it's not sacrificing itself with Explosion, it becomes much less threatening once its entire moveset has been revealed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake is an option for lead Mew to 2HKO Tyranitar and Golem at +2 without sacrificing itself; it also 3HKOes Steelix. Earthquake also allows Mew to hit otherwise annoying Pokemon for it like Gengar. However, Gengar already dislikes getting paralyzed with Thunder Wave, and Tyranitar and Golem already take heavy damage from Explosion. Earthquake also worsens Mew's matchup against Spikes users like Cloyster and Forretress. Lastly, using Explosion on the aforementioned Pokemon is usually Mew's task, rendering Earthquake mostly useless.</p> <p>Rock Slide 2HKOes Zapdos at +2 and it can help Mew get some Pokemon, like paralyzed Mewtwo and Heracross, into KO range by flinching them. However, it worsens Mew's matchup against Spikes users like Cloyster and Forretress. Cloyster gets 3HKOed at +2 and cripples Mew with Toxic or damages it with Surf or Explosion, with Forretress taking even less damage than Cloyster while doing the same.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is the last coverage option that lead Mew can use to hit Celebi, opposing Mew, and Mewtwo hard while not sacrificing itself with Explosion. However, Mew prefers running other moves and, like Earthquake and Rock Slide, it worsens Mew's matchup against Spikes users.</p> <p>Flamethrower can be used on the backline Mew set to OHKO Forretress and 2HKO Skarmory and Steelix. This is best used with a moveset of Swords Dance, Submission, and Shadow Ball for Mew to retain a powerful hit on Mewtwo. However, Barrier Mewtwo and Lugia will forever wall Mew if it is not running Explosion, as will other Pokemon like Zapdos, Ho-Oh, and Haze Quagsire. Similarly, Fire Blast is another option that Mew can run to improve its matchup against chipped foes like Steelix and Skarmory.</p> <p>Protect can be used on the backline Mew set as a way to get passive recovery and bait Explosion from foes like opposing Mew and Cloyster. This is best used on a set with Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Explosion as the other moves. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Tyranitar, Steelix, and Gengar that resist or are immune to Explosion. Similarly to Protect, Substitute is an option to not only bait Explosion but also block status from foes like Cloyster, which works best on teams that can fit a lot of paralysis support in the form of Thunder Wave Mewtwo, Thunder Wave Zapdos, and Body Slam Snorlax. Substitute works best on a set with Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Rock Slide with teammates that can deal with Barrier Mewtwo, Lugia, and Skarmory.</p> <p>A moveset of Flamethrower or Surf, Toxic, Soft-Boiled, and Explosion is an option for teams that want a bulky Pokemon that can act as a pseudo-wall to various Pokemon but cannot use Mewtwo because it is occupying another role, like being a Growth recipient. This set utilizes Mew's excellent natural bulk to be one of the most sturdy Mewtwo checks in Ubers, as it avoids a 3HKO from all of its attacks while also having a very strong Explosion to keep other threats like Zapdos, Jolteon, and the aforementioned Mewtwo in check.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug is an option in the backline Mew set to hit Celebi and Tyranitar super effectively in one moveslot. This allows Mew to run coverage for other threats like Ho-Oh and Barrier Mewtwo in Rock Slide and Explosion, respectively.</p> <p>Lastly, Thief can be used to steal Leftovers from Steelix, Skarmory, Forretress and other physical walls like Lugia. Thief is also effective due to its surprise factor, and it can help trick the opponent by bluffing that Mew is using Miracle Berry as its item. However, it requires Mew to go into the game itemless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Because of its access to Barrier and Recover alongside its higher Speed, Mewtwo is Mew's best check. Unless Mew has paralysis support in the form of Body Slam Snorlax, Thunder Wave Mewtwo, Thunder Wave Zapdos, or its own Thunder Wave, it cannot beat Mewtwo reliably. Offensive Mewtwo can survive every move from +2 Mew bar Explosion and deal decent damage back with Thunder. Lastly, Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct to deal massive damage to Mew, letting a teammate easily finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is the best offensive check to Mew, being strong enough to 3HKO Mew with Thunder and bulky enough to avoid the 2HKO from an unboosted Rock Slide. Furthermore, Zapdos also completely walls any Mew that is not running Rock Slide, forcing it to use Explosion to take it out. However, Thunder misses can make this a tricky interaction, and Mew always has the option to use Explosion on Zapdos. Zapdos Speed tying with Mew also makes it harder for Zapdos to consistently beat it.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross is bulky enough to avoid the 2HKO from any boosted attack and 2HKO Mew back with Megahorn. Its access to Curse and Rest + Sleep Talk make it a decent answer even when asleep. However, Mew can beat Heracross with just one Rock Slide flinch. Explosion also OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax only gets 3HKOed by +2 Earthquake and Rock Slide and can use Lovely Kiss to put Mew to sleep and nullify its threat. However, Submission 2HKOes it at +2, while Explosion outright OHKOes it. Miracle Berry can also nullify Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Lugia, Skarmory, and Umbreon are all Pokemon that naturally annoy Mew via either boosting their Defense or lowering Mew's Attack. Because of this, Mew's only way of dealing with these Pokemon is usually Explosion. However, Lugia can tank even a +6 Explosion with enough Defense boosts and has Recover to prevent Mew from taking advantage of it. Skarmory has only a 2% chance of getting OHKOed by Explosion, meaning that Mew needs to flinch it with a +2 Rock Slide to have a guaranteed KO with Explosion. Because of this, it is not very reliable. Umbreon is the most prone of the mentioned checks to lose to Mew, but its access to Charm, Moonlight, and Toxic can let it stall long enough for Mew to either faint or lose patience and use Explosion. Cloyster only gets 3HKOed by a +2 Rock Slide and can deal a minimum of 86% to Mew with Explosion. Steelix is bulky enough to use Curse even on a boosted Mew and can use Explosion itself to take Mew out.</p> <p><strong>Celebi</strong>: Celebi can be used as a good Mew check if pivoted properly, either by scouting if Mew is running Shadow Ball on its moveset or baiting Explosion and switching out to Pokemon that resist it.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is bulky enough to survive an unboosted Rock Slide, meaning it can use Toxic on Mew or deal damage to it with Flamethrower while scouting and pivoting around to reveal Mew's moveset. However, a +2 Rock Slide and Explosion will outright OHKO Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire annoys Mew with Toxic and Haze. Toxic is especially devastating for backline Mew, as its potential sweep will be compromised, and it will be forced to use Explosion more quickly.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is bulky enough to avoid the OHKO from a boosted Shadow Ball, resists Earthquake, and can put Mew to sleep with Sleep Powder while having access to Explosion to put a huge dent in Mew's HP. However, it must be careful of Rock Slide flinches and Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Jolteon can revenge kill a weakened Mew with its strong attacks, although it must be careful of Earthquake, as it 2HKOes Jolteon unboosted while Jolteon barely 3HKOes Mew in return. Other Pokemon like Gengar can take out Mew with Destiny Bond or Explosion, making them effective offensive checks.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Lead Mew": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lead Mew is the most common Mew set due to its positive matchups against other common leads. Swords Dance gives Mew the ability to perform feats such as having a 76% chance to OHKO +1 Defense Lugia, having a 59% chance to OHKO +2 Defense Mewtwo with Explosion after one Swords Dance, and always OHKOing Tyranitar and Golem after two Swords Dances, making Mew one of the toughest Pokemon to switch into in Ubers, especially if its moveset has not yet been fully revealed. Thunder Wave helps Mew beat Barrier Mewtwo one-on-one, as one turn where Mewtwo gets fully paralyzed is enough for Mew to beat it with Explosion. Thunder Wave also helps Mew circumvent its Speed problem and allows it to always outspeed Pokemon like Gengar and Zapdos. Fire Blast OHKOes Forretress, an otherwise solid check to Mew, without having to sacrifice itself with Explosion; it also 2HKOes Skarmory, Steelix, and Exeggutor and 3HKOes Leftovers Cloyster while having very favorable chances to 2HKO Miracle Berry variants. The combination of Thunder Wave and Fire Blast gives Mew the best possible matchup against the majority of opposing leads. If these Pokemon are not an issue, and Mew instead wants to have a better matchup against offensive teams, it can run Thunder alongside Magnet to secure a near-guaranteed OHKO on Cloyster, denying the opponent's Spikes while still retaining the useful paralysis chance on Pokemon like Mewtwo and Gengar.</p> <p>Mew can also run Surf to OHKO Golem without needing to use Explosion, letting it be saved for another Pokemon like Mewtwo while retaining the 2HKO on Steelix; it is best used alongside Thunder to let Mew keep the ability to paralyze Mewtwo and beat it one-on-one.</p> <p>As for what item Mew can run, Miracle Berry is the standard for its one-time immunity against Lovely Kiss from Snorlax and Sleep Powder from Exeggutor while also helping Mew last a bit longer against Toxic Mewtwo variants. However, if Mew is running Thunder, Magnet can be considered as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Potential teammates for Mew include Pokemon that can double down on the offensive prowess it provides, such as offensive Mewtwo. All-out attacker Mewtwo can, alongside Mew, break the opponent's team via coverage moves and a strong Self-Destruct that lets it beat foes such as Celebi and Ho-Oh that can annoy Mew depending on what moves it is running. Mew will usually be using Explosion on Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, Tyranitar, Golem, and Mewtwo, so Pokemon that appreciate the mentioned threats being out of the picture, like Snorlax, Cloyster, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Vaporeon, also make for good teammates.</p>"
        },
        "Backline Mew": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mew can use its respectable bulk to be a good switch-in to all-out attacker Mewtwo and Gengar. Swords Dance allows Mew to dish out far more powerful attacks, giving it the ability to potentially 2HKO or 3HKO the majority of the metagame. Earthquake targets Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon like Tyranitar, Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix, 2HKOing the former three while 3HKOing the latter. Earthquake also targets other important Pokemon like Jolteon and Raikou. Another option Mew can run is Shadow Ball, as it provides a strong hit on Celebi, opposing Mew, and Mewtwo, 2HKOing all of them after a Swords Dance. However, Mewtwo can turn the tables on Mew if it is running Barrier. It is worth noting that both Earthquake and Shadow Ball hit Gengar super effectively. Rock Slide allows Mew to OHKO Ho-Oh, 2HKO Zapdos, and 3HKO Cloyster after a Swords Dance. Submission can be used if Mew wants to hit Snorlax harder without sacrificing itself with Explosion, as Curse Snorlax will eventually be bulky enough to withstand a boosted Earthquake without too many issues. A boosted Submission also OHKOes Tyranitar, something that Earthquake fails to do, which can be used to prevent Mew getting phazed by it; it also 2HKOes Umbreon. Lastly, Explosion is used in the last slot to enhance Mew's wallbreaking abilities. A boosted Explosion destroys even the bulkiest of physical walls like Barrier Mewtwo, Lugia, Umbreon, and even Skarmory. This, however, comes at the cost of Mew KOing itself and is a move that is usually telegraphed, so it can get pivoted around. Soft-Boiled is a more defensive option that Mew can run over Explosion to take advantage of its good defensive capabilities against offensive Mewtwo, Gengar, and potentially Zapdos. Unfortunately, running Soft-Boiled means that Mew will be unable to get past Barrier Mewtwo, Lugia, and Skarmory on its own and thus will need the help of its teammates. Mew can run almost any possible combination of moves desired and do it with high effectiveness. However, one combination advised against is Earthquake + Submission because it leaves Mew unable to get past Mewtwo, Zapdos, Celebi, Forretress, and opposing Mew.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew appreciates Spikes weakening checks like Steelix, so both Cloyster and Forretress are good teammates. Cloyster in particular can hit both Steelix and Tyranitar with a strong Surf and use Explosion on a Pokemon like Snorlax or Celebi. Body Slam Snorlax can paralyze Mewtwo for Mew to have better chances of breaking through it without being forced to use Explosion. Tyranitar can beat Barrier Mewtwo and Lugia and weaken Cloyster for Mew, while Mew can weaken Steelix for Tyranitar and switch into offensive Mewtwo. Exeggutor can switch into Zapdos and threaten to heavily damage it, put something to sleep with Sleep Powder, and use its powerful Explosion and coverage to break past usual Mew checks like Mewtwo and the aforementioned Zapdos. Zapdos itself is a good teammate for Mew, as it commonly switches into Steelix and hits it hard with Hidden Power Water while forcing Steelix to use Explosion if it wants to hit back.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Crobat is a lesser-seen Pokemon in GSC UU, suffering from its lack of a strong STAB attack, shallow movepool, and poor typing that leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Electric and Psychic. However, it possesses a few defensive quirks that can't be replicated by any other Pokemon in the tier. Most notably, Crobat is the absolute best counter to GSC UU's most threatening sweeper in Scyther thanks to its base 130 Speed, access to Haze, and lack of a weakness to any of its attacks. It can also check other dangerous Pokemon in the tier such as Victreebel and Swords Dance Bellossom, and it notably is able to outspeed Quagsire that had an Agility boost passed to it, preventing a Belly Drum sweep. These niches give it a role on defensive teams. However, some of the most prominent Pokemon in GSC UU can switch into Crobat and threaten it easily, such as Nidoqueen, Slowbro, and Granbull.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crobat can run Sleep Talk over Thief to absorb sleep and be harder to take advantage of when sleeping, with Rest + Sleep Talk also making it a better check to Victreebel and Body Slam variants of Pinsir, but the utility provided by Thief or Toxic is hard to pass up. Giga Drain is an unexpected option for hitting Pokemon such as Kabutops, Omastar, Quagsire, and Graveler hard. Protect can be used to PP stall and slowly recover with Leftovers. Lastly, Crobat can try a set with Screech, Substitute, Mean Look, and Swagger that can be very annoying, taking advantage of Screech's Defense drop and Swagger's Attack boost to make foes hit themselves for big damage while they can't switch, although this set is quite luck reliant and requires Crobat to find opportunities to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime, Slowking, Slowbro, and Hypno are all capable of threatening Crobat while not being hurt too much in return from Wing Attack. All of them are also able to threaten paralysis. However, all of them dislike Thief.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Electric-type Moves</strong>: Ampharos is not hurt too badly by Hidden Power Ground, and it can set up screens for its teammates or threaten Crobat greatly with Thunder. Nidoqueen threatens a potential 2HKO and paralysis with Thunder and can heal off damage with Moonlight or grab momentum with Lovely Kiss. Gyarados and Lanturn threaten Crobat with Thunder and take little from its attacks. Magneton and Pikachu are able to potentially OHKO Crobat with Thunder, but they both have to watch out for Hidden Power Ground, and Pikachu hates Thief.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Dodrio, Piloswine, and Granbull can take advantage of Crobat's passivity to switch in and threaten it; Dodrio and Granbull are able to 3HKO with Double-Edge or Return, respectively, and Piloswine threatens with Ice Beam, Ancient Power, or Roar to force Spikes damage onto Crobat's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar, Kabutops, and Graveler all threaten Crobat with super effective damage and don't take much damage from Hidden Power Ground. Graveler can come in against Crobat to use Rapid Spin and Kabutops can set up a Swords Dance. However, these Pokemon should be careful of Giga Drain, and they fear Toxic if they're not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status moves from Grass-types such as Bellossom and Vileplume force Crobat to use Rest or have a teammate remove the status with Heal Bell. If Crobat is asleep or paralyzed, Pokemon such as Scyther have a chance of breaking through it.</p>",

        "Haze": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Crobat's high Speed and access to Haze to let it check dangerous setup sweepers. Haze is one of Crobat's best attributes, removing boosts from Pokemon such as Scyther, Pinsir, and Sandslash. Wing Attack is Crobat's most reliable source of damage and can 3HKO Scyther, Victreebel, Pinsir, and Bellossom. Thief can hurt the longevity of bulky Pokemon such as Ampharos, Hypno, and Nidoqueen that might try to switch in and threaten Crobat. Alternatively, Toxic has synergy with Spikes and can force a bulky Pokemon to use Rest. Confuse Ray has synergy with Crobat's high Speed and is its best way of making progress against bulkier Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground deals more damage to Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Electabuzz, and Magneton on the switch, and it has synergy with Toxic because it hits most Toxic-immune Pokemon. Lastly, Rest is helpful for keeping Crobat healthy throughout a game; it's most useful when paired with a teammate that has Heal Bell, although Rest can let Scyther actually break through Crobat while it's asleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crobat is best used on defensive teams for its ability to check dangerous threats. Heal Bell support from Chansey or Granbull can remove sleep from Rest or paralysis that Crobat may have sustained. Pokemon that can deal with Electric-type moves such as Nidoqueen, Piloswine, and Hypno can be useful teammates when dealing with Pokemon such as Electabuzz and Pikachu. Hypno appreciates Crobat countering Scyther and is also useful for combating Psychic-types and providing Light Screen or Reflect support. Spikes support from Qwilfish is useful for chipping opposing Pokemon and has synergy with Crobat's Thief. Magneton and Ampharos help against Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Pikachu and can take on bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Slowking. Blastoise is also found on defensive teams and can deal with Pokemon that can threaten Crobat, such as Omastar and Nidoqueen, while also being a decent check to Kabutops.</p>"

          "description": "<p>As one of the few Electric-types in the tier, Chinchou holds an incredible niche as one of the best anti-metagame Pokemon. Thanks to its typing, Chinchou is a mainstay on defensive teams and is able to check many top metagame threats, including Dewgong, Rapidash, Ninetales, and Octillery. Chinchou's decent Special Defense and lack of a weakness to Ice or Electric alongside its resistance to Water give it enviable role compression and allow it to check Water-types that are otherwise nearly impossible to wall reliably. Because of this, Chinchou is easily one of the most splashable Pokemon in the GSC NU tier. On top of this, Chinchou's dual STAB attacks pair very well together, as Thunder smacks the common Water-types in the tier and threatens even Pokemon that resist it with paralysis, while its Water-type STAB options hit Ground-, Fire-, and Rock-types for heavy damage, although Grass-types as well as the semi-uncommon Dragonair resist both of Chinchou's STAB moves. Chinchou is also deceptively fast, outspeeding nearly all of the relevant Rock- and Ground-types that threaten it with Earthquake, bar Dugtrio. Rest and Sleep Talk give Chinchou good longevity and let it absorb Hypnosis from the likes of Rapidash and Persian. However, its low overall stats are a huge hindrance, as most physical attackers easily 2HKO Chinchou and it doesn't hit very hard against non-super effective targets.</p> <p>Chinchou's role of dominating bulky Water- and Fire-types greatly helps Pokemon that struggle with said threats; many top-tier offensive Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Xatu, and Fearow struggle to break past Dewgong in particular, so they greatly benefit from Chinchou's ability to wall and threaten it. Chinchou also greatly appreciates being paired with physically bulky Pokemon such as Weezing and Azumarill, since they can reliably switch into the common physical attackers that scare out Chinchou. Xatu is also one of Chinchou's best partners, since they can beat each other's checksâ€”Xatu dominates the Grass-types such as Gloom that wall Chinchou, while Chinchou dominates Xatu's best check in Dewgong.</p>"

Without the obligation of devoting two moveslots to Rest and Sleep Talk, Chinchou also has room to run Ice Beam over one of its support moves to prevent itself from being walled by Grass-types such as Gloom. However, without the longevity provided by RestTalk, it cannot fight Fire-types as effectively in the long term.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>Lanturn is blessed with unique and valuable typing in a metagame full of Water-types. Its resistance to Water and Ice alongside its access to powerful STAB Electric-type moves makes it uniquely well positioned to take on common foes like Slowbro, Slowking, and Blastoise, and the threat of STAB Surf deters the usual checks to Electric-types, such as Nidoqueen and Piloswine. Its high HP, decent Special Defense, and lack of weaknesses to specially offensive types aside from Grass allow it to feasibly take on almost any special attacker, including powerful Psychic-types like Mr. Mime and Kadabra if needed. However, its weakness to Ground prevents it from switching into Ground-types despite being a bulky Water-type, and its middling Special Attack stat means it can struggle to threaten bulkier foes that are not weak to its attacks, such as Quagsire, Ampharos, and Hypno. Furthermore, Grass-types like Bellossom and Victreebel resist both of its usual attacks and can force Lanturn into a purely defensive role, in which it does not excel.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lanturn has access to several useful support options, including Thunder Wave, Light Screen, Toxic, and Confuse Ray. It is a viable option to drop Rest, Sleep Talk, or both and use some of these support options, although this limits the number of times Lanturn can take hits from Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mr. Mime and also makes it highly susceptible to status. Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump are options, but Thunder is preferred to Thunderbolt for its extra power and high chance of inflicting paralysis, and Hydro Pump is much less reliable than Surf, as its low accuracy allows Nidoqueen to potentially fish for a miss or attempt to run Lanturn out of PP by using Moonlight repeatedly. Ice Beam is available to target Bellossom and Jumpluff, although this is generally worse than the longevity offered by RestTalk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom, Victreebel, and Vileplume can all switch into Lanturn safely, although they are crippled by the potential paralysis from its Thunder. Once they have gotten in, they can threaten Lanturn with STAB attacks, boost their offensive stats with Swords Dance or Growth, or inflict status on Lanturn's teammates as they try to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey, Hypno, and Ampharos take minimal damage from Lanturn's attacks and can force it out with the threat of powerful attacks, such as Chansey's Present and Ampharos's Thunder, or, in the absence of these options, set up Light Screen for a teammate, cripple Lanturn with status, or PP stall it. Chansey can also cure its teammates of paralysis that Lanturn may have inflicted.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire is the only viable Ground-type that is not weak to Surf. It can therefore switch into Lanturn relatively safely and threaten a 2HKO with its super effective STAB Earthquake. However, its Special Defense is not great, so it should be wary of switching into Surf too many times, especially if Spikes are up.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen is not a safe response to Lanturn, as Lanturn barely manages an average of 54% damage with Surf. However, if Lanturn is paralyzed or if a healthy Nidoqueen switches into any move other than Surf, Nidoqueen will have a significant advantage, as it can 2HKO Lanturn with its faster STAB Earthquake and potentially heal off any damage traded as Lanturn is forced to retreat.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the most straightforward and reliable set for Lanturn. Thunder is the preferred Electric-type STAB attack, as its high base damage compensates for Lanturn's fairly low Special Attack, and its high paralysis chance poses a threat even to more resilient foes. Surf is Lanturn's most consistent attack and does just enough damage to Nidoqueen that it cannot recover enough health with Moonlight and Leftovers to stay out of 2HKO range, meaning if Lanturn connects with Surf on the switch, the standard Moonlight Nidoqueen will be forced to switch out or risk fainting. Rest gives Lanturn the ability to switch into many special attacks with ease without having to worry too much about getting worn down. Sleep Talk is particularly useful for keeping up Lanturn's threat level while it is asleep and therefore acts as a deterrent to dangerous foes like Nidoqueen, Scyther, and Granbull.</p> <p>Lanturn typically switches into one of the many Water-types in the tier, forcing them out with the threat of Thunder. From there, you are free to guess what the opponent might switch into and choose the appropriate move. Lanturn is quite an awkward Pokemon to switch into if the opponent does not have a special wall like Hypno, Chansey, or Ampharos due to its high power STAB attacks, good coverage, and the threat of paralysis from Thunder. It is one of very few Pokemon that is capable of safely taking repeated hits from the likes of Slowbro while threatening it in return and also having enough damage output to threaten Nidoqueen. However, due to it having a weakness to Ground, it cannot fulfill the same generic physical wall role that the other bulky Water-types in the tier can, nor can it safely check Nidoqueen despite being able to discourage it from switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Lanturn has a clear niche with clear advantages, it can be difficult to fit onto a team, as while it performs admirably as a special wall, it does not compare to Hypno or Chansey in this regard, nor does it do everything one might want their bulky Water-type to do. Lanturn strongly benefits from additional measures to handle Nidoqueen; some options fit for this purpose include Granbull, the combination of Gligar and Piloswine, and other bulkier Water-types such as Quagsire and Slowking. Lanturn can have a difficult time dealing with the raw power of other Electric-types such as Ampharos and Electabuzz, so Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Piloswine make for good teammates. These Ground-types also tend to draw in the Water-types that Lanturn can capitalize on. While Lanturn has enough power to threaten Granbull and can take a hit or two in return, it is wise to use a more reliable option to deal with Curse Granbull. Haunter and Magneton are two options that deal with mono-attacking Granbull reliably. Grass-types such as Bellossom are enormous problems for Lanturn; they are most safely dealt with by using another Rest user that is not weak to Grass, such as Hypno, Mr. Mime, or Pinsir. However, Qwilfish can also deal with Bellossom in the short term and provides Spikes that Lanturn and its team can take advantage of.</p>"

Lanturn is one of the few Electric-types that has no problem switching into Water-types, which is great since that's what Electrics do most. Lanturn also has massive HP which lets it take more hits than one might think. It also annoys really well, and can OHKO those Ground-types that resist Thunder Wave.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>You can make Lanturn even more annoying by combining confusion and paralysis with Attract to make it hard for your opponent to get in a hit. Rain Dance can be used somewhat effectively over Thunder Wave, and then you can use a 100% accurate Thunder and a beefed up Surf. Ice Beam could be a surprise attack for those Grass-types that resist both of Lanturn's STAB attacks. Toxic can poison the opponent and force it to switch out at some point.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn has fairly good type coverage, but not much power behind its attacks. Grass-types like Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom, and Victreebel resist both of Lanturn's STAB attacks and hit back super effectively with Giga Drain. Anything with Earthquake that is not weak to Lanturn's attacks should handle it easily, and as always, Blissey and Snorlax stop weaker special attackers like Lanturn indefinitely.</p>",

With two of the highest Special Attack and Speed stats in the tier combined with a great STAB attack in Psychic, Xatu is the single most dangerous special attacker in the tier and can be difficult to switch into for weakened teams. Xatu is a great check to several of the best Pokemon in the tier, notably Primeape, Hitmonlee, and Kingler. It also takes advantage of Spikes, which makes it even more difficult to switch into and turns certain 4HKOs on Pokemon like Magmar and Lickitung into potential 3HKOs. Xatu's immunity to Spikes is also a big benefit that makes it tougher to wear down. RestTalk is a fantastic set for Xatu, since it lets it absorb status and stick around for the late-game, where it often acts as a cleaner. Psychic is a mandatory STAB move that hits a lot of the tier for good damage and can nab a lucky Special Defense drop on a foe like Dewgong, which makes it easier to pressure. Xatu's chosen coverage move is often team-dependent. Drill Peck is generally the most common and reliable, since it acts as a secondary STAB move and guarantees that Sleep Talk will call upon a useful move against Pokemon like Primeape. Even though Hidden Power Electric lowers Xatu's bulk slightly, it hits opposing Xatu the hardest, which gives it an edge in those matchups, as well as putting pressure on Dewgong switching in with Spikes down. Lastly, Night Shade is generally a reliable source of damage, but its main role is to shred through the incredibly bulky Shuckle, which some teams don't have a reliable way of breaking through.</p> <p>Xatu partners well offensively and defensively with several Pokemon. Xatu's arguable best partner is Chinchou, which can beat several of the best checks to it, such as Dewgong, Magmar, and Ninetales; in return Xatu can check most of the physical attackers that scare out Chinchou, such as Hitmonlee. Pineco is an important partner for Xatu, since it sets up the Spikes that Xatu takes advantage of and can somewhat check one of Xatu's best checks in Dugtrio. Primeape forms a fierce offensive combo with Xatu, wearing down the opponent's offensive core by beating each other's checks, such as Weezing for Primeape and Dewgong for Xatu. Xatu is one of the best Baton Pass recipients in the tier; most notably, Growth passes from Flareon turn Xatu into a near-unwallable menace. Bulky Water-types such as Dewgong and Azumarill are often the best ways to check Xatu, since they can stall it out despite fearing Special Defense drops, so Pokemon such as Chinchou and Hitmonlee that can beat them are often good partners. Magnemite and Sneasel are resistant or immune to Xatu's Psychic and can hit it hard with their respective STAB attacks; however, Sneasel cannot check Xatu effectively at all if it is paralyzed, since that way it is forced into burning Moonlight's PP much more quickly. Both of these Xatu checks are weak to Fighting and Fire, so Hitmonlee, Ninetales, and Primeape are useful teammates to threaten them with.</p>"

Xatu can also run Rest and Mint Berry on the same set, which gives Xatu a chance to heal off all damage and status and also lets it use Thief after using the Mint Berry. This Xatu set does a bit better against bulkier teams when paired with other users of Thief and Spikes, which puts pressure on common bulky Pokemon such as Azumarill, Dewgong, and Ninetales.</p>"}

This means that, unlike Curse Graveler, it is somewhat difficult to immediately force out. Its resistance to Normal and high Defense are very valuable in a metagame with numerous viable Normal-types, such as Wigglytuff, Fearow, and Lickitung, and common Explosion users such as Weezing and Pineco. Its high Attack and STAB Rock Slide allow it to threaten Xatu and common Fire-types with a 2HKO while avoiding a 2HKO in return. Earthquake provides essential coverage to target Pokemon that resist Rock, such as Primeape and Dugtrio, as well as Pokemon weak to Ground, such as Weezing, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Self-Destruct allows Sudowoodo to take something down with it once its defensive role is no longer required. This can let it take down big threats such as Primeape or crucial defensive pieces such as Gloom and Azumarill. Furthermore, a Normal-type with Curse boosts seeking to PP stall Sudowoodo will typically be unable to survive a 999 Attack Self-Destruct after some slight chip damage from Rock Slide, so Sudowoodo can act as a reliable answer to these, even without Rest.</p> <p>Sudowoodo can be a useful teammate to virtually any team thanks to its fantastic set of resistances. In addition to providing an essential resistance to Normal, Sudowoodo also makes for a great recipient of Speed and Attack boosts from Baton Passers such as Ledian and Farfetch'd since it has great coverage and can take at least one hit from almost anything. Sudowoodo has a hard time against bulky Water-types such as Octillery and Azumarill, so it is a good idea to pair it with at least one Pokemon that fares well against these, such as Chinchou. Self-Destruct can be used to pave the way for a teammate such as Magmar, which can struggle against these Water-types. Magmar and other Fire-types can also help Sudowoodo against Grass-types such as Exeggcute. Normal-types, which tend to invite Pineco in due to its high Defense, also greatly appreciate Sudowoodo's presence as a Pokemon that remains relatively healthy after taking a telegraphed Explosion, which can otherwise be difficult to handle in the absence of low health Pokemon to use as fodder.</p>"

This set attempts to remedy these vulnerabilities by using Rest to give Sudowoodo some longevity. Curse is a good option to ensure that Sudowoodo cannot be beaten by Curse Normal-types, but it comes at the expense of either Earthquake, which Sudowoodo needs to avoid being fodder for Primeape, or Sleep Talk, which is important to maximize both its offensive and defensive presence while it is asleep. If it is running Sleep Talk, Sudowoodo also performs excellently as an answer to Rapidash and Ninetales, which have access to Hypnosis.</p> <p>As Rest Sudowoodo inevitably sacrifices one of Curse, Earthquake, or Sleep Talk, it is highly likely to become setup fodder at some point in a game. Thus, reliable defensive measures, such as Haze Xatu and Gloom, are important to ensure that opposing setup sweepers are kept in check. As usual, it is also highly recommended to use suitable answers to Water-types, as they will easily force Sudowoodo out otherwise. Some such answers include Hitmonlee, Gloom, and Dewgong.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Quagsire is one of the best recipients of a Speed or Special Defense boost from Baton Pass in GSC UU. Getting either boost allows it to set up Belly Drum more easily against many foes and become a fearsome offensive threat that can sweep teams on the spot. Quagsire's great typing gives it only a single weakness to Grass and an Electric immunity without the usual weakness to Ice or Water. Quagsire also fits outside of Baton Pass teams, as it can do well as a Belly Drum sweeper with paralysis support. However, Quagsire struggles against Haze users due to its terrible Speed, even being outsped at +2 by Haze Crobat. Quagsire also lacks many resistances, meaning that some of the most common attacks of the tier, such as Nidoqueen's Earthquake, Hypno's Psychic, and Blastoise's Surf, do enough damage to discourage it from setting up. Due to its low Speed and reliance on Belly Drum for power, it is easy to revenge kill if it has not received a Speed boost. Quagsire's defensive utility is also questionable, as it cannot run RestTalk without sacrificing coverage or a boosting move, and it is outclassed as a mixed RestTalk user by Piloswine, which sports a superior STAB combination and higher Attack.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest allows Quagsire to extend its longevity on its own. Heal Bell support from Pokemon such as Chansey and Granbull can let it pull off multiple Belly Drums in one match. However, Rest is more or less wasted on Baton Pass-oriented teams, where Quagsire is meant to go all out on sweeping. Curse can also be run over Belly Drum to maintain HP while still getting an offensive boost, and it also offers a bulk boost. However, it does not give Quagsire the immediate power it needs to sweep, and it can be difficult to break through bulky foes such as Slowbro before being forced to use Rest. Ice Beam and Surf allow Quagsire to threaten foes such as Piloswine and Jumpluff without having to set up. However, Quagsire is generally outclassed by Piloswine in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haze Users</strong>: Haze can be a huge issue for Quagsire, as it removes the boosts that make Quagsire so powerful. Crobat can outspeed Quagsire at +2 and can switch in safely to use Haze. Qwilfish and Omastar, although taking major damage from Earthquake, outspeed a Quagsire without any Speed boosts and can stop a sweep with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Encore Users</strong>: Encore users such as Jumpluff, Mr. Mime, and Kadabra can come in on an unboosted Quagsire or a Baton Pass teammate and ruin Quagsire's sweep by forcing either one out. Shuckle gets a special mention, as it can survive any hit from +6 Quagsire and lock it into a move, which is generally enough to end a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Curse variants of Granbull can use Curse on the turn that an Agility-boosted Quagsire uses Belly Drum, survive an Earthquake, and KO it back with Return. However, Granbull cannot beat Quagsire if it switches in on the turn Quagsire uses Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can take most of Quagsire's hits, even tanking a +6 Earthquake around 90% of the time, and deal a significant amount of damage back with Surf, revenge killing after chip damage in tandem with Belly Drum recoil.</p> <p><strong>Gligar</strong>: Gligar stands up to any attack +6 Quagsire throws at it and can use Counter to OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Electrode</strong>: Electrode can outspeed Quagsire, even at +2, and revenge kill it with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Quagsire's 4x weakness to Grass-type moves, as well as its somewhat below average Special Defense stat, means that it is vulnerable to most Grass-type coverage. Electabuzz can surprise Quagsire with Hidden Power Grass and KO it after a Belly Drum. Bellossom can OHKO Quagsire with its Hidden Power Grass. However, it has to watch out for Sludge Bomb sets.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Belly Drum": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set works best as a Baton Pass recipient, utilizing boosts to set up with Belly Drum and more consistently sweep. It can also work outside of Baton Pass teams as a bulky setup sweeper that appreciates Heal Bell and paralysis support. Belly Drum is Quagsire's biggest asset, allowing it to do massive damage. Earthquake's STAB and high-Base Power make it a fantastic attack for a Belly Drum user, as it allows Quagsire to deal much more damage both before and after boosting than competing Belly Drum users such as Politoed and Poliwrath. It can threaten Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, and Haunter significantly even before Belly Drum. After a Belly Drum, Quagsire has a small chance to OHKO even Slowbro, one of the most physically bulky Pokemon available. Hidden Power Rock targets Flying-types that otherwise wall Quagsire such as Scyther, Crobat, and Jumpluff, as well as Pinsir. Sludge Bomb gives coverage for the likes of Bellossom, which otherwise walls Quagsire. Alternatively, Amnesia allows Quagsire to set up on Hypno and Slowbro more reliably and can make Quagsire much more difficult to finish off. It is especially useful when Quagsire is forced to use Belly Drum when under 50% health. Finally, Protect is a solid option, as it allows Quagsire more Leftovers recovery and a way to block Explosion from the likes of Electrode and Haunter. However, remember that dropping Sludge Bomb for these options leaves Quagsire totally walled by Bellossom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Baton Pass user is a great option if you plan on running Quagsire. Girafarig can pass a crucial Speed boost with Agility as well as defensive boosts with Amnesia or Curse, which can make it easier to set up. Scyther can supply Speed and Attack boosts, which immediately enhances Quagsire's offensive power. However, Scyther's lack of immediate power leaves it more susceptible to Haze users. Mr. Mime is another useful Baton Pass teammate, as it can threaten Haze users, set up with Barrier, induce paralysis, and lock foes into setup moves with Encore. Politoed and Poliwrath are other good Baton Pass recipients that can assist Quagsire by using Lovely Kiss on Haze users such as Qwilfish, preventing them from ruining a potential sweep. Hypno is also a good teammate, as it can spread paralysis to Quagsire's checks and potentially absorb status. Jumpluff and Bellossom can also spread paralysis. Granbull appreciates the paralysis support that is often paired with Quagsire and can use Lovely Kiss on checks such as Haze Qwilfish.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Quagsire has always been a competent defensive Ground-type. However, it's generally not thought of as a top OU Pokemon because its ability to counter Hidden Power legends was not needed when they were banned and because it's a lot less offensive than other Ground-types. However, in the modern metagame where the legendary Electric-types regularly carry Hidden Power, Quagsire's neutralities to Ice- and Water-type attacks give it a unique defensive advantage over other Ground-types, although the uncommon Hidden Power Grass can still be used to ruin it. Quagsire is a decent mixed wall that can threaten to sweep if given the chance to set up a Belly Drum, but unlike other Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak, it doesn't have the attacking stats to pose an immediate offensive threat.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more defensive variant of Quagsire could be built by replacing Belly Drum with Curse. This would allow Quagsire to force out mixed attackers and force the opponent to send walls rather than offensive threats into Quagsire without having to rely on the difficult-to-use Belly Drum. This is important because a Quagsire hovering around half health can't threaten to set up Belly Drum, allowing a threat such as mixed Snorlax to switch in and take the initiative; on the other hand, Curse Quagsire would be able to easily deter this switch-in. A more defensive Quagsire could also use Haze in Belly Drum's slot. This would prevent Baton Pass users, most notably Jolteon, from transferring their boosts to another Pokemon while also neutralizing Curse users and stopping Belly Drum Snorlax sweeps. When using Curse or Haze, Sleep Talk can be used over Hidden Power Rock. Hidden Power Rock's main use is allowing Quagsire to KO Zapdos and Skarmory after a Belly Drum, so without Belly Drum, that slot would be better suited toward a more defensive move. Note that if Belly Drum is dropped, even for Curse, Quagsire is not going to contribute much of anything offensively because too many Pokemon shut it down entirely.</p> <p>In addition to more defensive sets, Quagsire could forgo Rest and run an all-out offensive Belly Drum set. Generally, Sludge Bomb is selected in place of Rest to give Quagsire a powerful move to use against Exeggutor. Even before a Belly Drum, it does quite a bit of damage to Exeggutor and threatens to poison it. Generally, an all-out offensive Quagsire will be used alongside Pokemon such as Jolteon and Smeargle that can pass Agility boosts, thereby negating Quagsire's lackluster Speed and allowing it to set up a sweep legitimately.</p> <p>Another possibility is using Quagsire's special attacking movepool. Surf is generally a poor move choice, but it can help check Rhydon more effectively and instantly threaten solid damage against Skarmory (30% - 35%). Note, however, that Surf still fails to 3HKO Skarmory. Ice Beam is another option; it's a decent attack for instant damage against Exeggutor switch-ins, and might also be useful for attempting to freeze a key Quagsire check such as Skarmory or Suicune. Generally, though, Quagsire shouldn't be using even STAB special attacks because its Special Attack is very poor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory is the chief Quagsire check, safely avoiding a 3HKO even from Quagsire's STAB Surf and comfortably phazing Quagsire after it has used Belly Drum (999 Attack Hidden Power Rock does 40% - 47% to Skarmory). Any other attack does pitiful, insignificant damage to Skarmory. Exeggutor is another potent check; although it fears Sludge Bomb, it switches in on Earthquake and Hidden Power Rock with impunity and threatens to KO with Giga Drain or Psychic. Meganium stops Quagsire even colder than Exeggutor does; it has better defenses, an instant recovery move in Synthesis, and unlike Exeggutor, isn't picked off by Pursuit Tyranitar. However, Synthesis's mere 8 PP erodes quickly, and Meganium is no fonder of taking a possible Sludge Bomb poison than Exeggutor is. Heracross is a potent Quagsire check, too. It resists Earthquake and is neutral to Hidden Power Rock; furthermore, it boasts a powerful Megahorn that threatens to 3HKO Quagsire. Thus, the presence of a medium-to-high-health Heracross effectively prevents Quagsire from using Belly Drum safely. Suicune is another strong Quagsire check, though it needs to be at high health and avoid paralysis if it is going to perform this function competently. Its Surf 3HKOes Quagsire, and if it switches in at full health as Quagsire uses Belly Drum, it KOes Quagsire with Surf before Quagsire can KO it with Earthquake. Cloyster is a decent check; while it can't 3HKO with STAB Surf or Ice Beam, Cloyster has the Defense to survive a 999 Attack Earthquake and hits hard enough with its STAB moves to 2HKO Quagsire after it uses Belly Drum. Marowak can serve as a check if you predict Belly Drum. Quagsire is one of the few Pokemon Marowak outspeeds, and a Thick Club-boosted Earthquake does a minimum of 53% to Quagsire. Thus, Marowak can threaten to KO Quagsire if it sets up Belly Drum on the switch-in. However, Marowak is an unreliable check, as switching it in on an Earthquake can render it unable to survive a hit such as Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos later in the match.</p> <p>If you can reliably keep Spikes down, you can use anything with a strong STAB Surf, such as Starmie or Vaporeon, to effectively trade with Quagsire. Although these Pokemon fail to OHKO Quagsire after a Belly Drum and are OHKOed by a 999 Attack STAB Earthquake, they can lower Quagsire's health to dangerous levels if it decides to go for the KO, thereby leaving it unable to switch back in easily. This, in turn, can open up your own Zapdos or Raikou for an offensive push. However, without Spikes, it becomes much more difficult to handle a possible Quagsire switch-in, so in the event that you cannot keep Spikes down, you should only use these frailer Water-types as Quagsire counters if it has enough residual damage to be put in KO range after a Belly Drum. Of course, anything with a Grass-type attack that isn't weak to Earthquake makes a solid Quagsire counter; even with a Ground-type weakness, having a Grass-type move can catch Quagsire by surprise and ruin it for the rest of the match. However, Grass-type moves are generally not very useful outside of countering Quagsire, so other means of checking Quagsire are preferred.</p>",

        "Belly Drum": {
          "description": "<p>You can thank Raikou, Zapdos, and the fairly recent (circa 2009) unbanning of Hidden Power on these Pokemon for Quagsire's emergence as a legitimate threat in GSC OU. The most common Hidden Power types used by Zapdos and Raikou are Ice and Water; Quagsire is neutral to both, which gives it the edge relative to other Ground-types that might be used to check Electric-types. It should be noted that Hidden Power Grass, while hypothetically possible, is rare and leaves the legendary Electric-type Pokemon vulnerable to Nidoking switch-ins.</p> <p>Quagsire walls these Electric-types impeccably, but it also serves as a fantastic mixed wall for threats such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Nidoking. Quagsire is also a solid check to Tentacruel, and at decently high health, it can survive a 999 Attack Charizard Earthquake and KO back with Hidden Power Rock. Because of its important defensive capabilities, Rest is recommended on Quagsire so it can keep switching in to wall what it can.</p> <p>However, while Quagsire's walling capabilities are certainly handy, decent mixed walls such as Raikou, Suicune, and Miltank are a dime a dozen. What truly makes Quagsire stand out is its access to Belly Drum. With Belly Drum, Quagsire can threaten to sweep the opposing team, something the aforementioned mixed walls cannot boast. Furthermore, it's capable of setting up Belly Drum safely in the face of the ever-present Hidden Power Zapdos and Raikou, something even the mighty Snorlax cannot accomplish. STAB Earthquake is the main move Quagsire will be using after setting up. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Rock hurts the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake. After a turn of setup, Hidden Power Rock can OHKO Zapdos and 3HKO Skarmory, one of Quagsire's most prominent checks. It should be noted that unlike other offensive sweepers such as Snorlax and Marowak, Quagsire isn't capable of threatening much of anything without a turn of setup.</p> <p>Quagsire likes support to help it wear down its most prominent checks. Tyranitar with Pursuit is one of the best teammates, as it can be used to snipe Exeggutor, which is otherwise a hard counter for Quagsire. Seismic Toss Heracross and Belly Drum Snorlax are other solid teammates that lure in Skarmory, arguably Quagsire's number one check, and hit it for heavy damage.</p> <p>Quagsire's biggest issues as an offensive contributor are its very low Speed and inability to instantly threaten switch-ins the way Marowak can. For this reason, a lot of general support is essential for Quagsire to ever get an opportunity to sweep. In particular, support from Stun Spore Exeggutor and Body Slam Snorlax helps to target key walls such as Skarmory and Suicune with paralysis and to give Quagsire general paralysis support against \"random\" Pokemon such as Miltank and Starmie that can otherwise stop a sweep with a little luck. Spikes support is also handy for forcing Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Suicune to Explode or Rest, thereby giving Quagsire an opening to set up Belly Drum.</p> <p>Rapid Spin is essential, too; having to switch into Spikes really limits Quagsire's ability to set up Belly Drum, and unless the field is clear of Spikes, Quagsire can't go for the kill against Water-types that use STAB Surf to put Quagsire at extremely low health after using Belly Drum. Furthermore, Quagsire appreciates Heal Bell support from the likes of Miltank just as the most popular Belly Drum sweeper, Snorlax, does. With Heal Bell support, Quagsire can Rest off any residual damage, then have its sleep turns negated to allow it to switch immediately back in to threaten another Belly Drum sweep.</p> <p>Quagsire is a fantastic teammate for teams that need its defensive talents, too. A team without Raikou definitely appreciates Quagsire's ability to hard-counter Electric-types that lack the rare Hidden Power Grass; Snorlax may be on every team, but Snorlax alone can't take STAB Thunders from Zapdos and Raikou all day. In addition, Quagsire is also an extremely potent mixed wall that counters key offensive threats such as Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite. Unlike mixed walls such as Miltank and Suicune, Quagsire does not have an exploitable weakness to a move type commonly used by the most prominent mixed attackers in GSC.</p>"

With a pure Psychic typing, Morning Sun, and STAB Psychic, it can switch into and threaten dangerous Pokemon such as Gengar, Machamp, Nidoking, and Tentacruel, which offensive teams sometimes struggle with.</p> <p>However, Espeon is too fragile to take physical attacks from Snorlax, the most dominant Pokemon in GSC OU. In addition, status afflictions such as paralysis from Thunder Wave will compromise its potential. Furthermore, its movepool isn't ideal, which makes it hard to sweep without having the correct Hidden Power for Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Forretress.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is a potent option that is especially effective when used in tandem with paralysis support. It can block status from Pokemon such as Umbreon, exploit the low accuracy of Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, shut down Exeggutor, and scout for Explosion from Pokemon like Forretress, but replacing Morning Sun for it will reduce its capacity to function as a check to Pokemon such as Gengar and Machamp. Bite is a decent option to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Starmie, Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Espeon, but it doesn't cover Steelix like Hidden Power Water and Hidden Power Fire. If it is used alongside Hidden Power Water, Espeon will have solid coverage, but Espeon typically benefits more from having Substitute or Morning Sun. Toxic can be used to wear down problematic Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Jynx, but since Espeon is often a late-game Pokemon, Toxic damage racks up relatively slowly. Finally, Reflect is somewhat useful against Explosion users and unboosted Snorlax, but it is difficult to fit and is hard to justify over Espeon's other utility options such as Morning Sun and Substitute.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Snorlax and Blissey can easily take Espeon's attacks and retaliate with strong attacks or status moves. The former frightens Espeon with its STAB moves, while the latter threatens Espeon with Present. Although Snorlax cannot stop Baton Pass, it can usually force Espeon to Baton Pass and threaten most recipients. However, without Present, Blissey is setup fodder for Espeon, though it can run Light Screen to potentially outlast recipients.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Toxic Umbreon is one of the best answers to Espeon without Baton Pass, but it is one of the worst answers to Espeon with Baton Pass. Crunch from Tyranitar and to a lesser extent Houndoom can 2HKO Espeon and both also have access to Roar to phaze it, but +1 Hidden Power Water has a decent chance to 2HKO both Pokemon after damage from Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Forretress can threaten Espeon with Explosion or Toxic, Steelix can remove it with Explosion or phaze it with Roar, and Skarmory can cripple it with Toxic or phaze it with Whirlwind. However, all of them, especially Forretress, will be hurt by Hidden Power Fire and boosted STAB Psychic. Steelix will also be worn down by Hidden Power Water.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor, Starmie, Jynx, and Alakazam can cripple Espeon with status moves. Exeggutor threatens it with Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, Starmie threatens it with Thunder Wave, and Jynx threatens it with Lovely Kiss and Ice Beam. In addition, Exeggutor has Explosion to potentially trade with Espeon, and Alakazam can dominate Espeon with Encore. However, Espeon has Morning Sun to shrug off most of their attacks, Exeggutor and Jynx should be wary of Hidden Power Fire, and only Encore Alakazam can prevent it from using Baton Pass.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou and Zapdos tend to lose to Espeon if they switch in as it uses Growth, but they may be able to paralyze or phaze it to prevent a sweep. Espeon has reasonably good odds of 2HKOing Zapdos with +1 Psychic whereas Zapdos rarely 2HKOes it in return with Thunder, although Thunder's paralysis rate makes it very dangerous to Espeon.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is usually seen late-game and is especially dangerous against a sleeping Snorlax because of Growth and STAB Psychic. Hidden Power Water covers two common threats: Tyranitar and Steelix. It also does decent damage to Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire deters Forretress and hits targets such as Skarmory, Exeggutor, Steelix, and Jynx relatively hard, but it doesn't touch Tyranitar. With the combination of high Speed, STAB Psychic, and a pure Psychic typing, which resists Fighting-type attacks while not being weak to Earthquake, Morning Sun allows Espeon to provide a typical offensive team with a solid answer to dangerous threats such as Machamp, Gengar, and Nidoking so long as one of its teammates have already been put to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Machamp and Espeon have both offensive and defensive synergistic qualities. Both of them can also put pressure on key common Pokemon such as Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, and Skarmory if given a setup opportunity, and if Machamp can weaken Zapdos or Espeon can weaken Snorlax or Raikou, the other will have a better chance at finding an opportunity at setting up a sweep. Defensively, Machamp checks Steelix and Dark-types such as Tyranitar, while, thanks to Morning Sun, Espeon deals with Gengar, Nidoking, and Tentacruel.</p> <p>Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to take out opposing Snorlax. Its coverage and status moves can also be used to weaken Espeon's other checks such as Tyranitar and Steelix. Gengar runs moves such as Destiny Bond, Explosion, Hypnosis, and Dynamic Punch to cripple special walls, Steelix, and Dark-type Pokemon, against which Espeon has a hard time. Tyranitar attracts Machamp and Nidoking so that Espeon can come in comfortably and get a setup opportunity. In return, Tyranitar takes care of Explosion and Self-Destruct users, Jynx, and the rare Houndoom, which Espeon struggles with. Steelix can answer some variants of Snorlax and Tyranitar that stop Espeon, such as Curse RestTalk variants. In addition, it can paralyze or remove Skarmory and Exeggutor with Body Slam or Explosion, which helps Espeon. Cloyster can lay Spikes, check Steelix, and take down Starmie, while Espeon checks Tentacruel. Zapdos counters Skarmory, absorbs Sleep Powder from Exeggutor, and can force Snorlax to use Rest, which Espeon can take advantage of.</p>"

However, +1 Psychic from Espeon can 3HKO both of them and has a high chance of 2HKOing Raikou after Spikes, and Espeon has access to instant recovery. Skarmory can phaze Espeon, but Espeon can just hit it with +1 Psychic until it is forced to use Rest, so it will not stop Espeon from using Baton Pass in the long run. In addition, Baton Pass allows Espeon to escape from Pursuit damage.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Morning Sun makes Espeon last longer while giving it great defensive value because it can handle dangerous threats such as Machamp, Gengar, and Nidoking. While dropping Morning Sun means that Espeon loses instant recovery and has to be more cautious about when it comes in, Hidden Power can be used to hit phazers; Hidden Power Water covers phazers such as Tyranitar, Steelix, Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon, while Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory and Steelix relatively hard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos and Raikou make great recipients as long as the opponent doesn't have Roar Raikou, and the threat these two pose can force the opposing Pokemon to use Explosion. Nidoking is one of the most dangerous recipients due to its access to Lovely Kiss and ability to succeed against Tyranitar. Gengar is a good recipient if the opposing Snorlax doesn't have Earthquake or Lovely Kiss. In addition, it becomes much easier to land Explosion on the target you are seeking if Gengar has a boost. Furthermore, Gengar is immune to Normal-type attacks that might be aimed at Espeon or its other potential recipients. Tyranitar not only resists Normal-type attacks but also can become very dangerous after a boost, though this depends on the opposing lineup and its moveset. Machamp is not much of a receiver, but it is still a useful teammate for threatening Snorlax and Dark-types and potentially benefiting from Growth with Fire Blast. Jynx is the Pokemon that is most likely to sweep after receiving a boost, even if its typing has no defensive merit alongside Espeon. Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei can take advantage of Umbreon, Skarmory, and Jynx and will be dangerous when boosted because teams often forgo answers to Fire-type Pokemon due to their rarity. Since Espeon without Hidden Power Water loses to Roar Tyranitar, moves such as Earthquake from Snorlax and Destiny Bond or Dynamic Punch from Gengar can be considered to lure in and remove the behemoth early-game.</p>"

  "Umbreon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Umbreon is one of the toughest walls to bring down thanks to its stellar defensive stats and access to Charm, which allows it to handle GSC's numerous Curse sweepers. It's also a solid Pursuit user despite being very weak offensively, since it doesn't fear much from Starmie and Dynamic Punch Gengar, unlike competing Dark-types Tyranitar and Houndoom. Umbreon can also make good use of the combination of Mean Look and Baton Pass, which is potentially very rewarding if the opponent fails to phaze it. However, with such poor offensive stats and its bare movepool, Umbreon is one of the most passive Pokemon in the tier and is left overly reliant on Toxic to do any sort of damage, which means it can't pose a threat to anything immune to poison except Gengar. Umbreon also despises status and has to use Rest in order to escape from poison and paralysis, and even though it is extremely sturdy, it can be overwhelmed much more easily when it is asleep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zap Cannon is an option alongside sweepers like Tentacruel, Charizard, and Marowak on teams relying on paralysis; otherwise, Toxic is usually the best option for such a stall-based Pokemon, and losing the surprise factor due to a miss can ruin this strategy. Toxic has some merits on the Mean Look Pass set, as it puts phazers like Raikou, Tyranitar, and Suicune on a timer and forces them to use Rest if they have it, but it's ineffective against Skarmory and Steelix and more situational than the options listed. Umbreon learns Growth and can Baton Pass it, and while it's still very weak even when boosted, it can live long enough thanks to its bulk, typing, and access to Moonlight. It can also dent Skarmory and Steelix with a +1 Hidden Power Fire, but other phazers like Raikou and Tyranitar make it completely useless. Umbreon also has access to both Curse and Substitute, but again, it can't stop phazers from ruining any strategy it might otherwise hope to pull off with these.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: The safest switch-ins to Umbreon at your disposal are phazers immune to Toxic like Skarmory and Steelix, though those that can cure themselves of poison via Rest like Raikou, Suicune, and Tyranitar are fine alternatives too.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross is one of Umbreon's biggest counters; all it needs is to avoid Charm on the switch in order to leave a big dent with Megahorn, and it carries Rest most of the time, so Toxic won't cripple it too much.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: Faster Explosion users like Cloyster and to a lesser extent Gengar can also threaten Umbreon if they can avoid Charm, but they are obviously less reliable answers, since they have to sacrifice themselves to weaken Umbreon.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Most setup sweepers can't take advantage of Umbreon's passivity because of Charm, but there are some exceptions like Growth Vaporeon, which will boost its Special Attack in front of Umbreon fearlessly.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Pokemon with Substitute</strong>: Substitute users like Tentacruel and Kangaskhan can set up against Umbreon, since their Substitute blocks Charm and needs at least three hits of Pursuit to break.</p> <p><strong>Belly Drum Users</strong>: Belly Drum Snorlax is a massive threat to Umbreon since it relies on Charm to handle boosting Snorlax and can't reduce Snorlax's Attack fast enough to avoid getting KOed by its boosted STAB attacks. Other users of Belly Drum like Charizard, Clefable, and Quagsire are similarly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: A common way to bypass Umbreon is to use status, as a paralyzed one is much easier to break through for powerful attackers like Marowak and especially Machamp, whereas a poisoned one won't be able to stall out anything. Thus Umbreon will have no choice but to use Rest and try to stay healthy during the two turns it is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Rest or Toxic Immunity</strong>: Pokemon immune to Toxic or with Rest don't fear anything from Umbreon, although they can't necessarily do much in return. Nonetheless, the likes of Zapdos still have the upper hand against Umbreon, since they can simply force it to use Rest, trade PP with it, and potentially threaten it if their Thunder connects multiple times.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Charm": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Charm is one of the main reasons why Umbreon is so hard to break through. The purpose of this move is to stop Curse sweepers like Snorlax in their tracks. It can also be used to soften the blows of Explosion and other physical attacks from slower Pokemon like Exeggutor, Rhydon, and even Machampâ€”though in Machamp's case, Umbreon must beware of Cross Chop's high critical hit rate. Pursuit allows Umbreon to wear down Pokemon like Exeggutor, Gengar, and Misdreavus, none of which can hit it very hard without using Explosion, punishing them with hefty damage if they try to switch out. Rest is Umbreon's preferred recovery option, since it allows it to get rid of poison or paralysis, which both pose a severe threat to Umbreon and limit its effectiveness. Rest also notably enables Umbreon to check threats like Body Slam Snorlax more effectively. However, it puts Umbreon out of commission for two turns, making it more vulnerable to offensive pressure. Therefore, Sleep Talk is recommended so Umbreon keeps fulfilling its tasks when asleep. However, Toxic is also a great option to weaken the foe, force switches, and threaten non-Rest variants of Snorlax, Zapdos, and Tyranitar. In conjunction with Pursuit and Spikes support, Toxic can wear down opposing Pokemon quite quickly. Alongside Toxic, Umbreon's more flexible recovery option in Moonlight can be given consideration if Umbreon can avoid or be cured of status and the low amount of PP isn't problematic despite the fact that Umbreon is an entirely stall-based Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Outside of its defensive utility, the main reason to use Umbreon is its ability to reliably weaken any Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon with Pursuit, something greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Machamp or mono-attacking Snorlax. Umbreon is also a good option for Spikes-based teams,  since it's the only viable Pursuit user that fares well against what is arguably the best spinner available, Starmie. Even though Starmie takes fairly low damage from Umbreon's Pursuit and has plenty of Recover PP, constant residual damage from poison and the threat of Pursuit will eventually see it struggling to keep Spikes off the field. If Umbreon happens to pack Sleep Talk instead of Toxic, your Spikes setter should be able to inflict Starmie with poison so Umbreon can still heavily pressure it. Both Cloyster and Forretress can struggle against Gengar and Misdreavus, so once again Pursuit is a great help. However, keep in mind that Umbreon's Special Attack is so lackluster that Rest Misdreavus can stall it out. As Umbreon relies on Charm to handle boosting Snorlax, its worst nightmare is Belly Drum Snorlax. It is therefore a good idea to use it alongside Skarmory on more defensive teams, as Skarmory is much better suited to handling Belly Drum Snorlax, whereas Umbreon can stave off Snorlax variants that Skarmory struggles with, such as Fire move Curselax.</p>"
        },
        "Mean Look + Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With Mean Look and Baton Pass, Umbreon works as the bulkiest trap passer available. Charm remains very useful against physical attackers, and it pairs well with Mean Look to prevent the opposing Pokemon from escaping while its Attack stat keeps decreasing. Once you have used Mean Look and potentially Charm several times, use Baton Pass in order to bring in an appropriate counter to face the trapped Pokemon or a teammate that can safely set up on it and attempt to sweep. Confuse Ray is the best option Umbreon has against the omnipresent phazers that are the biggest thorn in this set's side and can be extremely frustrating for your opponent, especially when used in tandem with Mean Look. However, this strategy is unreliable since it's based on luck, and the odds of the opposing Pokemon hitting itself twice in a row may be too low to rely on. Rest remains Umbreon's preferred recovery move due to its ability to heal status ailments and to PP stall a trapped Pokemon. However, this variant isn't as stall based as the first, which means that Moonlight is still a solid option, especially when you can hardly afford to waste turns by allowing Umbreon to sleep with this set. Sand Attack is another option that can be spammed in order to lower the accuracy of the foe and is even more effective when used alongside Confuse Ray. It's also the best tool available in Umbreon's arsenal if it traps a special attacker. While Leftovers remains the preferred item option, Bright Powder can be considered to maximize your chances against opposing phazers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Umbreon can't reliably transfer Mean Look if there is at least one Pokemon able to phaze it on the opposing team, with the most common ones being Skarmory, Raikou, Suicune, Steelix, and Tyranitar. Thus, Pokemon that can lure them in like Lovely Kiss or all-out attacker Snorlax make good partners; keep in mind that the first three need to use Rest in order to heal themselves and that they will rarely carry both Sleep Talk and Roar on the same moveset. Forcing Skarmory, Raikou, or Suicune to use Rest is also a good way to prevent them from disturbing Umbreon. Sturdy sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Vaporeon make good teammates, since Umbreon can give them many opportunities to set up. Pokemon that naturally scare off most of the aforementioned phazers like Nidoking and Cloyster are good partners as well, as this Umbreon variant can also bring teammates in safely with a dry Baton Pass; the latter in particular can use them as an opportunity to set up Spikes. This strategy works especially well due to the huge threat of trap passing almost guaranteeing that the opponent will bring a phazer in when facing this Umbreon.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Slowking is a very well-rounded Pokemon with a solid typing, strong STAB attacks, and access to Thunder Wave. The reason Slowking isn't at the very top of GSC UU in terms of viability is that it competes with Slowbro, which is almost identical to Slowking, except Slowbro has higher Defense, whereas Slowking has higher Special Defense. Unfortunately for Slowking, Defense tends to be more valuable, meaning it can be hard to justify using it. However, Slowking does offer some perks against special attackers and notably Nidoqueen, the most commonly seen Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowking has access to a few other coverage attacks such as Zap Cannon, Fire Blast, and Ice Beam, which can be used to threaten Slowbro, Scyther, Pinsir, Jumpluff, and Bellossom, all of which may try to take advantage of Slowking. However, it is difficult to fit these alongside its existing moves without sacrificing other important coverage. Slowking also has access to Reflect, which can be used to shore up its Defense and support its teammates. Swagger can be used alongside Thunder Wave and dual STAB attacks to give Slowking a chance at getting past specially bulky foes, although this leaves it susceptible to status and without any recovery. A final gimmick is Belly Drum, which can be used with Earthquake, a STAB attack, and a Normal-type move alongside paralysis support to take advantage of the opponent responding to Slowking with their own Slowbro or Slowking. However, using this set leaves Slowking unable to perform its usual roles as effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Tanks and Bulky Water-types</strong>: Opposing Slowking, Hypno, Chansey, and Lanturn are specially bulky Pokemon that can either neutralize or beat Slowking as well as absorb status from Thunder Wave adequately. Chansey can threaten Slowking if it has Present, and Lanturn can beat it with STAB Thunder; however Thunder Wave is a bigger threat to them than the others because of Heal Bell's limited PP and the possible threat of a Moonlight Nidoqueen teammate paired with Slowking. Slowbro and Blastoise can also take Slowking's attacks well and don't mind status too much due to RestTalk, although Special Defense drops and critical hits threaten Blastoise, and the rare Zap Cannon may put them in a precarious position if it lands. If Slowbro or Slowking is being depended on for handling Slowking, the one carrying Thunder Wave will have the advantage in a PP war, despite full paralysis resulting in some PP being saved.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is a fantastic answer to Slowking with its powerful STAB Thunder and commonly uses RestTalk, which improves its ability to take Thunder Wave. Electabuzz and Magneton can threaten Slowking with STAB Thunder too, but they lack the defenses to take repeated hits, fear Thunder Wave, and need to be aware of Slowking's potential to trade hitsâ€”unlike Slowbro, Slowking can afford to take a Thunder and not be put out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom and Jumpluff make great checks to Slowking that lack Thunder Wave. Jumpluff depends heavily on its high Speed and therefore cannot risk taking Thunder Wave, but while Bellossom dislikes paralysis due to normally lacking Rest, it can shoulder the burden of paralysis for its team and still function reasonably well, especially in terms of pressuring Slowking. As Slowking sometimes drops Psychic for Thunder Wave, Victreebel and Vileplume can occasionally be used as checks, though they are significantly impaired by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Slowking's Defense is not as high as Slowbro's, so it fears hard-hitting physical attackers like Dodrio, Granbull, Scyther, and Pinsir. Unlike Slowbro, Slowking will typically lose to Granbull when switching in due to being 3HKOed by unboosted Return and 2HKOed by +1 Return. Slowking also particularly fears Hidden Power Bug variants of Scyther and Pinsir, which can deal massive amounts of damage boosted or unboosted.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Special Tank": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slowking can take on a significant portion of the metagame one-on-one with this set. While it doesn't take physical hits fantastically unlike its main competition, Slowbro, Slowking can somewhat make up for this with its ability to take powerful special attacks, such as Thunder from Mr. Mime and Haunter, and retaliate with debilitating paralysis. This increased ability to take risks with the opponent's special and mixed attackers makes Slowking less predictable than Slowbro and makes it more effective at using Thunder Wave against the dangerous special attackers in the tier. Slowking's STAB attacks provide excellent coverage; should Slowking use both Surf and Psychic, the only Pokemon that resist both attacks are Slowbro and Slowking. However, as Slowking often has Thunder Wave, it will often drop a STAB attack. RestTalk allows Slowking to remain healthy and threaten physical attackers that may be eager to come in and hit it on its weaker side while it is asleep. This combination also makes it one of the tier's best status absorbers. If Slowking reveals dual STAB attacks, it is more likely to see Scyther switching in on an anticipated Rest turn, since without Thunder Wave, the worst that can happen is taking a hit. If Slowking has Thunder Wave, Scyther is taking a much greater risk switching in, but Pokemon like Qwilfish will switch in if it lacks Psychic, and Ground- and Psychic-types like Sandslash and Girafarig become far more dangerous without Surf. Sleep Talk can be dropped to run both STAB attacks alongside Thunder Wave, but this decreases Slowking's flexibility and resilience.</p> <p>In addition to competing with Slowbro, Slowking also competes with Blastoise and Hypno. Blastoise lacks a resistance to Psychic and access to Thunder Wave but outspeeds Nidoqueen and Sandslash and has access to Rapid Spin and Roar. Hypno is almost equal to Slowking in terms of special bulk and has better utility options, but it is quite a bit worse off in terms of physical bulk as well as Special Attack, making it a much worse Nidoqueen check. However, its lack of a weakness to Electric makes it a better blanket check to special attackers. Slowking's decent physical bulk and high Special Attack mean it is somewhat capable of taking on physical threats like Granbull and Dodrio if it needs to, although Slowbro is far better suited to this, which arguably leaves Slowking in the awkward position of \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" Nevertheless, its solid utility alongside its excellent ability to switch into Nidoqueen safelyâ€”Slowking is not even consistently 3HKOed by Nidoqueen's Thunder, whereas there is a small chance of Slowbro getting 2HKOed after Spikesâ€”makes it a worthy consideration for one's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking's well-rounded abilities lend it to supporting more offensive and balanced teams as a kind of anchor that can help take on the behemoth tanks of the tier like Nidoqueen and Slowbro while punishing the opponent's attempts to go on the offensive with Thunder Wave. Therefore, it will often find itself on teams with offensive Pokemon like Scyther, Pinsir, Sandslash, and Kabutops. Nidoqueen and Piloswine are obvious choices for teammates owing to their immunity to Thunder from the likes of Ampharos and Magneton; they also offer the ability to take on Scyther reasonably well, with Nidoqueen being particularly well suited for taking on the Hidden Power Bug variants Slowking fears most. Haunter and Magneton also make good partners for Slowking due to their ability to take on mono-attacking Granbull. Qwilfish is a good choice for a teammate for its access to Spikes, ability to function as a check to Pinsir, and ability to threaten Bellossom with Sludge Bomb. Grass-types like Bellossom and Jumpluff can help to spread paralysis and sleep beyond the opponent's designated status absorber by forcing switches with Leech Seed and Encore, which can help to set up slower sweepers like Pinsir and Sandslash. Jumpluff also serves as a check to Scyther and Pinsir, which often try to set up against Slowking. Victreebel and Vileplume can also help to spread status with Slowking by forcing switches with Leech Seed or the threat of setting up with Swords Dance, although their weakness to Psychic can make it more difficult to find opportunities to do so. Lastly, Slowking can be used alongside other bulky Water-types such as Omastar, Slowbro, and Blastoise to offer redundant defensive coverage and take advantage of their resilience and power to outlast foes. This works because most Pokemon with powerful attacks that hit them super effectively can be checked fairly safely by Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Chansey, Hypno, Jumpluff, and Bellossom.</p>"

  "Misdreavus": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Misdreavus is the only pure Ghost-type available in GSC OU, which gives it an immediate niche. Its typing grants it a coveted Normal immunity, allowing it to pivot in on a predicted Explosion, as well as check most Snorlax variants and prevent Starmie from using Rapid Spin much more reliably than Gengar. Moreover, Misdreavus has many tricks up its sleeve thanks to its movepool. Its Perish trap set is one of the main reasons why so many teams pack a phazer, and such teams still have to worry about the Disruptor set, which can badly cripple them.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Misdreavus is frail and lacks significant firepower, which means it can be quickly overwhelmed by most offensive powerhouses without doing anything significant beforehand. It also needs to watch out for Pursuit and faces competition from Gengar, which is much more immediately threatening and is immune to Toxic, a move commonly used by Cloyster and Forretress, two Pokemon you typically want to check with your Ghost-type.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Perish Song is usable without Mean Look to back it up, as it allows Misdreavus to force any Curse variants of Snorlax out and can serve as a counter to Baton Pass strategies. Attract can be used over Confuse Ray, as there is no chance of the foe snapping out of it early, but you lose the ability to buy time against Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, and Pokemon with the same gender. Mean Look has its own merits on a non-Perish Song set, especially when moves uncharacteristic of a Mean Look set such as Toxic are revealed first. Once Misdreavus has trapped the foe, it can force it to stay on the field while suffering from residual damage or PP stall it. However, this set is stopped cold by phazers like Steelix once revealed and Mean Look takes up a valuable moveslot. Growl is another way to handle Curse sweepers like Snorlax, Machamp, and Heracross without having to worry about taking a boosted hit in return, although it doesn't have much merit otherwise. Sleep Talk can be considered if using Rest, but Misdreavus is strapped enough for moveslots as is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Due to the fear of losing a Pokemon to the Perish trap set, most initial switch-ins to Misdreavus are phazers, but there's always a slim chance that Misdreavus can manage to get a KO anyway via multiple turns of confusion damage and Protect stalling. Tyranitar and Steelix in particular really want to avoid Thief, since they rarely carry Rest, and Leftovers is their only form of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Pursuit users including Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom all threaten both variants of Misdreavus, especially the disruptor set, since it struggles to outpace the damage from Pursuit with Toxic and Thunder. The Perish trap set also has a hard time fleeing on the last turn of the countdown and will generally be heavily damaged, if not outright KOed, after taking a full-powered Pursuit. Toxic + Protect Misdreavus can typically stall long enough if the foe is simply using Pursuit over and over, but potentially taking a devastating Crunch can ruin this strategy. Houndoom is particularly problematic, as it outspeeds Misdreavus and usually has both Crunch and Pursuit. Tyranitar is also capable of running Crunch alongside Pursuit for Misdreavus, but it must drop another coverage move to do so.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users</strong>: Due to Misdreavus's lack of offensive presence, the disruptor variant faces a wall each time a RestTalk user shows up, as such foes don't mind status and only have to be wary about a well-timed Destiny Bond if they're slower; however, any sleeping Pokemon is very vulnerable to the Perish trap set.</p> <p><strong>Immediately Powerful Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Marowak, Rhydon, and Charcoal Moltres pose a unique threat to Perish Song Misdreavus, as they are so powerful that they can 2HKO it without any prior setup, meaning they can potentially switch in against a full-health Misdreavus as it uses Mean Look, not bother to phaze it, and still emerge the victor. If Misdreavus decides to attempt to use Perish Song anyway, it needs to rely on the 50% chance of Protect working twice in a row. The disruptor variant can threaten all of them with Toxic, Marowak with Thief, and Moltres with Thunder. Thunder Zapdos can also threaten a 2HKO on Misdreavus, but it is slightly more likely to come out the loser due to Thunder's poor accuracy and a closer damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Unless it has Rest, any kind of status is a major problem for Misdreavus and should be avoided whenever possible. A poisoned or burned Perish trap Misdreavus will be much more easily 2HKOed or Pursuit trapped, and a paralyzed Misdreavus is unable to KO foes with Destiny Bond and risks becoming fully paralyzed at inopportune moments.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Disruptor": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to use Misdreavus's typing and movepool to their full potential by making it a spinblocker, a check to mono-attacking and all-out attacking variants of Snorlax, and a general annoyance due to its myriad of moves with which to cripple the foe. Thunder is Misdreavus's main attack and hits Cloyster, Starmie, and Forretress hard, making it a much more reliable spinblocker as well as an occasional paralysis spreader. Toxic is Misdreavus's best way to hinder the foe by putting it on a timer, eventually forcing it to heal with Restâ€”if it even carries it. Moreover, it can be spammed more freely than Thief and Hypnosis throughout the match, since it is not hindered by having an item or by Sleep Clause. Toxic can also stack with the loss of Leftovers and gives Misdreavus some bite.</p> <p>Thief is great at opening a hole in the opponent's gameplan because, unlike status moves, it will permanently hinder RestTalk users like Zapdos and Raikou. It will also cripple just about any Pokemon that isn't a Thief user itself by stealing its Leftovers or power-boosting item like Thick Club in the case of Marowak. It's especially effective when used alongside Toxic, since it will wear down the foe even quicker. Just make sure Misdreavus isn't carrying any item when using it. Alternatively, Protect lets Misdreavus slowly regain its health with Leftovers and allows you to scout your opponent's moves while the foe's health keeps decreasing because of Toxic. This is especially effective against threats like Pursuit Tyranitar and Roar Raikou. Another option is Hypnosis, which can put unsuspecting Pokemon to sleep. This can be very rewarding, since RestTalk users are generally not initial switch-ins to Misdreavus due to the fear of being trapped. Keep in mind that the move's low accuracy can ruin the surprise factor, though. Confuse Ray is also very threatening for a poisoned foe to deal with, and confusion cripples just about any Pokemon, making Misdreavus potentially very annoying to deal with and to eliminate. In the last moveslot, Pain Split gives Misdreavus instant recovery and potentially another way to cut down the opposing Pokemon's HP, but it's unreliable and can be played around. Rest, on the other hand, cures Toxic that Misdreavus is likely to take when switching into Cloyster and Forretress, at the cost of putting it to sleep for two turns.</p> <p>There are also some alternative options available depending on what you need or want to do with Misdreavus. Psychic, which is sometimes used over Thunder, allows it to check Machamp andâ€”to a lesser extentâ€”Heracross more easily, as well as punishing Nidoking, which would switch into Misdreavus almost fearlessly otherwise. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, forgoes recovery options and tries to trick the opponent into giving up a key Pokemon of theirs for what appeared to be a free KO. It can also serve as an emergency button against threats like Belly Drum Snorlax and Vaporeon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Misdreavus fits extremely well on Spikes-focused teams alongside Cloyster or Forretress due to its ability to spinblock and to wear down the foe further with Thief and Toxic. These forms of residual damage are even more effective when exploited by a phazer like Skarmory, which fares well against Earthquake variants of Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax, as well as Raikou, which is also offensively threatening on its own. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon are suited to deal with hard hitters that give trouble to Misdreavus; Marowak can be handled by Skarmory and Zapdos can be handled by Raikou. Misdreavus itself is especially susceptible to Pursuit users like Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom. Thus, Pokemon that can take advantage of Pursuit users like Machamp, Heracross, and Vaporeon make for good teammates; the last two in particular are sometimes able to use the likes of Nidoking, as well as Steelix in the case of Vaporeon, as setup fodder, two Pokemon that Misdreavus may be unable to threaten significantly depending on its moveset. This Misdreavus variant has the potential to mess with just about any Pokemon, but it is lacking in ways to eliminate Rest users by itself. That's why packing a teammate that appreciates common Rest users being asleep like Belly Drum Snorlax or Tentacruel is a good idea. Finally, Misdreavus's effectiveness is hampered if it is poisoned, paralyzed, or asleep. Therefore, clerics like Miltank and Blissey are welcome, especially if Misdreavus lacks Rest.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set sees Misdreavus trading most of its disrupting and defensive capabilities as well as its reliability as a spinblocker for a more immediately threatening approach. Mean Look and Perish Song used in tandem will put the opposing Pokemon on an inescapable timer, unless said Pokemon happens to be a phazer or can eliminate Misdreavus quickly enough. Protect stalls out the opponent's attempts to get rid of Misdreavus or to phaze it while the countdown gets closer to zero. There are plenty of options for the last moveslot, but Confuse Ray is recommended, since it's Misdreavus's best bet against phazers and most hard hitters in general, although Thunder is still something to consider, since it invalidates Skarmory as an answer and allows Misdreavus to remain as an effective spinblocker. On the final turn of Perish Song, Misdreavus can choose to either switch out and give the opposing Pokemon one shot at your team or stay in and trade one-for-one once it has outlived its usefulness.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite the presence of Confuse Ray, phazers like Tyranitar, Steelix, Skarmory, Raikou, and Suicune remain answers to this set. Therefore, Pokemon that can cripple them like Lovely Kiss or all-out attacking variants of Snorlax make for good partners. In return, Misdreavus will most likely find opportunities against opposing Snorlax, Machamp, and Miltank, something that your own Snorlax will appreciate. Although its effectiveness as a spinblocker is significantly reduced if it lacks Thunder, Misdreavus can still exploit its Ghost typing if paired with Cloyster or Forretress. Paralysis in conjunction with Confuse Ray can further frustrate attempts to phaze Misdreavus, so teammates such as Raikou, Zapdos, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and Body Slam Snorlax can be useful for the paralysis they can inflict on various targets. Toxic users like Forretress, Skarmory, and Suicune are essential alongside Thunder variants, as being poisoned will force Roar Raikou to use Rest and give Misdreavus a crucial opportunity. Additionally, Misdreavus fears Pursuit users and status ailments, so Machamp, Heracross, Vaporeon, Miltank, and Blissey are effective teammates.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Pineco is the premier Spikes setter in GSC NU, a massively game changing asset that defines the ability to make progress and punish switches. While running Pineco may feel like playing 5 Pokemon against 6 at times, the advantage that Spikes brings is unparalleled and makes Pineco a Pokemon highly recommended for use on most teams, and this impact is typically lessened by the presence of Pineco on both sides.</p> <p>Pineco has the ability to compress Rapid Spin support into its own movepool. This should not be Pineco's priority in most matches compared to setting up Spikes, but is an option it can use if given a free turn. Explosion is a fantastic tool that lets Pineco apply pressure when given a free opportunity, prevent itself from being set up fodder to Substitute users like Dugtrio and Primeape, and threaten weakened Curse sweepers like Wigglytuff. Toxic is the go to 4th move on Pineco to put pressure on opposing Pineco and stop it from switching in and either forcing a mutually negative draw or an Explosion speed tie attempt, and also lets Pineco apply meaningful pressure to a range of switch-ins still like Xatu and Rapidash to force them to use Rest later. Reflect is an option to instead ease switch-ins against aforementioned Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Primeape without having to use Explosion. Hidden Powater Water is another option to make Pineco harder to spinblock for Graveler, although it will still be forced out in the short term and Pineco struggles to find more set up opportunities often.</p> <p>Pineco's item choice depends on its position in a team. Leftovers is the standard item to give it more longevity and lets it switch into Pokemon like Stantler slightly easier. Miracle Berry is a solid option in the lead slot, however, as it lets Pineco avoid being slept by lead Stantler and Persian carying Hypnosis, so that it can easily set up Spikes and threaten an Explosion. When not run in the lead slot, Pineco finds its opportunities to switch in typically against Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Stantler, and Wigglytuff, as well as the more uncommon passive Pokemon such as Porygon and Gloom. Pineco must be careful about getting too greedy with trying to Rapid Spin against Wigglytuff too if not paired with a counter such as Sudowoodo, however, as it will give it enough Curse boosts to easily negate Explosion, the same can happen when Pineco gets Paralysed trying to switch into Body Slam.</p> <p>Pineco is a near mandatory fit on all non-stall teams due to the influence Spikes have over GSC NU. Pineco intrinsically pairs best with offensive Pokemon that appreciate having their switch-ins worn down. Xatu and Fearow are a prime example of this, as their checks such as Chinchou, Octillery, Dewgong, and Weezing find it harder to reliably switch in constantly. Other Pokemon such as Fearow and Octillery also appreciate having checks such as Dewgong and Chinchou worn down more. Dugtrio also appreciates Spikes wearing down Octillery and Dewgong and can set up on Rapidash and Ninetales that try to take Pineco out. More defensively orientated offensive threats such as Dewgong, Rapidash, and Magnemite can still make full use of Spikes to become less easily answered by Pokemon such as Octillery and Dugtrio, and can find lots of opportunities to wear down these Pokemon with their ability to check POkemon such as Xatu. Graveler is a unique teammate that can pair very well with Pineco on specific teams, as it ensures that one team has an enormous advantage in the hazards matchup by removing Spikes on Graveler's side while ensuring Spikes on the other. This is a potent advantage but Graveler can force more specific team structures in the process by stacking weaknesses to Pokemon like Xatu and Octillery, but in return provides one of the best Fearow answers. Sweepers such as Stantler and Wigglytuff appreciate the Spikes support to better break through checks like Weezing and Octillery.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Forretress is one of two viable Pokemon in GSC Ubers that is able to set Spikes, with the other one being Cloyster. When compared to Cloyster, the benefits Forretress brings are primarily defensive in nature; being blessed with the Bug / Steel typing means it is immune to the status move Toxic and resists Normal-type attacks, so it can repeatedly afford to come in multiple times on the format's most centralizing threat, Snorlax, to set entry hazards and spin. This typing also gives it an excellent matchup against defensive Pokemon such as Celebi, taking minimal damage from its STAB moves and can use it as an opportunity to remove hazards or set them up. This defensive prowess comes at a large cost; Forretress is incredibly passive barring the few good matchups it has, and it is threatened by a myriad of Pokemon due to often having to use Spikes + Rapid Spin on the same moveset. Zapdos, Mewtwo, and Ho-Oh all threaten it, and even stray neutral hits from Pokemon like Skarmory and Tyranitar can rack up over time until it can no longer do its job. This means that it should not be used as aggressively as Cloyster, as every stray hit matters with Forretress, and careful positioning is required to ensure that Forretress can get the most use out of its function.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Another moveset that Forretress can run is Hidden Power Fire / Spikes / Defense Curl / Rest, letting it act as a physical wall while still being able to set Spikes and threaten opposing Forretress. Giga Drain might be tempting on some structures to hit Cloyster and Golem super effectively, but it holds poor coverage outside of that in the format hitting none of the Ubers super effectively. Finally, Protect is an option on some teams to allow Forretress to heal off the damage taken by Spikes and also allows it to scout foes' movesets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Forretress's special bulk is meager, and given its lack of reliable recovery, it will often take unrecoverable damage from the tier's litany of special attackers. Mewtwo, Zapdos, Jolteon, Vaporeon, and Raikou all scare Forretress out and can fire off strong special attacks as it switches out. In the case of Jolteon and Vaporeon, they can use this as an opportunity to set up Growth and then pass the boost to their teammates. The two Eeveelutions do however have to respect Forretress using Explosion to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh OHKOes Forretress with Flamethrower, while Forretress holds no chance of threatening Ho-Oh past poisoning it or using Explosion, and even then, a full-health Ho-Oh is favored to survive the detonation.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus and Gengar take minimal damage from most Forretress sets and can block Rapid Spin, and in Gengar's case, it's also immune to Forretress's Toxic. Hidden Power Ghost Forretress does however pose a challenge for them, 3HKOing both.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type coverage</strong>: Fire-type coverage from the likes of Mew, Mewtwo, Tyranitar, and Snorlax is immensely threatening; should Forretress not respect it, it will easily be OHKOed.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes ensures grounded targets such as Mewtwo and Snorlax are going to be taking constant damage switching in, which will ensure that opponents won't be able to switch their Pokemon in and out without risk. Toxic is the main way Forretress will deal damage in longer games, as statusing Pokemon like Golem and Cloyster that otherwise switch in freely on Forretress will hamper their longevity and can allow Forretress to keep Spikes on the field versus both. Rapid Spin is preferred on teams that are not able to fit a dedicated entry hazard remover such as Golem, Tentacruel, or Starmie and should only really be used on Pokemon that can't significantly damage Forretress such as Celebi. Forretress can opt to run Explosion to ensure that it deals immense damage after it has set down Spikes or flat out KO some threats like Vaporeon and Jolteon that otherwise switch in freely on it. Forretress has a handful of options when it comes to Hidden Power coverage; Hidden Power Fire is preferred to ensure lasting damage against opposing Forretress while also dealing damage to Pokemon such as Steelix, while Hidden Power Ghost means Ghost-type switch-ins like Gengar and Misdreavus are hit super effectively, which can allow Forretress to use Rapid Spin to clear away hazards. Finally, Hidden Power Bug can threaten a 2HKO on Celebi while still hitting Pokemon like Mew and Mewtwo super effectively on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress primarily shows up on team structures like balance and stall that require an entry hazard setter with longevity and a Toxic immunity. Barrier Mewtwo is a common partner with Forretress, being able to threaten opposing hazard setters with Flamethrower or Toxic while also walling physical sweepers such as Snorlax. Ho-Oh is a good partner to Forretress, checking threats like Mewtwo and Mew without Rock Slide while also being able to use Whirlwind to rack up large amounts of hazard chip damage throughout extended games. Tyranitar and Rhydon can be paired with Forretress, as they resist Fire-type moves and can begin setting up Curse boosts acting as phazing sweepers that make great use of the Spikes Forretress puts down. Forretress struggles dealing with strong Electric-type attacks coming off of the likes of Zapdos and Raikou, so pairing it with Celebi ends up covering this weakness, since Celebi can soak up their attacks and heal in front of them with Recover.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Forretress finds a secure spot on many OU teams due to its ability to viably compress Rapid Spin and Spikes support. It also has excellent physical bulk and a fantastic Steel / Bug defensive typing that gives it useful resistances to Psychic-, Ice-, and Normal-type moves and an immunity to Toxic, which allows it to switch in and set up Spikes and use Rapid Spin on passive Pokemon with Toxic like Umbreon and Skarmory. Its resistance to Normal-type moves also allows it to tank Explosion and Self-Destruct from the likes of Steelix and Snorlax, making it a good choice to attempt to take those moves aimed at key teammates after Forretress has set up Spikes. However, Forretress has the lowest Special Defense of any fully evolved Steel-type, meaning that it can often be overwhelmed by strong special attacks. Forretress also has a terrible 4x weakness to Fire, and its poor Special Defense and the popularity of Steel-types as a whole mean that it has a tendency to be lured in and KOed by Pokemon it would usually set up on, such as Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor and Fire Blast Snorlax. Finally, Forretress faces competition as a Spikes setter and Rapid Spin user from Cloyster, which is much faster, has a more threatening Explosion due to its higher Attack stat, and has STAB Surf, which allows it to offensively pressure all Explosion-resistant, physically defensive Pokemon, something that Forretress struggles to do with its pathetic Special Attack and bare offensive movepool. However, Forretress's lack of weaknesses outside of Fire means that it can choose to risk a strong neutral or resisted hit in exchange for setting up or removing Spikes against a wider pool of Pokemon, such as Nidoking and even Raikou and Zapdos. The strategy of wearing down Cloyster with Toxic that stall teams often use will also be ineffective against Forretress, making it a useful pick when trying to outlast them. Lastly, while Cloyster must drop a key move in Explosion in order to run Rapid Spin, Forretress is free to use both on the same set.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Bug is Forretress's best STAB move, which threatens Starmie just enough so that it is unable to reliably remove Spikes against Forretress and also does big damage against Exeggutor and Jynx. However, Hidden Power Bug isn't really good for much else, and Toxic with Pursuit or Ghost-type support can also do the job of beating Starmie. Running Hidden Power Bug over Forretress's other coverage options also prevents Forretress from being able to beat important Pokemon such as Cloyster, Gengar, and opposing Forretress. Reflect doubles Forretress's and its partners' Defense, letting certain setup sweepers have an easier time setting up. Protect allows Forretress to gain additional Leftovers recovery and scout for moves like Fire Blast. Sandstorm is an option that out-damages Leftovers and pairs very well with Toxic and Spikes. Unfortunately, all of these options are very difficult to fit on the standard set, and while Sandstorm is very useful for chip damage, it can also have the adverse effect of wearing down Forretress's teammates, so this is important to consider when building a team with it. Forretress can drop Rapid Spin to free up space for another move like Toxic or Explosion; however, this can mean having to bring an additional Rapid Spin user, and without Rapid Spin, Cloyster is usually better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus and Gengar are some of Forretress's hardest counters, since they take negligible damage from most of its attacks barring Hidden Power Ghost, are immune to Explosion, and are able to spinblock Forretress. Gengar is also notable in that it is immune to Toxic. Misdreavus can Perish trap Forretress to remove it, and Gengar can simply overwhelm Forretress with Thunder. However, it is harder for them to counter Forretress if it runs Hidden Power Ghost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves</strong>: Any Pokemon that carry Fire-type moves such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Nidoking instantly pose a massive threat to Forretress due to its 4x weakness to Fire. Snorlax notably misses the OHKO with Flamethrower but guarantees an OHKO with Fire Blast. Naturally, all Fire-type Pokemon also threaten to OHKO Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Power Fire Forretress</strong>: If Forretress isn't also running Hidden Power Fire and doesn't have a Ghost-type teammate for support, opposing Forretress can set up Spikes, remove Spikes from the opponent's side of the field, and 2HKO Forretress with Hidden Power Fire.</p>",

        "Spikes": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes plays an incredibly critical role in GSC, limiting the opponent's ability to switch freely and creating countless potential plays and win conditions where they would otherwise simply not exist. Rapid Spin removes Spikes on Forretress's side of the field to prevent the same situation from happening to it. Toxic wears down most Pokemon that come in on it and is good against Pokemon like Cloyster, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Snorlax. Although Forretress is slow, Explosion lets it be an emergency check to Belly Drum Snorlax thanks to its slightly higher Speed while also checking Vaporeon and Machamp and allowing it to possibly KO Zapdos and Raikou. Hidden Power Fire threatens to 2HKO opposing Forretress, potentially a game-winning advantage, and does decent damage to Skarmory and Steelix. Hidden Power Ghost prevents Forretress from being completely defenseless against Gengar and is a solid alternative to Toxic against Misdreavus. Giga Drain is an alternative that has a chance to 3HKO Cloyster, giving Forretress a chance of beating it one-on-one and creating mind games as to whether Forretress will use Giga Drain again or Rapid Spin, and it has a chance to 2HKO Golem.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress wants to keep Spikes set up against the enemy as much as possible, so Ghost-types such as Gengar and Misdreavus make for good partners by blocking enemy Rapid Spin users. Forretress hates Ghost-types itself, however, so Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom can take care of them to prevent the opponent from spinblocking. Forretress also appreciates Tyranitar's ability to take on Snorlax that have Fire-type moves and Umbreon's ability to better trap Starmie. Due to Forretress's 4x weakness to Fire, Pokemon that can take on Belly Drum Charizard and RestTalk Moltres, such as Suicune, are very valuable teammates. Forretress's passivity also means that it allows many scary special attackers, setup sweepers, and general threats such as Zapdos, Vaporeon, Tentacruel, Gengar, and Perish Trap Misdreavus to switch in, so Raikou often makes a good partner with its reliable ability to beat these threats at least once.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Steelix is an anomaly in that it's a primarily defensive Ground-type. It has incredible Defense and resists Normal-type attacks, letting it counter Snorlax, and its Steel / Ground typing gives it a crucial Electric immunity paired with neutrality to Ice-type attacks, thereby making it a safe switch-in to Electrics with Hidden Power. It's also one of the best go-to defensive phazers for responding to threats such as Perish trap Misdreavus and Baton Pass Jolteon. However, while Steelix surpasses other Ground-types defensively, it falls incredibly short of their offensive prowess with an Attack stat of 268. Still, Steelix is not totally inept. With Spikes down, it can use Roar to shuffle the opponent's Pokemon with the best of them, and it can set up Curses to pressure the opponent or even sweep in a late-game situation where all the Pokemon capable of hurting Steelix are KOed. It also gets Explosion to instantly take out a wall. Overall, Steelix is an excellent defensive pivot and emergency phazer that, while offensively handicapped compared to other Ground-types, can still threaten foes.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse could be foregone to allow both Body Slam and Explosion on the same set to maximize Steelix's potential for immediate offensive impact. With a set of Earthquake, Body Slam, Explosion, and Roar, Steelix can still Spikes shuffle and phaze out dangerous threats while both spreading paralysis and having Explosion for walls such as Suicune or Zapdos. However, Steelix is generally better suited to building pressure by setting up Curses. Iron Tail could be used as an alternative STAB that, by virtue of the lack of Pokemon immune to it, actually allows mono-attacking Steelix to sweep at +6. However, Steel is in general a terrible attacking type, and furthermore it is only 75% accurate and also incapable of forcing Raikou to switch out. Substitute can be paired with Curse and Roar to dodge Growl and Charm while setting up a sweep. Iron Tail is the ideal attacking move on such a set to ensure nothing can wall a +6 Steelix. Bind can be paired with Explosion to make sure Steelix takes out the appropriate target.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water-types are the chief counters that force Steelix to switch out while taking little damage in return from Steelix's Earthquake. Suicune, Vaporeon, Cloyster, and even Starmie are all excellent switch-ins to Steelix. Exeggutor is also a fine switch-in to Steelix that resists Earthquake while threatening to use Sleep Powder or whittle away its health with Psychic, Giga Drain, or Hidden Power Fire. Heracross, while not as common, can switch into Steelix, resists Earthquake, and can whittle away its health with Seismic Toss. Some more passive switch-ins to Steelix are Growl Miltank and Charm Umbreon, which shut Steelix down by negating the Attack boosts it gets from Curse. However, these counters cannot actually hurt Steelix, thereby allowing it to gain Leftovers recovery or switch out to a threatening special attacker, such as Zapdos, that does not mind taking a Growl or Charm on the switch.</p> <p>Steelix is also countered, to an extent, by Flying-types. Zapdos and Dragonite, especially if they use Hidden Power Water or Fire Blast, respectively, are great answers to Steelix. Their Flying typing, at the very least, forces Explosion Steelix to trade lives with them, although switching one of these Pokemon into a Rock Slide Steelix is a dicey proposition, especially if Steelix uses Curse on the switch-in to enable the Rock Slide 3HKO. Charizard is an unconventional Pokemon, but it is similar to Zapdos and Dragonite in that it at worst trades with Explosion Steelix while struggling to switch into Rock Slide Steelix. Charizard, however, can OHKO Steelix with STAB Fire Blast, so it fears switching into Rock Slide more than it fears switching into a Curse. Skarmory, too, is similar in that it forces Explosion Steelix to trade with it, while Rock Slide Steelix ultimately beats Skarmory if it is the only decent answer to Steelix left. However, Steelix must hit Skarmory on the switch with Rock Slide, as it must use Roar against an active Skarmory to avoid being phazed and losing its boosts. Thus, if Skarmory is paired with another Pokemon that can easily tank Rock Slides, Skarmory can attempt to stall Steelix out of PP. This is made even easier if Skarmory is using the uncommon Sand Attack set.</p> <p>Certain physical threats can also come in to capitalize off of Steelix's weaknesses. Marowak can handily 2HKO with Earthquake, although its Earthquake is downgraded to a 3HKO if Steelix has a Curse set up, so Marowak cannot switch into an active Steelix and instead must switch in as Steelix switches in. Machamp is similar, except its unboosted Cross Chop only 3HKOes, although the high critical hit ratio means that Cross Chop can potentially OHKO Steelix. Again, though, a Steelix that has set up Curse can tank these hits (unboosted Cross Chop from Machamp only does 30-35% to Steelix after a Curse), so Machamp must switch in as Steelix switches in, rather than switching into an active Steelix. Of course, these Pokemon and several others could also be using Fire Blast to roast Steelix for at least a 3HKO on the special side, meaning that even if they are brought in by Roar against a Steelix with several Curses, they could stay in despite the Defense boosts and still do heavy damage. Even Pokemon that Steelix normally counters, such as Snorlax, can easily turn the tables on Steelix with Fire Blast.</p>",

        "Curse + Roar": {
          "description": "<p>Unlike other Ground-types, Steelix plays more as a defensive pivot than an offensive powerhouse thanks to its combination of great defensive typing and woefully mediocre Attack. STAB Earthquake is, aside from the Electric immunity, one of the biggest perks to being a Ground-type, so it's a must on Steelix to allow it to threaten relevant damage against foes. Curse is also required, as it allows Steelix to bolster its Attack to levels at which neutral Earthquakes actually threaten significant damage. Curse is the main way Steelix manages to create offensive pressure, especially in conjunction with Roar. Roar allows Steelix to prevent itself from being phazed by Pokemon such as Skarmory while it is setting up Curses, and furthermore can be used to shuffle the opponent's team to either scout or accumulate Spikes damage. Roar is also fantastic defensively, as Steelix is capable of countering several threats such as Curse Snorlax, Perish trap Misdreavus, and Baton Pass Jolteon, Espeon, and Umbreon.</p> <p>The last move depends on what you want out of Steelix. Explosion allows Steelix to break walls instead of simply applying offensive pressure. After a Curse, a full-health Steelix can survive Suicune's Surf and guarantee an OHKO in return with Explosion. Other threats, such as Zapdos and Miltank, are guaranteed to fall to a +1 Explosion, and Zapdos in particular is likely to be OHKOed and takes at least 93% damage from an unboosted Explosion. Explosion can also come in handy against Snorlax, even Fire Blast variants that Steelix otherwise struggles to beat. An unboosted Explosion does 80-94% to Snorlax, so you will need a little bit of residual damage to make this into an OHKO. Skarmory can also be KOed by Explosion if Steelix is able to set up enough Curses beforehand--at least 4 Curses are needed to guarantee an OHKO against an unboosted Skarmory, whereas 6 are needed to have a roughly 70% chance of OHKOing a +1 Skarmory. On the other hand, Rock Slide is a more conservative option that allows Steelix to 3HKO Zapdos after a Curse without needing to Explode. Furthermore, Rock Slide allows Steelix to sweep late-game when none of the opposing Pokemon can hurt it, even if the opponent has an Earthquake-immune Zapdos or Skarmory. Rock Slide can also severely punish Charizard switch-ins without the risk involved with Explosion. However, it's important to note that outside of trying to catch Charizard, Rock Slide is useless without Curses behind it, as it fails to even 3HKO Zapdos without a boost. Finally, Body Slam is an option for Steelix's last moveslot. Body Slam does not threaten to outright KO a wall the way Explosion can, and since it only does 24-28% to Skarmory when Steelix is at +6 Attack, it does not allow Steelix to sweep, either. However, Body Slam allows Steelix to spread paralysis, thereby allowing it to support its team much more effectively than it would have been able to otherwise.</p> <p>Steelix is best used on offensive teams as a defensive pivot to switch into Snorlax and Electric-types. It's immune to Thunder and takes only neutral damage from Ice moves, giving it \"perfect\" defensive coverage against the vaunted BoltBeam coverage touted by Zapdos, Raikou, and Gengar. Its high Defense and Steel typing allow it to tank Snorlax Double-Edges better than any other non-Ghost-type Pokemon, and furthermore its Defense is high enough to take merely 27-31% from Snorlax's unboosted Earthquake. These are the match-ups that make Steelix great, so it's best to use Steelix to either attempt to mount pressure against an opposing Snorlax or to chain-switch around Hidden Power Zapdos to get your own Snorlax or Tyranitar in on an innocuous Hidden Power instead of a powerful Thunder. However, always be wary of Fire Blast on Snorlax and Hidden Power Water on Zapdos or Raikou, as these can ruin Steelix's strong match-up against these foes. The possibility of these moves is part of what makes Explosion the standard fourth move over Rock Slide; at least with Explosion you can salvage the situation when unable to sweep against a non-standard Snorlax or Zapdos set and take something down with Steelix.</p> <p>Steelix tends to work best with Spikes support so it can use Roar to accumulate damage against the opposing team. Typically, Cloyster is the Spiker of choice to pair with Steelix. Defensively, Steelix synergizes well with Exeggutor, which can switch in against and torment Raikou and Zapdos that opt for Hidden Power Water over Hidden Power Ice. Misdreavus is also a good partner since it can handle Fire Blast Snorlax while spinblocking to keep Spikes down for Steelix. As for offensive support to pair with Steelix, this depends on whether Steelix is running Explosion, Body Slam, or Rock Slide. Steelix with Explosion helps break walls for the team, so Pokemon that struggle with its common Explosion targets are good teammates. Vaporeon, Machamp, and Charizard are a few teammates that appreciate Explosion Steelix's ability to take Suicune and Zapdos out of the game. If Steelix runs Body Slam, it isn't breaking walls but rather afflicting them with status to allow other attackers to beat them. Nidoking and Marowak are absolutely thrilled by Steelix's ability to paralyze Zapdos and Suicune for them, whereas Belly Drum Snorlax and Machamp can capitalize off of Steelix's ability to paralyze Skarmory. However, if Steelix uses Rock Slide, it aims to be a more effective Spikes shuffler by threatening damage against Zapdos, while also looking for a potential late-game sweep. Thus, Steelix will need to receive support rather than supply it. Steelix's common counters include Suicune and Growl Miltank, so teammates that can KO or paralyze these threats so Steelix can sweep will help it immensely. In particular, mixed Snorlax with Self-Destruct or Body Slam can threaten to KO or paralyze Miltank and Suicune.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Scizor seems good at a first glance. It has a strong defensive typing that gives it only one weakness to Fire, one of the highest Attack stats in OU, decent bulk, and boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility that could make it a strong Pokemon for Baton Pass teams; however, in practice, Scizor is rather underwhelming. While passing Speed and Attack boosts can be scary for unprepared teams, it often struggles to pull that off effectively due to its poor matchup against the tier's most popular phazers, Steelix and Skarmory, both of which are able to easily tank any hit from Scizor and either force a switch or phaze it. Due to this, it usually can't come out until a partner such as Smeargle, Jolteon, or Snorlax has disarmed the phazers by putting them to sleep or doing serious damage. Additionally, Scizor has to constantly watch out for Fire-type attacks that many common Pokemon run, such as Snorlax and Tyranitar.</p> <p>However, Scizor does have a unique niche on Baton Pass teams that still might make it worth using. It has decent bulk and a Bug / Steel typing that not only grants Scizor an immunity to Poison and useful Psychic- and Ice-type resistances, but also gives it a strong resistance to Explosion and Self-Destruct, which makes it more difficult for offensive teams to prevent it from passing stat boosts. Scizor also has a strong matchup against Exeggutor, which can be a crucial Pokemon to take down due to its ability to threaten Baton Pass teams. Scizor is also able to hit Raikou hard, which very few other Baton Pass users on Baton Pass teams can do.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scizor has access to Light Screen, which can benefit its team by halving the damage of special attacks and assisting in passing boosts to teammates, and it also helps Scizor take some special attackers head on. However, Light Screen cannot reliably fit on Baton Pass sets due to Scizor needing all four slots for other moves. Counter can be used to possibly OHKO Pokemon like Snorlax and Heracross; Earthquake + Normal-type move + Belly Drum Snorlax notably cannot take out Scizor without a critical hit. However, Counter is incompatible with Baton Pass and can make Scizor setup fodder for sweepers if you predict incorrectly. Scizor can attempt to use a Swords Dance sweeper set with Swords Dance, Hidden Power Fighting, Steel Wing, and Return, but due to lack of a strong STAB move and low Speed, other candidates for the physical sweeper role such as Heracross and Marowak tend to make for better choices. Thief can be run over Agility on non-Baton Pass teams to take items from Pokemon like Skarmory and Steelix, which can make whittling them down much easier. However, this gets rid of Scizor's ability to pass Speed onto its teammates, so its effectiveness is lowered.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is Scizor's hardest counter, as Scizor is unable to do any significant damage to Skarmory even with a +2 Hidden Power Fighting and gets phazed out without any effort.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Any Pokemon that carries Fire-type attacks such as Nidoking, Snorlax, and Machamp are huge threats to Scizor, preventing it from doing its work as a Baton Passer by KOing it easily due to its poor special bulk and 4x weakness to Fire-type Moves.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists both Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Fighting and is able to 2HKO it with Thunder; however, it cannot prevent Scizor from passing boosts unless it has Roar or Thunder paralyzes it.</p> <p><strong>Suicune</strong>: While Suicune doesn't resist Scizor's attacks, its Defense causes Scizor to be unable to threaten it even after a boost, and Suicune can easily phaze Scizor or hit it hard with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Steelix</strong>: Steelix can safely phaze Hidden Power Bug variants multiple times and Hidden Power Fighting variants once or twice. It can also set up a Curse boost and threaten heavy damage with Earthquake.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the standard set for Scizor, which attempts to make use of Swords Dance, Agility, and Baton Pass to support its team through important stat boosts. Hidden Power Bug is the best STAB move option, as it does high damage to Raikou at +2, hits Tyranitar hard, OHKOes Exeggutor, and hits Suicune and Snorlax for reasonable damage at +2. Hidden Power Fighting is also an option to hit Steelix super effectively and threatens to OHKO Tyranitar, though this sacrifices a good matchup against Exeggutor. Leftovers gives Scizor useful passive recovery that might allow it to stay in for a bit longer, but Miracle Berry can be run instead to prevent paralysis or sleep, which would otherwise prevent it from reliably passing boosts to teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Baton Pass staples such as Smeargle and Jolteon are mandatory teammates, as they can threaten or incapacitate most phazers. In return, Scizor can do serious damage to Raikou, which can be a pain for Baton Pass teams due to Roar and its high Special Attack. Scizor's most common Baton Pass recipients are Marowak, Machamp, and Snorlax, all of which greatly benefit from a Speed boost, Attack boost, or both.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "uu": {"sets": {"Defensive": {}}},
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Shuckle is a Pokemon of extremes. Its ridiculously high Defense and Special Defense stats are coupled with other stats that are ridiculously low, which makes it extremely difficult for it to inflict meaningful damage through conventional means. Shuckle's resistance to Normal in combination with its lack of weaknesses to common types, such as Electric, Ground, and Fire, makes it one of the most reliable Snorlax checks in the game. It is unique in that it has high Special Defense alongside its resistance to Normal, meaning it can wall many common Explosion users, such as Gengar and Exeggutor. Its downfalls are its bare movepool and awful attacking stats, which limit its options to spreading poison with Toxic and PP stalling and make it one of the most passive Pokemon in the game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shuckle can use Rollout with Curse to attempt to sweep the opposing team, but this requires anything that can potentially KO it quickly, phaze it, poison it, or reduce its Attack to be dealt with beforehand and substantially decreases its effectiveness as a defensive wall. Sleep Talk can be used to increase Shuckle's capacity to absorb sleep as well as improve its ability to take on powerful threats that come close to 3HKOing it, although this comes at the expense of a moveslot. Sandstorm can be used to complement Toxic and wear down foes very quickly, although it may also wear down some of Shuckle's teammates. Lastly, Shuckle has the option of running Hidden Power Fire to put pressure on Forretress, which is one of the Pokemon that can take the most advantage of Shuckle by setting and removing Spikes. However, DV requirements mean that Shuckle's already low HP gets reduced even further when using it, and it takes up a valuable moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Forretress</strong>: Forretress is immune to Shuckle's Toxic and can lay down Spikes, which can then be used to pressure Shuckle and its teammates without having to use PP. Forretress can also spin away any Spikes that Shuckle's teammates may have put down.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: As Shuckle is often paired with other passive Pokemon like Skarmory and Blissey, Vaporeon can be extremely dangerous, especially if it is a RestTalk or Baton Pass variant with Growth. Shuckle can poison Vaporeon with Toxic on the switch, but Vaporeon is likely to be able to find an opening due to Shuckle having to PP stall other foes and often has Rest to cure itself in the event it gets caught on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Swords Dance Tentacruel is one of the biggest threats to teams with Shuckle due to their passivity and tendency to rely on Toxic to keep dangerous sweepers from switching in. Shuckle can do nothing to threaten Tentacruel, meaning it can come in at any time to set up and threaten Shuckle and its teammates. This weakness is also compounded by the fact that many of the Pokemon Shuckle pairs well with, such as Skarmory and Blissey, struggle against Tentacruelâ€”there is generally at most only a single reliable counter to Tentacruel on these passive teams, which also makes them a target for Explosion users that Tentacruel is commonly paired with, like Cloyster and Steelix.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Steelix</strong>: Skarmory and Steelix are both immune to Toxic and can use Curse with a phazing move to prevent Shuckle from walling them with its Defense boosts. However, they can do little to stop it from lowering their accuracy with Flash, so they can sometimes find it difficult to exert pressure despite this advantage.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Suicune, Zapdos, and Raikou</strong>: These Pokemon don't care much about Toxic due to having RestTalk and can threaten Shuckle with their STAB attacks to force it out. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they will be able to create momentum if they are walled by other members of Shuckle's team, unless Spikes are up. Furthermore, being forced to use Rest can result in opportunities for dangerous sweepers that Shuckle may be paired with, such as Belly Drum Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is not immune to Toxic, but its access to Spikes, STAB Surf, and Explosion makes it a dangerous foe for Shuckle and its teammates. Cloyster can take advantage of its threat level against Shuckle to land Explosion on an important target such as Starmie, which may be the only thing preventing Pokemon like Machamp, Charizard, and Tentacruel from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Belly Drum users such as Charizard, Snorlax, and Quagsire can take advantage of Shuckle's downtime after using Rest to set up a sweep. Belly Drum Snorlax is particularly notable because Shuckle will often switch into it expecting a Curse or Self-Destruct variant but will usually lose to Belly Drum Snorlax unless it lacks Earthquake. Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and Heracross can similarly take advantage of a sleeping Shuckle to set up Attack boosts; Heracross and Machamp notably still outspeed Shuckle after a Speed drop from Curse.</p> <p><strong>Seismic Toss</strong>: Seismic Toss 3HKOes Shuckle, so Pokemon such as Heracross and Miltank can potentially use it to threaten both Shuckle and its common partner Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar and Rhydon</strong>: Pokemon with STAB Rock Slide such as Tyranitar and Rhydon can threaten Shuckle, although they often lack Rest, so they are fearful of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Nidoking and Gengar</strong>: Nidoking and Gengar are prone to being PP stalled by Shuckle because boosting moves are unviable on them, but they are immune to Toxic and can therefore attempt to beat Shuckle by freezing it, landing a well-timed critical hit, stealing its Leftovers with Thief, or putting it to sleep when it's at low health. Their immunity to Toxic also makes it much easier to press a Spikes advantage or create situations where the Shuckle user must take risks or use up PP in exchange for no gain, and in the absence of Spikes, they are able to use Shuckle to regain health with Leftovers.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "PP Stall": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Shuckle cannot hope to get past any foes by attacking them, so its role is to waste PP and wall a variety of threats. Defense Curl has a massive PP count, which ensures that Shuckle cannot be outdone in terms of PP. Without the ability to boost its Defense, Shuckle would eventually succumb to Curse Snorlax, so Defense Curl is crucial to allow Shuckle to perform its role effectively. Toxic is Shuckle's only damage source and can be used to restrict the number of Pokemon that can switch into it safely to those that are immune to it or have Rest, force Pokemon that have Rest to use it, and punish any Pokemon without Rest that risk staying in against it. As it is a powerful dissuasion tool with limited PP, it is sometimes a good idea to use it sparinglyâ€”although, catching dangerous sweepers on the switch can yield significant advantages. Alternatively, Encore can be used to attempt to waste the PP of a particular move or lock the opposing Pokemon into a move, which allows Shuckle's teammates to switch in freely. However, Toxic tends to be preferred because it gives Shuckle a way to punish threatening Pokemon like Cloyster, Machamp, and Tyranitar. Unlike Curse Skarmory, which is at no risk of being defeated by a critical hit from an opposing Curse Snorlax, Shuckle's inability to boost its Defense past +2 and its low base HP mean that it will, on average, be KOed by a critical hit Double-Edge or Earthquake plus two non-critical hits from a +5 Attack Snorlax. Shuckle therefore has Flash to minimize the odds of this situation occurring. Flash is also useful against other setup sweepers such as Steelix, and it contributes to Shuckle's overall goal of ensuring the opponent cannot mount offensive pressure by reducing the threat level of any foe it hits. Wrap is an alternative that forces foes to waste more PP by preventing them from switching out, which can also work well with Encore to attempt to force the opponent to use up more of a particular move. However, forgoing Flash can result in situations where Shuckle is unable to do its job of walling Snorlax effectively. Finally, Rest ensures that Shuckle cannot be worn down by repeated attacks by allowing it to keep itself healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shuckle is extremely passive, so it fits best on teams with reliable and sturdy Pokemon such as Skarmory and Blissey. Shuckle is one of the best Pokemon in the game at taking on all manner of mixed, Curse, and Self-Destruct variants of Snorlax, but it struggles against Belly Drum Snorlax due to being outsped by it. It is therefore a good idea to use Skarmory as a check to Belly Drum Snorlax as well as other threats such as Heracross, Machamp, and Marowak, which Shuckle can struggle against. Shuckle can easily be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Growth Vaporeon, so it is a good idea to bring a reliable answer to it such as Zapdos, Roar Suicune, Light Screen Starmie, or Light Screen Blissey. However, it must be noted that Shuckle will be extremely vulnerable to special attacks while Light Screen is active because its Special Defense is so high that Light Screen makes it exceed the stat cap and roll over to a much lower number. Other powerful special attackers like Zapdos also pose a significant threat to Shuckle, especially if Spikes are up. Pokemon such as Blissey, Snorlax, Raikou, and Quagsire make for solid options for taking on Zapdos, and Blissey can also potentially offer Heal Bell support. Due to Shuckle inviting Forretress in, it can be a good idea to pair it with a spinblocker if Shuckle is supported by Spikes and a spinner to prevent Shuckle from being worn down in the long run. Starmie, Golem, and Forretress are common spinners; Starmie is also good against Cloyster and Machamp, Golem boasts a decent Tyranitar matchup and can easily beat both spinblockers, and Forretress has access to Spikes.</p> <p>Due to Shuckle's passivity, it requires its teammates to be capable of exerting offensive pressure in order to have a chance at winning. This pressure can come from Spikes and Toxic, Belly Drum users and powerful physical attackers like Machamp and Marowak, Growth sweepers like Jolteon, and even teams designed to take advantage of Struggle's infinite PP to create offensive pressure. Shuckle can be used on more offensive teams, but doing so introduces significant risk due to there being dangerous Pokemon that can take advantage of its presence, such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Shuckle is by far the bulkiest Pokemon available in GSC NU and offers its team a crucial resistance to Normal. Its amazing defenses allow it to act as an answer to virtually any Pokemon that can't boost or hit it super effectively, including major threats like Xatu, Fearow, Weezing, and Stantler. With Defense Curl-boosted Rollout, it can also pose a legitimate threat despite its abysmal Attack. As Rollout locks Shuckle in and prevents it from switching out, it is important to make sure that foes are unable to take it down with STAB Water attacks, so Toxic can be used to force a situation where the foe will need to use Rest or switch out, which can allow Shuckle the opportunity to get rolling. Defense Curl is chosen over Curse because of its high PP count, which allows Shuckle to reliably PP stall Normal-type foes without having to lock itself into Rollout.</p> <p>One should not bring in Shuckle expecting to be able to immediately sweep, however. Almost all teams have significant threats to it, and in the absence of a measure to eliminate them, Water-types such as Octillery and Dewgong with Rest will be a major long-term pain for Shuckle. Indeed, in some circumstances, Shuckle should expect never to be able to sweep. Nevertheless, Shuckle is exceptionally good at taking attacks for the purpose of PP stalling. To allow it to do this for as long as possible, having a spinner is very helpful, and Spikes will also help Shuckle's team by preventing foes from simply switching to conserve PP. Therefore, Pineco is an excellent partner, and it can even use Explosion to remove Water-types. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo, Graveler, and Pupitar pose a threat to Shuckle with their STAB Rock attacks, especially if they have Curse to boost their Attack. Additionally, Fire-types with Sunny Day or Growth, such as Magmar and Flareon, can boost the power of Fire Blast to a level that can 3HKO Shuckle. To address these threats, it is crucial to pair Shuckle with a Water-type; some examples of good choices include Octillery, Azumarill, and Chinchou. When paired with Reflect and Light Screen users such as Pineco and Azumarill, it should be noted that a Shuckle with maximum defensive stats will have its defenses roll over behind screens, leaving it incredibly vulnerable. Ninetales is useful as a teammate for dealing with Fire-types, and it can also deal with powerful special attackers such as Xatu and Magnemite decently if Shuckle is not in a position to do so. Fighting-types with Meditate such as Primeape and Hitmonlee threaten Shuckle if they catch it at a lower health point without Defense boosts. Pokemon that resist Fighting, such as Xatu, Gloom, Exeggcute, Weezing, and Arbok, make for useful partners to deal with these threats.</p>"

Rest and Sleep Talk allow Shuckle to continue to dissuade foes from setting up or taking advantage of it, with minimal downtime.</p> <p>Water-types such as Octillery and Chinchou are crucial teammates for Shuckle, as they can handle the majority of foes that threaten it, including Octillery, Sudowoodo, and Sunny Day Magmar.

      "overview": "<p>Heracross's decent Special Defense and high Attack let it take quite a few special hits and fire back hard physically. Furthermore, its key resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks allow it to check Pokemon like Nidoking, Golem, Steelix, and Machamp; when it's healthy, it can safely switch in and check an unboosted Marowak that lacks the uncommon Hidden Power Flying. On top of its high Attack and Special Defense, its Speed is quite good. This allows Heracross to outspeed Exeggutor, Tyranitar, and Umbreon, which all get maimed by Megahorn.</p> <p>However, Heracross's only prominent STAB move, Megahorn, is resisted by very common types like Flying and Steel. This means that Pokemon like a healthy Zapdos, Skarmory, and Steelix can reliably pivot in and cause trouble for the Hercules beetle, with the threats of Thunder from Zapdos, Drill Peck or Whirlwind from Skarmory, and Roar or Explosion from Steelix, among some more niche moves from these Pokemon. Overall, Heracross can be very effective at shutting down difficult threats throughout the game, but patience must be exhibited when using it, as it needs to wait for some Pokemon that may very well be long-lasting to get KOed or weakened before it can try to clean.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake provides really good coverage for Pokemon like Gengar, Nidoking, and Raikou, which otherwise might stay in to deal chip damage, but since it does nothing to combat Zapdos and Skarmory, moves like Curse and Seismic Toss are usually better.</p> <p>Heracross can opt for a set utilizing Curse, Megahorn, Earthquake, and Hidden Power Rock if you want to exchange staying power for offensive pressure. This set works like Curse Machamp but with better special bulk and key resistances; however, compared to Machamp, it has a worse STAB move, and it's still walled by Skarmory.</p> <p>An Endure + Reversal set is marginally viable, as Reversal can 2HKO Skarmory, but it is difficult to pull off, as its biggest issue is simply that it's difficult to get the opponent to attack and lower Heracross's HP down to 1%. One of Heracross's selling points is its ability to shrug off status via its longevity and Rest, but this variant of Heracross will despise status. Also, if Spikes are in play, itâ€™s only a one-time use, so Rapid Spin support is mandatory with this set. Starmie fits the role well here, as it can potentially remove Gengar with Psychic or slow down faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Counter can be used to bait and take out Snorlax and Machamp, and with Curse it can remove Skarmory, but the RestTalk Curse set is more consistent against Snorlax, and it tends to be more effective for other teammates to remove Skarmory to support Heracross's potential end-game sweep. Counter can also potentially be used against Marowak, but this is far more situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Skarmory and Zapdos are the most reliable Heracross checks. Skarmory is more effective at stopping Curse Heracross, since it always wins the one-on-one matchup, while Zapdos is more effective at stopping Seismic Toss variants because they can't 4HKO it; however, both are very good versus either version. The rarer Reflect Zapdos can shut down Curse variants even more consistently while still doing excellently versus the Seismic Toss variant. Charizard, Moltres, and Dragonite, though far less prominent, are safe switch-ins against Heracross, bar less viable Hidden Power Rock sets. However, Dragonite must have super effective moves like Hidden Power Flying and Fire Blast, or Heracross will chip it down.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar is immune to Seismic Toss, takes negligible damage from Megahorn, and can threaten Heracross with Explosion, Destiny Bond, Ice Punch freezes, or Fire Punch; however, it must watch out for Earthquake if it doesn't want to trade, and Curse sets can mitigate the danger of Explosion while somewhat avoiding Destiny Bond mind games. Misdreavus can force Heracross out with the threat of Perish trap or maybe even engage in Destiny Bond mind games, but it only functions as a soft check at most, since Megahorn still stings and can land a 3HKO with just a little bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Other Bug-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Steelix can boost alongside Heracross with Curse and phaze it with Roar or even trade with Explosion, but it does not make for an effective Seismic Toss Heracross counter. Nidoking could potentially turn the tides around with a surprise Flamethrower or Fire Blast, but Heracross can still heal itself by using Rest, and Nidoking almost never has an active form of recovery, so it wants to avoid taking chip damage. Similarly, Heracross also has to watch out for Fire Blast from Muk, which also resists Megahorn and has reasonably decent natural bulk. Machamp can also pack Fire Blast, but it's more uncommon; furthermore, Hidden Power Flying is an option on Machamp to hit both Heracross and Exeggutor with super effective damage. Entei, although a very niche pick, can switch in with ease, set up Sunny Day, and destroy Heracross with its Fire Blast. Heracross can check itself, but you should try to manage its PP well in case you later on decide to engage in a PP war. Seismic Toss Heracross will naturally lose in the long run to RestTalk + Curse Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Miltank</strong>: Miltank can switch in safely enough and lower Heracross's Attack with Growl as well as drain Curse's PP while healing up with Milk Drink, but it can't really threaten RestTalk Heracross.</p>",

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Heracross has quite the shallow movepool but a decent combination of bulk and typing, which makes RestTalk the perfect strategy for it. Megahorn will heavily dent anything that doesn't resist it. Combining these attributes, Heracross can have decent matchups against Pokemon like Raikou and Suicune. Raikou sustains massive damage from Megahorn, and Heracross also outdamages Suicune while not minding Toxic too much thanks to Rest, making it a very reliable Suicune pivot and enabling it to force Suicune out often.</p> <p>For the last moveslot, Curse and Seismic Toss are the two best choices. Curse can make Heracross an extremely effective late-game sweeper after checks like Skarmory, Steelix, and Zapdos have been removed from the battle. In more desperate situations, with timely Thunder misses from Zapdos, Heracross may actually be able to edge it out in the one-on-one scenario, but this is unlikely and extremely risky. Curse can also allow Heracross to match up decently versus Snorlax sometimes, as Megahorn does quite a lot of damage, and even after a Curse, Heracross still outspeeds Snorlax.</p> <p>Seismic Toss is more of a conservative and defensive choice, which gives Heracross more consistent damage output against Pokemon like Machamp, Steelix, and even Nidoking, which all resist Megahorn. Seismic Toss does a great job at chipping Skarmory when it enters into Heracross, and if Skarmory uses Rest and is forced out without burning any sleep turns, it can no longer safely switch into Heracross because it gets outsped and 4HKOed by Seismic Toss. Otherwise, Heracross will most likely have to switch out after hitting a healthy Skarmory with a Seismic Toss. Also, Seismic Toss gives Forretress more trouble, especially since it's a Pokemon that usually has no recovery other than Leftovers. However, without Curse, Heracross will not be as potent of an end-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Unfortunately, most Pokemon that resist Megahorn like Zapdos and Skarmory are quite common and shut Heracross down quite easily, so getting rid of its common checks is crucial for it to shine. This means that Heracross really appreciates lures for these Pokemon. Using a Self-Destruct Curse Snorlax with Heracross is a great way to lure in and KO opposing Skarmory. Exeggutor can often cripple and even remove Zapdos with Explosion; it can also use Hidden Power Fire to pressure Skarmory and cripple it with a status move. Tyranitar is a great teammate for being an essential Normal-type switch-in and a Pursuit trapper that can assist in taking down meddling Ghost-types like Gengar; it can even take advantage of Skarmory's fear of Fire Blast to chip it with Pursuit, bringing it closer to the range Seismic Toss Heracross can KO it from. An additional sleep absorber like Sleep Talk Raikou or Sleep Talk Snorlax can pair decently well with Heracross to help against both Zapdos and Jynx. In Raikou's case, Heracross can absorb sleep from Nidoking and Snorlax, while Raikou covers Jynx and Exeggutor. Golem provides Rapid Spin, a Normal resistance, and offensive presence as a spinner, which pairs nicely with Heracross both offensively and defensively. Raikou will check both Zapdos and Skarmory defensively, two of Heracross's worst nemeses, while Heracross checks Nidoking and Machamp, giving the two Pokemon great defensive synergy as well.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Sneasel holds two incredibly valuable defensive niches in GSC NUâ€”it is one of the few Pokemon with instant recovery in the tier, and it is one of the only three Dark-types. The latter grants it a valuable immunity to the main STAB move of the best Pokemon in the tier, Xatu, although Sneasel should still watch for Drill Peck. Sneasel fits very well on Spikes teams thanks to Toxic forcing numerous switches; this compounding chip damage is complemented by Sneasel's incredible Speed, being tied for the second highest in the tier behind Dugtrio, and decent Attack stat, which lets it revenge kill a lot of low health dangerous sweepers such as Primeape. Sneasel fares well against the numerous RestTalk users in the tier such as Dewgong, Xatu, Chinchou, and Azumarill thanks to its decent Special Defense, and Nightmare if it chooses to run a more offensive set. However, Sneasel is quite frail on the physical side, which means almost every physical attacker can 3HKO or 2HKO it. Sneasel is also almost worthless if it is paralyzed, since it is forced to burn through Moonlight's 8 PP much more quickly and loses its ability to outspeed anything. Return is Sneasel's most reliable source of damage, although it lacks STAB. Moonlight is Sneasel's most valuable tool, giving it excellent longevity, and Sneasel has plenty of opportunities to regain HP thanks to its Speed. Toxic is used to cripple Fire- or Fighting-types that lack Rest and tend to switch into Sneasel, such as Magmar and Primeape. Moonlight and Toxic in particular pair very well on Sneasel, since it can use Moonlight until the opposition is worn down due to Toxic. For Sneasel's last move, Dynamic Punch lets Sneasel 3HKO Rock-types and 2HKO the dangerous Magnemite. Alternatively, Thief fits well on Sneasel, since a lot of Pokemon that Sneasel lures in, such as Weezing and Primeape, greatly dislike having their Leftovers stolen.</p> <p>Pokemon that struggle with Xatu and to a lesser extent, Dewgong, are often the best partners for Sneasel. Weezing in particular pairs incredibly well with it, resisting Fighting and having incredible physical bulk to sponge physical attackers that threaten Sneasel. Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonlee, and Hitmonchan synergize well with Sneasel, as Sneasel checks their worst enemy in Xatu. Pineco and its Spikes are excellent support for Sneasel since Toxic very often forces switches; in return, Pineco with Reflect checks Dugtrio and Primeape. With Sneasel's weakness to Fire-types, it appreciates teammates that check Fire-types well, such as Dewgong, Azumarill, and Ninetales.</p>"

Sneasel can Toxic a foe such as Dewgong or Azumarill, forcing them to use Rest, which enables Sneasel to heavily pressure them with Nighmare while chipping them even further with Return. Moonlight gives Sneasel greater longevity, and works well due to Sneasel taking heavy damage from most RestTalk users that it checks. Primeape pairs well with this Sneasel variant, since Sneasel forcing foes to use Rest gives it a chance to switch in. Offensive teams also sometimes lack Pokemon that can break through Dewgong, which Sneasel does very well.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>Ursaring has the highest Attack stat of any Normal-type at base 130, allowing it to KO some Pokemon that its main competitors Snorlax and Kangaskhan cannot. It also has a decent Special Attack and special movepool, letting it perform as a niche mixed attacker. Unfortunately, Ursaring's positives end there, as it still faces far too much competition in all of its roles. Other Normal-types such as Porygon2, Snorlax, and even Tauros mostly outclass Ursaring due to their superior bulk, coverage, or Speed. As a Curse phazer, Ursaring is usually outdone by Rhydon and Kangaskhan, where the former sports better physical bulk and a Ground/Rock typing and the latter making up for its worse Attack with better overall bulk, allowing it to stay in longer. Ursaring's subpar bulk and Normal typing also provide its team with no useful defensive utility, and since Snorlax is often considered mandatory on OU teams, both can create a big Fighting-type weakness for its team together. Due to these traits, Ursaring should rarely, if ever, be considered on a serious team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ursaring can use a RestTalk set with Curse and Return to give it some more longevity, but must deal with the same measures the opponent will have prepared for Snorlax while also being thoroughly outclassed by it. A mixed attacker set with Return / Earthquake / Dynamic Punch and Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, or Zap Cannon can be run. However, this set is mostly outclassed by Snorlax and Porygon2, which have better bulk and access to Flamethrower and Fire Blast for the former and Ice Beam for the latter, though Dynamic Punch has the benefit of KOing Tyranitar, which Porygon2 struggles to do. Counter takes advantage of Ursaring's rather average bulk to potentially KO threats such as +1 Attack Skarmory and Steelix, but this can take the slot of an important move, so it is difficult to fit on any set. Incorrectly predicting can lead to the opponent boosting freely, spreading status, or phazing Ursaring, so it is rather risky. Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful STAB move that can land a surprise KO on Pokemon that stay in on Ursaring. However, using Hyper Beam renders Ursaring immobile for a turn afterwards, which can give the opponent a free turn to boost, set up Spikes, or status Ursaring. Berserk Gene can be used alongside Hyper Beam for even more instant power, but has the issue of confusion, which can hurt Ursaring quite a bit if it is unlucky. Thief hinders some of Ursaring's common checks and counters such as Skarmory and Steelix by removing their Leftovers to reduce their longevity, something that Kangaskhan and Snorlax cannot do. However, Thief is very weak and is only able to be used once before becoming useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Forretress, Steelix, and Skarmory completely wall any of Ursaring's sets barring its mixed set. Steelix has such high bulk that it takes Ursaring two Curse boosts just to 2HKO it with Earthquake, and Steelix can retaliate by phazing or setting up on Ursaring. Skarmory laughs at Ursaring's Return and is immune to Earthquake. It too can phaze Ursaring in return, which can be an issue for Ursaring, as it lacks the bulk and resistances to switch in often. Forretress takes neutral damage from Earthquake and requires Ursaring to use Curse four times to get a guaranteed 2HKO. Forretress can also set up Spikes and cripple Ursaring with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Ursaring is not running Earthquake, it is walled by popular Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Rhydon. These Pokemon are also able to threaten Ursaring with their high Attack and STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster can take advantage of Ursaring by easily tanking its attacks, setting up Spikes, and using Toxic or Surf on it before either using Explosion or switching to the appropriate counter.</p> <p><strong>Miltank and Umbreon</strong>: Due to Ursaring's lack of access to Body Slam and Double-Edge, it doesn't have a STAB option that would allow it to potentially get past Miltank or Umbreon. They can negate any Attack boosts with Growl or Charm and heal off any damage, allowing both to run Ursaring out of PP or weaken it for a teammate to finish it off.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curse Phazer": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Curse raises Ursaring's Attack and Defense by one stage and also lowers its Speed by one stage, allowing it to potentially phaze other Roar users such as Steelix while being able to deal and withstand more damage. STAB Return can do a considerable amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake gives Ursaring coverage to help take down Rock-types that would otherwise wall it. Roar allows Ursaring to beat enemy Curse users as long as it gets a Curse boost first. With the Speed drop from Curse, Roar also allows Ursaring to get around Pokemon that would otherwise counter it through phazing such as Skarmory. However, this strategy is ruined if Ursaring gets poisoned, so it can elect to use Rest instead of Earthquake. If it selects Roar while asleep and is slower, it will still block enemy phazing attempts. Leftovers gives Ursaring essential passive recovery. This set faces heavy competition for a teamslot from Kangaskhan, whose superior bulk better suits the Curse phazer role and mostly makes up for its significantly lower Attack stat.</p>"

    "uu": {"sets": {"The P-Word (RestTalk)": {}}},
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Piloswine is an oddity among oddities in OU, possessing a one-of-a-kind list of attributes that are mixed together from more common Ground-types. It most prominently borrows from Steelix and Nidoking, combining the former's Ice neutrality and the latter's ability to threaten Zapdos and Exeggutor while packing a stronger Earthquake than both. However, Piloswine's inability to check Snorlax and threaten Explosion like Steelix or pressure Cloyster and inflict sleep like Nidoking means it also lacks many of the selling points that form the bedrock of their respective places in the tier. Piloswine is also similar to Raikou as a check to Electric-types and Gengar that threatens Zapdos, and Piloswine has the added benefit of beating opposing Raikou; however, this benefit comes with an asterisk due to Piloswine's Hidden Power Water weakness, making it less consistent as a dedicated Electric-type check. Piloswine is capable of solving problems for certain teams by compressing a check to Electric-types, some Ground-types, and Gengar into one team slot, but its defensive flaws and mediocre stats are glaring enough to ensure that its niche remains very small and somewhat at the mercy of metagame trends.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blizzard is an alternative Ice-type STAB option that notably 2HKOes Zapdos and 3HKOes Skarmory; however, its low PP is a major issue in longer games even with help from Sleep Talk, and this combined with low accuracy makes it inconsistent. Toxic is a feasible option to give Piloswine a method of punishing Cloyster switch-ins, but this would force Piloswine to drop Sleep Talk, making it significantly easier to play around in other ways. Curse can power up Piloswine's Earthquake to make it more threatening when paired with paralysis support, but this once again lacks the consistency provided by Sleep Talk. In general, most deviations from Piloswine's standard set are hard to justify due to how difficult it is to drop Sleep Talk, which is made worse by the fact that both of OU's viable Heal Bell users stack a Fighting-type weakness with Piloswine.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Piloswine struggles to deal with every Water-type in the metagame, including Cloyster, Starmie, Suicune, and Vaporeon. Cloyster and Vaporeon can also take advantage of Piloswine to generate offensive pressure with Spikes and Growth, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon and Miltank</strong>: Umbreon and Miltank are two prominent mixed walls that Piloswine struggles to get past. They both take negligible damage from Piloswine's attacks and can weaken it further with Charm and Growl, respectively. However, nothing outside of a Mean Look stall tactic on Umbreon's part can punish Piloswine for playing for a freeze against them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Heracross resists Earthquake, takes paltry damage from Ice Beam, and threatens heavy damage in return with Megahorn. Machamp takes considerable damage from Earthquake, but it outspeeds Piloswine and threatens major damage in return with Cross Chop.</p> <p><strong>Forretress and Skarmory</strong>: Forretress welcomes the sight of Piloswine on the field, easily tanking its hits and exploiting its presence to set up Spikes or threaten Rapid Spin. Skarmory is similarly good as a check despite its lack of an Ice resistance, being immune to Earthquake and able to do whatever it wants in front of Piloswine unless it lands a freeze or gets lucky with Blizzard accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Fire / Flying-types</strong>: Moltres and Charizard are immune to Earthquake, lack a weakness to Ice Beam, and threaten to incinerate Piloswine with their terrifying STAB Fire Blasts.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Power Water</strong>: Piloswine's ability to check Zapdos and Raikou is greatly hindered by their tendency to use Hidden Power Water on many teams instead of Hidden Power Ice. While neither of them can 2HKO a healthy Piloswine with the move even after a round of Spikes damage, it doesn't take much further chip damage for Piloswine to become unable to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is mentioned primarily for its ability to gain the upper hand in just about any one-on-one in the game. However, Piloswine's Earthquake guarantees a 4HKO on the switch after Spikes and can 3HKO Snorlax with a critical hit, preventing it from switching in comfortably. That said, if it manages to switch into Ice Beam or Rest, Snorlax can dare Piloswine to exhaust Earthquake PP trying to get the critical hit needed to break its Rest loop. Moreover, Piloswine cannot prevent Snorlax from setting up Curse boosts, and even an unboosted Double-Edge can 3HKO it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Piloswine's great STAB combination, decent bulk, and unique defensive typing make it a good candidate for a RestTalk set. Earthquake gives Piloswine a potent STAB move for its respectable Attack stat, threatening tier staples like Raikou, Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Gengar. Earthquake also does enough damage to prevent Snorlax from safely switching into Piloswine, although Piloswine cannot reliably switch into a Snorlax and force it to switch out. Ice Beam is a great secondary STAB move that lets Piloswine efficiently play offense while on defense, since it can threaten major damage against Zapdos after switching into Thunder without being forced to KO itself; the move also 2HKOes other crucial threats like Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Marowak. In addition, Ice Beam's chance to freeze foes gives Piloswine a means to threaten otherwise sturdy counters such as Skarmory, Umbreon, Miltank, Blissey, and most Water-types. It's worth noting that Piloswine is a poor dedicated sleep absorber, since it can't reliably switch into Jynx, Exeggutor, or Lovely Kiss Snorlax, so don't solely rely on it for that purpose.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos is a great teammate, since it can punish Skarmory, Forretress, and Water-type switch-ins that take advantage of Piloswine, and it enjoys Piloswine acting as a sturdy check to Gengar and Nidoking. Piloswine's ability to absorb sleep from those two is especially useful, making it easier for Zapdos to drop Sleep Talk and fit a different move in its place like Reflect. Any variant of Snorlax with Sleep Talk is a great asset to Piloswine teams, providing a sturdy backup sleep absorber and checking Hidden Power Water Electric-types with aplomb. Since Piloswine can help deal with Gengar and Rock-types, a mono-attacking Snorlax set with Curse is entirely feasible, as is the use of a mixed coverage option such as Thunder or Fire Blast. Piloswine doesn't pack a Normal resistance unlike Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix, so a teammate that can switch into Snorlax is crucial; Skarmory and Misdreavus are a great pairing that can combine to wall every possible Snorlax set, and Tyranitar is serviceable here as well.</p>"

  "Octillery": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Boasting the highest Special Attack stat in the tier, a fantastic typing of pure Water, STAB Surf that hits several common Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Ninetales, Graveler, and Rapidash for super effective damage while 3HKOing most neutral targets; RestTalk for longevity; and the complementary coverage of Hidden Power Electric or Ice Beam, Octillery makes for a phenomenal choice on many teams. However, while Octillery is amazing, it is not flawless. Octillery is quite slow, being outsped by most offensive threats such as Weezing, Stantler, and Xatu. Additionally, while Octillery is generally bulky enough to handle Pokemon it needs to with RestTalk such as Rapidash and Dugtrio, it can be 3HKOed by strong unresisted STAB moves such as Stantlerâ€™s Frustration and Fearow's Double-Edge or a sufficiently strong coverage move, and it can very easily be pushed into 3HKO range of attacks such as Xatu's Psychic by the ubiquitous Spikes. Octillery also has issues with coverage, as with Ice Beam, it is walled by opposing Octillery and Dewgong, while with Hidden Power Electric, it cannot touch Grass-types like Gloom and Exeggcute. Octillery also suffers minor competition with Dewgong, which in exchange for a much weaker Surf, the inability to effectively utilize Hidden Power Electric, and weaknesses to Rock and Fighting along with a lack of a resistance to Fire, provides much more speed and bulk than Octillery and a stronger Ice Beam, resulting in a a significantly superior matchup into Xatu and Fearow. Dewgong also has access to Encore, providing an additional niche that Octillery doesnâ€™t have. However, Octillery's greater power, which lets it 3HKO Stantler and sometimes Wigglytuff, and its better/more practical defensive utility and pure Water typing making it a much better check to Magmar, Sudowoodo, and Sunny Day Ninetales often make it the superior choice on teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Octillery can use Hidden Power Grass to hit Chinchou super effectively and have a second move to hit Ground-types like Dugtrio while using Sleep Talk, similar to Ice Beam, while retaining a super effective hit on opposing Octillery and Dewgong. However, Hidden Power Grass significantly reduces Octillery's DVs, making it a worse check to threats like Xatu and Magmar, and unlike Hidden Power Electric and Ice Beam, it cannot hit Xatu and Fearow for meaningful damage when Octillery is using Sleep Talk. Octillery can forgo Sleep Talk in favor of Amnesia to make it in theory much sturdier against threats like Xatu, opposing Octillery, and Magmar, but it means Octillery is constantly being pressured to use Rest due to a lack of having Sleep Talk, and Amnesia does not prevent Octillery from taking significant damage from strong physical hits like Stantler's Frustration, Fearow's Double-Edge, and Primeape's Cross Chop. Octillery can use Surf / Ice Beam / Hidden Power Grass / Protect as a Growth recipient, similar to Dewgong. However, Dewgong tends to be the far superior choice because it is significantly faster and bulkier. RestTalk Octillery with Hidden Power Electric will also often be a superior Growth recipient. Octillery can choose to use a set consisting of Curse, Return, Amnesia, and Rest to take advantage of its high Attack stat and solid typing. However, it has difficulty switching into attacks without Sleep Talk, is slow, can be overwhelmed by Spikes, strong moves, and Explosion; and it tends to be outclassed by Curse Wigglytuff and Porygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou counters Octilleryâ€”bar a freeze from Ice Beamâ€”as it resists Surf and Ice Beam, takes little from Hidden Power Electric, is faster, and 2HKOes Octillery with Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Hidden Power Electric Octillery is the most common check to other Octillery, as it resists Surf and can 3HKO with Hidden Power Electric, quickly forcing the opponent to use Rest or switch their Octillery out. Dewgong cannot do significant damage to Octillery, having to fish for an Ice Beam freeze to do anything to it, but it is not 3HKOed by Hidden Power Electric without a critical hit, can PP stall Ice Beam Octillery, and is faster. Additionally, if Dewgong has Toxic and Encore, it can directly beat Octillery at the cost of potentially being worn down by Hidden Power Electric long-term.</p> <p><strong>Hitmonlee</strong>: Hitmonlee avoids a 3HKO from Surf, outspeeding and 3HKOing back with High Jump Kick while having Rest and Sleep Talk to keep itself alive. However, it can be pushed into range of a 3HKO from Surf by Spikes or a miss from High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Gloom and other Grass-types are reliable answers to Hidden Power Electric Octillery, keeping themselves healthy throughout a battle with Synthesis and 3HKOing with STAB Grass moves or, in the case of Gloom, Curse-boosted Sludge Bombs. However, they take significant damage from Ice Beam and are generally poor offensively.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon avoids a 2HKO from Surf and can repeatedly use Recover to bring itself back to full health. It additionally has Thunder Wave to slow down and potentially fully paralyze Octillery. Porygon can then use the paralyzed Octillery to boost up with Curse or fire off Thunders. However, Porygon is slower than Octillery and only barely manages to dodge a 2HKO from full health, so if there are Spikes on the field or Porygon has taken chip damage, it is not an effective switch-in to Octillery. Porygon also gives Octillery many chances to critically hit it while attempting to boost with Curse.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: While not reliable switch-ins, Octillery can be directly beaten by threats like Weezing, Primeape, and Stantler, and it has significantly more trouble answering Xatu if it has Hidden Power Electric and Spikes are on the field.</p>",

Hidden Power Electric also retains the ability to hit Xatu and Fearow hard while using Sleep Talk, which Hidden Power Grass cannot do. Ice Beam leaves Octillery walled by other Octillery, but means it is no longer blocked from making progress by Gloom or other Grass-types and hits Xatu and Fearow much harder than Surf or Hidden Power Electric. It also prevents Dugtrio from having a two-thirds chance to not be hit by Octillery when it is asleep, making trying to fish for a non-damaging move to safely use Substitute and Screech much riskier, does not reduce Octillery's DVs, making answering Xatu much easier, and has a potentially crucial chance to freeze on any given usage, which over time can potentially shut down checks like Chinchou and other Hidden Power Electric Octillery. While Ice Beam seems to have much larger upside than Hidden Power Electric, giving free entry to opposing Octillery tends to be disastrous for many teams, so ideally it should be used alongside another Pokemon that can answer opposing Octillery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pineco is a great partner for Octillery, as its Spikes make switching in Pokemon like Stantler and Wigglytuff that are neutral to Surf and can threaten Octillery much more punishing. Chinchou and Hitmonlee make running Ice Beam on Octillery a lot more forgiving, as they are great checks to other Octillery and appreciate it having a second move to hit Dugtrio and not losing bulk from Hidden Power Electric's DV requirements. Chinchou and Hitmonlee also answer Dewgong, which counters Ice Beam Octillery and can freely fish for freezes with its own Ice Beam. Xatu and Fearow are great answers to Hitmonlee and Grass-types like Gloom and Exeggcute that answer Hidden Power Electric Octillery while also helping Octillery not get overwhelmed by Dugtrio. Fearow, in addition to Wigglytuff, appreciates Octillery forcing Sudowoodo and Graveler to sacrifice themselves with Self-Destruct and Explosion, respectively, to break through it. This can result in a scenario where Sudowoodo is forced to choose between repeatedly coming into Fearow and Wigglytuff but giving up relatively free entry to Octillery or using Self-Destruct on Octillery but leaving its team vulnerable to Fearow and Wigglytuff. Octillery-weak Pokemon like Ninetales, Dugtrio, and Graveler enjoy having a Hidden Power Electric Octillery of their own to switch into other Octillery. All three of these Pokemon can also check Weezing, with Graveler also checking Fearow and spinning away Spikes for Octillery, while Ninetales helps build a sturdier defensive force against Xatu and Magmar. Rapidash also makes for a solid partner, as while its lesser bulk makes it a worse check to Weezing and Hidden Power Ground Magmar than Ninetales, it is much better at forcing damage on Chinchou and is a great answer to Sunny Day Ninetales. Porygon and Magmar are countered by Ninetales, so Octillery is a natural fit alongside them. Gloom and other Grass-types also like Octillery for the same reason, and aid in the Octillery mirror matchup too.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Since the very beginning of the GSC metagame, Skarmory has proved to be a force to be reckoned with. With an amazing base 140 Defense stat, 9 resistances, 2 immunities, and no physical weaknesses, Skarmory is easily the best physical wall available in GSC. Throw in Skarmory's ability to phaze opponents with Whirlwind and boost its already ridiculous Defense with Curse, and you have an excellent check to top threats such as Snorlax, Marowak, Heracross, Exeggutor, Machamp, Umbreon, Quagsire, and Espeon. In addition, Skarmory's resistance to Normal-type attacks also makes it a good switch-in to most predicted Explosions.</p> <p>While Skarmory is an amazing physical wall, it lacks the ability to effectively deal with special attacks from most special and mixed attackers, the reason being its measly base 70 Special Defense and poor base 65 HP. Skarmory's movepool is also rather limited; beyond Toxic and Drill Peck, it has little in the way of offense, and is forced to rely upon Rest and Leftovers for healing off damage due to its lack of recovery options. While sleeping, Skarmory will no longer be able to check some threats, such as Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, Machamp, and trappers, although others, such as Curse Snorlax, non-Seismic Toss Heracross, and most Exeggutor, still won't be able to get past Skarmory. That said, Skarmory is still an incredible defensive Pokemon that should always be considered when team building, especially when creating a stall-based team. Ignore this bird of steel at your own risk!</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Outside of the moves already mentioned, Skarmory has a few options that it can use over Curse. Thief is an interesting possibility because it can remove Leftovers from an opponent, making them more susceptible to being worn down over time. Keep in mind that Thief only works when Skarmory is not carrying an item. Toxic is another option over Curse to drain the opponent's health. However, many Pokemon carry Rest, and Heal Bell support is also fairly common, so Skarmory will often find it difficult to sufficiently wear down many of the tanks that Toxic is meant to counter; however, Toxic is still useful for forcing certain Pokemon to waste a turn Resting. Pokemon that often carry Rest without Sleep Talk, such as Raikou, are especially susceptible to this strategy. Wearing down Electric-types looking to switch in can be very useful, especially with Spikes support. Toxic will also wear down Tyranitar, Rhydon, Cloyster, and Dragonite looking for an easy switch-in, and is effective against defensive Pokemon that don't have Rest and Sleep Talk, such as Starmie and Miltank. Sand Attack is another option for Skarmory to use against Kangaskhan, and makes a great ploy for annoying opponents in general. The accuracy drops can really ruin opponents, especially those that rely on moves without perfect accuracy, such as Thunder Zapdos and Raikou.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Strong special attacks remain the best way to deal with Skarmory, as they hit its much weaker Special Defense. Electric-types such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon can easily switch into Drill Peck and force Skarmory out with a super effective STAB attack. Mixed sweepers such as Nidoking, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Fire Blast Snorlax can all come in and do a great deal of damage to Skarmory. Vaporeon is a deadly special sweeper which can scare out Skarmory and use the free turn to boost. While not common, Charizard can come in on Skarmory, threaten it with Fire Blast, and use Belly Drum as it switches out. Cloyster and Forretress can easily set up Spikes on Skarmory. Steelix, Kangaskhan, Rhydon, and Tyranitar are all slower than Skarmory after a Curse boost, allowing them to force Skarmory out with Roar after it uses Whirlwind--in GSC, phazing moves fail if they go before the opponent moves. Houndoom and Tyranitar can rack up Pursuit damage on Skarmory by threatening it with powerful Fire-type moves. Starmie and Suicune can threaten Skarmory with a STAB Surf, and Starmie can even get a free turn to clear away Spikes with Rapid Spin. However, be aware that many of the counters mentioned above will be surprised by the occasional Toxic. Snorlax with Fire Blast can surprise Skarmory with a 2HKO, while Lovely Kiss versions can cripple Skarmory and then proceed to use Belly Drum to rip through the rest of the team.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Physical Wall": {
          "description": "<p>This set gives Skarmory everything it needs to succeed. With access to Whirlwind and Curse, as well as fantastic resistances, Skarmory will be able to counter many top OU threats with ease. It can easily come in on Curse or Belly Drum Snorlax and phaze it with Whirlwind. Curse allows Skarmory to effectively wall Belly Drum Snorlax as well as last-Pokemon Curse Snorlax after only one or two boosts. Skarmory can also deal with the likes of Heracross, Marowak, and Machamp, preventing them from sweeping or setting up. Additionally, it can serve as an effective check to Umbreon and Misdreavus without Thunder, as Whirlwind will stop their respective trap-passing and Perish-trapping attempts.</p> <p>Curse gives Skarmory additional Defense boosts, increasing its general longevity. The sheer physical durability of Skarmory after a Curse cannot be understated. For example, at +1 Defense, Skarmory will almost never be 3HKOed by Snorlax's 999 Attack Double-Edge, 999 Attack Marowak cannot 3HKO with Rock Slide, boosted Steelix can't OHKO with Explosion, 999 Attack Rhydon never 2HKOes with Rock Slide, and Machamp will fail to OHKO with a +1 Cross Chop even with a critical hit. Curse also gives Skarmory a Speed drop that lets it phaze other Curse and Roar users, such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Tyranitar, that would otherwise phaze Skarmory instead. While not common, Skarmory can occasionally sweep thanks to Curse if Growl users and special attackers such as Zapdos and Raikou are removed, but this is a very situational scenario. A quick note on Curse: when using Pokemon Netbattle Supremacy, Skarmory will be one Speed point faster at -1 than Snorlax; however, when using Pokemon Online, Skarmory at -1 Speed will tie with Snorlax.</p> <p>With Drill Peck, Skarmory has an option to deal a good chunk of damage to threats such as Machamp, Exeggutor, and Heracross. Skarmory resists both of Exeggutor's STAB moves, and barring Sleep Powder or Hidden Power Fire, it can switch in with impunity. When going up against Curse Machamp, it is a good idea to boost with Curse first before using Drill Peck in order to prevent Skarmory from losing a good chunk of its health to Cross Chop. Rest is for recovering health and removing paralysis; a paralyzed Skarmory will find it more difficult to check Pokemon it would normally beat, such as Swords Dance Marowak, Curse Machamp, and Belly Drum Snorlax. However, keep in mind that a sleeping Skarmory won't be able to counter threats it normally would, such as setup sweepers and trappers. As a word of warning, opponents can and will capitalize on the two free turns from Rest. It is recommended that you only use Rest when completely necessary; Heal Bell support is also a good idea.</p> <p>Skarmory is a fantastic physical wall and defensive pivot, but it will enjoy help dealing with special threats. Skarmory absolutely loves support from switch-ins to Electric-types that try to ruin its day. Steelix, Quagsire, and Blissey are all able to counter Zapdos and Raikou effectively; Nidoking, Rhydon, and Snorlax can also help play around these threats if need be. However, Snorlax will not enjoy being forced to absorb powerful special attacks over the course of a longer match. Playing Snorlax defensively is seldom a good idea because it would rather use its large bulk to prolong its offensive use. Nidoking and Rhydon will also have issues against Raikou and Zapdos packing Hidden Power Ice or Water. Beyond Raikou and Zapdos, Skarmory will also want mixed and special attackers such as Nidoking, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Vaporeon covered. Zapdos and Raikou can take on Vaporeon, Dragonite, and special attackers in general with their special bulk and high Special Attack. Suicune is also a good choice for countering special and mixed sweepers because of its resistances to Water- and Ice-type attacks, good mixed bulk, and access to STAB Surf and Toxic.</p> <p>Skarmory also needs help dealing with certain physical threats that can play around it. Lovely Kiss, Thunder, and Fire Blast versions of Snorlax are notable for their ability to beat Skarmory one-on-one. Lovely Kiss versions will cripple Skarmory with sleep, while Fire Blast versions can score a surprise 2HKO should Skarmory choose to switch in. Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Misdreavus are all excellent counters to the aforementioned Snorlax sets. Gengar and Steelix work best against Lovely Kiss versions, though Gengar will have to watch out for a possible Earthquake. Curse users with Roar, such as Tyranitar, Kangaskhan, and Rhydon, are also troubling for Skarmory, as their Roar will go after Skarmory's Whirlwind after they set up a Curse, causing it to fail. With the combination of Curse and Roar, these Pokemon will be able to beat Skarmory without special attacks. Miltank and Umbreon can neutralize most Curse and Roar users with Growl and Charm, respectively.</p> <p>Skarmory and Miltank are great partners, as together they counter virtually every physical threat in the metagame. Miltank can also take on the mixed Snorlax versions that give Skarmory trouble. Blissey and Skarmory complement each other well as partners and make up the famous \"SkarmBliss\" combo. However, in GSC, this partnership is not as strong as it is in ADV. Blissey can provide Heal Bell and screen support for Skarmory, but other than that it will do little to secure victory. Skarmory enjoys phazing support; Raikou works well in this regard because of its high Special Defense, resistance to Electric-type attacks, and access to Roar. Suicune also deserves a mention for its great mixed defenses, access to Roar, and ability to check mixed Snorlax with Fire Blast. Other great phazing partners include Tyranitar, Steelix, and Rhydon, which are notable for their resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Defense. Having an extra Snorlax check is a wise idea in case Skarmory is put to sleep by Lovely Kiss or surprised by Fire Blast. Stall teams should especially consider extra phazing support for Snorlax in order to prevent it from sweeping once Skarmory has gone down. Additional phazers such as Rhydon can also work well against Misdreavus with Thunder trying to Perish trap. Skarmory enjoys the stallbreaking prowess that Misdreavus brings to the table with Perish Song and Mean Look. Misdreavus can also block Rapid Spin, thereby keeping Spikes on the field. Skarmory is often used in a phazing role and therefore loves entry hazards; Forretress and Cloyster are both good options for providing Spikes support.</p>"

  "Houndour": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Houndour has one purposeâ€”to trap and eliminate Xatu with Pursuit. Since it is immune to Xatu's nearly unresisted STAB Psychic, takes little from Hidden Power Ice or Electric, and has a solid Special Attack, Houndour can consistently clear the way for teammates that are otherwise walled or annoyed by Xatu's presence, such as Primeape, Hitmonlee, Kingler, Gloom, and Weezing. Houndour's Fire Blast is also quite strong, being as strong as Rapidash, and it's faster than Pokemon like Weezing and Gloom, so even after it removes Xatu, it might still be able to force damage on the opponent's valuable defensive pieces. However, after removing Xatu, Houndour often does little else and is usually sacrificed for a free switch, as it is extremely frail, is relatively slow, is walled by other Fire-types, and takes heavy damage from Water-type moves, with Octillery even OHKOing it with Surf. Houndour often makes for defensively flawed teams, since it so often does very little compared to an otherwise better Pokemon once it is done trapping Xatu. This is not even to mention that some teams do not even use Xatu, in which case it can feel like playing a five versus six matchup. Houndour also struggles heavily against Pokemon like Dewgong and Stantler, further limiting what it can do beyond trapping Xatu.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Houndour can use Thief to steal Leftovers from an opposing Xatu before it escapes Pursuit or from whatever Pokemon is switching into Houndour, and this is additionally useful for when the opponent is not using Xatu. However, it consumes a turn that Houndour may rather spend using a different attack, and, in the case of Xatu switching out, means Houndour is losing surprise factor and the opponent's Xatu still remains instead of taking heavy damage from Pursuit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Flareon, Ninetales, Magmar, and Rapidash all have very high Special Defense while resisting Houndour's Fire Blast, so they are able to wall Houndour and take it down. Magmar, Rapidash, and mixed Flareon are able to quickly KO Houndour with their physical attacks, though Rapidash and Flareon should be wary of Counter if Houndour has not used Sunny Day. Flareon can also take advantage of Houndour to set up Growth boosts and pass them out to a powerful special attacker like Dewgong with Baton Pass.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast and powerful attackers like Primeape, Stantler, Fearow, Hitmonlee, and Kingler can outspeed Houndour and easily 2HKO or even OHKO it, and, in the case of Kingler, use it to boost with Swords Dance. Porygon is outsped by Houndour, but it has access to Thunder Wave and Recover and can easily shrug off its attacks and boost up with Curse or wear Houndour down with Thunder. Stantler and Fearow do need to be careful of Counter if Houndour has not revealed Sunny Day, though, as if at full health, Houndour can take one attack and retaliate with an OHKO from Counter, though Stantler's Earthquake has a chance to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Octillery, Dewgong, and Chinchou take little from Fire Blast and Crunch and do massive damage with STAB Surf, with Octillery even OHKOing it from full health. Dewgong and Chinchou are also both faster than Houndour. However, Houndour can use Sunny Day in front of Octillery or before it comes into the battle and deal heavy damage with Solar Beam, and if Houndour has set up sun before Chinchou enters the battle, it will lose to a healthy Houndour.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio outspeeds Houndour and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Dugtrio can also switch into Crunch if needed or take advantage of Houndour using Pursuit to get a free switch. Dugtrio also has Substitute and Screech to take advantage of a potential switch from Houndour. However, Dugtrio takes heavy damage from Fire Blast, and, if using Substitute too carelessly, can lose HP unnecessarily when the trainer may just want to sacrifice Houndour.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Pursuit": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Pursuit allows Houndour to trap and KO Xatu, one of the most common foes and one that takes advantage of Pokemon like Hitmonlee and Gloom. Houndour is the only Dark-type Pokemon in the tier that learns Pursuit; while other Pokemon do learn it, Houndour is the only effective user. Often, after Houndour has switched into the opposing Xatu and removed it, it has accomplished its goal and can be used as sacrifice fodder to get one of its teammates in safely. Fire Blast is the main choice of a Fire-type STAB move to do as much damage as possible before Houndour goes down, and crucially lower Xatu into Pursuit range in the absence of Crunch since Pursuit cannot 3HKO. Sunny Day allows Houndour to power up its Fire Blast and seriously threaten both Xatu and whatever may switch in, such as a Stantler or Fearow. Sunny Day also reduces the damage of opposing Surf and allows Houndour to use Solar Beam. Solar Beam 2HKOes Octillery and OHKOes Graveler and Pupitar, allowing Houndour to potentially clean through a slow team if preserved. Against teams with a Fire-type of their own, such as Ninetales, where even sun-boosted Fire Blasts won't accomplish much, Houndour should prioritize trapping Xatu and being relegated to a sacrifice rather than attempting to break holes with Sunny Day. With Crunch, Houndour 2HKOes Xatu, preventing situations where Houndour loses to Xatu because it has taken prior chip damage, misses Fire Blast into Xatu, or gets critically hit by Xatu's Hidden Power Electric, though it comes at the cost of dropping Solar Beam. Counter is often used over Sunny Day in conjunction with Crunch, since without Solar Beam, Sunny Day becomes less useful. Counter mainly allows Houndour to take advantage of its ability to take one neutral physical hit if at high health, such as a Fearow Double-Edge, and retaliate back with a surprise KO. Houndour can also surprise greedy Stantler that come in to revenge kill Houndour with a KO from Counter if they use Return instead of Earthquake in an attempt to not let in Xatu or Fearow freely. Additionally, Houndour can switch into Weezing on a revenge kill or a double switch and force damage on it with Fire Blast or Pursuit, helping to weaken it for a Primeape or Hitmonlee that Houndour may be partnering with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Body Slam Hitmonlee is a prime partner for Houndour, as Xatu otherwise walls it. Hitmonlee is also a solid answer to Octillery, Dewgong, and Chinchou, all of which can switch into Houndour and take advantage of it. Ice Beam Octillery is also a fine choice alongside; while it isn't particularly wanting of Xatu's removal, it works well alongside Hitmonlee to answer opposing Water-types that beat Ice Beam Octillery while also covering Dugtrio and Fire-types like Magmar and Rapidash well for Hitmonlee and Houndour. Gloom, additionally, is walled by Xatu, so Houndour is a natural partner. Gloom can also take on Hidden Power Electric Octillery, Chinchou, and Primeape, all of which threaten Houndour, without being worried about an opposing Xatu blocking it from making progress with Stun Spore or Sludge Bomb. Primeape and Weezing are capable of breaking past Xatu on the switch-in with Thunder; however, Xatu is still an annoyance and can revenge kill both easily, so it can be worth using Houndour alongside them. Using Houndour can also allow Primeape to drop Thunder and instead use a move like Meditate or Thief on Substitute sets or Double-Edge on RestTalk sets. Hidden Power Ground Kingler's biggest enemy is Xatu, so Houndour works well with it, too. Stantler also appreciates Xatu being gone so the opponent has a harder time switching into or revenge killing it. Graveler can be a good partner for Houndour, as while the two don't particularly synergize well beyond Xatu sometimes being annoying for Graveler, many Pokemon that struggle with Xatu, such as Hitmonlee, Gloom, and Kingler, also naturally struggle with Pineco and Fearow.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Houndoom is the proud owner of the strongest Pursuit in the entire GSC metagame, with enough coverage and firepower to truly take advantage of Pursuit's utility. While other Pursuit users fail to do notable damage or even force out their targets for said Pursuit, Houndoom's strength forces Ghost- and Psychic-types to choose between getting 2HKOed by a STAB attack or potentially fainting to such a strong Pursuit. Combined with good neutral coverage in its STAB types, good Speed, and even better Special Attack, Houndoom is very difficult to switch into and out of overall. Houndoom's typing also makes it the best offensive check to Jynx and Exeggutor by resisting both of their STAB moves and having a pick of super effective STAB attacks to hit back. It can even run a Sunny Day set to become even stronger. However, Houndoom's low Defense stat means that even neutral hits can 2HKO the poor dog. Houndoom is also walled by very common Pokemon, most notably Snorlax and Tyranitar, and can struggle to achieve proper 2HKOs against some of its more valuable targets. Regardless, Houndoom's combination of utility and power makes it an addition worth considering.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sleep Talk gives Houndoom additional opportunities to switch in against Jynx and Exeggutor because sleep is the most reliable way for these foes to escape from being Pursuit trapped by Houndoom. The move lets Houndoom work as a general sleep absorber, though a full RestTalk set can have mixed results due to Houndoom's less-than-stellar bulk. Houndoom is also unable to Pursuit trap while asleep. Miracle Berry is a viable option that is arguably more effective at dealing with sleep inducers because it gives Houndoom a chance to Pursuit trap them even if it switches in as a sleep move is used.</p> <p>Toxic is an option to wear down common bulky checks, such as Snorlax and Tyranitar, but it can struggle to be justified because Houndoom is very frail. Toxic is ideally paired with Roar, but using both means that Houndoom will have to give up another attack.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can hit foes such as Golem and Rhydon hard, but Crunch already hits them hard and Hidden Power Grass fails to OHKO. Similarly, Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Tyranitar as it switches in, as Tyranitar would otherwise completely wall Houndoom. However, it fails to 2HKO Tyranitar from full health, and therefore Houndoom's standard options are recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Snorlax and Blissey can consistently soak up any damage that Houndoom throws at them. Snorlax does have to be careful about a potential Counter, and Fire Blast in the sun can 3HKO, but Snorlax remains an excellent stop to Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon do not fear Fire Blast or Crunch, and they only mildly fear the rare Solar Beam. This allows them to consistently switch into Houndoom and threaten it with their STAB attacks, and RestTalk variants can stall out Sunny Day as well. Even Starmie can revenge kill Houndoom with its superior Speed, but it has to be wary of switching into a potential Crunch or Sunny Day. Tentacruel is also worth mentioning  thanks to its resistance to Fire Blast and its high Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar can switch into a Fire Blast or Crunch with ease and potentially OHKO Houndoom with a STAB Rock Slide. Golem and Rhydon also resist Fire Blast and threaten Houndoom with their STAB attacks, but they're more afraid of Grass-type coverage and chip damage from Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Raikou</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou both outspeed Houndoom and can threaten a 2HKO or paralysis with Thunder, whereas Houndoom can only hope to 3HKO in return. The SunnyBeam set puts this matchup in jeopardy, though, as the sun lowers Thunder's already-shaky accuracy further and makes Houndoom's Fire Blast a solid 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Machamp and Marowak can take a hit from Houndoom and OHKO in return without even having to set up. These Pokemon need to be relatively healthy, however, as Houndoom can muscle through them if they are below 50%.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Pursuit Trapper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Houndoom's primary STAB move, with Crunch being excellent coverage for would-be threats like Gengar and Starmie on the switch. Being forced to switch out for fear of taking a strong Fire Blast or Crunch plays directly into Houndoom's excellent Pursuit, allowing it to trap valuable targets such as Exeggutor, Gengar, Jynx, Misdreavus, and even Cloyster effectively. Houndoom further differentiates itself from fellow Pursuit user Tyranitar by resisting Giga Drain from Exeggutor, making the Pursuit trap considerably cleaner. Houndoom can also relatively easily double switch in on its preferred targets due to how predictable they can be coming in. A Gengar coming in to block Rapid Spin against Forretress or a Cloyster seeing an easy opportunity to set Spikes against Golem are both fairly easy double switches for Houndoom to Pursuit trap. In fact, thanks to Houndoom's frailty, it prefers this method of coming in.</p> <p>Roar and Counter are both good choices for the fourth moveslot. Roar prevents threats such as Snorlax from using Houndoom as a setup opportunity, and it can also drag in a valuable Pursuit target on which to force heavy damage. Due to its negative priority, however, Roar can leave Houndoom open to attack, which is risky due to its low defenses. Counter is another option for punishing what would normally be a safe attack from Snorlax, but a Counter used at the wrong time loses all surprise factor, and it makes Houndoom a true sitting duck against Curse Snorlax.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndoom's Pursuit is extremely effective at removing Ghost- and Psychic-types. This is heavily appreciated by partners such as Snorlax, Machamp, and Golem, which can struggle against Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Exeggutor otherwise. Teammates that can switch in on the common Water- and Ground-type attacks thrown at Houndoom, such as Exeggutor, are also appreciated to help offset Houndoom's low bulk and improve team cohesion. Machamp gets a special mention for its ability to reliably switch in on Tyranitar and ward off Snorlax, Houndoom's two biggest counters. Ground-types such as Nidoking are also useful for switching into Electric-types such as Raikou that Houndoom is not keen on taking on.</p> <p>Spikes support is always handy for additional damage to further solidify potential 2HKOs and 3HKOs. It also lets Roar rack up more damage. Cloyster and Forretress both excel in setting Spikes and can even keep Spikes off of Houndoom's side. Houndoom doubles down on the synergy by Pursuit trapping the Ghost-types that would try to block the aforementioned spinners.</p>"
        },
        "SunnyBeam": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set trades some of the utility of a more focused Pursuit set for more firepower and an improved matchup against Water-types, allowing Houndoom to wallbreak better. Sunny Day lets Fire Blast 2HKO even neutral foes and do as much as 40% to Snorlax, making it a potentially shaky switch-in where it is a reliable check otherwise. It also lowers the accuracy of Thunder, which is a problem for the very popular Electric-types Zapdos and Raikou. Sunny Day also allows Houndoom to use Solar Beam, improving its matchups against Rock- and Water-types, most notably 3HKOing Vaporeon and Suicune. Pursuit remains the main justification to using Houndoom and gives it versatility. However, lacking Crunch means that the set is less reliable for KOing Gengar and Misdreavus.</p> <p>This set does not need to set up sun in order to function. Houndoom's Fire Blast is still strong without sun, and its ability to Pursuit trap is always invaluable; keep in mind that Pursuit damage is sometimes more valuable than setting up sun. Additionally, due to Houndoom's low defenses and common checks, setting up sun can be difficult, so it is sometimes better to simply attack and wait for a better moment to set up sun, such as when the opponent has made it clear that they will switch to a Water-type, Electric-type, or sleeping Snorlax against Houndoom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with the power boost from Sunny Day, Houndoom can have a difficult time breaking through specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and RestTalk Snorlax. Because of this, partners that can pressure or simply eliminate these walls, such as Machamp or Explosion Cloyster, are a great help. Prior Spikes can make the difference between 2HKOs and 3HKOs, encouraging setters like Cloyster and Forretress. Golem is also noteworthy for providing Rapid Spin while being able to check Snorlax thanks to its resistances.</p> <p>Even though this set takes a more offensive focus, Houndoom is still able to support its team. Pursuit can still be reliably used to KO Ghost- and Psychic-types early- and mid-game, which is a big help for teammates like Machamp. This set is primarily a wallbreaker and less of wincon, great at wearing down foes for sweepers later in the game. Excellent choices for these sweepers include Machamp, which also provides defensive synergy, as well as Tentacruel and Vaporeon.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Kingdra is unfortunately disallowed in UU but on the fringes of viability in OU. As a bulky Water-type, it faces stiff competition from the likes of Suicune, Vaporeon, and Starmie, all of which have useful qualities that Kingdra lacksâ€”Suicune is substantially bulkier across the board; Vaporeon has Growth; and Starmie has Recover, Rapid Spin, Thunder Wave, and useful resistances to Fighting and Psychic. Nevertheless, Kingdra can be surprisingly effective in circumstances where these other Water-types usually struggle. Its Dragon typing relieves it of all relevant weaknesses, meaning that it's harder for the nearly ever-present Electric-types to force out, and it can neatly keep very tricky mixed attackers under control, such as Nidoking, Gengar, and Tyranitar. These unique defensive qualities, its decent damage output, and its status threat justify its use as a catch-all check that can trade hits adequately with almost any foe other than Snorlax.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a viable option over Dragon Breath, and it's Kingdra's best deterrent against Snorlax and a more reliably impactful move against Cloyster when paired with Rapid Spin support. However, it is less effective than Dragon Breath or Ice Beam against Zapdos, Nidoking, and Gengar, which are three of the main Pokemon Kingdra would be chosen over Suicune for. Running Haze would turn Kingdra into one of the best answers to Baton Pass teams, as unlike most phazers, Jolteon and Marowak can't easily force it out. However, outside of this advantage and improved reliability against Growth Vaporeon, Haze has limited application. Hydro Pump is a more powerful option than Surf to reach improved KO thresholds on many threats. However, it is less accurate and is susceptible to being PP stalled, so it is not generally recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is by far the biggest problem for Kingdra, as Kingdra can do very little to harm it and risks being walloped by a powerful STAB Double-Edge or set up on by Curse variants. The most Snorlax has to fear from Kingdra is status, which can typically be ignored or cured by Rest.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Raikou</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou can 3HKO Kingdra with Thunder and Zapdos has a high chance of 3HKOing with Thunderbolt. However, both must be wary of paralysis from Dragon Breath, and Zapdos should be particularly wary of Ice Beam variants, which can 3HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can permanently wall any of Kingdra's sets and can cure its team of any status that it has spread. If it has Light Screen, Blissey can use it against Kingdra to create an opportunity for a teammate such as Machamp, Marowak, or Snorlax. If it has Present, it can also threaten a KO on Kingdra. However, Blissey does fear a potential Ice Beam freeze, especially if it lacks Present to threaten Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Cloyster can set up Spikes against Kingdra and threaten to remove it with Explosion, although this may be a favorable trade for the Kingdra user if Kingdra is paired with Rapid Spin support. Suicune can create a stalemate with Kingdra that will essentially boil down to PP management. Starmie should beware of Dragon Breath, but with Heal Bell support, it can potentially use Kingdra to safely spin away Spikes. Vaporeon can easily set up Growth against Kingdra and attempt to PP stall it, pass the boosts to a teammate with Baton Pass, or KO it with boosted Ice Beam. However, standard mono-attacking Vaporeon will typically fail to KO Kingdra until the latter has run out of PP due to its 4x Water resistance. Tentacruel can set up on Kingdra safely behind a Substitute but should avoid switching into Dragon Breath.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon has great special bulk and can wall Kingdra easily. It also threatens to potentially trap Kingdra with Mean Look, which could then be passed to a setup sweeper like Snorlax with Baton Pass. However, if Umbreon does not have Mean Look + Baton Pass, Kingdra can potentially PP stall it or give a teammate an opportunity by statusing it with Dragon Breath or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: As one of the few physical attackers with decent Special Defense and RestTalk as its standard set, Heracross matches up very well with Kingdra. Heracross is only 4HKOed by Surf, which generally lets it Rest loop Kingdra, barring unlucky Speed ties and Sleep Talk rolls or critical hits. In return, it deals over 40% to Kingdra with its unboosted STAB Megahorn, and the Speed tie makes it uncertain which turn Kingdra should use Rest on.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor takes little from Dragon Breath Kingdra and has a low chance of 3HKOing with STAB Psychic. As it takes very little damage, it can fish for Special Defense drops or critical hits, and it also has the threat of status or Explosion up its sleeve. However, it takes heavy damage from Ice Beam variants and prefers to avoid paralysis. While Kingdra may want to switch into Jynx to absorb sleep, Jynx has access to a variety of options that can allow it to overwhelm Kingdra. Ice Beam has a small chance of 3HKOing, and Thief stealing Leftovers sharply reduces Kingdra's longevity. Nightmare can ruin Kingdra's effectiveness as a RestTalk user, and if Kingdra tries to attack while awake, it risks being put to sleep from half health and relying on Sleep Talk calling Rest to recover its health. Alakazam 3HKOes Kingdra with Psychic over 80% of the time and can prevent Sleep Talk by locking it into Rest with Encore. Espeon has a decent chance of an unboosted 3HKO with Psychic and can boost its Special Attack with Growth. However, Jynx, Alakazam, and Espeon all take an uncomfortable amount of damage from Kingdra's STAB Surf and fear Dragon Breath paralysis, so they are not reliable checks.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Kingdra's most effective set is very basicâ€”Surf for solid damage across the board and threatening key Rock- and Ground-types such as Tyranitar, Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix, RestTalk for longevity, and a coverage move with a status-inducing secondary effect. Dragon Breath provides a high chance of inflicting paralysis and comes close to 3HKOing Cloyster. Even bulky foes like Zapdos, Snorlax, and Blissey tend to prefer to avoid paralysis, as it leaves them more vulnerable to dangerous potential teammates like Belly Drum Snorlax. Alternatively, Ice Beam offers super effective damage against key foes such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. Unlike with Ice Beam Suicune, Zapdos cannot safely switch into a healthy Ice Beam Kingdra and force it out with the threat of its mighty Thunder, as Kingdra is only 3HKOed by Thunder and Ice Beam 3HKOes in return. This also allows Kingdra to potentially take risks with Sleep Talk rolls against Zapdos, putting it in a less comfortable position. Having Ice Beam and Surf on the same set also minimizes the chance of Nidoking coming out on top via Speed ties and lucky Sleep Talk rolls, as well as offering a chance to freeze foes such as Snorlax, Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Blissey. However, without Dragon Breath, Kingdra's damage output against Cloyster is rather pitiful, which can be quite awkward to deal with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kingdra's most obvious synergy is with Forretress. Kingdra takes on even the most powerful Fire-types with unbelievable ease thanks to its 4x resistance to Fire. In return, Forretress offers a critical resistance to Normal. This allows it to take on Snorlax that lack Fire-type moves; Explosion users such as Exeggutor; and Jynx, which can threaten Kingdra with moves such as Ice Beam, Nightmare, and Thief. It is especially effective at taking on these threats if it runs Rest and Toxic. Forretress also provides Spikes support, which is critical in helping to control foes such as Snorlax and Raikou. Running Kingdra over Suicune means that physically powerful foes that aren't weak to Kingdra's attacks become more dangerous. The most obvious examples are Snorlax and Machamp. Golem and Rhydon are potential teammates that offer support against Snorlax with Fire-type coverage, while teammates such as Starmie, Zapdos, and Venusaur are useful for dealing with Machamp. Golem and Starmie can also potentially provide Rapid Spin support. While Kingdra can lessen the need for an absolute counter to Zapdos if it is running Ice Beam, it appreciates a reliable answer to Zapdos's attacks. Raikou and Snorlax are two typical choices for this role, and Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoking, Golem, and Steelix could be used alongside Snorlax as pivots to lessen the defensive burden on it. Offensively, Kingdra appreciates powerhouses such as Curse Earthquake Snorlax, Belly Drum Snorlax, and Swords Dance Marowak to provide heavy damage output against defensive teams, as it lacks the power to break through walls itself. These offensive allies also benefit from Kingdra's ability to potentially spread paralysis with Dragon Breath.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Donphan is a unique Pokemon in the GSC metagame that finds a small niche thanks to an interesting combination of traits. As a Ground-type with access to the coveted Rapid Spin, it faces competition with the more popular Golem, but Donphan's lack of a secondary typing means it's one of the few Ground-types in OU that lacks a weakness to opposing Ground-type attacks. This gives it favorable matchups against metagame staples such as Steelix, Rhydon, Raikou, Tyranitar, and the aforementioned Golem. Donphan's excellent Defense also allows it to check some non-Curse Snorlax sets despite lacking a Normal resistance, although it doesn't appreciate repeated hits with Spikes in play. Being a spinner with a strong STAB Earthquake means it's extremely risky for Gengar and Misdreavus to try spinblocking against Donphan, making it proficient at keeping Spikes off the field against a variety of teams.</p> <p>However, Donphan remains an extremely rare sight in GSC because its unique traits are ultimately limited and not without downsides; while it has certain advantages over Golem, Golem remains the more popular choice of Rapid Spin user thanks to its STAB on Rock-type moves and ability to check a wider variety of Snorlax sets, making it less restrictive on teambuilding. Starmie is another stiff competitor to Donphan for teams wanting a spinner that checks common Normal-resistant foes, boasting Recover and an excellent Speed tier as major advantages. Donphan's low Special Defense and frequent inability to fit Rock-type coverage also makes it helpless against two of the most common Pokemon in the tier, namely Zapdos and Cloyster, although its Electric immunity is still great for pivoting around the former.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Donphan's movepool is unimpressive outside of the options already mentioned. Growl is Donphan's best tool for dealing with Snorlax and other Curse users, but Roar is more widely applicable against the Pokemon Donphan commonly finds itself switching into. Donphan can run a Curse set of its own with Earthquake, Hidden Power Rock, and either Roar or Rest, but such a set faces tough competition with the more powerful Rhydon. Hidden Power Fire lets Donphan 2HKO Forretress and annoy Skarmory, but it is useless outside of those matchups, and the massive drop in Donphan's HP DVs impacts its hit-taking ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Donphan's lack of STAB on Rock-type moves makes it difficult to avoid inviting Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Dragonite onto the field, all of which can easily threaten it out, phaze it, or set up on it. Moltres and Charizard can also take advantage of a Donphan lacking Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Curse Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax can exploit Donphan's lack of a Normal resistance if it runs a Curse set, easily overwhelming the RestTalk set with its boosted STAB moves; however, offensive Donphan can at least phaze Snorlax if it carries Roar, and repeated Earthquakes can overwhelm Snorlax if it's carrying Self-Destruct instead of Rest.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross takes pitiful damage from Donphan's attacks and easily bowls it over with Megahorn; Curse variants can also set up on it unless it has Roar, creating problems for Donphan's team.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Exeggutor resists Earthquake and threatens Donphan with either of its STAB moves; RestTalk sets struggle to absorb its Sleep Powder because of this. The much rarer Meganium can also wall Donphan with ease, although it isn't quite as threatening in return since it usually runs physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster's stupendous physical bulk and threatening Water-type attacks make it a pain for Donphan to deal with and repeatedly deny Spikes against, forcing the Donphan user to fit Toxic or rely on teammates to help against it. However, Donphan is generally able to outlast the standard Rest-less Cloyster set with smart play, as the latter can be quickly worn down early-game if it's crippled by Toxic or forced to switch into Snorlax repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx can neutralize Donphan for long stretches of the game with Lovely Kiss, and similar to Exeggutor, RestTalk sets struggle to absorb the sleep from it due to their deathly fear of STAB Ice Beam. However, it can't switch directly into Donphan's attacks, and things can go wrong for it very quickly if it misses Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Charm and Growl Users</strong>: Umbreon easily shrugs off Donphan's attacks thanks to its massive bulk and neuters its damage output with Charm; however, it can be beaten if Donphan chooses to run Toxic. Miltank performs similarly well against Donphan thanks to Growl and Milk Drink. It's worth noting that both of these Pokemon struggle to damage Donphan in return, especially the RestTalk set; thus, these matchups will frequently be decided by PP stalling in a one-on-one scenario, which Donphan has an advantage in due to Rapid Spin's massive 64 PP.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although they don't pack a Ground resistance, bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and the rare Kingdra can withstand Donphan's attacks long enough to dispatch it with Surf. Vaporeon can even take advantage of Donphan to set up a Growth boost if it comes in at high health.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is simple yet effective, seeking to leverage Donphan's natural defensive profile to check common threats throughout the course of a game. STAB Earthquake gives Donphan solid offensive presence at all times, letting it 2HKO every Ground-weak Pokemon in the metagame besides Steelix without needing Spikes support. It also threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and 2HKO on Misdreavus, ensuring Donphan can remove Spikes from the field in peace. Rapid Spin is Donphan's most important supportive tool, letting it clear Spikes from its team's side of the field, which greatly assists grounded teammates such as Snorlax. Rest is Donphan's only form of recovery outside of Leftovers, making it mandatory in order to stay healthy for as long as possible. Sleep Talk is used alongside Rest to limit downtime as much as possible, letting Donphan continuously fire off Earthquakes against targets that might otherwise take advantage of it to rack up Curse boosts, such as Rhydon. Sleep Talk also makes Donphan a decent switch-in against Hypnosis from Ghost-types and Lovely Kiss from Snorlax and Nidoking, although its vulnerability to Jynx and Exeggutor makes it awkward to use as a team's sole sleep absorber.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Donphan's lack of a Normal resistance and inability to fit Roar mean it needs a teammate that can provide both of these tools. Tyranitar is a standout candidate, easily switching into Snorlax and phazing it to negate any Curse boosts; its STAB Rock Slide also dishes out some serious pain against Zapdos and Cloyster, which easily beat Donphan. Raikou is the go-to choice for a dedicated Zapdos check thanks to its Electric resistance and powerful Thunder, and Zapdos itself is a crucial teammate for checking threats that bowl over the Donphan + Tyranitar pairing, such as Heracross and Curse Machamp. As a result, Donphan most commonly finds itself on double-Electric teams that seek to limit Cloyster's opportunities to repeatedly lay Spikes; such teams might refrain from using Starmie for Rapid Spin duty, since it stacks too many weaknesses to opposing Raikou. Skarmory and Misdreavus can take Tyranitar's place on bulkier teams, forming an excellent defensive pairing with Donphan that checks every Snorlax variant on its own, leaving Donphan free to deal with Raikou, Tyranitar, and the Ground-types. RestTalk Donphan also compresses a decent Gengar check and a sleep absorber into one team slot, which can free up a team's Snorlax to run a mono-attacking or mixed set. Thunder Snorlax is especially useful for pestering Skarmory, which Donphan can't scratch at all, and Cloyster. Alternatively, Snorlax can still run a set with Sleep Talk if the team finds itself weak to Jynx.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is difficult to justify using due to its similarity to Golem's common sets, but it remains useful for teams seeking a Rapid Spin option that matches up better against opposing Ground-types, Tyranitar, and Giga Drain Forretress. Earthquake is Donphan's main source of damage, striking fear into common Ground-weak Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, Steelix, and Tyranitar and generally providing good neutral damage. Rapid Spin lets Donphan rid the field of Spikes if it finds an opportunity, which is especially useful because Gengar and Misdreavus want nothing to do with its Earthquake and are thus unlikely to switch in. Hidden Power Rock covers Flying-types that commonly switch into Earthquake looking for free turns, mainly Zapdos but also Dragonite, Moltres, and Charizard; however, Donphan doesn't beat the former two one-on-one despite the super effective coverage. Toxic is a decent alternative that puts much more pressure on Cloyster, letting Donphan punish it for switching in on a predicted Rapid Spin and trying to lay Spikes again; it also has applications against Ground-resistant foes such as Exeggutor and Heracross, and it still applies some pressure to the aforementioned Flying-type targets as well. The last moveslot is somewhat flexible: Roar lets Donphan phaze certain Curse users such as Tyranitar, Steelix, Machamp, and even Snorlax in a pinch before they snowball out of control. Roar in conjunction with Spikes support is also a powerful offensive tool that can quickly rack up chip damage against the opponent's team. Alternatively, Protect lets Donphan maximize its Leftovers recovery, which is especially important, since this set doesn't have room for RestTalk. It's also useful for stalling out Toxic damage and wasting low-PP moves such as Cross Chop from Machamp and Giga Drain from Exeggutor and Forretress, making those threats significantly easier to play around.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Donphan sacrifices the longevity of Rest for additional offensive coverage, its team should appropriately match the fast pace it wants to play at. Cloyster is an ideal teammate for this set, providing a backup non-Curse Snorlax check, Spikes that Donphan can leverage with Roar, Toxic that Donphan can accentuate with Protect, and even Explosion to lure and remove Zapdos. Tyranitar is an excellent choice for the Normal resistance, phazing, and offensive presence it provides, and Donphan's good matchups against the tier's spinblockers can potentially free it up to run a Curse set. The Donphan + Tyranitar pairing is also useful in that it handles Gengar extremely well and thus reduces the pressure on Snorlax to run a set with Earthquake, giving it more options overall. A mono-attacking Snorlax set with Curse, Rest, and Sleep Talk pairs very well with this Donphan, providing a special sponge, win condition, and sleep absorber in the same team slot. Raikou is a useful teammate for providing extra insurance against Zapdos, and it can also viably run a Sleep Talk set depending on the needs of the team. Gengar can ensure Spikes remain on the field for Donphan's team, check Heracross and Machamp, and pressure nearly the entire tier with its coverage and Hypnosis; it also discourages Steelix and Golem from trying to trade with Donphan via Explosion, which is especially useful if Donphan isn't running Protect.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the most versatile Normal-types in GSC OU thanks to its fantastic stats and movepool. It can be difficult to deal with thanks to its wide coverage options, mixed damage, decent power, and ability to spread status with Thunder Wave as well as its solid bulk and access to Recover. Porygon2 especially shines as a Thunder Wave user thanks to its ability to nail Ground-type switch-ins with Ice Beam. It also makes for a decent Curse user because it can recover its health without being forced to fall asleep, as well as hitting Pokemon that resist its Normal-type STAB moves hard with Ice Beam thanks to its good Special Attack. Its well-rounded stats, great movepool, and consistent damage output can make even top Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, and Raikou think twice about taking it on. However, despite access to Recover, Porygon2 is extremely vulnerable to status conditions, especially Toxic poison. Porygon2's lack of super effective coverage against threats such as Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Miltank can also give it issues. As a Curse sweeper, Porygon2 is outclassed by Snorlax thanks to the latter's much better offensive and defensive stats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It is rather difficult to recommend anything over the standard sets because Porygon2's functionality is already severely limited by the obligation to run a Normal-type STAB attack, Recover, and Ice Beam on every set. Tri Attack is another alternate recoil-less STAB move that can possibly burn, paralyze, or freeze the foe, but the status inflicted is random; Thunder Wave is a more consistent option to paralyze the foe, and Return and Double-Edge are much more powerful. Toxic can be used to help pressure Pokemon like Cloyster, Snorlax, Machamp, and even Heal Bell users like Miltank, but it is useless against Steel-types like Forretress and Skarmory, unlike Thunder Wave. Thief can also be used to steal the foe's item. However, this move is very weak and is an inferior support move compared to Thunder Wave. Reflect can also be used to increase Porygon2's team's Defense for 5 turns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Skarmory, and Steelix can easily stop the Curse set by phazing it with Roar or Whirlwind. Skarmory can also poison Porygon2 with Toxic, beating it and shutting it down. Steelix can take Porygon2 out with Explosion, although this is more of a last resort option. Tyranitar can beat Porygon2 with Toxic, Crunch, Dynamic Punch, or its Curse + Roar set. Raikou can only beat Porygon2 with Reflect and Roar, so it is a shaky check at best.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Forretress</strong>: These two Pokemon can set up Spikes in front of Porygon2 and then poison it with Toxic or take it out with Explosion. Cloyster doesn't want to take a potential Thunder, however.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Miltank and Umbreon can stomach an unboosted Return, heal off the damage, and lower Porygon2's Attack with Growl or Charm. Miltank in particular can heal the damage done with Milk Drink and remove any paralysis inflicted by Porygon2 with Heal Bell. Misdreavus tanks any of Porygon2's attacks and threatens to Perish Trap it or inflict status on it.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Machamp is one of the best checks to Porygon2 because it can stomach Porygon2's moves and 2HKO it with Cross Chop. However, when switching in, Machamp should try to time its entry on a turn that Porygon2 is using Recover or Ice Beam, as it takes hefty damage from Double-Edge and does not want to get paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Porygon2 is shut down by common Toxic users such as Cloyster, Umbreon, and Forretress, as the status condition's residual damage makes it much harder for Porygon2 to heal itself. Paralysis is also annoying for Porygon2 because it prevents it from consistently healing with Recover.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Thunder Wave": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Porygon2 is one of the best Thunder Wave users in the game because it has good mixed offenses and coverage while being difficult to take down thanks to its good defenses and Recover letting it keep itself healthy and continue spamming Thunder Wave. Double-Edge is Porygon2's strongest STAB attack, and it can 3HKO Raikou and 4HKO Snorlax. While Thunder Wave is the first move of choice, Porygon2 can instead use Thunder to hit Pokemon such as Cloyster, Skarmory, and Forretress. Without Thunder, Porygon2 cannot touch these Pokemon, though paralyzing them isn't bad either. Ice Beam deals with any Ground-type such as Steelix, Marowak, or Rhydon that tries to switch into Thunder Wave. It also 3HKOes Zapdos and can be used to chip or freeze Tyranitar, Miltank, and Umbreon, which all otherwise stomach Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and offensive Cloyster love Porygon2's ability to spread paralysis easily so they can focus on cleaning late-game without worrying about being outsped themselves. Machamp can also take out defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon and Miltank, which all take little damage from Porygon2's moves. Pokemon like Starmie, Cloyster, and Vaporeon appreciate Porygon2's Thunder Wave support and can also help it by threatening Steelix, which takes little damage from Double-Edge but is chipped by Porygon2's Ice Beam. Electric-types like Raikou, Zapdos, and Jolteon appreciate Porygon2's ability to threaten Ground-type Pokemon like Rhydon and Marowak.</p>"
        },
        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Porygon2's above average stats, typing, and access to Recover make a Curse set not only viable but also quite distinctive. The combination of boosting its physical stats and Recover's 32 PP allows it to combat and often beat Curse Snorlax and other Curse boosters. Boosted STAB Double-Edge hits like a truck against targets that don't resist it and should be chosen if Porygon2 is on a team that provides it with paralysis or poison support. Return is slightly weaker than Double-Edge, but it has the benefit of a recoil-free STAB attack and more PP, further enhancing Porygon2's potential to win via stalling the foe. Ice Beam rounds out Porygon2's coverage and is often the preferred fourth move, as it can hurt Pokemon that resist or are immune to its Normal-type STAB attacks such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Misdreavus. It also provides a 10% chance to freeze the opposing Pokemon, further solidifying its offensive tools against other Curse users. Thunderbolt is another option for the fourth move to hit Cloyster, Forretress, and Skarmory harder.</p> <p>Ideally, Porygon2 should be used mid- to late-game after its checks have been softened or knocked out in order to avoid taking status or unnecessary damage and increase its chances of sweeping. Porygon2 can also set up if it is the last Pokemon left on the team because it won't be able to be phazed by Roar or Whirlwind users like Steelix and Skarmory and can threaten the freeze if a Normal-resistant Pokemon tries to set up Curse alongside it. Recover's massive PP allows Porygon2 to go toe-to-toe with Raikou and Zapdos as well, a feat that shouldn't be overlooked.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Partners such as Machamp, Marowak, and Rhydon can help weaken or take out the Steel-type Pokemon that are not threatened by any of Porygon2's moves. If Porygon2 is running Thunderbolt, partners that can deal with Marowak and Rhydon such as Starmie, Suicune, and Exeggutor are needed. Umbreon and Miltank also stop Porygon2 dead in its tracks, so teammates like Machamp and Heracross are appreciated. Porygon2 also appreciates Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Starmie. Heal Bell support from Blissey and Miltank can also be run to help with status conditions, but then Porygon2's team will require a solid Machamp answer such as Starmie or Alakazam. Snorlax can also make a good teammate, as mixed sets can lure Porygon2's counters and potentially knock them out, or it can remove them with Self-Destruct, giving Porygon2 better opportunities to sweep.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Stantler is quite the threatening Pokemon thanks to its solid offensive stats and a variety of support moves including Hypnosis, Light Screen, and Reflect. In addition, unlike most other Normal-types in GSC NU, it is quite strong even when unboosted and has crucial coverage in Earthquake to actually threaten Rock- and Steel-types. Stantler is a defining member of the lead metagame, able to effectively put something to sleep before dishing out damage with its powerful Return. Stantler is also quite fast for the tier, outspeeding Pokemon such as Kingler, Weezing, Chinchou, and Dewgong. However, Stantler has a poor matchup against the most common Pokemon in the tier, Xatu, and also struggles with other top-tier Pokemon such as Primeape. Furthermore, while its defensive stats are passable, they are far from amazing, which can make it difficult to switch in throughout a battle. Return is a mandatory STAB move that hits a vast majority of the tier for a 3HKO. Earthquake complements Return well, hitting the common Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Pupitar for decent damage and OHKOing Magnemite and the rare Gastly. Hypnosis is another valuable tool in Stantler's moveset, as it can shut down Stantler's checks temporarily as well as stop slower setup sweepers. Thief's ability to make defensive Pokemon such as Azumarill and Dewgong much easier to break through by stealing their Leftovers makes it invaluable for Stantler's offensive teammates. On teams with setup sweepers such as Kingler and Primeape, Stantler can run Light Screen or Reflect over its other supporting moves to make their time setting up much easier, especially Light Screen in Kingler's case. Finally, when paired with a Agility + Baton Pass user such as Farfetch'd, Stantler can run Curse to boost its Attack, turning it into a powerful sweeper while retaining +1 Speed after one use.</p> <p>Stantler best fits on offensive teams, starting the game off well by potentially sleeping a slower lead such as Wigglytuff or Pineco and later stealing valuable Leftovers from bulky Pokemon that could give its team trouble. Weezing is one of Stantler's best partners, as it greatly helps Stantler with its weakness to Fighting-types, while Stantler can support Weezing well with Thief and Hypnosis. Anti-Xatu Pokemon such as Ninetales and Dewgong also assist Stantler with its poor matchup against the Psychic bird; Dewgong in particular enjoys Stantler's ability to blow through Chinchou with Earthquake. Finally, setup sweepers that can have a hard time setting up, such as Kingler and Primeape, benefit from Stantler's ability to shut one check down and provide Light Screen and Reflect support.</p>"

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>With this set, Stantler becomes an incredibly solid anti-lead with better longevity than a dedicated lead set. Its ability to stay in on Thunder Wave variants of Wigglytuff, opposing Stantler leads, and Rapidash can be invaluable for teams lacking switch-ins for those Pokemon. Stantler is also able to switch in throughout the game much better thanks to said longevity. Return and Earthquake hit everything in GSC NU for neutral damage, making them the best options for RestTalk Stantler to still keep its solid offensive prowess.</p> <p>Unfortunately, RestTalk Xatu has an excellent matchup against Stantler because Return cannot 2HKO it and Xatu outspeeds and reliably 3HKOes in return with Psychic or Drill Peck. One way to improve Stantler's chances is to pair it with a Light Screen user such as Azumarill, which also doubles as a check to fast and powerful Fire-types and some Water-types, or Ivysaur, which also checks Chinchou and Primeape. While these Pokemon are passive, RestTalk Stantler can compensate for this with its high-Base Power attacks, perfect coverage, and good longevity behind a screen.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Smeargle learns almost every move, so it is dangerous through its unpredictability. In particular, there is no way to know what a lead Smeargle is going to do for sure. It has access to Spore, a reliable sleeping move that no other viable Pokemon can use, and with access to Baton Pass and Spikes alongside Spore, it can do a solid job of supporting an offensive team. However, the fact that Smeargle is slower than many common leads and can't take many attacks restricts its viability. In addition, its user has to make key predictions around the timing of its use of moves like Spore, and choosing the wrong move or the wrong turn to use a specific move will typically result in Smeargle becoming fodder. Straying from the sets outlined in this analysis may be a wise choice, because while they are effective, people will expect them, and one of Smeargle's most valuable traits is its unpredictability.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rapid Spin, which needs Pursuit support for Ghost-types, can be frustrating for an opposing Spiker to deal with when they can't safely come in because of Spore and the fourth move that could be Present for Cloyster or Sacred Fire for Forretress, but coverage is lost, and it can be hard to switch Smeargle in safely. Perish Song pairs well with Spider Web and Destiny Bond. Thunder Wave cripples Sleep Talk users, especially Zapdos and Raikou. Super Fang does decent damage to every Pokemon bar Ghost-types, but RestTalk users aren't bothered by it much. A TrapPass set with Spider Web and Baton Pass can try to trap basically anything that switches into it, and Smeargle can use the combination of Protect and Disable to block phazing attempts. It should be noted that trapping moves are illegal on the same set as sleep moves, so Smeargle can't use Spore with Spider Web. Thanks to Leftovers, Recover could give Smeargle another shot at pulling off a TrapPass or passing defensive boosts, which is most likely to be found in a Baton Pass chain, but it is too fragile to take attacks except something like Surf from Cloyster or Pursuit from Umbreon. Counter allows Smeargle to threaten physical attackers that target its awful bulk, and lowering Defense EVs to get some Counter OHKO benchmarks is a viable option. For example, limiting Smeargle to 216 Defense EVs ensures that Counter will OHKO Snorlax if it uses Double-Edge. Thief can be used in a spare slot to steal the foe's item, which will typically deprive them of Leftovers's passive recovery for the remainder of a game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Any Attacking Move</strong>: Any reasonably powerful attack will deal plenty of damage to Smeargle, but one should be wary of moves such as Mirror Coat and Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phaze</strong>: Baton Pass chains can be stopped by Haze, Whirlwind, Roar, or Perish Song, but Smeargle has Spore to prevent these moves from being used.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion threatens Baton Pass chains, but Smeargle has Spore and Substitute to solve this problem.</p> <p><strong>Fast Thief + Lovely Kiss</strong>: Although Smeargle usually has Miracle Berry, Nidoking and Jynx can use Thief against Smeargle to block Spore and threaten Smeargle teams, especially Baton Pass ones, with Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk</strong>: With Sleep Talk, Pokemon can absorb Spore so that they won't be taken advantage of by Smeargle teams. However, if a switch to a Sleep Talk user is anticipated, Smeargle can use a move like Agility, Substitute, or Baton Pass as they switch in to maintain momentum.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is used to set up dangerous setup sweepers or other Baton Pass users with Speed boosts. Smeargle is the only Baton Pass user that can always pass a boost even if an opponent has two phazers, assuming you get it in versus a non-phazer, which makes it a staple Pokemon for basically all teams centered around Baton Pass. For example, if you have it in against an opposing Snorlax, you can use Agility, and if their phazer is switched in, you can use Spore and then Baton Pass on the next turn.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Substitute blocks status from Pokemon such as Exeggutor once Miracle Berry is used, scouts Explosion from opposing Pokemon such as Forretress, exploits the low accuracy of Thunder, and gives a teammate a free turn to set up. Spikes secures many relevant OHKOs, most importantly +6 Snorlax's Mega Kick or Double-Edge versus Cloyster and Suicune. Although it's risky to switch Smeargle into a Pokemon such as Snorlax, Vaporeon, or Quagsire as they set up, if you succeed, you can lock them in with Encore and gain momentum. Encore can also lock Pokemon such as Skarmory into Rest. Destiny Bond has some potential to take something out with Smeargle, especially after Agility is used. Miracle Berry deals with status, especially sleep and paralysis, which can be problematic for Agility + Baton Pass teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow wallbreakers such as Marowak, Belly Drum Snorlax, Meditate Machamp, and the uncommon Quagsire appreciate boosts from Smeargle's Agility. Marowak can threaten phazers such as Raikou, Tyranitar, and Golem, handle Explosion users such as Gengar with Earthquake, use Rock Slide to score flinches against checks like Skarmory after getting Speed boosts from Smeargle, and take Electric-type attacks from Sleep Talk variants of Zapdos and Raikou that are common switch-ins to Spore from Smeargle. Belly Drum Snorlax can use Lovely Kiss to get a free turn to set up. Machamp is helpful in breaking CurseLax.</p> <p>Scizor can deal with Explosion Exeggutor with Hidden Power Bug. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fighting can be used for pressuring phazers like Tyranitar and Houndoom, doing more to Steel-types than Hidden Power Bug, and threatening the most dominant Pokemon in GSC OU, Snorlax, whose Sleep Talk + Curse set is very threatening for most Baton Pass teams. Furthermore, it can also handle some variants of Forretress, whose Explosion can be annoying for Agility receivers. Jolteon forces phazers such as Skarmory and Suicune out, making it an essential teammate for maintaining Baton Pass chains. Thanks to Confuse Ray, Mean Look, and Baton Pass, Umbreon can be frustrating for phazers. With Sand Attack, it can also be an emergency option for setup attackers. Smeargle can also put Pokemon that Umbreon has trapped to sleep, which leaves the foe helpless unless they have Sleep Talk.</p>"
        },
        "Spikes": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set acts as a Spiker. The threat of Spore limits Pokemon that can safely switch into Smeargle and forces switches, and if landed on the right target, it can swing a game in your favor. Present and Sacred Fire are primarily used for the purpose of preventing spinners from keeping Smeargle's Spikes off the field; the former can do enormous amounts of damage to Cloyster and Starmie, while the latter is a reliable Fire-type attack for Forretress and threatens to burn Golem. Also, phazers might come in and get crippled if they fear the Baton Pass set; Present is for Raikou and Suicune, while Sacred Fire hits Skarmory and Steelix super effectively and can burn Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon. Mirror Coat OHKOes special attackers such as Zapdos, and with Destiny Bond, Smeargle can attempt to score a one-for-two trade, though many people will expect these moves on Spikes Smeargle sets. In addition, a player should remember that Mirror Coat will always fail against Hidden Power and moves used via Sleep Talk. Furthermore, lowering Special Defense EVs to get some Mirror Coat OHKO benchmarks is a viable strategy. For example, limiting Smeargle to 200 Special Defense EVs ensures that Mirror Coat will OHKO Raikou if it uses Thunderbolt. However, lowering your Special Defense would also lower your Special Attack, so despite Smeargle primarily using Sacred Fire for the burn chance, the fact that Sacred Fire's damage output would be reduced means this EV reduction strategy is not without drawbacks.</p> <p>This set competes with Cloyster for the Spiker slot on offensive teams, and generally speaking, Cloyster is a more viable choice. Offensively, its STAB Surf does decent damage to most Pokemon that resist Explosion. Defensively, its considerable physical bulk allows it to switch in on Ground-types such as Steelix and Marowak. Smeargle's advantages over Cloyster mainly come down to Spore and surprise value.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Smeargle is frail, it fits on fast-paced teams. Phazers with offensive presence such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Rhydon can exploit Spikes support from Smeargle. Thief users like Jynx help Spikes wear down an opposing team more quickly. Present can surprise Cloyster, Raikou, and Exeggutor so that attackers such as Vaporeon can shine. If Mirror Coat is used to surprise Pokemon such as Zapdos, attackers such as Machamp and Exeggutor will appreciate it.</p>"

  "Miltank": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Miltank is a cow on a mission: in the stall-oriented GSC metagame, spreading and removing status is paramount. With the prevalence of moves such as Rest, Toxic, and Thunder Wave, it is more than likely that at any given moment, several of Miltank's teammates will be debilitated by a status aliment. However, because of its access to Heal Bell, Miltank can eliminate these status problems in one turn, allowing its teammates to get back into the battle without any hampering status conditions. Miltank is arguably one of the best Heal Bell users in the game because of its great bulk, Speed, and access to an instant recovery move with no drawbacks--Milk Drink.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all alfalfa and flower-filled fields for this bovine. Miltank faces stiff competition for the cleric spot from Blissey. Miltank also sports a rather low Special Defense that can really hinder its ability to counter major threats in the GSC metagame. Miltank is straightforward and limited, but when given the opportunity, it can provide an excellent support option that should never be overlooked.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Miltank does have a few other options it can utilize. Psych Up has its occasional uses; stealing a Belly Drum, Swords Dance, or Curse boost and sweeping is fun, but lacks the consistency of Curse or Growl and is generally a riskier option. Earthquake can be used if you feel like Miltank needs the coverage, and Seismic Toss can be used if you want to have more consistent damage output against Steel-types, but both are generally outclassed by Body Slam and Growl. Curse is a possibility, but Snorlax, Kangaskhan, or Porygon2 will generally serve you much better in that regard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Miltank is a great support Pokemon, but it isn't without its counters. Special attacks are the bane of Miltank's existence. Zapdos doesn't give a rip about paralysis because of RestTalk, and it has Thunder to slam Miltank's weak Special Defense. Vaporeon's access to Growth and Surf make it a major thorn in Miltank's side. It can easily set up and shrug off any paralysis because of its low Speed. After one Growth, Surf is almost always a 2HKO. Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress all resist Normal-type moves and can either phaze Miltank or set up entry hazards. Machamp is also notable because of it is one of the few Curse users that Miltank cannot counter with Growl. Machamp's super effective Cross Chop will do heavy damage, 2HKOing Miltank with no boosts and OHKOing after one boost from Curse.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with sleep moves will pose a threat to Miltank as long as Sleep Clause hasn't been activated; Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Nidoking work in this regard. Exeggutor can also use Explosion to nail Miltank if need be. However, if Sleep Clause has already been activated or Lovely Kiss misses, Nidoking will be unable to check Miltank, and will find itself countered by Miltank instead. Gengar works as a counter because it takes no damage from Body Slam and has a slew of special attacks to fire at Miltank. Misdreavus works much like Gengar, but with Mean Look and Perish Song instead of an all-out assault.</p> <p>Forretress also deserves a special mention as a check because of its ability to set up Spikes while taking a pittance from any of Miltank's attacks. Forretress doesn't mind paralysis, and the reduction in attacking power from Growl is not as important to it as it is to Pokemon such as Snorlax. Cloyster functions in the same way with the additional ability to fire off Surfs at Miltank's lower Special Defense stat. Keep in mind that Miltank's high Defense and access to Milk Drink and Heal Bell will make it difficult to wear down with Toxic. However, while time consuming, it is possible to outstall Heal Bell's PP with Toxic, assuming Miltank stays in. Miltank, however, doesn't enjoy being put to sleep or frozen. It cannot remove these status conditions with Heal Bell, meaning that it will be crippled in its main position as a status remover. That being said, strong special attacks remain the best way to take down Miltank.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Cleric": {
          "description": "<p>Heal Bell is the mother's milk of all Miltank sets; with Heal Bell, Miltank can switch in on a physical attack that does little damage, use Heal Bell to clear its teammates' status, and then switch out to a newly-cured team member. Heal Bell is an amazing support move because it allows Pokemon that lack reliable recovery to use Rest, switch out, and then have their sleep removed so they can jump back into the fray at full health. The usefulness of Rest and Heal Bell as a strategy cannot be understated. The extra moveslot is incredibly useful for many Pokemon and allows instant recovery to be viable for many sweepers. Getting rid of nasty poison and paralysis with Heal Bell is also useful, especially against stall teams. Without Toxic damage, many stall teams will struggle to do anything meaningful against Miltank and its teammates. Miltank also has Milk Drink's recovery, which, combined with Heal Bell, can allow Miltank to plop its large derriere down and stall in its own right.</p> <p>Heal Bell and Milk Drink are great, but Growl and Body Slam are what really set Miltank apart from other Heal Bell users such as Blissey. Compared to Blissey, Miltank has better Speed, Defense, and Attack. Miltank can also use Growl, allowing it to serve as a great Snorlax check by removing the Attack boosts from Curse. Growl Miltank serves as a great check to Curse users in general because it can use Growl's 64 PP to outstall Curse's 16 PP and prevent Curse users from gaining any Attacks boosts with which to sweep. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heracross, and Rhydon will all struggle to get any sort of boosts with Curse, and can be easily crippled by Body Slam's paralysis rate. The paralysis rate from Body Slam is especially concerning for opponents without any way to remove status because they will often find themselves crippled and setup bait for the rest of the match.</p> <p>Miltank also has great Speed, giving it the chance to nullify its opponent's Attack with Growl or use Milk Drink before they land a possibly lethal blow. This combination of bulk and Speed can make Miltank very difficult to take down. Growl has the practical benefit of essentially boosting Miltank's Defense while refraining from lowering its Speed, as is the case with Curse. In order to remove the Attack drops from Growl, the opponent is forced to switch out. Forcing these kinds of switches is great for offensive momentum and stopping Curse sweepers in their tracks. Body Slam's 30% paralysis rate serves well alongside Growl by crippling both the physical attacker's Speed and Attack. Miltank is a great counter to physical attackers, but be wary of users of Curse that also carry Substitute, though they are rare. Snorlax with Belly Drum is also capable of breaking through Miltank's defenses.</p> <p>Miltank is easy to fit on most defensive, and even some offensive, teams. Miltank's ability to remove status easily with Heal Bell is wonderful when paired with bulky sweepers that need recovery but don't want to give up two moveslots to Rest and Sleep Talk. Miltank works well with literally any Pokemon that needs Rest, but also needs to ditch Sleep Talk to help its own coverage. Notable partners include Snorlax with Belly Drum, Raikou, and Suicune. With Heal Bell support, Snorlax can use Belly Drum, attack until its health gets low, Rest, switch out to Miltank, and then switch in to use Belly Drum again once Miltank uses Heal Bell; Marowak is in the same boat, except with Swords Dance over Belly Drum. Skarmory makes a good partner because it can wall the few physical threats that Miltank struggles to take down, such as Marowak and Belly Drum Snorlax. Raikou and Suicune can also work well alongside Miltank because of their ability to take special attacks and to deal out damage with Thunderbolt and Surf, respectively.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Blissey is largely overshadowed by Snorlax due to Snorlax's incredible special bulk being complemented by tremendous offensive power. Blissey has even greater special bulk than Snorlax but pales in comparison in terms of the damage it can dish out. Its primary role outside of simply taking hits is to cure its team of status with Heal Bell, and its remaining moveslots tend to be used to deter foes that might otherwise try to take advantage of it. Blissey does have access to interesting options such as Counter and Thunder Wave, but unfortunately they are incompatible with Heal Bell, so Blissey can only make use of them when it has dropped what is arguably its most useful move. Nonetheless, it is possible to play Blissey aggressively by taking advantage of its access to coverage moves, status moves, and Counter. Blissey's biggest flaw overall is that it struggles to deter many dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax and Nidoking, as well as struggling to fit coverage for both Cloyster and Forretress on the same set. As long as Pokemon on the opposing team have Rest, it struggles to make any offensive progress whatsoever, unlike Snorlax and Raikou, with which Blissey competes for the role of special wall. Furthermore, it is susceptible to being OHKOed by Explosion from the special attackers it would ideally be walling like Exeggutor and Gengar. Despite its drawbacks, Blissey still takes special hits better than any other Pokemon by far and is therefore a worthy consideration for defensive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect can be used to give Blissey's teammates an easier time switching into Snorlax and allow Blissey to potentially take on mixed attackers like Nidoking and Tyranitar and Explosion users like Gengar and Cloyster. However, it is illegal with Heal Bell, and Blissey risks being OHKOed by a critical hit from Snorlax's unboosted Double-Edge at any given time. Growl is attainable alongside Heal Bell and can be used in a similar capacity to Reflect. It can be used to prevent Snorlax from setting up Curse against Blissey and encourage foes to switch out, and it also has a lot of PP, which can be useful for PP stalling in some scenarios. However, Blissey may not be able to punish the switches it encourages effectively, it remains susceptible to critical hits from Snorlax and other Pokemon, and using Growl turns Blissey into an ideal setup opportunity for Belly Drum Snorlax variants. Thunderbolt is an option on Blissey that hits both Skarmory and Cloyster super effectively and has perfect accuracy, although Blissey tends to prefer either Thunder's paralysis chance or Flamethrower's super effective damage against Forretress and Steelix.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is the primary reason for Blissey not being common, as it can shrug off anything that Blissey can do to it bar Counter and can easily use Blissey as setup fodder or hit it for massive damage with its STAB attacks. Curse Snorlax is a massive threat to offensive teams and Belly Drum Snorlax is a huge threat to defensive teams, and Blissey can do little to prevent either from setting up freely against it.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Machamp is the only Pokemon that can outright OHKO Blissey with an unboosted attack other than Explosion and Self-Destruct, and no matter what Blissey does, Machamp retains the ability to OHKO with a critical hit Cross Chop. However, most Machamp despise being inflicted with status, so they must be wary when switching into Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most strong physical attackers can severely threaten Blissey with their STAB attacks. Marowak and Heracross both 2HKO Blissey, while Golem and Rhydon usually 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Attack stats can lure in Blissey and then use Explosion to remove it. Even weaker Explosion users such as Gengar can OHKO Blissey due to its low Defense, and once Blissey is removed, special attackers such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Jynx become much more threatening.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Nidoking, Tentacruel, and Muk can switch into Toxic Blissey with relative impunity, as they will usually take very little damage from Blissey's attacks. They do have to beware of Blissey having the correct coverage move or a less common move such as Sing, Thunder Wave, or Counter, however.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Attackers</strong>: Mixed attackers such as Gengar, Dragonite, and Tyranitar can be quite threatening to Blissey. They can run Dynamic Punch to deal massive damage to Blissey and potentially prevent it from recovering with the accompanying confusion. Although uncommon as a mixed attacker, Zapdos can also use Drill Peck to threaten a 4HKO against Blissey, which is enough to put it in danger of being taken out by a critical hit or force it to use up all of its Soft-Boiled PP.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While Blissey is commonly seen as one of the best Pokemon to counter status thanks to Heal Bell, it too must be wary of some status afflictions. Blissey is highly susceptible to sleep moves, and once it is put to sleep, it will be unable to cure its teammates of status. Pokemon such as Jynx and Gengar can try to fish for a freeze against Blissey due to its low damage output, and if frozen, Blissey will be unable to cure itself. One should also keep in mind that Toxic has more PP than Heal Bell, which can lead to dangerous late-game situations if Blissey needs to cure particular teammates or itself. If Blissey lacks Heal Bell, it will need to be careful of poison and paralysis too, although its enormous special bulk will often allow it to take on special attackers even when afflicted with these.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers with Rest</strong>: Setup sweepers with Rest can take Blissey's status attacks and take advantage of its passivity to set up boosts before curing themselves and attempting a sweep. Curse Snorlax, Curse Tyranitar, Growth Vaporeon, and Curse Heracross are some of the most common sweepers to use this combination, but others such as Skarmory, Steelix, Jolteon, and Kangaskhan can also pull this off if Blissey lacks the necessary coverage moves to deal with them.</p> <p><strong>Belly Drum Users</strong>: Blissey's meager attacking power affords Belly Drum users such as Charizard, Quagsire, Clefable, and the aforementioned Snorlax a great opportunity to set up for a sweep. While Blissey's Toxic can discourage these foes from switching in while its team is healthy, the passive damage alone cannot be depended upon to stop a sweep from these Pokemon, as damage is not taken by the poisoned foe on turns on which a Pokemon is KOed. It's therefore crucial for Blissey to prioritize keeping key checks healthy with its Heal Bell support when facing Belly Drum users.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blissey's aims with this set are to keep its team healthy and to take strong special hits for its team. Its main form of utility is Heal Bell, which works well with teammates that use Rest, such as Snorlax and Skarmory. Blissey most often uses Flamethrower as its attacking move, which works well in combination with Toxic, since several notable Toxic-immune Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress, are weak to Fire. Forretress in particular can put a lot of pressure on more defensive teams due to its access to Spikes and Rapid Spin and is therefore one of the main reasons for Blissey to choose Flamethrower over Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. However, Ice Beam can be used to make Zapdos less of a safe answer while simultaneously threatening Toxic-immune Nidoking. Additionally, the chance of inflicting a game-changing freeze is available should Ice Beam be chosen. Toxic is a common choice for Blissey to allow it to pose a significant threat to dangerous sweepers like Machamp and Marowak in the long term, and Toxic can also force Pokemon that have Restâ€”most commonly Snorlaxâ€”to use it. This can provide Blissey's teammates with the opportunity they need to set up a sweep.</p> <p>An alternative to Toxic is Light Screen, which Blissey can use to better protect itself against Growth sweepers like Vaporeon and support its team. This can be particularly useful for reducing risk against Zapdos and Raikou when using powerful sweepers like Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak, two Pokemon that significantly benefit from being able to find opportunities to set up from full health. Light Screen can also be used alongside Toxic by forgoing attacking moves entirely, although this can allow low HP Pokemon and dangerous Toxic-immune Pokemon like Nidoking and Gengar opportunities to recover their health with Leftovers and attack freely and is therefore a choice only suitable to particular teams, such as those that use Spikes with a Ghost-type to improve the matchup against Forretress and prevent free Leftovers recovery. Another option that Blissey can use to punish greedy opponents is Present, a move that is extremely dangerous to any Pokemon with a secondary or singular type that deals special damage, such as Cloyster, Raikou, Tyranitar, and Vaporeon. While it is not threatening at all to Pokemon like Snorlax and Zapdos, which have Normal and Flying as their singular and secondary types, it limits the number of Pokemon that can take Blissey on safely and can severely punish Pokemon that are threatened by it. Sing is useful as a surprise sleep move to catch Pokemon off guard, and its low accuracy is somewhat offset by the fact that Blissey can typically find opportunities to use it many times during any given game. However, it will inevitably miss on the first attempt a lot of the time, which unfortunately ruins the surprise factor entirely and allows the opponent to safely handle it with a Sleep Talk user. Lastly, Blissey uses Soft-Boiled to keep itself healthy, which works well with Heal Bell to ensure Blissey does not become permanently paralyzed or poisoned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey works best with defensive teams due to their ability to better handle Pokemon that can take advantage of it, such as Snorlax. Pokemon such as Skarmory that can take on powerful physical attackers make very beneficial teammates. For mixed Snorlax variants, Rock-types such as Golem and Tyranitar can prove to be useful, and Blissey can provide them with Heal Bell support in the event that they become poisoned. Blissey can make a wide variety of strategies successful due to its unique support options and the fact that it takes dangerous special attackers on so effectively. Sweepers such as Machamp, Marowak, and Snorlax can take advantage of Blissey's support by running Rest alongside their boosting and attacking moves, allowing them to risk taking hits they might usually not be able to. Belly Drum Snorlax in particular is a great choice alongside Heal Bell Blissey with Flamethrower. Even 999 Attack Snorlax can sometimes struggle to overcome Skarmory, as Skarmory can boost with Curse and then try to heal off Snorlax's damage with Rest, leaving it walled. If its entry is timed correctly, Flamethrower Blissey can force Skarmory out before it can burn any sleep turns, which can lead to Snorlax getting to face an incapacitated Skarmory that can't protect itself with Defense boosts. However, it should be noted that a Skarmory with RestTalk or Heal Bell support can prevent this strategy from working. Pokemon such as Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Tyranitar are all crippled by status, so using Blissey alongside them can allow them to take risks they might normally be severely punished for. Pokemon that use instant recovery moves, such as Umbreon and Belly Drum Clefable, can also take advantage of Heal Bell support so they can be less afraid of status inflictions. However, the fact that these Pokemon share a Fighting weakness with Blissey can introduce a significant Machamp weakness, so this must be considered when building a team with Blissey. Starmie is another very popular choice for a Blissey teammate thanks to its excellent type synergy, instant recovery move, and access to Rapid Spin, which greatly benefits the defensively inclined teams Blissey tends to be a part of. In particular, Starmie's excellent matchup against Machamp is very useful to Blissey teams. Cloyster is also a great option to use alongside Heal Bell Blissey, since many Cloyster will try to trade poison inflictions when setting up Spikes. If Rapid Spin is used on Cloyster or a teammate, this can make it seriously difficult for the opponent to keep Spikes up. Aside from Starmie, Zapdos and Misdreavus are useful teammates to deal with Machamp should Cloyster be chosen. Zapdos is also solid against a variety of other troublesome offensive threats, including Nidoking, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, while Misdreavus can check Snorlax alongside Skarmory, spinblock when used with Spikes, and nullify Explosion that may be used to target Blissey or its teammates. Moreover, both commonly run Rest and can be cured of sleep by Blissey.</p>"
        },
        "Counter": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blissey can choose to employ a more aggressive approach by forgoing its role as a cleric and taking advantage of its access to powerful status moves and coverage attacks. Despite its lack of attacking power with which to threaten Snorlax, it can retain efficacy in this role thanks to the threat of Counter, which makes any physical attacker think twice before attempting to take Blissey down. Thunder Wave allows Blissey to cripple any Pokemon that is not a Ground-type, which can be very useful in setting up slow but powerful Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and Snorlax for a sweep. It pairs well with Ice Beam, which hits Thunder Wave-immune Ground-types super effectively and has a chance of inflicting freeze. Alternatively, Sing can be used as Blissey's status move, which can incapacitate threats such as Snorlax, Cloyster, and Forretress for extended periods of time. However, Sing's effectiveness is somewhat contingent on the opponent not expecting it, and it is inconsistent due to its very low accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential effectiveness of the move and the opportunities to use it generated by the prevalence of special attackers makes it a worthwhile consideration. Thunder can also be used as a pseudo-status move if one's aim is to maximize coverage and include multiple of Blissey's high utility moves on the same set all at once. It does massive damage to Pokemon like Cloyster and Skarmory and has a decent chance of inflicting paralysis. An alternative option for an attacking move is Flamethrower, which hits Steelix, Forretress, and Skarmory for heavy damage. If Blissey is only running one attacking move, Ice Beam and Flamethrower are the preferred options due to no Pokemon being immune to them. However, it is worthwhile considering using a Blissey with Thunder as a second attack, as Cloyster, a very important target, will often try to set Spikes against Blissey and will be significantly impaired if Thunder lands.</p> <p>Other than status moves and Heal Bell, by far the highest utility move Blissey can take advantage of is Counter. Counter allows Blissey to threaten the physical attackers that target Blissey's awful Defense. It is most effective when the opponent is not expecting it, although even after it has been revealed, the opponent will be hard-pressed to take Blissey down without resorting to physical attacks, which can make Blissey quite awkward to deal with for more offensive teams. Unfortunately, Counter is incompatible with Heal Bell, which leaves Counter Blissey rather susceptible to status and inhibits its ability to pose a longer term threat against defensive teams whether it runs Soft-Boiled or not. Lastly, while it might seem like an alien idea to drop Soft-Boiled, Blissey's huge special bulk and its Leftovers can allow it to last a surprisingly long time even without its trademark healing move, and if Blissey manages to catch just one Pokemon with Counter, the opponent will often be at a large disadvantage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Counter Blissey fits less well on ultra-defensive teams and is instead best placed alongside powerful attackers that can take better advantage of the status inflictions and forced switches it can provide. Some of these include Snorlax, Marowak, and Machamp; however, there are many possible options available. It is important to be able to deal with or threaten Curse Snorlax, as while Counter Blissey can dissuade it from attacking immediately, Blissey can do little to prevent it from setting up. Machamp is one of the only Pokemon that can offensively threaten a Curse-boosted Snorlax and greatly benefits from Counter Blissey's ability to discourage unboosted Snorlax from hitting it as it switches in. Phazers such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Skarmory can also deal with Curse Snorlax with varying degrees of effectiveness depending on Snorlax's coverage attacks. These Pokemon also benefit from Blissey's ability to paralyze Snorlax, since they will outspeed a paralyzed Snorlax after setting up their own Curse boosts. Machamp is another Pokemon that is critical for a Blissey team to be able to handle, as it is one of the only Pokemon that can take out Blissey with a single unboosted attack other than Explosion and Self-Destruct. Some checks that go well alongside offensive Blissey include Exeggutor and Nidoking, although they are fearful of Hidden Power Bug and Earthquake. Starmie can also be used, although using it will typically cause your team to have to take a more defensive approach to Snorlax, which can then result in Counter Blissey being a poor fit due to its inability to cure Starmie and itself of status. Another option is Heracross, which checks most Machamp and Nidoking fairly well but struggles in the long term against Snorlax and often struggles to get past Skarmory and Zapdos. Lastly, it is often a good idea to bring a Spiker such as Cloyster or Forretress to assist Blissey and its team with wearing down the opposition.</p>"

What sets Pupitar apart from its exploding rock companions is Ancient Power, which has a 10% chance to boost every single stat bar accuracy and evasiveness and can make Pupitar a deadly cleaner when Water-types are removed. Forcing the opponent to switch out as Pupitar tries for an Ancient Power boost is where it shines the most. Sure, it's a 10% chance, but it's a 10% chance to give a power boost to the unresisted dual STAB combination of Rock Slide and Earthquake.</p> <p>Screech Pupitar is a solid answer to Curse Wigglytuff and Porygon while also giving it much better odds to break through Hidden Power Electric Octillery with Spikes up. Although it can be unreliable at timesâ€”and very luck dependentâ€”even without boosts, Pupitar has a great time against some of the great staples in the tier, such as non-Sunny Day and Giga Drain Xatu variants, even having a chance of surviving three STAB Psychics; Weezing; the aforementioned dreaded Curse Normal-types; Magnemite; and Pineco. Unfortunately, Water-types and Hidden Power Grass-wielding Fire-types are quite troublesome for the rock worm, but that's when its teammates come in. Defensively, Chinchou and Azumarill can handle both kinds of foes reliably, and offensively, options such as Substitute Explosion Graveler can be used to take out Water-types before Pupitar is even revealed. Hitmonlee can also pair well with Pupitar to handle Dewgong and Chinchou, while Pupitar can switch into Psychic or Drill Peck aimed at Hitmonlee from Xatu. Pupitar can also get worn down fast by repeated hits from Fearow and Wigglytuff over the course of a game, especially with Spikes on the field.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Blessed with excellent stats all around, a unique typing, and an insane movepool, Tyranitar is one of the best Pokemon in GSC Ubers. Its ability to check very important Pokemon in the metagame, such as Snorlax, Mewtwo, Lugia, and Ho-Oh, coupled with key attributes like resisting Normal, having access to Curse and Roar, and having few special weaknesses means that Tyranitar fits perfectly on all kinds of teams from offense to stall. The rarity of effective checks to Tyranitar like Machamp and Nidoking in the metagame also means that Tyranitar usually feels less threatened to switch out once it starts boosting with Curse.</p> <p>However, Tyranitar often finds itself using Roar in conjunction with Spikes support as a way of making progress through teams, as the lack of a powerful STAB move means that it can't fully exploit its gargantuan base Attack stat and thus struggles with the bulky nature of the metagame. Furthermore, many teams are prepared for Tyranitar and have answers to it, such as Celebi, Golem, and Steelix, all of which greatly threaten Tyranitar, meaning a Curse Tyranitar sweep should only be considered when all of its checks are weakened or removed. Lastly, the relevance of Growth + Baton Pass Pokemon like Jolteon and Vaporeon in the tier hurts Tyranitar's ability to reliably check Pokemon it's supposed to, like Mewtwo.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Screech can be used on Curse sets as an alternative to Roar, which potentially enables Tyranitar to beat Barrier Mewtwo and Curse Snorlax one-on-one. However, it is less reliable than Roar due to its low accuracy, and running Screech means that Tyranitar can't scout for threatening foes and chip them with Spikes support. Surf can also be used over one of Rest or Roar to hit Rhydon and Golem trying to take advantage of Tyranitar staying in on them. Lastly, either Hidden Power Bug or Earthquake can be used over one of Rest or Roar as well; Hidden Power Bug is Tyranitar's strongest available move that 2HKOes Celebi, while Earthquake OHKOes Jolteon at +1 and does good damage to opposing Tyranitar without offering much outside of that.</p> <p>On the 3 Attacks set, Pursuit can be an option over either Flamethrower or Surf to trap Pokemon like Mewtwo and, in particular, Gengar. However, Pursuit is an extremely weak move, and, unless Tyranitar drops the foe's Special Defense with Crunch, the Pokemon it's supposed to trap will usually stay in on it, rendering Pursuit useless. It's also worth noting that a boosted Pursuit deals the same amount of damage that a regular Crunch does. Lastly, Gengar is not a common enough Pokemon to justify running Pursuit, making Tyranitar be better off using other moves.</p> <p>An all-out attacker set with Rock Slide, Crunch, Flamethrower and one of Dynamic Punch or Surf is also an option to maximize Tyranitar's wallbreaking capabilities. However, it's a set that is very reliant on its teammates, as without Roar and Rest, Tyranitar can't effectively do its main role of checking Snorlax throughout a game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Rhydon and Golem can immediately threaten to 2HKO Tyranitar with their Earthquake. Both Pokemon are OHKOed by Surf, however. Steelix gets a special mention, as it resists both of Tyranitar's STAB moves, can use Curse alongside Tyranitar to deny Roar attempts, and can hit back with a super effective Earthquake. However, it must be careful of Surf and Flamethrower. Marowak doesn't mind any attacks from Tyranitar aside from Crunch and Surf while threatening to OHKO Tyranitar with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Celebi</strong>: Celebi is one of the best answers to Tyranitar, as it can comfortably recover all health lost and hit back hard with a super effective Hidden Power Grass, forcing Tyranitar to use Rest or forcing it out. It should be careful of Fire Blast and Crunch variants, however, as they can potentially deal more damage to Celebi than it can recover if the respective secondary effects of their moves trigger.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Vaporeon and Suicune don't mind any of Tyranitar's attacks and can proceed to hit hard back with Surf. Quagsire can use Haze to reset all of Tyranitar's Curse boosts and takes very little from Rock Slide, Crunch, and its coverage options. While it doesn't like switching into Tyranitar directly, Cloyster functions as one of the best Tyranitar checks in the tier thanks to its ability to immediately threaten to 3HKO it with Surf due to its superior Speed.</p> <p><strong>Giga Drain Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Rock Slide and heal back the damage with Giga Drain; it should be careful of Crunch and Fire Blast variants, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor can switch into Curse Tyranitar and put it to sleep for up to six turns with Lovely Kiss and Sleep Powder, respectively, allowing Pokemon like Cloyster to come in on it for free. Toxic from Mewtwo and Forretress can eventually force Tyranitar to use Rest, leaving it similarly vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon denies Curse Tyranitar's sweep attempts thanks to Charm and its good bulk. It also takes little to no damage from any of Tyranitar's coverage attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Pokemon like Soft-Boiled Mew and Recover Mewtwo are especially annoying to Tyranitar, as thanks to their good natural bulk, they can scout what set Tyranitar is running to pivot their teammates in accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Mewtwo and Mew often run moves like Submission to immediately threaten Tyranitar with a 2HKO. Mew in particular can boost with Swords Dance and turn the 2HKO into an OHKO. Albeit rare, Machamp can KO Tyranitar even through Curse boosts thanks to Cross Chop and easily switches into it, as it resists both of its STAB attacks and is naturally bulky.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross takes a decent chunk from Rock Slide but can scare Tyranitar off with its STAB Megahorn and heal itself with Rest; it must be careful of Fire Blast, however.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "CurseTar": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Tyranitar's most popular set thanks to its good role compression: checking Snorlax, Mewtwo without a Fighting-type move, and Lugia is invaluable for many teams. Curse lets Tyranitar comfortably wall non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax while making it a potential wincon. Rock Slide is Tyranitar's attacking move of choice, as there are no Pokemon immune to Rock-type attacks. Roar phazes Curse Snorlax and Barrier Mewtwo, making this Tyranitar set the most reliable check to them in the tier. Roar also prevents Tyranitar from being phazed by opposing Tyranitar while asleep. Rest gives this set necessary longevity, as without it, Tyranitar gets worn down too quickly, preventing it from properly checking Snorlax and Mewtwo; Rest also lets Tyranitar PP stall variants of Mewtwo without a Fighting-type move. Lowering Tyranitar's Speed EVs to 204 allows it to win the Curse war against opposing Curse Tyranitar and Lugia while Speed tying with Exeggutor: this also underspeeds -1 Speed Lugia and opposing Tyranitar at neutral Speed, which allows Tyranitar to not get phazed by them. Other phazers like Whirlwind Zapdos and Ho-Oh are also discouraged from phazing Tyranitar due to their critical weakness to Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even after a Curse boost, Mew will still threaten to break through Tyranitar with a boosted Submission. Therefore, checks to it such as Barrier Mewtwo and Curse Skarmory are good teammates. Cloyster can set Spikes for Tyranitar and help it against Ground-types such as Steelix, Golem, and Rhydon. Snorlax can form a double Curse combination with Tyranitar, as they both share the same checks and counters and so can work together to wear them down. Zapdos defeats Earthquake variants of Lugia for Tyranitar and scares out Cloyster; Tyranitar switches into Snorlax and Mewtwo in return.</p>"

        "Roar + 3 Attacks": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Tyranitar's large movepool and high attacking stats let it lure and remove checks to itself and its teammates. Even on a specially oriented set, Rock Slide is mandatory, as without it, Tyranitar would not be able to check key Pokemon like Zapdos and Ho-Oh. Roar phazes Curse Snorlax and lets Tyranitar scout for threats while potentially chipping them with Spikes support. Crunch hits Mewtwo and Celebi, two of the best checks to Tyranitar, for super effective damage; it also has the added benefit of being able to drop the foe's Special Defense, which can be useful in one-on-one scenarios against non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax and Lugia. Flamethrower is commonly chosen on the last slot to hit important targets like Forretress, Skarmory, and the rare Heracross for super effective damage. Surf can be used instead to hit Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem while hitting opposing Tyranitar decently hard. It's worth mentioning that both Flamethrower and Surf hit Steelix, a Pokemon that would otherwise wall both of Tyranitar's STAB moves.</p> <p>Fire Blast is another option over Flamethrower, as it can reach some benchmarks that Flamethrower can't. For example, Fire Blast gets a guaranteed 2HKO on Steelix that Flamethrower misses out on. Fire Blast also pressures Heracross harder, as it now has a chance of being 2HKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Tyranitar's wide coverage being able to lure Steelix, Forretress, and Skarmory. Given that Curse Snorlax can potentially break through Tyranitar, more offensive ways of handling it are important. Thus, teammates such as Explosion Cloyster, Mewtwo, Exeggutor, and Mew are needed. Jolteon and Vaporeon are other good offensive teammates, as they can use Growth and Baton Pass to allow Tyranitar to wallbreak a lot easier. Tyranitar checks Snorlax for them in return. However, Tyranitar is only a temporary check to Snorlax due to it not being able to break through Curse sets in a one-on-one scenario. Additionally, Tyranitar's usefulness is decreased if Snorlax is running Earthquake. As such, checks to Earthquake variants of Snorlax, such as Barrier Mewtwo and Curse Lugia, are recommended. Mono-attacker Snorlax appreciates Tyranitar's ability to cook Steel-types like Skamory, Forretress, and Steelix with Flamethrower, while it switches into Zapdos for Tyranitar in return.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent stat distribution, unique typing, and wide movepool, Tyranitar is a key Pokemon in GSC OU. Most notably, a combination of a strong Pursuit, solid all-around bulk, an important Normal resistance, and access to Roar allows Tyranitar to provide very desirable role compression for teams looking for a Pokemon able to check threats such as Snorlax, Gengar, Exeggutor, Misdreavus, and Jynx all at once. These factors make Tyranitar very easy to fit on teams, as the sheer utility of Pursuit and Roar is extremely helpful in the metagame. Furthermore, Tyranitar is a versatile Pokemon that can turn into a Curse sweeper that invalidates typical answers to Curse Snorlax such as phazing and Explosion thanks to Roar and its part-Rock typing. Tyranitar is also capable of acting as a lure due to its numerous coverage options that allow it to dent its usual answers.</p> <p>However, Tyranitar doesn't have access to a powerful STAB attack to fully exploit its tremendous base 134 Attack stat. Therefore, it faces competition as a physical attacker from Rhydon and, to a lesser extent, Golem. Moreover, Tyranitar suffers from several common and exploitable weaknesses, a below-average Speed stat, an unfortunate case of four-moveslot syndrome, and a tendency to be unable to punish switch-ins from dangerous Pokemon such as Nidoking, Marowak, Vaporeon, Rhydon, and especially Machamp. These flaws also hamper its overall reliability against the threats it is supposed to keep in check, seeing that it struggles to pressure Starmie and takes substantial damage from Exeggutor's Giga Drain, Gengar's Dynamic Punch, and most importantly, Snorlax's Earthquake, meaning Umbreon provides serious competition, as it usually performs better against these examples. Finally, Tyranitar usually has to check multiple Pokemon throughout the match and can be worn down fairly quickly when factoring its weaknesses, lack of reliable recovery, and susceptibility to residual damage in the form of Spikes and Toxic.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyranitar possesses a large pool of coverage options to lure and dent many of its usual answers. Dynamic Punch is capable of 2HKOing Snorlax, Miltank, and Umbreon after Spikes damage. Ice Beam targets Ground-types that aren't Steelix, Piloswine, and Quagsire while retaining a hard hit against Exeggutor, whereas Surf trades the ability to scare it off for a potential 2HKO on Steelix, a potential OHKO on Golem, and a guaranteed OHKO on Rhydon. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Cloyster and maintains super effective coverage against Pokemon such as Starmie and Skarmory in the absence of Crunch and Fire Blast. With so many possibilities, an all-out attacker set consisting of Rock Slide and three of Fire Blast and the aforementioned moves makes for a viable option. Ancient Power can also be considered on this kind of set and can make Tyranitar very difficult to handle should its secondary effect activate. However, Ancient Power fails to consistently 2HKO Zapdos, which substantially decreases its viability. Unfortunately, Tyranitar cannot break through all of the troublesome Pokemon with a single set, and it will be exploited by Machamp and Suicune regardless of which moves it has.</p> <p>Screech is an alternative to Roar, as it can force out the opposing Pokemon by lowering its Defense, which notably enables Tyranitar to potentially win against non-Earthquake variants of Curse Snorlax in a one-on-one scenario and pairs well with Pursuit, as the opponent is likely to call their Pokemon back in fear of taking a Rock Slide after a Screech. However, it is less reliable than Roar overall and isn't nearly as effective against PerishTrap Misdreavus. Toxic is a good way to deter most switch-ins to Tyranitar, but it is hard to fit onto a set.</p> <p>A more offensive Curse variant with Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Fire Blast is another way to lure and play around Pokemon such as Nidoking, Steelix, and, to a lesser extent, Heracross, but due to the lack of a strong physical STAB attack it is mostly outclassed by Machamp and Rhydon.</p> <p>On the Curse set, dropping Roar in favor of Pursuit is doable. The role compression it offers can be quite appealing for defensive teams looking for a Pokemon capable of handling non-Earthquake Snorlax while offering the ability to trap Ghost-types to support Snorlax and spinners from its team.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Due to its bulk and typing, Machamp can take hits from Tyranitar rather easily and swiftly OHKO it with its STAB Cross Chop or use it as a setup opportunity, but it has to be wary of switching into Tyranitar's assaults with Spikes down too often. Even then, the RestTalk variant is a hard wall to Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Tyranitar is unable to get past Suicune, which does severe damage with Surf in return. Vaporeon is bulky enough to avoid the 3HKO from Rock Slide and can accumulate boosts in front of Tyranitar without much trouble, especially if it's an Acid Armor variant. Cloyster doesn't like switching into Rock Slide, but it still has the upper hand against Tyranitar due to its superior Speed and can lay down Spikes against it. Starmie is another problem if Tyranitar doesn't pack Crunch, and even then it can threaten Tyranitar with a very likely 2HKO. The less common Tentacruel can also scare off Tyranitar with its Water-type STAB and start using Substitute or Swords Dance against it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most of the time, Tyranitar is unable to prevent the likes of Nidoking, Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Donphan and Sandslash from taking advantage of it unless it has Ice Beam or Surf. Marowak in particular is a very dangerous Pokemon that can switch in on Tyranitar and threaten it with a potential OHKO with its STAB Earthquake, but its lack of passive recovery and poor Speed mean that it should be wary about switching into Fire Blast or Crunch, and it loses if it takes an Ice Beam or Surf on the switch. Steelix shrugs off Tyranitar's assaults as long as it doesn't have Fire Blast, Surf, or, to a lesser extent, Earthquake. Finally, the rather uncommon Quagsire doesn't care about any of Tyranitar's usual attacking moves aside from Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Unless Tyranitar packs the appropriate coverage move, the standard variant has trouble breaking through Snorlax, Raikou, and Porygon2. However, the Curse variant is likely to eventually win against these. On the other hand, Umbreon and Miltank can shut down Tyranitar's offensive capabilities by using Charm or Growl and cripple it with status effects. The only move they have to watch out for is Dynamic Punch after Spikes damage. If Tyranitar doesn't have Fire Blast, Skarmory, Forretress, and the rare Meganium become troublesome, but only Meganium is able to act as an answer to Curse Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: While Fire Blast does a significant amount of damage, Heracross is still able to scare off Tyranitar with its fast and powerful Megahorn and can heal itself with Rest. If Tyranitar doesn't have Fire Blast, Heracross can start accumulating Curse boosts against it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Tyranitar usually has to keep multiple Pokemon in check throughout the game. Chip damage in the form of Spikes and Toxic hamper its ability to do so, but Rest can make this task easier.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This variant of Tyranitar brings as much role compression as it can get into a single set. Rock Slide is Tyranitar's STAB move of choice, as backed up by its very high Attack stat it is able to 2HKO Zapdos, 3HKO Cloyster, and OHKO Jynx. It also pressures any Snorlax without a Curse boost, as it has the potential to induce a flinch at very inconvenient times. Pursuit is one of Tyranitar's main draws, as it allows it to punish Dark-weak Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Jynx if they attempt to switch out, and it can do some chip damage to Pokemon that Tyranitar typically scares out like Zapdos. Roar is a move recommended on every team in GSC OU due to the dominance of Curse Snorlax, and Tyranitar is fit to use it, as it can constantly phaze non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax by virtue of its Normal resistance and huge physical bulk, on top of having a great matchup against Misdreavus, which can be deadly with its PerishTrap set in the absence of phazers. Roar also gives some much-needed insurance against Mean Look + Baton Pass Umbreon, and Tyranitar's typing is suited to phazing some uncommon threats such as Espeon, Porygon2, and Muk.</p> <p>Fire Blast is usually chosen in the last slot for its ability to scorch Steel-types such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress, which would otherwise be troublesome for Tyranitar. It can end up being very useful on a Spikes-focused team against Forretress, as Fire Blast Tyranitar can force it out and slowly but surely wear it down with Pursuit throughout the match so it cannot use Rapid Spin to get rid of your Spikes forever. Fire Blast also pressures Exeggutor, another notable Pursuit target that Tyranitar needs to scare off. Alternatively, STAB Crunch retains the ability to threaten Exeggutor while also doing much more damage to Gengar and Misdreavus than Rock Slide. This can turn out to be pretty significant, as these targets tend to cripple Tyranitar with status, Thief, and repeated hits while trying to avoid a full-powered Pursuit. Crunch Tyranitar also has a shot at trying to remove a weakened Starmie from the game. However, Tyranitar takes a lot of damage in the process and may be unable to do anything else afterwards. It is possible to fit both Fire Blast and Crunch onto the set, but the utility of Roar is usually too important to give up. Finally, Earthquake 2HKOes Raikou, Nidoking, and Tentacruel while scoring a 3HKO on Rhydon and Golem. It also has the merit of hitting both Gengar and Steelix hard in one slot, but dropping Fire Blast or Crunch makes Tyranitar unable to pressure Exeggutor as effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roar, Pursuit, and the Normal resistance are all important features that let Tyranitar fit onto a wide variety of teams. It is especially useful alongside Spikers such as Cloyster and Forretress, as they struggle against Ghost-types, which can absorb their attempt to use Explosion or Rapid Spin. Tyranitar's ability to get rid of these with Pursuit is beneficial, and Roar allows it to take advantage of Spikes further. Tyranitar's Pursuit also helps Starmie against Misdreavus, which in return can clear the field and check Machamp, arguably Tyranitar's biggest nemesis. Cloyster is also suited to help Tyranitar against Ground-types such as Marowak and Rhydon. Suicune is another good teammate, as it makes a good check to the aforementioned Ground-types but also deals nicely with Nidoking and, to a lesser extent, Vaporeon if it packs Roar. Exeggutor and Zapdos are more offensively inclined partners that can check most Ground- and Water-types as well as Machamp, giving them excellent synergy with Tyranitar. The same applies to Heracross, which is a safer answer to Ground-types and Machamp that appreciates Tyranitar's ability to cripple Gengar and Misdreavus with Pursuit. Overall, any Pokemon that wants to have the opposing Ghost-type or Exeggutor out of the way such as non-Earthquake Snorlax, Machamp, and Vaporeon will benefit from having Tyranitar's Pursuit to back it up.</p> <p>It is important to keep in mind that this Tyranitar set is only a temporary check to Snorlax at best, as it cannot break through Curse Snorlax's Rest loop in a one-on-one scenario where Snorlax is the last member of its team. Furthermore, Tyranitar's usefulness will be short lived if Snorlax is packing Earthquake. As a consequence, it is recommended to pack an answer to said variants. Curse Skarmory is a good example of such a Pokemon, and it also helps against some of Tyranitar's other problems such as Marowak, Heracross, and Machamp. In return, Tyranitar checks Fire Blast Snorlax and Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor. Unfortunately, more offensive teams can't always afford to pack passive Pokemon like Skarmory to deal with Snorlax, and they would rather pick a phazer like Tyranitar to do the job. Therefore, they have to keep constant pressure on Snorlax in order to force it to Rest so Tyranitar can phaze it safely and keep it from sweeping. Powerful Pokemon such as Machamp, Vaporeon, Nidoking, and Zapdos are suited to apply offensive momentum and can benefit from having the opposing Snorlax asleep as well.</p>"

        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>As a Curse user, Tyranitar faces competition from Rhydon due to its access to STAB Earthquake, making it more offensively threatening. Tyranitar, on the other hand, is bulkier overall and isn't plagued with 4x weaknesses to Water and Grass, which makes it harder to force out once it has set up boosts. Rock Slide is Tyranitar's best physical STAB attack and is sufficient as the sole attacking move on this set, since there is no Pokemon immune to Rock-type moves. With Curse, Tyranitar is able to reliably take on non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax one-on-one and can act as a potential wincon. Roar prevents faster phazers such as Skarmory, Raikou, and opposing Tyranitar from forcing Tyranitar out. This also works when Tyranitar is asleep, so forcing it to Rest in order to phaze it afterwards isn't a possibility. It can also be helpful in Curse wars against the likes of Snorlax, Porygon2, and Muk. Rest provides the longevity needed for this set's success. Without it, Tyranitar could be worn down by the Pokemon it is supposed to check and would be ruined by Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with Curse, Machamp and Ground-types can still easily break through Tyranitar. Therefore, answers to these such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Suicune, and Heracross are teammates of choice. Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon also prevent any attempt to sweep with Tyranitar, which is another reason why Zapdos and Exeggutor make good partners. Skarmory is one of the best defensive backbones to support Curse Tyranitar due to its good matchup against Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax carrying Earthquake, Heracross, and Marowak. The two of them together form a very formidable obstacle for Snorlax to overcome, no matter what its moveset is. Despite its overall great bulk, Tyranitar is 3HKOed by Zapdos's Thunder and Exeggutor's Giga Drain, which means that it cannot use Rest over and over again against these threats. Thus, specially bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax, Raikou, and Blissey make good backups for Tyranitar. Blissey can also cure Tyranitar from its self-induced sleep with Heal Bell, allowing it to use Rest more freely. Opposing Miltank and Umbreon can be painful to face for Tyranitar, as they can negate its boosts with Growl or Charm, so Pokemon suited to take advantage of these such as Spikers, Ghost-types in the case of Miltank, and Heracross in the case of Umbreon can be beneficial.</p>"

  "Lugia": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>By virtue of its behemoth bulk, access to Recover, and Flying typing which grants it a Spikes immunity, Lugia is the bulkiest Pokemon in GSC Ubers. 106 / 130 physical bulk allows Lugia to switch into almost every physical attacker and, paired with Curse and Whirlwind, beat them one-on-one. This makes Lugia a very valuable defensive piece for a lot of teams that can also work as a potential wincon. Its monstruous Special Defense also lets it avoid the 2HKO from every non-STAB Thunder, meaning only Pokemon like Zapdos and Jolteon can consistently 2HKO it with unboosted attacks. Lugia can even run moves like Surf and Toxic to turn the tables on Pokemon that usually give it trouble, like Golem, Steelix, and Rhydon, while supporting its team.</p> <p>However, Lugia struggles to deal meaningful damage until it gets going with Curse boosts. Furthermore, Lugia's strongest attack is Aeroblast, which has only 8 PP, so it can get stalled very easily by smart pivoting, restricting Lugia to only phazing foes until it can safely start attacking. Lastly, Lugia's inability to get past metagame beasts like Zapdos and Tyranitar limits its utility for the majority of the early- or mid-game to acting as a phazer and soft counter to physical attackers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is an option on Curse sets over Whirlwind on Growth + Baton Pass teams. It allows Lugia to 3HKO Tyranitar, OHKO Golem, and 2HKO Marowak unboosted, and is not bothered by Curse, which means that Tyranitar can't boost its Defense to shrug the damage off. However, not having Whirlwind really hurts Lugia's late-game presence, as it can get phazed with relative ease. Hydro Pump also suffers from the same PP problem Aeroblast has, making it very hit-or-miss.</p> <p>Ice Beam is another option on Curse sets over Whirlwind to 3HKO Zapdos consistently, potentially 2HKO Golem and Rhydon, and threaten everything that switches into Lugia with a freeze. However, it doesn't do much outside of this, as Ice Beam is generally not a strong move, and not having Whirlwind means that Lugia can't be used to sweep until all enemy phazers are out of the picture.</p> <p>Mystery Berry is yet another option on Curse sets to help circumvent Lugia's PP problems, giving it more leeway to attack. However, not having Leftovers really hurts Lugia's ability to regularly switch into Pokemon, as now it is forced to use Recover more often.</p> <p>Lastly, support sets can run Thunderbolt over Surf to 2HKO Cloyster, as Cloyster commonly stays in on Lugia to inflict Toxic on it. However, not having Surf means that Pokemon like Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix now wall Lugia.</p> <p>Ice Beam is another option over Surf to pressure Zapdos with a 3HKO, threaten Golem and Rhydon with a potential 2HKO, and spread freeze. However, it doesn't offer much outside of this, and Lugia would much prefer running other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is one of the best counters to Lugia, as it fears nothing from it bar the rare Ice Beam and can 2HKO Lugia with STAB Thunder. Zapdos is also immune to Spikes, which means that Lugia can't wear it down via Whirlwind and Spikes damage. Lastly, Zapdos is bulky enough to withstand even a critical hit from Lugia and use Rest to heal all the damage done.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Moves</strong>: Raikou resists Aeroblast and can 2HKO Lugia with Thunder but must be careful of Earthquake, as Lugia can potentially beat Raikou one-on-one if it has enough Curse boosts. Although it doesn't like switching directly into Lugia, Jolteon can force Lugia out with a Boosted Thunder. Pokemon that carry Thunder, such as Mewtwo, can also potentially threaten Lugia if paralysis triggers.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Tyranitar resists Aeroblast, has high enough bulk to ensure not even critical hits threaten it, can use Curse alongside Lugia, and can deny phazing attempts with Roar, making it one of the best checks to Lugia available. It must be careful of Earthquake, however, as the move has a chance to 2HKO it. Rhydon and Golem operate similarly to Tyranitar but are bulkier and thus not as afraid of Earthquake; they can even phaze a -1 Speed Lugia. Skarmory resists Aeroblast, can use Curse alongside Lugia, can deny phazing attempts with its own Whirlwind, and does not mind Earthquake thanks to its Flying typing. Lastly, Steelix is bulky enough for +1 Earthquake to not 2HKO it, can use Curse alongside Lugia to take even less damage, and can phaze Lugia with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Paralysis, paired with very strong attackers like Marowak and Belly Drum Snorlax, can overwhelm Lugia very easily. Sleep-inducing moves from Snorlax and even Exeggutor can also ruin Lugia, as it doesn't commonly run Sleep Talk, so it can be a punching bag for up to six turns. Lastly, Toxic from the likes of Cloyster and Forretress is also annoying for Lugia, as it'll be forced to switch out eventually, losing all of its Curse boosts.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Umbreon are sufficiently bulky to withstand even boosted attacks from Lugia. Umbreon can even negate any Curse boosts with Growl and cripple Lugia with Toxic. Other, more obscure Pokemon, like Miltank, can also deter Lugia's offense by denying Curse boosts with Growl and even potentially inflict a paralysis with Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users</strong>: Quagsire can deny Lugia's Curse boosts with Haze, potentially stalling the PP out of Aeroblast in the process. Lugia will have to make the choice of attacking or not, as Quagsire lives a boosted Aeroblast and can heal all damage done with Rest. Other, more obscure Pokemon like Omastar can also use Haze to deny Lugia's sweep attempts, and Omastar does not care about critical hits because of its Rock typing, although it must be careful of Earthquake, as the move 2HKOes it at +1.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Lugia's most consistent set. Curse and Whirlwind, coupled with its absurd bulk, allow it to check many threats with ease. It can easily switch into Vaporeon, Heracross, Snorlax, and Mew and phaze them with Whirlwind. Aeroblast is the only attacking move on this set, as there are no Pokemon immune to Flying-type attacks; its high critical chance can also overwhelm checks like Curse Snorlax and Barrier Mewtwo. Using Aeroblast and Whirlwind in concert turns Lugia into one of the most threatening late-game presences in Ubers.</p> <p>Earthquake is an option over Whirlwind, as Lugia commonly baits Tyranitar and other Pokemon weak to Ground, such as Steelix and Jolteon, into the field. However, not having Whirlwind means that Lugia is unable to beat Barrier variants of Mewtwo, a Pokemon that would otherwise be helpless against it, and is an infinitely worse late-game presence because Pokemon like Ho-Oh and opposing Lugia can phaze it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lugia struggles heavily against Pokemon like Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon, all of which resist Aeroblast and can annoy Lugia with Roar. Because of this, Earthquake Snorlax is a good teammate, as it commonly lures them out while also checking other threatening Pokemon for Lugia, like Zapdos and Jolteon. Lugia, in return, can potentially beat Pokemon like Barrier Mewtwo for Snorlax. Pokemon that can lure in Electric-types like Zapdos and Raikou for Lugia, such as Exeggutor, Self-Destruct Mewtwo, and Self-Destruct Snorlax, are also good teammates. Cloyster and Forretress can lay down Spikes for Lugia, making its Whirlwind all the more threatening, and provide some offensive pressure with Toxic and Explosion. Cloyster additionally can threaten Tyranitar with its STAB Surf. On more defensive teams, Celebi is also a good partner for Lugia, as it can comfortably switch into the Electric-type Pokemon that annoy Lugia and use Heal Bell to ensure that status does not ruin Lugia.</p>"

        "Supportive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set trades Lugia's original approach of a Curse sweeper and turns it into a supporter for its team. Surf can OHKO Pokemon like Golem and Rhydon, 2HKO Marowak and Steelix, and potentially threaten Tyranitar. Toxic allows Lugia to put pressure on the enemy team by incurring crucial passive damage. This gives Lugia an option to put Pokemon like Zapdos, Tyranitar, and Cloyster on a timer. Cloyster will be pressured to use Explosion earlier after it's been poisoned, while Tyranitar and Zapdos will be forced to use Rest. Whirlwind lets Lugia phaze threatening Pokemon like Vaporeon, Snorlax, and Mew, as thanks to its massive bulk, it only fears Self-Destruct and Explosion from them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this Lugia set doesn't carry ways to boost its Defense, physical attackers can overwhelm it. Additionally, Lugia can have trouble repeatedly switching into Pokemon like Snorlax, Marowak, Mew, and Mewtwo if it's paralyzed, so Pokemon like Barrier Mewtwo and Celebi are appreciated. Barrier Mewtwo can check threatening attackers alongside Lugia, while Celebi can provide Heal Bell support to ensure status does not ruin Lugia. Tyranitar can comfortably absorb Lovely Kiss from Snorlax and check Mewtwo without a Fighting-type coverage move; it can also potentially beat opposing Tyranitar one-on-one if it gets enough Curse boosts. In return, Lugia checks Pokemon like Mew and Earthquake Snorlax for Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Thanks to its astronomical bulk, 32 PP Recover, and good defensive typing, Ho-Oh makes for a very good wall capable of checking important Pokemon in the metagame like Mewtwo, Steelix, Gengar, Heracross, and non-Rock Slide Mew. It's also capable of phazing Pokemon like Curse Snorlax in a pinch thanks to its decent physical bulk. Access to Toxic helps Ho-Oh put Pokemon that would otherwise check it, like Tyranitar and Zapdos, on a timer. Ho-Oh also functions as a good lead on teams, as its massive bulk and the rarity of enemy leads that can threaten it such as Zapdos let it scout and gain information about the opposing team without much trouble while still applying some pressure itself thanks to its respectable Special Attack and Toxic.</p> <p>However, Ho-Oh is very susceptible to status moves like Lovely Kiss and Toxic, as they greatly hinder its ability to check the Pokemon it's supposed to check. A complete inability to get past Tyranitar means that Ho-Oh teams oftentimes find themselves having to deal with Roar + Spikes, which can wear Ho-Oh's team down quickly. Ho-Oh can also be lured out by Explosion from Mewtwo, Mew, and Gengar, all common users of the move and Pokemon Ho-Oh regularly switches into. The prevalence of Growth + Baton Pass Pokemon like Jolteon also hurts Ho-Oh's ability to check the Pokemon it's supposed to, like Mewtwo, as Ho-Oh can no longer switch into them if they have been a passed a Growth boost.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ho-Oh can run a set of Flamethrower, Recover, Earthquake, and one of Toxic or Whirlwind on teams that appreciate Ho-Oh baiting Tyranitar in and hitting it hard, potentially dealing enough damage for a teammate to finish it off. Earthquake also hits Jolteon hard, which, in conjunction with Whirlwind, can deny Growth + Baton Pass attempts, as Ho-Oh lives a +1 Thunder from full. However, running Earthquake means Ho-Oh needs to forgo one of Whirlwind or Toxic, potentially denying either the ability to phaze or the free turns Toxic can give. A set with Curse, Sacred Fire, Recover, and Return can be used, allowing Ho-Oh to become a potential late-game threat once Pokemon like Tyranitar are removed. Insane bulk coupled with Recover and Sacred Fire's chance to burn some phazers like Lugia and Tyranitar are some unique traits that Ho-Oh has over other Curse sweepers. However, Ho-Oh's early-game utility is then greatly reduced, with its damage output lacking even after a few Curse boosts due to a lack of physical STAB move. Furthermore, Ho-Oh also becomes unable to prevent phazing attempts due to the lack of Whirlwind on this set, making it only a late-game presence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Due to Ho-Oh's critical weakness to Rock, Rock-types naturally pose a big threat to it. Tyranitar is the best available counter to Ho-Oh, as it is capable of nullifying Toxic with Rest, negating Whirlwind with a slower Roar, and OHKOing Ho-Oh with Rock Slide while not minding Flamethrower. Rhydon is another Rock-type that can deal extreme damage to Ho-Oh, but it must be careful of Toxic, as it can quickly wear Rhydon down.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Coverage</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou both comfortably switch into Ho-Oh and scare it out thanks to their STAB Thunder; they also commonly run Rest, meaning that Toxic from Ho-Oh won't keep them down for long. Although it doesn't appreciate switching directly into Ho-Oh, Jolteon can boost its Special Attack with Growth and force it out. Electric-type coverage moves from Pokemon like Mewtwo and Gengar can also potentially scare Ho-Oh out.</p> <p><strong>Status and Explosion users</strong>: Paralysis, sleep, and poison all hinder Ho-Oh's ability to consistently check Pokemon it's supposed to check, like Mewtwo, non-Rock Slide Mew, Gengar, and weakened threats like Marowak. Even if not statused, Ho-Oh should still be careful of them, as Mewtwo, Mew, and Gengar can lure in and KO Ho-Oh with a well-timed Explosion. Other Pokemon like Snorlax, Cloyster, Steelix, Forretress, and Exeggutor can also use Explosion on Ho-Oh if it is paralyzed, so making sure Ho-Oh is not statused is key.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Suicune and Quagsire don't care about anything Ho-Oh throws at them, as they commonly run Rest to shrug off any Toxic attempts and also resist Flamethrower. Starmie can come in on Ho-Oh and freely use Rapid Spin. These Pokemon can also hit Ho-Oh with a decently strong Surf. Vaporeon also scares out Ho-Oh thanks to Growth and Surf, as a +1 Vaporeon 2HKOes Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax can comfortably switch into Ho-Oh and threaten to use it as setup fodder for Curse; it can also potentially use Love Kiss on Ho-Oh, rendering it useless for up to 6 turns. It should be careful of Toxic, however, as a Snorlax without Sleep Talk or Rest can be played around with relative ease.</p>",

Whirlwind phazes Snorlax and Mew in a pinch while also phazing and threatening out Pokemon like Cloyster and Celebi, both of which can't do much to Ho-Oh.

Ho-Oh, in return, checks very troublesome Pokemon for Celebi like Mewtwo and Heracross. While it has decent physical bulk and a good typing, Ho-Oh can still get overwhelmed by common physical attackers like Curse Snorlax. Because of this, having physically bulky Pokemon like Barrier Mewtwo and Skarmory is advised to give Ho-Oh and its team a strong defensive backbone. Barrier Mewtwo especially is a very good teammate for Ho-Oh, as it can check Pokemon that are very threatening to stall like Marowak. Secondary checks to Snorlax, like Forretress and Cloyster, are also good teammates, as they can also set Spikes that Ho-Oh can take advantage of with Whirlwind.</p>"

It pulls the Perish Song job very well with its good defenses. It also allows a stall team to not worry about a last-Pokemon Curse sweep. Giga Drain is a good move but frankly it isn't advisable. Celebi already has a recovery move, and unlike Exeggutor, Celebi is more defensive and should be played as such. An interesting option you could try is Curse coupled with Baton Pass, but it might leave you in a bind when Houndoom shows up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Houndoom and Tyranitar are really the only Pokemon that will take it down with certainty. Espeon can set up Substitute and Growth before passing to a teammate with Flamethrower. Zapdos has a chance to stop it with Drill Peck. Jynx has a good chance too, thanks to the double threat of STAB Ice Beam and Lovely Kiss, and its low HP means Celebi won't regain much with Leech Seed. If Celebi is paralyzed, Heracross and Pinsir make good counters. Charizard may be able to set up a Belly Drum on Celebi, or just nail it with STAB Fire Blast.
