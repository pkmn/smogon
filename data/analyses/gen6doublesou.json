  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar makes a name for itself as a strong disruption pick in DOU. Mega Gengar is notable for being the better half of the two viable Shadow Tag Pokemon in the metagame and has a unique assortment of support and disruption moves such as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp that it can use in conjunction with its trapping ability and high Speed, which is enough to outrun the whole unboosted metagame except for Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl; these qualities make it adept at picking off or neutering key threats for its teammates' benefit. Its regular forme is also viable, adept at using a nifty array of resistances and immunities to support teammates with Icy Wind and the aforementioned Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, making it a good check to notable threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T. Both formes are also no slouches offensively, with Mega Gengar even boasting a very high base 170 Special Attack, and their Ghost STAB makes them useful against most Trick Room setters. Both Gengar formes are also frail, however, making them unable to switch in on most hits effectively and being easily KOed by any strong or super effective attack; in particular, Gengar needs a Focus Sash to be actually able to take one hit minimum. Gengar's frailness also makes it easily picked off when at the wrong end of speed control.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Disable prevents foes from using the move they last used, possibly allowing Gengar and its teammate a free turn and generally preventing a foe from attacking with their first attacking option; in tandem with an Encore user such as Whimsicott, Disable Mega Gengar can be frustrating to face due to the possibility of being locked into a Disabled move. Similarly, in conjunction with Substitute, Disable can turn Mega Gengar into a pain to deal with. Focus Blast, despite its terrible accuracy, can serve as a serviceable attack to nab the quick KO on the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, and Heatran. Perish Song allows Mega Gengar to pressure foes by limiting the turns they can stay on the field and works well with Mega Gengar's ability to deny switching. Skill Swap can also be nifty for giving partners such as Heatran Levitate and passing Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag to a partner.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Hoopa-U, Hydreigon, and Darkrai can generally take out either Gengar forme with their super effective STAB moves, though the regular forme usually holds a Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types can't be trapped with Shadow Tag. Aegislash can also generally take one attack and OHKO back with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Landorus can take out Mega Gengar with ease using their STAB moves. The regular Gengar forme is immune to Ground-type attacks due to Levitate, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Deoxys-A can simply outrun and take out Mega Gengar through its paltry defenses. Kingdra and Ludicolo can be outrun as well but only under rain. Regular Gengar has lower Speed and gets outrun by a few more threats, albeit niche, such as Weavile, Darkrai, and Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks bypass Gengar's high Speed entirely and simply punch through its low defenses. Talonflame in particular can generally get a KO against a healthy Gengar with its priority Brave Bird. Sucker Punches from the likes of Bisharp and Mega Kangaskhan also hurt Gengar, but they can be played around and neutered with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Gengar relies on its Speed to actually be effective at disrupting foes; without it, it loses effectiveness and becomes prone to getting easily picked off. Tailwind from the likes of Talonflame and Latios can take away Gengar's Speed advantage, while Trick Room from setters such as Cresselia and Hoopa-U can turn the tables against it entirely. Thunder Wave from threats such as Thundurus can take away Mega Gengar's Speed advantage for the duration of a match.</p>",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Both Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball are simply STAB attacks, the former more powerful and able deal a significant amount of damage to non-resisted targets and the latter boasting better neutral and super effective coverage, capable of hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Aegislash and Cresselia super effectively. Will-O-Wisp can neuter physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T, while Taunt can stop foes from setting up or supporting with moves such as Trick Room, Tailwind, or Follow Me; in conjunction with Shadow Tag, Mega Gengar can also render certain foes into unswitchable liabilities with either move. Substitute can also be useful to shield Mega Gengar from status moves such as Thunder Wave and strong attacks. These three options can also be used to play around Sucker Punch, with Will-O-Wisp even neutering would-be threats. Protect lets Mega Gengar shield itself from attacks while a partner takes out a threat, stalls field conditions such as Trick Room, and punishes double-targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Mega Gengar go as fast as possbile while still having high damage output. Pre-Mega Evolution, the EV investment lets Gengar Speed tie with threats such as Latios and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gengar should generally aim to make most use of its trapping ability by using it to deny switching, pressuring foes. Mega Gengar's trapping is particularly effective from early- to mid-game, when it can trap and weaken or KO specific foes so that a teammate has an easier time doing its job due to having one less check; for example, Belly Drum Azumarill can smash through a team with ease once Amoonguss is sufficiently weakened or removed through Mega Gengar's ability to guarantee damage. Mega Gengar can also work late-game, when it can clean up opposing teams with its high Speed and excellent Special Attack, but one needs to make sure any faster threats or those with powerful priority have already been removed.</p> <p>Generally speaking, Mega Gengar works well as a lead thanks to its nifty immunity to Fake Out and high Speed; leading Mega Gengar also lets it Mega Evolve quickly, which it should do as soon as possible in order to fully take advantage of its ability. When against certain foes, using Mega Gengar's disruption move can work wonders, as it turns them into liabilities without any chance of escape; for example, burning a Mega Kangaskhan can leave it a liability on the field due to being neutered and unable to switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Partners that rely on setting up such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Cresselia appreciate Mega Gengar's trapping abilities, as it can help remove key threats, making smashing through the opposing team easier. Pokemon that can take out Dark-types with ease also serve as good teammates; Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Sylveon and Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion all can take out most Dark-types in the metagame such as Hydreigon and Scrafty. Wide Guard support from the likes of Conkeldurr can be nifty as well, as it can block Landorus-T's Earthquake. Quick Guard from partners such as Scrafty and Keldeo is also appreciated for blocking any strong priority attack, such as Sucker Punch and Brave Bird from Talonflame. Talonflame checks are appreciated as well, as it can simply blast through Mega Gengar's paper-thin defenses while bypassing its Speed with strong priority; the likes of Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Rotom-W all work well for the job. Intimidate from the likes of Scrafty and Landorus-T also work as well because, aside from backing up Mega Gengar's paltry Defense, it can work well in conjunction with Shadow Tag by leaving weakened physical attackers unable to switch out.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Offensive Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is Gengar's most powerful STAB move and its main attacking move on this set. It has a decent chance to poison the foe, which essentially gives it a chance to break through Focus Sash. Shadow Ball can be used in the second slot to prevent Gengar from being walled by Steel-types. While a set with dual STAB moves can be used, Icy Wind is an option to provide speed control on some teams; sitting at an impressive base 110 Speed, it can outspeed and lower the Speed of other threats that may be initially faster than Gengar's ally. When using only one STAB move, you should consider what coverage your team needs most when debating which one to use. Shadow Ball should not be used when the rest of your team is vulnerable to Dark-types, for instance. Will-O-Wisp makes Gengar a rather reliable Mega Kangaskhan check by allowing it to avoid Sucker Punch and burning it in the same turn. For the fourth slot, Taunt is the best choice, as it allows Gengar to hinder teams that rely on Trick Room or Tailwind while also halting other shenanigans that may hinder the offensive potency of rest of your team, such as an opposing Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. It also allows Gengar to slow down opposing setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Calm Mind Cresselia.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Focus Sash helps compensate for Gengar's frailty and increases its overall staying power. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Gengar to hit as hard and fast as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When against Mega Kangaskhan, you shouldn't try to attack it because of the threat of Parental Bond Sucker Punch. Therefore, Will-O-Wisp is the go-to play against Mega Kangaskhan. Gengar shouldn't be directly switched in very often in order to keep its Focus Sash intact, but it can still switch in on Choice-locked Landorus-T's Earthquake or Mega Kangaskhan very easily. Keep in mind that non-Mega Gengar's main purpose is to perform an offensive support role, so you should try to support the offensive powerhouses of your teams with Icy Wind and Will-O-Wisp rather than solely attacking with Gengar. Be wary of using Icy Wind when facing Bisharp, as it will gain a free Attack boost from Defiant and can safely switch in thanks to its resistance or immunity to both of Gengar's STAB moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Both Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y greatly appreciate Icy Wind support to outspeed most of the speedy threats that would otherwise threaten them to a large degree, such as offensive Thundurus, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. Hydreigon not only takes advantage of Gengar's use of speed control but is also able to switch into Psychic-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks for Gengar. As Gengar is typically crippled by Thunder Wave and Taunt, Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Terrakion can prevent Prankster Taunt and Thunder Wave from the likes of Thundurus and Klefki from hitting Gengar. Fighting-types such as these two can also threaten Tyranitar, which breaks Gengar's Focus Sash with Sand Stream. Gengar works well with Fighting-types such as Keldeo or Conkeldurr due to its ability to beat Fairy-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types. Hydreigon, Latios, and other Dragon-types also appreciate Gengar's ability to cripple opposing physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Latios in particular benefits from Gengar being able to turn Mega Kangaskhan into dead weight.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting good overall stats, Entei is a solid choice that can take a few hits and maintain good offensive pressure. Entei is a great attacker that makes itself worthwhile with its respectable bulk and solid offensive movepool; specifically, Sacred Fire, Entei's signature move, has a solid 100 Base Power and a 50% chance to burn, deterring physical attackers from switching in. Entei also works as a good sun counter, being able to OHKO both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur while taking little damage from their attacks. Adding to that, when holding Safety Goggles, Entei is immune to Sleep Powder and can get the KO on Venusaur. However, it loses to threats most other Fire-types would lose to as well. Landorus-T is a cold stop to Entei, although switching in on Sacred Fire is risky for it. Entei also can't touch Heatran or Mega Diancie, while they hit it hard with Earth Power and Diamond Storm, respectively. While Entei has no spread moves to bypass redirectors, besides the suboptimal Snarl, Sacred Fire and Stone Edge allow it to take on the three most common redirectors, namely Jirachi, Amoonguss, and Togekiss. With Safety Goggles, Entei can ignore Amoonguss completely. Be wary, though, as Entei has difficulties switching into attacks it doesn't resist. Lastly, Entei is sadly often outclassed by other Pokemon because of its average stats and movepool, as it faces competition from Talonflame as a strong physical attacker and from Heatran as a Substitute attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shuca Berry can be used to eat an Earthquake from Landorus-T and try to get a burn with Sacred Fire. Sitrus Berry can also be used for more immediate longevity. Life Orb is an option for extra power. Other moves can be useful too, such as Iron Head, which can be used to catch Mega Diancie on the switch, and Snarl, which allows Entei to hit through Substitutes and drop the foe's Special Attack, making it a significant debuffer. Substitute can be used to make Entei a solid cleaner, allowing it to fish for burns on threats that would KO it. When using Substitute, Leftovers should be used for the passive healing. A set using Psych Up can be paired with a Belly Drum Azumarill for the potential of an extremely threatening +6 Attack Entei with strong priority. However, the set is extremely niche and requires a lot of setup.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, and Keldeo are a big pain for Entei, as it can't hit them reliably with its STAB attack and has no coverage moves for them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Most Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon can take a Fire-type STAB attack, but they will get chunked by Entei's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-types pose a big threat to Entei; even though Terrakion and Mega Diancie don't want to come into a Sacred Fire and risk the burn, they can outspeed Entei and do lots of damage to with their Rock-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as the Landorus formes are a problem as well, as they can OHKO Entei with Earthquake or Earth Power. However, they still risk getting burned by Sacred Fire if they switch in or are outsped.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran is a pain because of Flash Fire, which stops Entei from using its STAB attack and forces it into using Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Due to Entei being a physical attacker, Intimidate reduces its offensive potential. Notable Intimidate users include Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: While Entei thrives in sun due to being a Fire-type, rain is extremely detrimental for it, as it will weaken Sacred Fire significantly; additionally, most Pokemon typically found on rain teams such as Politoed, Ludicolo, and Kingdra have an edge over Fire-types, making rain an even more difficult matchup for Entei.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While Entei has decent bulk, its Speed tier is okay at best and it can't take a lot of hits reliably. Therefore, Pokemon that can outspeed and KO or chunk Entei are strong checks to it. Notable examples are Latios, Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p>",

        "name": "Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sacred Fire is Entei's go-to attacking move and has a chance to cripple the target with a burn. Stone Edge is used to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame primarily. The third moveslot is for Extreme Speed, which allows Entei to become a strong late-game cleaner, because its +2 priority allows it to outspeed other priority users, such as Talonflame and Bisharp. Protect is a staple move in Doubles. It is used to stall out field conditions, allowing Entei to defend itself while its partner deals with a threat and to scout for the opponent's moves, among many other uses.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread maximizes Entei's Attack and Speed. Adamant is used to obtain maximum power, while Jolly allows it to Speed tie with fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Kangaskhan. However, keep in mind that a Jolly nature is illegal when using Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Flash Fire isn't released, so Pressure has to be used. Safety Goggles is chosen as the item to allow Entei to ignore the effects of powder moves, such as Spore, Sleep Powder, and Rage Powder. This allows Entei to check typical users of such moves, such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Venusaur.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Entei is good at specific endeavors, such as burning Mega Kangaskhan and removing Mega Charizard Y. Entei is best used in the early-game, when it can spam Sacred Fire and fish for burns. Over the course of the game, the burn damage will stack up, which helps Entei KO the foe later in the game. Sacred Fire's massive burn chance can also help Entei get past Focus Sash users like Bisharp and Weavile. Entei can also come into a predicted Spore or Sleep Powder, and considering powder users are generally Grass- and Bug-types, it can immediately threaten the user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entei is a strong sun counter, so Pokemon that have trouble dealing with that archetype, such as Kyurem-B, can make for great partners. Entei is also great at removing Grass-types from the field. Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune can take advange of that and further support Entei with their moves, as together they have strong offensive synergy. Entei can't reliably deal with Heatran and Ground-types, so Pokemon that can deal with those threats are appreciated; again, Water-types such as Suicune and Keldeo are good at this. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash are appreciated, as they can stop Earthquake, Rock Slide, or Muddy Water from hitting Entei. Entei has a lot of trouble with Water-types because it has no meaningful way of damaging them; therefore, Grass- and Electric-types that can beat Water-types make for great partners. Thundurus and Amoonguss are good examples; the former provides speed control with Thunder Wave, hits hard with Thunderbolt, and can also beat Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon, while the latter provides redirection with Rage Powder and boasts the ability to put threats to sleep with Spore.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>With its outstanding defensive typing and stats, Suicune is one of the best bulky Tailwind setters in the metagame, and its access to other moves such as Snarl further makes it a great utility Pokemon. Suicune is a great defensive backbone on most teams thanks to its ability to switch in on almost any neutral attack. However, it is weak to one of the most common offensive types, Electric, and its base 90 Special Attack makes it damage output quite underwhelming.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune can also run a more offensive set with an EV spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe. This spread will outspeed Jolly Breloom and deal as much damage as possible, with some investment in HP as well to grant it some staying power. This set functions well with Sitrus Berry, Life Orb, or other items that boost Water-type attacks. However, this set isn't as effective because Suicune simply doesn't have the offensive stats to be threatening. More times than not, you're better off using a more powerful Water-type such as Keldeo. Mirror Coat can be used in the fourth slot instead of Snarl or Protect, enabling Suicune to surprise foes such as Rotom-W and Charizard-Y. Suicune also has access to Calm Mind and Substitute, giving it the possibility of being a powerful setup sweeper; however, setting up is typically too time consuming, and it would also be better to use a stronger offensive Water-type. Icy Wind can be run for additional speed control, but there usually isn't room for it. Roar is another option to remove setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan as well as Trick Room setters, but it's very situational. Wacan Berry or Rindo Berry can be used to reduce damage from an Electric- or Grass-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Bulky Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos are good checks against Suicune. However, Zapdos and other Electric / Flying type Pokemon such as Thundurus should be cautious of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Breloom, Venusaur, and Amoonguss also give Suicune a great deal of trouble, but they should also be cautious of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Sableye and Thundurus prevent Suicune from setting up Tailwind, which is typically Suicune's main purpose.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty also prevent Suicune from setting up Tailwind while the opposing team sets up its own field effects.</p> <p><strong>Defiant, Competitive, and Contrary: Pokemon with Defiant or Comeptitive such as Bisharp and Milotic can switch in on Snarl and sweep with their boost. Serperior can also come in and get a Special Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Mega Charizard Y drastically lessen Suicune's impact on the game. Mega Charizard Y can easily switch in on Suicune and diminish its already mediocre offensive presence further due to sun halving the damage of Water-type moves, and it can then proceed to 2HKO it with Solar Beam.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Bulky Tailwind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tailwind doubles the Speed of Suicune and its allies for four turns and serves as a good utility move to allow slower Pokemon to become fast offensive threats. Hydro Pump is used to allow Suicune to provide serviceable offensive pressure, having a high chance to OHKO Mega Diancie always 2HKOing Heatran, though it should only be used if Suicune's team is heavily reliant on it to check both Mega Diancie and Heatran. Scald is used as both a STAB attack to soild deal damage and a utility move to possibly burn physical attackers; it also has perfect accuracy, unlike Hydro Pump. Ice Beam provides nice coverage against Dragon- and Flying-types such as Hydreigon and Landorus-T. Snarl provides utility and allows Suicune to support its team by weakening opposing special attackers. Snarl is also great for catching Rotom-W and Thundurus on the switch-in and helping to reduce the opposing team's amount of offensive pressure on Suicune specifically. Snarl, however, should not be used on teams with a notable weakness to Bisharp. Alternatively, Protect keeps Suicune safe for a turn while it waits to reset Tailwind or its partner takes care of a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry provides immediate recovery, improving Suicune's longevity. Leftovers can be used over Sitrus Berry for more gradual HP recovery, but Sitrus Berry is generally a better fit. The Defense EVs with a Bold nature and Sitrus Berry allow Suicune to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Return. The Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl when Tailwind is up. The given Special Defense investment allows Suicune to always survive two Thunderbolts from standard bulky Rotom-W with the aid of a Sitrus Berry. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to boost Suicune's power, netting it OHKOs on Landorus-T and Salamence with Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Suicune typically works best early- and mid-game, using Tailwind to either gain or restore momentum. Thanks to its bulk, Suicune is a fantastic switch-in to most neutral attacks, so it has use staying in the back and switching in for a frailer teammate. With Snarl, it's able to severely hinder any powerful special attacker, such as Kyurem-B, and even boosting ones, such as Calm Mind Cresselia. Use Snarl sparingly when the opposing team has Bisharp, as the move activates Defiant, giving Bisharp a +2 Attack boost and allowing it to apply heavy offensive pressure to your team. There are many Pokemon in Doubles OU that don't have a good matchup against Suicune, most notably Steel- and Water-types. Because of this, Suicune can be a great wincon late-game, soaking up hits, possibly burning threats with Scald, and slowing wearing down a foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune works fantastic in bulky Fire / Water / Grass cores with Pokemon like Heatran and Mega Venusaur. These types of Pokemon work very well together by having fantastic defensive synergy and typing coverage, providing an extremely solid defensive backbone that can be hard to break. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can help Suicune set up Tailwind successfully. Amoonguss is a particularly good partner for Suicune, as it can redirect Electric-type attacks while Suicune sets up Tailwind or takes care of opposing Fire- and Flying-types. As Suicune is mainly used for Tailwind, it works well with Pokemon that benefit from it, such as Breloom and Mega Kangaskhan. Pokemon that can deal with opposing Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Kyurem-B and Landorus-T also make for good partners.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gardevoir establishes itself as one of the more flexible Mega options in the DOU metagame. A sky-high Special Attack, decent Speed tier, and excellent offensive typing paired with a powerful STAB move in Hyper Voice make Mega Gardevoir a very good pick for late-game clean-ups that is just as good early on in order to soften up opposing teams for its partners. On top of its excellent offensive prowess, Mega Gardevoir also possesses a wide array of support options, being a great pick for an Encore user as well as for speed control through Trick Room. This allows Mega Gardevoir to pair quite well with redirection moves, speed control, and Intimidate users, meaning it can be an excellent pick on several kinds of team archetypes.</p> <p>However, Gardevoir is held back due to its mediocre pre-Mega base 80 Speed, which often forces it to waste a turn using Protect to safely Mega Evolve. It is also ailed by its terrible base 68 HP and 65 Defense, which allow almost every common physical attacker to 2HKO it at worst and readily OHKO it at best, not to mention that it is vulnerable to every common priority attack in the game. Its terrible HP stat also offsets its excellent base 135 Special Defense, which limits how often it can switch in, even against resisted attacks. Gardevoir is also hindered by the frequency of Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, which means that, depending on its coverage, it can become Substitute-bait for Heatran or Aegislash.</p> <p>Mega Gardevoir is still a very good choice in the DOU metagame, as very few Pokemon can provide the offensive presence and flexibility that Mega Gardevoir can. However, despite the ease with which its weaknesses can be mitigated, they still necessitate support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp is an option that allows Gardevoir to slow down physical attackers, though this move is best employed through teammates because Gardevoir's frailty means that it will still take significant damage from burned foes. Gardevoir can also make great use of a Substitute to mitigate its lack of bulk, becoming a threatening presence once behind one, though this further increases the need for a redirection partner. Taunt is a viable pick as well, allowing Gardevoir to stop opposing Trick Room setters from setting up, as well as preventing other support moves such as Wide Guard, Tailwind, and Follow Me. Though very niche, Gardevoir can use Imprison, Memento, and Helping Hand to further support its teammates, though the latter two are best used on bulkier Pokemon, and Imprison only really aids against Sylveon. Lastly, Gardevoir can use Telepathy in its base forme in order to come in safely on a partner's spread move such as Earthquake or Explosion and then Mega Evolve safely the next turn, though it doesn't have use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross can easily come in on Gardevoir and proceed to KO it. Heatran can also switch in on Gardevoir's STAB moves with ease, but it has to scout for Focus Blast and Hidden Power Ground beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Gardevoir has no means of dealing with Fire-type Pokemon outside of a neutral Psychic, so they typically force it out. Charizard and Talonflame also beat Gardevoir one-on-one and can switch in on Hyper Voice fairly easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outrun and do heavy damage to Gardevoir, with U-turn 2HKOing and Earthquake OHKOing it in one-on-one situations. Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Gengar also outrun it and do significant damage. Though not conventionally counters, Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion can outrun and pick off weakened Gardevoir with ease if Gardevoir does not have a form of speed control in play.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks nullify any form of speed advantage Gardevoir may have, and due to its general frailty, all common priority moves deal significant amounts of damage to Gardevoir. In particular, Brave Bird from Talonflame and Sucker Punch from Bisharp both OHKO Gardevoir, with Gardevoir having little in the way of a play around aside from switching out or relying on a partner to deal with it. Kangaskhan also can do significant damage through Sucker Punch pick off a weakened Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Gardevoir's terrible Defense means that even weaker physical attacks will do heavy damage, and strong physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie will quickly tear through it.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Due to being reliant on any one form of Speed control, an opposing form can be costly for Gardevoir. Though annoying for all variants, faster Gardevoir in particular should avoid being paralyzed at all costs, as that greatly diminishes their impact on the game. Faster variants are also very ineffective against Trick Room teams due to the low bulk meaning that they can not just take a hit and retaliate. Slower Gardevoir also have a tough time against faster teams without Trick Room being up due to even the bulk investment not granting significant durability. Gardevoir used with Tailwind also dislike opposing Tailwind, as that voids any speed advantage that might be gained by Gardevoir's own team's Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard prevents Mega Gardevoir from using Hyper Voice freely.</p>",

        "name": "Trick Room Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Both Hyper Voice and Psychic are powerful STAB attack options, the former being Mega Gardevoir's primary form of offense due to its incredibly powerful spread damage that allows Mega Gardevoir to deal significant damage to anything that does not resist it. Psychic is used in order to bypass Wide Guard and deal with Poison-type Pokemon that resist Hyper Voice, most notably Amoonguss, though Psyshock can be used as an alternative in order to do more damage to Sylveon. Trick Room is used in order to support slower teammates by reversing the conventional turn order, allowing slower Pokemon to attack before faster ones. Protect lets Mega Gardevoir shield itself from attacks while a partner takes out a threat, stall out opposing field conditions, and punish double targets.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs on this set allow Gardevoir to always survive a Hasty Life Orb Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury, which facilitates setting up Trick Room. With the Special Attack investment and a Quiet nature, Mega Gardevoir can 2HKO non-bulky Mega Kangaskhan with Hyper Voice. Quiet is used over Modest for the drop in Speed, which makes Gardevoir faster in Trick Room. Similarly, 0 Speed IVs should also be used on this set to ensure that Gardevoir can take the most advantage out of Trick Room. Gardevoir's ability pre-Mega isn't really important, as none of them are particularly beneficial, but Trace is sometimes useful for being able to copy a foe's Intimidate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Trick Room Gardevoir, the key is to make sure Trick Room goes up as soon as possible, as this supports not only Gardevoir, but Gardevoir's whole team as well. Once Trick Room has been set up, Gardevoir plays quite similarly to a fast variant, with Hyper Voice now being used as often as possible. However, this set does not have any form of tertiary coverage, meaning it is a lot more dependent on its teammates to cover its weaknesses. One common mistake made when using Trick Room is the assumption that it needs to be set at all times; however, that is not the case, so it is best to remain cognizant of when to set Trick Room and when not to.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room Gardevoir works brilliantly because it can supplement speed control for itself. Intimidate support can be fulfilled by the likes of Landorus-T, as it can run sets to work on both fast and slow teams, and Scrafty is a very useful partner as well because its Fake Out allows Gardevoir to set Trick Room with greater confidence and it is also a capable check to Steel-type Pokemon. Redirection users also make for some viable team options, particularly Amoonguss, which becomes notably potent by gaining a fast Spore under Trick Room. Trick Room also allows Pokemon such as Hariyama and Rhyperior to become more threatening options for dealing with Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, with Hariyama also providing Fake Out support. Lastly, Mega Gardevoir also benefits greatly from another form of speed control, with full Trick Room teams preferring another setter such as Hoopa-U or Cresselia and balanced teams preferring an alternate form such as a Tailwind setter like Suicune, as Gardevoir can still outrun a large portion of the metagame if it's using a Modest spread.</p>"

        "name": "Special Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fast Mega Gardevoir relies heavily on Hyper Voice as its primary mode of offense, with Psychic or Psyshock being used as a secondary STAB move to deal with Amoonguss. Protect is used in order to safely Mega Evolve, stall out opposing field conditions, and scout and punish double targets. Focus Blast is one of Gardevoir's primary coverage options, allowing it to deal significant damage to Kangaskhan, with a 30% chance to OHKO standard set when using a Timid nature and just shy of a 90% chance when using a Modest nature. Hidden Power Ground is another option that grants Mega Gardevoir a more secure method of dealing with Heatran than Focus Blast and can punish opposing Aegislash that try to set up a Substitute on Gardevoir. Encore provides an excellent support option when used in conjunction with a Fake Out user, being able to lock opposing Pokemon into Protect or Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Mega Gardevoir outrun as much as possible, with the 8 HP EVs allowing it to survive a Sludge Bomb from Landorus and the rest of the EVs invested in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. If outrunning neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon is not a major concern, a Modest nature can be used instead. A bulkier spread of 72 HP / 108 Def / 220 SpA / 108 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used in order to always survive a Brave Bird from standard Talonflame, as well as a Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon from standard Aegislash, and outrun Jolly Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is a formidable threat in all moments of the game; however, it is at its best when outrunning and cleaning up worn-down threats with the help of some form of speed control. Typically, when using Mega Gardevoir, the goal is to spam Hyper Voice to take out large chunks of both of the opposing Pokemon's HP until it is forced out or is otherwise incapable of freely using Hyper Voice. Early-game, Hyper Voice can quickly break down the opposing team for Gardevoir's teammates to deal with more easily later on, and late-game, Gardevoir can clean up weakened threats two at a time with ease. Gardevoir's coverage options should only be used if absolutely needed; however, depending on what coverage is being used, Gardevoir is afforded different degrees of freedom. If Gardevoir is using Focus Blast, it may not have to always switch out if an opposing Kangaskhan is on the field if the Gardevoir user is aware of the Speed of both of the Pokemon. Focus Blast and Hidden Power Ground prevent Heatran from safely switching in on Gardevoir and using it as setup bait. Hidden Power Ground and Encore also allow Gardevoir to pressure Aegislash by punishing the Substitute and Wide Guard variants, though these options have to carefully weighed, as Aegislash can punish a bad read much more heavily than Heatran. As already mentioned, Gardevoir benefits greatly from speed control; however, this is especially true because a lot of the key threats it deals with typically outrun it and do significant damage before Gardevoir gets the chance to deal with them, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, which is why Gardevoir works so well with Tailwind to outrun and deal with them effortlessly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Gardevoir set appreciates the presence of an Intimidate user on its team in order to alleviate its bad physical bulk, in particular the likes of Landorus-T and Salamence. Landorus-T is able to quickly beat down bulky Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, which Gardevoir has trouble with, and Salamence is capable of using its mixed offensive coverage to help tackle some of Gardevoir's weak areas and can also offer speed control through Tailwind, which is a major boon for Gardevoir. Due to its middling Speed tier, Gardevoir likes to lean on the use of speed control options, such as Tailwind and Icy Wind, in order to outrun the opposing team and go to work. Notable options for speed control include Hydreigon, Talonflame, Gengar, and Jirachi, the former two setting up Tailwind and the latter two providing Icy Wind support. Each of those also provide some other area of support such as the ability to to beat Steel-types, cripple physical attackers, or provide redirection. The last key element, redirection, is an essential element of any Gardevoir team, as it provides room for Gardevoir to breathe and get into its offense. Jirachi and Amoonguss are the two most prominent options when looking for a redirector, as the former also has access to speed control and Helping Hand, whereas the latter has a sleep-inducing move with Spore. Gardevoir's team should place emphasis in being able to tackle Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon in particular, so options such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, Keldeo, Volcanion, and Heatran are all good picks.</p> <p>Some other options that Gardevoir teams can make great use of include Fake Out support, as that eases prediction when Mega Evolving and becomes a very disruptive option when used in conjunction with Encore. Infernape works well in this way, as it provides a Fake Out that outspeeds most common Quick Guard users and can deal with other foes that threaten Gardevoir such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Quick Guard is another option that Gardevoir greatly benefits from, as it keeps it safe from priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch, both of which OHKO it with ease, as well as priority Taunts and Thunder Waves.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran possesses a unique Fire / Steel typing and the ability Flash Fire, which grant it nine resistances and an immunity to Fire-type moves, allowing it to switch in on a lot of common threats in the Doubles metagame and serve as a great check for sun offense and Fairy-types. With a high Special Attack stat and good bulk, it serves as a strong offensive support Pokemon, capable of delivering significant damage to the opposing team. However, Heatran is held back by its weaknesses to common offensive types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. A fairly linear movepool makes Heatran quite predictable, and its middling Speed tier leaves it outrun by common threats when using its faster sets and undersped in Trick Room by common Trick Room sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A pure Special Attacker set with a Shuca Berry or Life Orb is Heatran's most viable option aside from its Substitute set. Such sets would run Flash Cannon in addition to its dual STABs, which helps Heatran take on Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B as it can stomach their Earth Powers due to the Shuca Berry. Shuca Berry can also be used on the Substitute set, although the usage of Substitute can knock Heatran's health low enough that the Shuca Berry will no longer protect it from any Ground-type moves. Eruption is a decent choice on Heatran, but as it forces Heatran to use a Quiet nature, should only be used on teams featuring Trick Room. Such sets should be paired with Safety Goggles so that they can take on Amoonguss, a major threat under Trick Room.</p> <p>Safety Goggles is a solid item choice on other sets as well, bolstering Heatran's ability to wall Chlorophyll Venusaur and Amoonguss, which might try to put it to sleep. Hidden Power Ice can be useful on the second set for taking on threats such as Landorus and Salamence. Will-O-Wisp can be used to hinder physical attackers on the switch. Ancient Power can be used to beat Talonflame and Charizard, though it is generally a poor choice. Alternatively, Stone Edge takes advantage of Mega Charizard Y's weaker defense and gets the OHKO even with a negative Attack nature. Heatran is one of the few Pokemon that can be used as a Stealth Rock setter, though it should only be used if sun is a major weakness of your team. Choice Scarf can be used to outrun and do heavy damage to Pokemon that normally outspeed Heatran, but Eruption, the move that would be most useful on such sets, forces Heatran to use a negative Speed nature. Air Balloon can be useful in some cases but should be avoided, as it removes Heatran's ability to switch in and out without breaking the Air Balloon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp can easily OHKO Heatran with Earthquake, and Swampert can also use Waterfall to circumvent a potential partner with Wide Guard. Pokemon with Ground-type coverage such as Mega Diancie, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B threaten Heatran as well, although only Hydreigon can safely switch in. Mega Charizard Y sometimes uses Hidden Power Ground specifically to beat Heatran, which would otherwise wall its standard set.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types can take any of its attacks and wear it down. Suicune and Rotom-W can easily take any move Heatran uses and 2HKO back with Hydro Pump, and Gyarados can do the same with Waterfall. Faster Water-types such as Kingdra, Ludicolo (under rain), and Keldeo can all outrun and OHKO Heatran; Keldeo, in particular, can beat it with both of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types, such as Terrakion and Virizion, can beat Heatran with STAB moves such as Close Combat. Bulky Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Scrafty are good checks as well; they can easily take its attacks due to commonly using Assault Vest and can 2HKO with Drain Punch to recover most of the damage taken. Mega Kangaskhan with Low Kick can take out Heatran as well.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Rain teams render Heatran relatively useless, as Heat Wave becomes a very weak move, and common rain abusers don't mind Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Substitute Heatran is susceptible to both Taunt and Encore, as they can prevent it from setting up Substitute or lock it into Substitute, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard prevents Heat Wave from being used and forces Heatran to either switch out, wait for its partner to handle the Wide Guard user, or use a coverage option.</p>",

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute shields Heatran from super effective moves and status, giving it room to operate. Heat Wave is the primary attacking move; the goal is to get behind a Substitute and use Heat Wave to wear down the opposing team for Heatran's teammates. Earth Power lets it beat opposing Heatran, which would otherwise wall it, as well as hit Rock-types such as Terrakion if you predict the switch. Protect does a number of things, including letting Heatran scout, stall out field conditions, and survive a deadly attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heatran runs maximum Speed usually to maximize its chance at winning a speed game with opposing Heatran. Investing 24 EVs into HP ensures that Choice Scarf Landorus-T cannot ever break a Substitute with Rock Slide, and the remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack to hit harder. If you find it important to outrun Pokemon which typically sit in the 260 Speed range, particularly Kyurem-B, Charizard, Zapdos, and Breloom, you can use Timid, but against the latter three Pokemon it's typically better practice to use Heatran's partners to give it room to set up a Substitute on them. If you don't need to outrun these threats, Modest allows Heatran to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Substitute Heatran, it is better to be patient and wait for a free turn to get behind a Substitute. There are numerous situations in which Heatran can safely set up, such as against support Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Togekiss, Cresselia, and Jirachi. Certain Choice item users, such as Genesect, Landorus-T, and Sylveon locked into Iron Head, Rock Slide, and Hyper Voice, respectively, are good foes to safely set up against. Once Substitute is up, use Protect and Leftovers to allow Heatran to quickly recuperate the HP lost from setting up the Substitute. Use Protect to scout for random Hidden Power Ground and Focus Blast, because common threats such as Sylveon, Charizard, Gardevoir, and Latios occasionally carry them to beat Heatran. A key part of using Heatran is that you should not try to set up a Substitute against a foe that beats Heatran, but if Heatran is already behind a Substitute when a check switches in, feel free to fire off a Heat Wave or Earth Power before switching out (unless their partner can also do heavy damage). Heatran can also switch in and out rather frequently, as it has enough bulk and resistances to do so relatively freely. In certain situations, it can be worth risking a Substitute versus a Pokemon that is capable of breaking it, such as when the opposing Pokemon are more threatened by Heatran's partner or are forced to go for the partner. It can be worth sacrificing a Pokemon to set up a Substitute, depending on how much of a nuisance Substitute Heatran is to the opposing team. For example, versus sun offense, Heatran can be virtually immovable, but against rain, Heatran is more of a liability.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W can clear out Terrakion and Ground-types such as Landorus-T. Rotom-W has the added bonuses of a Ground-type immunity and the ability to beat opposing Water-types, and Suicune has Tailwind for speed control. Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Diancie can all beat Fighting-types and enjoy having Steel-types cleared out. They also can complement Heatran's Heat Wave with powerful spread moves of their own. Substitute Heatran enjoys redirection quite a bit more than most Pokemon, as it relies on setting up a Substitute to succeed in doing its job. Partners such as Togekiss and Amoonguss can provide redirection and have good defensive synergy with Heatran. They both provide valuable resistances to Fighting, and Togekiss can provide speed control via Tailwind, while Amoonguss can easily absorb Water-type moves and use Spore to create free turns. Thundurus can paralyze faster threats, beat Water-types, and use Prankster Taunt in case opposing teams try to use their own Taunt to stop Heatran from setting up.</p> <p>Partners that provide significant amounts of offensive pressure are also excellent, as they tend to generate a lot of free turns as well as attention from the opposing team. Kangaskhan is a good example, as it can use Fake Out to buy Heatran a turn to set up. Latios can provide Tailwind support, and it threatens most common Fighting-types due to its high Speed and Special Attack and Psychic typing. Cresselia is a great partner, as it can support Heatran in many ways, such as by providing Skill Swap support to alleviate Heatran's Ground-type weakness, using Icy Wind or Thunder Wave for speed control, setting up sun via Sunny Day for a boost to Heat Wave, and beating common threats to Heatran such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Terrakion. Levitate and Flying-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Cresselia, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos are good partners. Due to being a major liability against rain teams, Heatran prefers partners that can compensate for it against rain. Electric-types and Grass-types, such as Thundurus and Amoonguss, work well in this regard, as do Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon. Mega Charizard Y also helps against rain by being able to change the weather using Drought, providing Heatran with increased Fire-type damage as well. Wide Guard users such as Hitmontop, Swampert, and Aegislash are useful partners, as they can shield Heatran from Earthquake users. Hitmontop also provides useful Intimidate and Fake Out support, Swampert can be useful in dealing with Landorus-T, Terrakion, and opposing Heatran, and Aegislash possesses powerful offenses and a useful Fighting-type immunity.</p>"

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash is one of the best utility Pokemon in DOU. Its great defensive typing and stats make it a good switch-in to many of the most powerful attackers in the metagame, including Kangaskhan, Metagross, Diancie, and Kyurem-B, four extremely potent offensive threats that are otherwise hard to check and definitely impossible to check with a single slot. Its powerful, nearly unresisted STAB moves are capable of 2HKOing basically anything that doesn't have investment in bulk. It can effectively run multiple different sets: most commonly a Wide Guard support set, but also an offensive bruiser with Life Orb or a late-game cleaning wall with Substitute.</p> <p>However, Aegislash's low Speed and lack of recovery make it vulnerable to being worn down over the course of the match, as it often has to take multiple hits before it attacks: one when it switches in on a hit and another on the turn it attacks. Its weaknesses to the common types of Dark, Fire, and especially Ground don't help its case either; it can take all but the strongest of hits from full health, but once chip damage removes half of its health, its utility is drastically limited. The fact that it is forced to run a unique Protect, King's Shield, doesn't help either. While it can sometimes bluff your opponent into not attacking for fear of a -2 Attack stat drop, or actually get a crucial -2, it's far more likely to let Aegislash get burned, put to sleep, or Encored.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The tank set can run Sitrus Berry to extend its longevity while bluffing Weakness Policy, but generally the threat is less effective than the real thing. When running Life Orb, Aegislash can also use Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened foes, but the attack is rather weak without investment, so Wide Guard is usually more useful. The Life Orb set can also use Sacred Sword over Flash Cannon to hit Bisharp, but as Bisharp is faster and almost OHKOes Aegislash, it's usually better to keep Flash Cannon, which has much better neutral coverage. For example, if the opponent could switch in either Hydreigon or Landorus-T, Flash Cannon will cover both, while Sacred Sword and Shadow Ball cover one each.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-type Pokemon are basically the only Pokemon that can shrug off a Shadow Ball, and all are capable of dealing heavy damage back to Aegislash. As such, they are the best Aegislash switch-ins. Bisharp is especially good for resisting both of Aegislash's STAB attacks. Hoopa-U is easily able to OHKO Aegislash with Hyperspace Fury, which breaks protect and ignores Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame are capable of significantly damaging Aegislash and make it much easier for the opposing team to keep it at bay.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Both Landorus and Landorus-T are capable of taking out Aegislash with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Taunt from the likes of Thundurus and Gyarados forces Aegislash to stay in Blade forme, keeping it vulnerable to a fatal hit. Unfortunately, Aegislash can simply switch out, not to mention the foe will still have to eat at least one Shadow Ball. Encore is effective on every single one of Aegislash's moves, trapping it either into Blade forme or a useless King's Shield. It's basically a strictly superior version of Taunt versus Aegislash, but the only remotely common users are Politoed, Mega Gardevoir, and Togekiss. Both of these utility moves are especially safe, because King's Shield does not stop them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: The foe can force Aegislash to switch in on resisted hits and take chip damage until it's within KO range of super effective coverage moves. This is how Aegislash is actually handled in the vast majority of cases. The hits it takes will get to it eventually, and it is much less effective when it can't attack with impunity. Burning Aegislash, possibly with Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, puts it on a short timer so that it is no longer entirely free to alternate between attacking and using King's Shield.</p>",

        "name": "Wide Guard Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are Aegislash's STAB attacks and complement each other well, only really missing out on Bisharp. Unfortunately, they have very little super effective coverage; Aegislash will pick up many 2HKOs, but very few OHKOs. Wide Guard is a spectacular support move to protect Aegislash's partners from Rock Slide, Diamond Storm, and, less frequently, Earthquake, Hyper Voice, and Heat Wave. It also has the nifty property of making Landorus-T unable to come in on Aegislash, especially if it lacks Stone Edge. Beware of the rarer Knock Off Landorus-T, but it does activate Weakness Policy. Substitute is an option over Wide Guard to take advantage of Aegislash's ability to force switches and to prevent Amoonguss from putting it to sleep, but Wide Guard is typically more useful. Besides, Aegislash doesn't want to dent its own HP because it wants to stay out of the KO range of super effective moves. All Aegislash should have King's Shield because Protect is already great and Blade forme cannot take hits.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aegislash doesn't need much more complicated investment than maximum HP and Special Attack. With less Special Attack, Aegislash loses the chance to OHKO Kangaskhan at +2, which is pretty important. Because Aegislash mirrors are fairly common, everyone does their own thing with Speed. Some minimize it fully to get the second hit on other Aegislash (to hit while the opposing Aegislash is in Blade forme), others use 4 Speed Modest to get the first hit (even Shield forme Aegislash can take up to 80%), and others use 84 Speed on a Tailwind team to get the jump on offensive Thundurus. In general, less Speed is good so that Aegislash can take more hits in Shield forme, but you should make your own decision based on your team's needs. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's ability to take super effective attacks fairly well by providing it with a boost to attacking stats. A useful alternative is Life Orb, which provides Aegislash constant high damage output, useful for securing KOs at the cost of compromising its bulk. Safety Goggles is another item option, allowing Aegislash to counter Breloom, Venusaur, and Amoonguss, but it is useless in all other matchups.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is mostly used as a pivot, switching in on threats, forcing them out, and taking a chunk out of something with one of its STAB attacks. Weakness Policy is used to discourage the opponent from attacking Aegislash with a super effective move that won't KO, which greatly extends Aegislash's lifespan by forcing the opponent to use non-super effective attacks to whittle Aegislash down first before taking it out. As such, it's recommended to keep Aegislash at high enough HP to keep the threat effective. Some important benchmarks are 55% for Mega Diancie's or Kyurem-B's Earth Power, 65% for Heatran's Heat Wave, and 75% for Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. If your opponent does activate Weakness Policy, something is probably going to faint every time Aegislash attacks, so you should focus on making its rampage last as long as possible. If Aegislash is running Life Orb, it works fairly well at greatly denting foes for teammates to clean up later. Typically this set is used early- and mid-game to keep momentum in your favor and won't survive to the end of the match, though you of course should keep it around if you're relying on it to check a specific threat such as Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>More than anything, this Aegislash is spectacular with Pokemon that need help with Diancie, such as Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B. Honestly, though, it fits on most teams because of its all-around utility. It is awkward on Tailwind teams though, as it will be exposed in Blade forme much more often. This set is great on balanced teams which emphasize defensive synergy, especially if they include fast sleep, redirection, or Fake Out, which are all useful for extending its +2 rampages. More offensive teams would probably prefer Life Orb Aegislash.</p>"

        "name": "Substitute Leftovers",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon provide Aegislash with two-move coverage that hits every relevant Pokemon except Bisharp neutrally. Substitute and King's Shield is a classic cleaning wall combination; alternating between the moves with attacks thrown in allows Aegislash to live forever if the Pokemon which can beat it one-on-one are eliminated. Substitute also helps to patch up King's Shield's inability to block status moves, though Aegislash is still vulnerable to Encore and Taunt. In addition, Aegislash can use Substitute along with its ability to force switches earlier in the game to play around its usual switch-ins. Wide Guard is an option that can be used in conjunction with Substitute in order utilize the both the longevity of the Substitute set with the support utility of the Wide Guard set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is vital for healing so that Aegislash can fulfill its role as a win condition via Substitute + King's Shield stalling. No more complex investment than maximum Special Attack and HP is necessary; even this comparatively bulky Aegislash is useful for hitting hard. Because Aegislash mirrors are fairly common, everyone does their own thing with Speed. In general, less Speed is good so that Aegislash can take more hits in Shield forme, but this set wants to win the mirror matchup because it has the ability to use Substitute on the opposing Aegislash and bait it into Blade forme or fish for King's Shields. How much creep you run is up to you.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main role is to serve as a win condition, cleaning the opponent's team after its counters are removed, simply by being unkillable. Early game, it can be used to blast the opponent's team with powerful Ghost-type moves and check some threats, but be sure to keep it healthy if it's likely to be your win condition.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>More defensive teams, which enjoy Aegislash's defensive traits but typically suffer from a lack of clear win conditions, will get the most mileage out of this set. Of course, this set needs support, and it only works on teams which are adept at clearing out its checks, which is to say Fire-, Ground-, Dark-, and strong Water-type move users. As basically all of these types are fairly popular in the metagame, this set is quite difficult to use; most teams will be better off with the tank set instead. However, it is still viable if the team is able to support it.</p>"

However, it is prone to becoming setup bait, especially for threatening sweepers carrying Substitute.

Light Clay can be used to lengthen the time screens last. Hidden Power Fire lets Cresselia hit Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage, as it takes very little from any of Cresselia's other attacks. Skill Swap is also a notable choice, as you can pass Levitate to Heatran and not have to worry about opposing Ground-type attacks while Cresselia gains an immunity to Fire-type attacks. You are also able to strip enemies of their useful abilities, such as Huge Power on Azumarill or Parental Bond on Mega Kangaskhan. Safeguard can be used to prevent crippling status conditions like Sleep and Paralysis as well as stop physical attackers from being burned by Will-O-Wisp. Gravity can raise the accuracy of moves such as Hydro Pump, but it also makes Cresselia and Flying-types vulnerable to Ground-type moves. Lunar Dance enables a crippled Pokemon to regain all of its HP with no status for a potential late-game sweep, although this is at the cost of Cresselia.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, Hydreigon and Hoopa-U can counter Cresselia if it is not carrying Moonblast, as they are immune to its STAB Psychic-type attacks. Bisharp and Scrafty can also run Knock Off, which Cresselia despises. Bisharp can even switch into Icy Wind and gain a +2 Attack boost due to Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Mega Gengar can deal a lot of damage with their super effective STAB Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar must be careful though, as it takes a lot of damage from Cresselias STAB Psychic-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Metagross, and Ferrothorn wall Cresselia without Hidden Power Ground. Aegislash can also hit back hard with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Spore users such as Amoonguss and Breloom can stop Cresselia from setting Trick Room by putting it to sleep. Safety Goggles can block Spore, however.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute: Pokemon that carry Substitute such as Heatran can set up on Trick Room Cresselia with ease. Without a Mental Herb, Taunt completely shuts down Cresselia, as it is unable to fulfill its role as a supporter or a Trick Room setter.</p>",

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room gives slower allies a chance to sweep. Cresselia's STAB-boosted Psychic does respectable damage to things which are not weak to its coverage moves, such as Rotom-W. Cresselia should always run Psychic, not Psyshock, because only the former breaks Kyurem-B's Substitute. Ice Beam gives Cresselia extra coverage, dealing 4x super effective damage to common threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ground lets Cresselia 2HKO Heatran, a threat that would normally wall Cresselia, as it resists Psychic- , Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks. Hidden Power Fighting allows Cresselia to deal 4x super effective damage to Bisharp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The main purpose of this set is to set up Trick Room and hit common threats hard. A Sassy nature and 3 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to function as effectively as possible in Trick Room while still having the maximum power possible for Hidden Power Ground. The EV spread lets Cresselia survive a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Bisharp while OHKOing 0 / 4 Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Expert Belt lets Cresselia deal more damage to the Pokemon it hits for super effective damage without compromising its bulk as Life Orb would do. Sitrus Berry increases Cresselia's longevity and lets it set up Trick Room more times and deal extra damage to foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Trick Room should be set up as early in the battle as possible, as Cresselia functions best under it and it can aid slower partners. You should also attempt to keep Cresselia and a partner that can sweep under Trick Room alive for a possible late-game sweep when the opponent's checks have been removed. Cresselia is great for switching into attacks because its amazing bulk allows it to take multiple hits. Cresselia should also be used to support its partner by getting surprise KOs on checks such as Bisharp and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As the moveset suggests, Cresselia is great for Trick Room teams, as you will find many opportunities to set up Trick Room with its impressive bulk and hit foes that are weak to Cresselia's attacks for good damage with Expert Belt. You should partner Cresselia with slow, powerful Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Rhyperior, and Mega Ampharos to get the most out of the Trick Room turns provided. A Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Hitmontop can flinch potential threats to increase the chances of setting Trick Room. Fighting-types also handle the common threats Cresselia has to deal with such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Earthquake users such as Rhyperior pair well with Cresselia, as they can freely use their STAB attack without hitting Cresselia. Amoonguss can also be a viable partner, as Rage Powder redirects Taunt and aids in setting up Trick Room. It can also put a potential threat to sleep with Spore and benefits greatly from Trick Room.</p>"

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind makes Cresselia a very threatening cleaning wall, as most Pokemon are not able to damage it faster than it can heal itself and very few can take boosted Psyshocks with ease. Even though Dark-types are immune to it, Psyshock is still Cresselia's main attacking option, as Cresselia needs the STAB boost to deal sufficient damage after a Calm Mind or two. Psyshock is recommended over Psychic solely for the mirror match. Moonlight is Cresselia's best healing option because rain and sand are uncommon. As a Trick Room setter, this Cresselia is able to support its team and pull its weight even when it can't use Calm Mind, and under Trick Room, it is able to move first, making it that much scarier. However, Icy Wind can be used instead on the fourth slot in for additional coverage that can still prove support. Hidden Power Ground is also an option, useful for getting past Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Cresselia runs maximum HP and Defense EVs because Calm Mind will boost its Special Defense. Safety Goggles is the recommended item because the easiest way to dispatch this Cresselia is to put it to sleep, though Leftovers (with Substitute) and Chesto Berry (with Rest) are also options. If Cresselia is not using Trick Room, 136 Speed EVs may be used so that Cresselia outspeeds Bisharp, granting it the ability to use Moonlight before taking Knock Off and stalling it out. If using Icy Wind, this also allows Cresselia to move before offensive Thundurus and any base 110s after getting a speed drop.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you plan to win with Calm Mind, it is absolutely critical to avoid letting Cresselia get burned, especially before it has set up, as burns destroy its effectiveness by forcing it to heal almost every turn. The game plan for this set is simple: come in on two foes that can't outdamage Moonlight, set up a Trick Room or Calm Mind, and become virtually invincible. Don't be afraid to set up early; thanks to Cresselia's bulk, it can set up multiple times throughout a match, and setting up is a great way to lure in Cresselia's checks for its partner to dismantle. Cresselia can support its team throughout the match by plugging away with +1 or +2 Psyshocks to soften up the opposing team, and Cresselia has a much easier time sweeping when it has partner support.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Cresselia is capable of offering Trick Room support, it fits quite well on Trick Room teams as an extremely bulky setter that doesn't fear being OHKOed. In return, it appreciates Fake Out and redirection support, which can give it a much easier time setting up, block Taunt and burns, and help Cresselia get past certain threats such as Kangaskhan. Of course, it wants teammates that can remove Dark- and Steel-types consistently, which means Fighting-, Fairy-, and Fire-types are most effective. On non-Trick Room teams, Keldeo is a very good partner, as it lures in setup bait such as Amoonguss and Venusaur and is able to handle all of the common Dark- and Steel-types.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icy Wind is a spread move that provides speed control and is 4x super effective against Landorus-T and Salamence. Thunder Wave is also great for permanent speed control and the possibility to immobilize a foe. Helping Hand assists in giving Cresselia's partner a 1.5x power boost, which can be helpful in many situations. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move because more of the Doubles metagame has bulkier Special Defense. Light Screen boosts the team's overall Special Defense significantly or Protect can be used to add more survivability.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Calm nature with maximum HP investment and 112 Special Defense EVs enable Cresselia to be a specially defensive wall that's difficult to take down. With the assitance of a Sitrus Berry, Cresselia can avoid getting 2HKOed by a Shadow Ball from Modest Mega Gengar. Furthermore, the 100 Defense EVs with the Sitrus Berry ensure that Cresselia will survive a Pin Missile from Adamant Mega Heracross, an extremely strong attack, and also let it avoid being 2HKOed by a Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan. Safety Goggles can assure Cresselia is not shut down by Spore or Sleep Powder.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main purpose of this set to provide Cresselia's partner with speed control and a boost to its attacks. However, Cresselia is also extremely useful in switching into most attacks thanks to its impressive bulk. Cresselia should slow the opposing Pokemon down with Icy Wind until its partner is able to outspeed them, before spamming Helping Hand to assist its partner in dealing major damage. Psyshock should only be used if it is super effective against the opposing Pokemon or if the enemy is within KO range.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is most effective on offensive teams looking for a Pokemon that can take hits and provide speed control to aid with sweeping. Powerful attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Azumarill, and Keldeo all enjoy speed control for beating faster checks. Speedy Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo or those with priority moves make good partners, as they can eliminate Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon before they inflict damage towards Cresselia with their powerful Dark-type STAB attacks. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are also helpful for taking care of annoying Steel-types that will support Cresselia such as Scizor. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are able to spam Earthquake thanks to Levitate, while also taking care of Steel-types, notably Heatran. Garchomp appreciates speed control as well to outspeed and beat Latios.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>When Mega-Evolved, Mega Venusaur has the ability Thick Fat, which neuters Fire- and Ice-type moves, making it only weak to Flying-, Psychic-, and Teravolt Ice-type attacks. The combination of Thick Fat and its increased stats makes Mega Venusaur a fantastic tank, especially against rain teams, and as a win condition, meaning it's great at winning the game if you remove its checks. Alternatively, non-Mega Venusaur takes advantage of the ability Chlorophyll and its base 80 Speed to outspeed virtually anything when the sun is up. Venusaur has a great movepool with access to powerful STAB attacks as well as the useful support move Sleep Powder. Its non-Mega Chlorophyll set takes advantage of its high Speed to deal good damage and spread sleep, and it has strong offensive synergy with Mega Charizard Y. However, both formes are weak to common Fire- and Psychic-type threats, such as Talonflame and Cresselia, and are also reliant on Sleep Powder and Leech Seed to do anything against Steel-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Growth can be run on either set to make Venusaur a huge offensive threat, but it's typically not worth sacrificing a moveslot for. Leaf Storm can be run on Mega Venusaur to get OHKOes it wouldn't achieve with Giga Drain (such as against Rotom-W or Politoed), but it's pretty team-specific and not as reliable as Giga Drain overall. Wide Lens can be used instead of Life Orb to increase Sleep Powder's accuracy, but the decrease in power is very noticeable. Hidden Power Ground is one of Venusaur's few coverage options to hit Steel-types, mainly Heatran, but this is a weakness that's typically better covered by another teammate, since Venusaur does not want to give up any of its moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Powerful Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran threaten non-Mega Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-types such as Latios and Cresselia can heavily dent Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Common Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash are immune to Venusaur's Poison-type moves and resist Grass. Some are also immune to Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame not only has a typing advantage but outspeeds even Venusaur in sun thanks to Gale Wings. It can handily deal massive damage with its Gale Wings Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B easily handles both formes of Venusaur, as Teravolt ignores Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Sand, rain, and hail remove Venusaur's Speed boost. However, Venusaur fares pretty well against Politoed one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan fares well against Mega Venusaur, as it doesn't care about Mega Venusaur's resistances and deals too much damage for Mega Venusaur to tank, KOing with Fake Out + Double-Edge. However, Mega Kangaskhan doesn't like Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye disable Venusaur's essential support moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room, Tailwind and paralysis users such as Cresselia, Thundurus, and Jirachi neuter Venusaur's high Speed and put it at a disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles: Common Safety Goggles users such as Aegislash, Rotom-H, and Cresselia shut down Venusaur's sleep spam strategies, and many of the common Safety Goggles users also have typing advantages against Venusaur.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain's recovery adds to Mega Venusaur's already impressive bulk. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's strongest STAB move, allowing it to deal with threatening Fairies and also possibly poison foes to aid residual damage from Leech Seed. Sleep Powder is an excellent support move in the Doubles metagame, which doesn't have a Sleep clause, and thanks to Mega Venusaur's improved bulk, it's great at spreading sleep. Leech Seed can be used instead of Sleep Powder as a means of both passive damage and recovery for Mega Venusaur and its teammate's switch-ins. Protect keeps Mega Venusaur safe while its partner deals with any possible threats, such as Talonflame. Synthesis is another option, as it provides more reliable recovery and adds to Mega Venusaur's already great bulk. However, it should only be used beside Sleep Powder, as the recovery granted from Leech Seed + Giga Drain is typically enough for Protect to be more useful in the last slot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Venusaurite is required in order for Venusaur to Mega Evolve. Thick Fat neutralizes Mega Venusaur's biggest weaknesses, Fire- and Ice-type moves, making it only weak against Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. The given HP and Defense EV investment allows Mega Venusaur to live a Life Orb Brave Bird from Talonflame, while 52 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outrun standard Rotom-W. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack which, with a Modest nature, lets Mega Venusaur deal as much damage as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur works excellently late-game, as it walls most weakened Pokemon and can then stall with Leech Seed or Synthesis or spam Sludge Bomb. With Sleep Powder, it also can be used early-game to put threats to sleep, allowing you to gain momentum. Mega Venusaur is a fantastic rain counter, able to wall or defeat big rain threats such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Ludicolo. Choosing to not Mega Evolve Venusaur can also help you get an edge against opposing sun teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is a good partner to Mega Venusaur due to the fact that it can dish out a super-effective Heat Wave versus Steel-types that Mega Venusaur would normally have some trouble against, such as Aegislash, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. Heatran also brings some useful resistances to the table that Mega Venusaur appreciates, most notably resistances to Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. Mega Venusaur also helps Heatran in return by being arguably the best counter to Rain teams in the metagame, against which Heatran is often dead weight. Quick Guard users such as Keldeo or Terrakion can assist Mega Venusaur by protecting it from Talonflame's Brave Bird. Keldeo and Terrakion are also capable of getting rid of Mega Kangaskhan, who hits Mega Venusaur too hard to be tanked, and Kyurem-B, who hits Mega Venusaur with a super effective STAB Ice Beam, thanks to Teravolt. Terrakion in particular also helps remove Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, Keldeo, Terrakion, or other Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks like Suicune can get rid of certain Fire-types that Mega Venusaur does not fare well against, especially Heatran. In return, Mega Venusaur helps Terrakion and Keldeo by easily switching into Mega Diancie and bulky Water-types. Rotom-W, Thundurus, or other Electric-types can switch into Flying-types for Mega Venusaur, increasing its longevity. Powerful Dark- and Ghost-types such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Darkrai can get rid of Psychic-type threats, specifically Latios and Cresselia.</p>"

Giga Drain's recovery adds to Venusaur's already impressive bulk and offsets Venusaur's Life Orb damage. Leaf Storm can be used instead to achieve OHKOs that Venusaur wouldn't normally get against Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Sleep Powder is an excellent support move in the Doubles metagame, where there is no Sleep Clause, and Venusaur is almost always guaranteed to go before your target in the sun. It has less-than-ideal accuracy, but it helps maintain momentum by stopping Pokemon which Venusaur cannot KO and makes Venusaur useful against Steel-types, which wall its STAB attacks. Protect keeps Venusaur safe while its partner deals with any potential threats and while Charizard Mega Evolves to get sun up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed investment makes Venusaur one of the fastest Pokemon in the game while sun is up, outspeeding up to Jolly Scarf Landorus-T. Full investment in Special Attack, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb allow Venusaur to become a powerful offensive threat. The remaining EVs are put into HP to allow Venusaur to make the most of its good defensive typing and ability to switch in on Water-types, especially Politoed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sun is essential for Venusaur to reach its full potential, as its Speed is its greatest asset. It functions best as a lead to apply offensive pressure or to sleep spam threats, allowing you to gain momentum. It's also great at walling Pokemon such as Amoonguss, as its Grass typing makes Venusaur immune to powder moves. Lastly, be cautious against foes that might have Safety Goggles, such as Rotom-H and Cresselia.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Venusaur should always be paired with Mega Charizard Y, as it's the only viable Drought user in the tier. Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y also have excellent synergy. Venusaur checks Rock-types, particularly Mega Diancie and Terrakion, for Mega Charizard Y, as well as Water-types that resist Mega Charizard Y's Fire-type attacks, particularly Politoed, which can replace the sun, and serves as a Trick Room check with Sleep Powder. In return, Mega Charizard Y checks Steel-types, such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, for Venusaur. Venusaur can also put Pokemon that threaten both Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur to sleep. If the sun is up, Venusaur can switch into resisted hits, as well as Amoonguss and Breloom thanks to Venusaur's immunity to powder moves. Heatran and Talonflame checks are extremely important because they counter both Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y. Good checks include Gyarados, Rotom-W, Quick Guard Keldeo, Landorus-T, and Terrakion. Terrakion checks Rotom-H, Talonflame, and Heatran and has its Water weakness removed in the sun. Venusaur in return checks Fairy- and Water-types that threaten it.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>In Doubles OU, while Mega Charizard Y is one of the top three Mega Pokemon and is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame period, Mega Charizard X serves as more of a niche option and needs heavy team support to work at its best. One of Mega Charizard Y's key selling points is Drought, which gives it excellent utility as a weather setter and, more importantly, complements its already powerful Special Attack by providing a 50% damage boost to its Fire-type moves, which lets its Heat Wave take huge chunks of HP out of any opposing Pokemon that does not resist it. What Mega Charizard X brings to the table is the fact that it is a physical setup sweeper that is immune to burns, though its typing is also very useful, as it reduces Charizard's 4x Rock-type weakness to a 2x weakness, removes its Electric- and Water-type weaknesses (though Drought reduces the Water-type weakness on Mega Charizard Y as well), and gives it a neutrality to Fairy despite it being a Dragon-type. Mega Charizard X also has a very useful surprise factor, as opponents may find their typical Charizard counters, such as Electric-types, ineffective against Mega Charizard X. However, Charizard does have its share of problems, notably its middling Speed when compared to threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross. Mega Diancie in particular is common and powerful, which forces Charizard teams to play extra carefully. Charizard also has weaknesses to a few common offensive types, with Mega Charizard Y being weak to Electric-, Rock-, and Water-type moves and Mega Charizard X being weak to Rock-, Dragon-, and Ground-type moves. In addition, Charizard does not take neutral hits particularly well, meaning that you have to be careful when bringing Charizard on to the field. Mega Charizard X also has the unfortunate issue of having its best attack, Flare Blitz, wear it down quickly due to recoil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Mega Charizard Y, Fire Blast can be used over Overheat, as it still hits really hard and does not drop Charizard's Special Attack, though it is slightly weaker and has shakier accuracy. Flamethrower can also be used to get around Wide Guard, and it deals significant single-target damage without any of the drawbacks of Overheat or Fire Blast, but it is quite a bit weaker than both. Sunny Day and Tailwind are also interesting choices on Mega Charizard Y; Tailwind makes up for its mediocre base Speed, and Sunny Day provides a way to punish Politoed switch-ins. Focus Blast is an alternative move that provides coverage against Pokemon that can take Charizard's other attacks with ease, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Mega Charizard X can run Earthquake so that it is not hard countered by Heatran. Fire Punch can be used over Flare Blitz if you do not want to deal with the recoil, but it is much much weaker. Roost can be used for longevity on either Mega Evolution; it is particularly helpful on Mega Charizard X due to the recoil from Flare Blitz. Will-O-Wisp is also an option to punish certain switch-ins, but it is not very reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard Y suffers from limited coverage, which lets certain foes such as Latios and Hydreigon switch in and hit it back with minimal risk. They can also OHKO Mega Charizard X with Draco Meteor, though they have to watch out for Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran can easily switch in and set up on both Mega Charizard formes, but it only fully counters Mega Charizard Y lacking Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Politoed completely shuts down Mega Charizard Y, weakening its Fire-type STAB attacks in addition to rendering Solar Beam virtually useless. Tyranitar can easily switch in on Mega Charizard Y, lacking Focus Blast. Mega Charizard X has a slightly better matchup versus opposing weather setters, though rain forces it to rely on Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Terrakion, Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie can outspeed and deal massive damage to both Charizard formes, if not outright OHKO them. Maximum Speed Mega Kangaskhan outspeeds standard Charizard and deals massive damage to both formes as well, and Sucker Punch lets it pick off weakened Charizard if it fails to OHKO it. Talonflame can always outrun both forms of Charizard and dish out massive damage. Weather sweepers such as Ludicolo and Excadrill can outrun and OHKO Charizard in rain and sand, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room lets slow opposing Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Ampharos outrun and deal massive damage to, if not OHKO, both Charizard formes. With Tailwind support, Pokemon that would normally be beaten by Charizard, such as fast Rhyperior, are able to outspeed and KO it. Neither forme wants to be hit with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Wide Guard: Although it's uncommon, Stealth Rock severely reduces Mega Charizard Y's staying power, taking just shy of 50% of its HP every time it switches in. Encore can lock Mega Charizard X into Dragon Dance, forcing it to either switch out or stall out. Wide Guard prevents Mega Charizard Y from spamming Heat Wave, which is what it will normally be doing.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave provides Mega Charizard Y with a reliable STAB attack, and because it is a spread move boosted under the sun, it allows Mega Charizard Y to deal massive amounts of combined damage against the opposing team. Solar Beam hits the Water- and Rock-type Pokemon that resist Heat Wave for super effective damage. Overheat provides Charizard with a \"nuke\" option, as it is able to deal huge damage against even Pokemon that resist it. Hidden Power Ground can be used to beat opposing Heatran, which otherwise wall it. Lastly, Protect allows Charizard to scout for moves, block Fake Out and status inflictions, and stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 64 Def EVs allow Mega Charizard Y to always survive a Return from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan. 108 Speed EVs ensure that Charizard always outruns maximum Speed Breloom, as well as other positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, which allows it to KO Breloom before being hit by Spore. The remaining EVs are dumped placed into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. 248 HP EVs are the most EVs possible that still allow Charizard to switch in on Stealth Rock twice, though Stealth Rock is incredibly rare in Doubles OU. Alternative spreads include the traditional 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid or Modest nature, though that spread is not very effective in the current metagame, and another spread of 248 HP / 144 Def / 8 SpA / 108 Spe, which allows Charizard to always survive a Rock Slide from an Adamant Landorus-T and have a 50% chance to OHKO back with Overheat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an incredibly simple Pokemon to use; generally, the hardest part of using it is finding the right time to get it onto the field. However, once Mega Charizard Y is in, the goal is to spam Heat Wave until something on the opposing side forces Charizard out, as a sun-boosted Heat Wave takes large chunks of HP out of both opposing Pokemon, assuming that neither foe resists it. Coverage options are used when needed, though you should be careful when using Solar Beam if the opposing team has a sand or rain setter, as Solar Beam takes two turns to charge instead of one without sun. Overheat should only be used when you desperately need something KOed or if you are okay with switching Charizard out immediately afterwards. Use Protect when needed, such as to scout for an opposing weather setter to switch in before you Mega Evolve Charizard. During weather wars, it is a generally good idea to keep Charizard in the back to switch in once the opposing team has already set their weather, as Charizard can then come in to negate it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Venusaur is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard Y due to Chlorophyll doubling Venusaur's Speed under sun, and they cover each other's weaknesses well. Venusaur can switch in on most common Electric-type attacks easily, and under the sun it can outspeed and deal heavy damage to a lot of common Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon. It also has access to Sleep Powder, so it can act as a buffer against Trick Room teams, which give Mega Charizard Y trouble. Heatran enjoys using sun-boosted Heat Waves and, together with Charizard Y, creates a devastating offensive force under the sun. Aegislash is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard Y, as it is an excellent check to Rock-types (namely Diancie), works well against Trick Room and all other manners of speed control, and also has access to Wide Guard, which helps Charizard against Diancie and Rock Slide users. Scrafty is a good partner due to its access to Intimidate, which helps versus physical attackers, as well as being able to work effectively against Rock-types apart from Diancie. Terrakion is also a good partner, as it can break past the likes of Heatran, Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar with ease, and its own Water-type weakness is mitigated by Drought. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior make for good partners for Mega Charizard Y, as they both have access to Lightning Rod to redirect Electric-type moves from Charizard and are able to beat common Charizard checks, particularly Diancie, with ease. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and access to Icy Wind and Thunder Wave, both of which alleviate Mega Charizard Y's issues against fast Pokemon. Calm Mind Cresselia also enjoys Drought, as Moonlight recovers more HP in the sun. Latios also pairs well with Mega Charizard Y and can support it with Tailwind. Landorus-T can support Mega Charizard Y thanks to its ability to beat threatening Rock-types, access to a fast pivoting move and Intimidate, and immunity to Electric-type attacks. Charizard appreciates Wide Guard, with the most noteworthy user being Aegislash. Lastly, Quash / Will-O-Wisp Sableye is a fun partner for Charizard, as Quash allows Charizard to move ahead of Pokemon that can otherwise beat it and OHKO them with Overheat, and Will-O-Wisp can severely cripple physical attackers, which affords Charizard more room to operate, as it then does not have to worry as much about physical attacks.</p>"

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz is Mega Charizard X's strongest attack and can OHKO most of the metagame after one boost. Dragon Claw is a safe move to use if your opponent's team is already weakened, and unlike Flare Blitz, it doesn't have recoil, allowing Mega Charizard X to stick around longer. Dragon Dance boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack and Speed, making it very threatening. Protect allows Mega Charizard X to scout for moves, block Fake Out and status inflictions, and stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X has maximum Attack investment in order to help it to hit as hard as possible. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed all Deoxys-A at +1, and Hydreigon at +0. An Adamant nature is used over a Jolly one, as Dragon Dance makes up for the initial loss in Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The key to using Mega Charizard X is to find a free turn to set up a Dragon Dance before proceeding to break apart the opposing team. Free turns can be found against Electric-types and certain Water-types; for example, both Swampert and Keldeo can deal massive damage to Mega Charizard X, but Suicune struggles to dish out relevant damage to it. A useful thing to remember is that most people assume Charizard will be holding Charizardite Y, so use that to your advantage, such as by setting up on Wide Guard users. Generally speaking, it is best to keep Mega Charizard X in the back until its checks and counters have been weakened or KOed and it is able to set up and clean the rest of the opposing team. Saving it for later also maintains the mind game as to whether it's Mega Charizard Y or Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefairy and Amoonguss are viable users of Follow Me or Rage Powder and can drastically ease Mega Charizard X's setup; Clefairy can bolster Charizard's Defense thanks to Friend Guard, and Amoonguss can help it set up Dragon Dance with Spore support as well. Aegislash is an excellent partner for Mega Charizard X, as it is an excellent check to Rock-types (namely Diancie), works well against Trick Room and all other methods of speed control, and also has access to Wide Guard, which helps Charizard out against Diancie and Rock Slide users. Scrafty is a good partner due to its access to Intimidate, which helps versus physical attackers, as well as its ability to work effectively against Rock-types besides Diancie. Terrakion is also a good partner, as it can break past the likes of Heatran, Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar with ease. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior make for good partners for Mega Charizard X, as they both have access to Lightning Rod to redirect Thunder Wave away from Charizard and are able to beat common Charizard checks, such as Diancie, with ease. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and access to Icy Wind and Thunder Wave, both of which alleviate Mega Charizard X's issues against fast Pokemon. Landorus-T can support Mega Charizard X thanks to its ability to beat threatening Rock-types and its access to both a fast pivoting move and Intimidate, though it has to be careful about using Earthquake, as Mega Charizard X is not immune to Ground-type attacks. Charizard appreciates Wide Guard support, with the most noteworthy user being Aegislash. Defiant and Competitive users such as Bisharp and Milotic can make for good partners for Mega Charizard X by discouraging opponents from bringing in Intimidate users. Bisharp also works well against common Trick Room setters and can put opposing Pokemon that survive a +1 Flare Blitz into KO range thanks to its powerful Sucker Punch. Milotic does a good job at breaking past bulkier Rock-types thanks to its Water typing, and it also beats Heatran, which otherwise walls Mega Charizard X with ease. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill also help to beat Heatran as well; Keldeo can also use Quick Guard to spare Charizard from Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus-I.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest Fake Out users, sporting a base Speed of 110 that lets it outspeed the likes of Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape. It also has Lightning Rod, which neuters opposing Electric-types by redirecting Electric-type attacks, benefiting teams that struggle with foes such as Thundurus. With access to a good utility movepool containing options such as Fake Out, Encore, Nuzzle, and Feint, Raichu controls game flow and provides speed control. On the other hand, its poor bulk leaves it easily KOed by strong attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Talonflame's Flare Blitz. In addition, Raichu provides little offensive pressure by itself, as it lacks the ability to deal meaningful damage and is walled by Grass- and Ground-types. Compared to other Electric-types in the metagame—Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos—Raichu lacks the natural Ground immunity, bulk, and offensive pressure the other options provide, making it a niche option for teams requiring its specific support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice is a possible coverage move, but it's unpopular because Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily move before Raichu and U-turn out. In addition, Hidden Power Ice doesn't pick up the KO on Landorus-T even with maximum Special Attack investment. Protect is useful on nearly every Doubles Pokemon, and despite its already difficult task of picking only four moves, Raichu can also use it to decent success.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Threats faster than Raichu, such as Talonflame and Landorus-T and even weather sweepers such as Swift Swim Ludicolo and Chlorophyll Venusaur, do not need to worry about a large portion of its utility moves and can threaten to OHKO it, nullifying its ability to properly support its partner.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Not running Protect leaves Raichu with little counterplay to opposing Fake Out. In addition, Kangaskhan with Inner Focus can ignore Raichu's Fake Out because it cannot flinch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss and Ferrothorn are generally unafraid of being paralyzed and can slowly take out Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Landorus are immune to Nuzzle and can simply OHKO Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar are immune to both Fake Out and Feint.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nice access to one of the fastest Fake Outs lets Raichu outspeed other Fake Out users and immobilize a foe for a turn nearly without fail, giving Raichu's partner room to set up or go on the offensive without being hindered. Encore locks a foe into the same move for three turns, possibly forcing it to use a suboptimal move. An Electric-type STAB move in the form of Volt Switch or Thunderbolt enables Raichu to still be an offensive threat to frailer foes, such as Talonflame and Azumarill. Volt Switch lets Raichu pivot to refresh Fake Out and bring in a partner; alternatively, Thunderbolt deals more damage and, when combined with more Special Attack EVs, picks up the KO on threats such as Talonflame. In addition, Thunderbolt is a better option for situations where Raichu does not wish to switch out. Nuzzle lets Raichu provide speed control for a team and reduce its tendency to suck momentum, even hitting Mega Diancie where Thunder Wave cannot due to bypassing Magic Bounce in addition to Taunt. Feint breaks Protect, making it a good option for applying offensive pressure while also synergizing with the threat of Fake Out. Feint is especially helpful for partners that use single-target attacks, such as Mega Kangaskhan, which benefit from Raichu breaking Protect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Lightning Rod redirects Electric-type attacks, neutering the offensive pressure of opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Raichu Speed tie with the competitive base 110 Speed tier, which includes threats such as Latios and Mega Diancie. The remainder is put into HP to alleviate Raichu's poor bulk, letting it survive attacks like Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave. An alternative set with maximum Special Attack instead of HP is recommended if using Thunderbolt, to pick up the KO on Talonflame. Air Balloon is useful for discouraging opposing Choice Scarf Landorus-T from locking itself into Earthquake, forcing a U-turn or a Rock Slide, both of which Raichu is relatively unafraid of. On the other hand, Focus Sash is a good catch-all defensive item for surviving any powerful attack, including not only Landorus-T's Earthquake but also Talonflame's Flare Blitz.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Raichu's Fake Out support is key to helping allies set up—such as through Belly Drum, Swords Dance, Tailwind, or Substitute—or to maintain offensive pressure. Due to Raichu's access to Encore, its Fake Out is especially threatening, as foes cannot stall out the Fake Out turn with Protect. Feint can punish Protects as well. Although opposing Pokemon will want to double Protect on Raichu's Fake Out, Encore combined with a high Speed allows Raichu to lock foes into Protect, making them effectively useless for three turns or until they switch out. In addition, Encore is useful for locking foes into Fake Out, which doesn't work after the first turn out, or setup moves such as Belly Drum and Substitute, and for locking foes into resisted moves or Electric-type moves, either for Raichu's partner or itself. Thus, Raichu should be used for building up offensive pressure and providing the necessary support to its partner. With Volt Switch, Raichu can take advantage of its rotational power to keep itself healthy and refresh Fake Out, coming in when the support is needed and avoiding situations where it becomes a momentum sink, unable to impact the field. For example, Raichu can't threaten certain fast threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Talonflame and bulkier threats such as Aegislash and Amoonguss, all of which either outspeed and KO it first or are relatively untouched by anything from its movepool. Be careful when bringing Raichu in on attacks, as its poor bulk and negligible resistances leave it susceptible to being KOed on the switch. Instead, mostly use it as a lead or switch it in after a partner is KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water- and Flying-types, such as Azumarill and Talonflame, that benefit from Lightning Rod incapacitating opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus make for very good partners for Raichu. Fake Out support is good for partners that appreciate the free setup opportunities, such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, and Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B. Unlike other Electric-types, Raichu has a poor matchup against Talonflame, being outsped and OHKOed by Flare Blitz, so good Talonflame checks such as Landorus-T and Mega Diancie help alleviate this weakness. Raichu is incapable of threatening Amoonguss, so Amoonguss checks and switch-ins that are immune to Spore such as Safety Goggles Jirachi compensate for Raichu's poor Amoonguss matchup. Other Pokemon that can threaten to KO Amoonguss such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y also are good options.</p>"

Clefairy also has access to useful support moves such as Follow Me, Heal Pulse, and Helping Hand, which allow it to be a useful addition to a lot of teams. Even though Clefairy cannot viably carry any other items apart from Eviolite, it has a small niche in being slightly bulkier than Clefable with it, which is very useful in many situations, as Clefairy can heal its teammate after taking a hit or redirect very powerful moves that Clefable cannot. Friend Guard also provides an additional damage reduction to powerful spread attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Landorus-T's Earthquake. However, Clefairy has very bad offensive stats and finds itself restricted to supportive roles only, which makes it Taunt bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used as permanent speed control; however, it is blocked by Taunt and can only target one Pokemon at a time. Moonlight can be used to provide recovery and help Clefairy stay around for longer, but it is hindered by rain and is also stopped by Taunt. Moonblast can be used to deal solid damage to Hydreigon and Scrafty while also preventing Bisharp from switching in for an easy boost from Defiant. However, Clefairy can easily redirect moves from Hydreigon and Scrafty anyway, so Icy Wind is usually the more reliable option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Clefairy can easily lose to Steel-types such as Aegislash, Bisharp, and Mega Metagross, as they are all capable of 2HKOing or even OHKOing it. Heatran also sets up for free on Clefairy, as it doesn't care about Follow Me because it uses Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Because Clefairy relies on support moves to be useful and has no offensive presence, it can be made useless when Taunt are used against it.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attackers</strong>: Clefairy is incapable of redirecting spread moves from the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Heatran and is usually dead weight against them.</p>",

Clefairy has very low offensive presence; however, Icy Wind allows it to slow down opposing Pokemon and prevents it from being forced out, even after it has been hit by Taunt. Heal Pulse allows Clefairy to heal its teammates by 50% and help them stay on the field longer when combined with Friend Guard. Alternatively, Helping Hand helps Clefairy's teammates deal more damage and potentially net OHKOs that they usually couldn't get. Protect gives Clefairy longevity, can help provide free turns, and keeps Friend Guard active for longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and 192 Defense EVs coupled with Eviolite allow Clefairy to always survive Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, while the remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to allow Clefairy to survive Aegislash's Flash Cannon. Eviolite provides Clefairy with slightly more bulk than Clefable. Friend Guard boosts Clefairy's teammates' bulk and gives it a niche over Clefable. An EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD with a Calm nature can be used, as it allows Clefairy to still survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and provides a lot more special bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefairy should only be used for Friend Guard to help its teammates set up; otherwise, a different Follow Me user such as Clefable or Togekiss should be used. Friend Guard is only active when Clefairy is on the field, so keeping it safe by using Protect against powerful opposing Pokemon such as Bisharp and Mega Metagross can give its teammate an opportunity to heavily damage them. Follow Me should be used to allow teammates to set up or prevent them from taking damage from powerful attacks. If there is an opportunity for Clefairy's teammate to OHKO an opposing Pokemon, use Helping Hand. Do not be afraid to lose Clefairy, as it has only one job in supporting its teammates, and if it faints while doing so, it means that it has done its job.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong attackers that have good bulk such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan work well with Follow Me and Friend Guard support. Mega Charizard Y can take out the Steel-types that threaten Clefairy and has more opportunities to spam Heat Wave when aided by Clefairy's redirection support. Mega Kangaskhan can set up with Power-Up Punch against the opposing team while Clefairy redirects their moves. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B appreciate the ability to set up for free with redirection support, and both of them are very bulky with Friend Guard active. Belly Drum Azumarill can get free turns to set up with Belly Drum and becomes difficult to take down because Friend Guard boosts its already good bulk. Clefairy fits best on offensive teams because it has next to no offensive presence and its teammates appreciate the extra bulk.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>In Doubles OU, Clefable finds itself as an effective Follow Me user thanks to a solid defensive typing coupled with good mixed defenses. However, what separates Clefable from other Follow Me users is its access to Unaware, which lets Clefable ignore the opposing Pokemon's stat changes. This allows Clefable to work as a quick stop to opposing setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, simultaneously stopping the opposing team's strategies and protecting Clefable's partner from taking hits. In addition to that, Clefable has a wide variety of other useful moves such as Thunder Wave, Helping Hand, Icy Wind, Encore, and Safeguard, letting it provide support when Follow Me is unneeded. However, Unaware has the downside of ignoring opposing Pokemon's stat drops too. This means that unless an opposing Pokemon has had its Attack reduced by a burn, Clefable will almost always be taking hits from +0 even against foes at -1 or -2, whereas other Follow Me users take reduced hits from the foes in the same situation. When considering Follow Me users, teams that are in need of a way to stop Pokemon that prefer to set up and sweep should strongly consider Clefable; however, teams that are not in need of that particular niche should instead consider Togekiss and Clefairy as Fairy-type Follow Me users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moonlight is an option that allows Clefable to recover HP and continue to redirect hits. Encore can be used to lock threats into unfavorable moves, such as locking Dragon-types into Draco Meteor or Trick Room users into Trick Room. Clefable can use Ice Beam and 92 Special Attack EVs to always OHKO standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which does not particularly mind Clefable's redirection; however, this requires giving up Moonblast or Protect. Icy Wind is an alternative form of speed control and has the benefit of not being blocked by Taunt; however, it leaves Clefable even more vulnerable to Bisharp, and Clefable's poor Speed means that it still cannot outrun most relevant threats. Rocky Helmet allows Clefable to land chip damage against physical attackers with Follow Me, though losing the recovery of Sitrus Berry significantly reduces Clefable's overall longevity. Magic Guard can be used to redirect burns away from physical attackers without taking any residual damage and, unlike Unaware, is compatible with Soft-Boiled. Safeguard is an option to block status conditions for the whole team, but Clefable is slower than most common status spreaders aside from Amoonguss. Moves such as Aromatherapy, Heal Pulse, and Healing Wish allow Clefable to fulfill a somewhat clerical role. Healing Wish in particular allows Clefable to completely revive a weakened teammate once Clefable has fulfilled its usefulness in a battle.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and Heatran can easily switch into Clefable and either deal severe damage to it or take advantage of it by setting up. Bisharp does not switch in well but does significant damage to Clefable with Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Without Thunder Wave, Clefable cannot hinder Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, which can do significant damage to it.

Moonblast is used as the primary attacking option and allows Clefable to KO Dragon-types such as Hydreigon as opposed to just redirecting their attacks. Helping Hand is used to allow Clefable's partners to attain KOs that would normally be out of reach, though Thunder Wave is also an option as a means of providing speed control, crippling opposing sweepers that like to rely on their Speed advantage. Protect is used to stall out field effects, to scout for moves, and to allow Clefable's partner to take out a foe that threatens Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Special Defense EVs let Clefable always survive a sun-boosted Overheat from Timid Mega Charizard Y with the remaining EVs put into Defense in order to survive attacks such as Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double Edge or an Iron Head from Focus Sash Bisharp. Unaware is used to ignore the stat boosts of opposing setup Pokemon, and a Sitrus Berry is used to increase Clefable's overall longevity. Safety Goggles may be used in place of a Sitrus Berry to allow Clefable to redirect Sleep-inducing moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Clefable, Follow Me is used primarily to prevent Clefable's partner from taking hits that would otherwise severely damage or KO it and to let it safely KO an opposing Pokemon or set up; however, Follow Me does not prevent the partner from taking damage from spread moves, such as Heat Wave and Earthquake. Helping Hand should be used cautiously, especially if the opposing Pokemon is able to use a guaranteed Protect, so as not to give your opponent a free turn. Helping Hand is best used as a means of picking up a surprise KO against foes that would otherwise survive an attack. Moonblast can be used both as a means of picking up KOs on certain threats and as a way of getting in chip damage to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range of Clefable's partner. It can also be used in situations where Follow Me and Helping Hand either are unhelpful or cannot be used but switching to a different Pokemon is too risky. Clefable can also be used as an emergency check to boosted Pokemon such as a +2 Mega Kangaskhan or a +6 Azumarill, especially if it has a partner that threatens them, as the combination of Follow Me and Unaware negates the stat boosts and prevents the opposing Pokemon from using a priority attacks to take out Clefable's partner. One thing to be aware of is that Unaware Clefable also ignores stat drops, such as ones caused by Intimidate, on the opposing Pokemon, so do not expect Clefable to take hits more easily with a partner's Intimidate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill like having Clefable as a partner, as it allows them to safely set up and also prevents opposing setup sweepers from threatening them. Kyurem-B also makes for a good partner, as Clefable can effortlessly redirect opposing Fighting- and Dragon-type moves to let Kyurem-B safely set up a Substitute, while Kyurem-B can beat threatening Steel-types with Earth Power, as well as Poison-types such as Venusaur and Amoonguss with Ice Beam. Hydreigon also appreciates how easily Clefable redirects Fighting- and Dragon-type moves, allowing it to attack the opposing team without much worry. Pokemon that are capable of beating Steel-types are especially welcome partners for Clefable, so Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Heatran all pair well with it. Mega Diancie is another good partner, as it's a frail Pokemon that enjoys redirection and can easily beat common Taunt users such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Terrakion.</p>"

Boasting a Normal typing and attacks strong enough to 2HKO majority of the metagame, Mega Kangaskhan is a dangerous threat to face, as there are few switch-ins to its attacks. Mega Kangaskhan's dominating power is partly thanks to its ability, Parental Bond, which effectively gives Mega Kangaskhan's attacks a 50% power boost and lets it hit twice, breaking and hitting through through Focus Sash and Substitute. Sporting access to a setup move in the form of Power-Up Punch, which, thanks to Parental Bond, is effectively a Swords Dance that deals damage, Mega Kangaskhan is a very dangerous threat, as it can also boost its already high power to astronomical levels; the ability to function both as a dangerous setup sweeper and as a powerful wallbreaker from the get-go defines Mega Kangaskhan's effectiveness and role. Mega Kangaskhan also has access to Fake Out and Sucker Punch; the former lets it buy a turn for a partner or get momentum while also hitting for decent damage, and the latter lets it circumvent its middling Speed and hit faster threats with priority.

Fake Out lets Mega Kangaskhan snag momentum, letting a partner set up for free or deal with foes without much pressure; it also deals decent damage and is useful for stopping a foe from setting up field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Alternatively, Protect can be used to shield Mega Kangaskhan from attacks in order to buy time to position itself in order to keep its boosts; Protect also lets Mega Kangaskhan stall out field conditions and defend itself while a partner deals with an opposing threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Scrappy allows Mega Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, letting it use Fake Out on and stop setup from the likes of Jellicent and Chandelure. Inner Focus is an option in order to prevent flinches, letting Kangaskhan surprise opponents and delay foes for a turn without regard for opposing Fake Out users. The EV investment maximizes Mega Kangaskhan's offensive potential, and an Adamant nature boosts its power to higher levels. Alternatively, a Jolly nature can be used in order to outrun other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and Speed tie with positive-natured ones, though Mega Kangaskhan will be slightly weaker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should apply as much pressure to the opponent's team as it can with its raw damage output and ability to set up with Power-Up Punch. Leading with Mega Kangaskhan can be a good idea in order to grab momentum quickly by using Fake Out while Mega Evolving, providing it with some firepower while simultaneously giving it a free turn to set up and get into a favorable position early. On a similar note, using Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out to get into a good position mid- or late-game can be a good play. Be careful, though, as while Fake Out always seems like the play to make when Mega Kangaskhan first enters the field at any given time, this is not the case; it really depends on in-battle circumstances, and there are times when Return or Power-Up Punch is the better move. Mega Kangaskhan can also utilize Scrappy before Mega Evolving to make Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent flinch, stopping them from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should only use Power-Up Punch when there's a good opportunity to do so, such as when it's paired with a redirection user or the opponent's active Pokemon aren't threatening; a boosted Mega Kangaskhan applies tremendous pressure, as it can easily blow holes in opposing teams with its extremely powerful attacks. Don't use Power-Up Punch too soon, though, as setting up too early, such as when the opponent still has a healthy counter to Mega Kangaskhan in the back, means that Mega Kangaskhan will just waste a turn using a weak attack when it's forced out in the next few turns. Mega Kangaskhan should use Sucker Punch when it's threatened by a faster foe in order to get the first hit and possibly avoid unnecessary damage; this is especially true when it has Attack boosts, in which case Sucker Punch becomes particularly powerful.</p> <p>Some speed control support such as Tailwind and Thunder Wave works wonders for Mega Kangaskhan, as this lets it outspeed, attack, and KO foes it can't safely beat otherwise, such as Keldeo and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. It's also a good idea to pair Mega Kangaskhan with a redirection user, such as Amoonguss or Togekiss, in order to get safe turns to set up with Power-Up Punch or attack. It's a good idea to take out foes with Intimidate in order to make Mega Kangaskhan's job easier, as these Pokemon can easily come in and soften Mega Kangaskhan's blows to manageable levels. Don't let Mega Kangaskhan get burned, as this greatly will weaken its power, though Power-Up Punch can remedy this somewhat and a burned Mega Kangaskhan can still be useful if it can use Fake Out again to gain momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Being an offensive Pokemon, Mega Kangaskhan appreciates teammates that can remove or match up well against its own checks and counters. Pokemon that can take on Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar serve well; Hydreigon can take out both with its Dark Pulse, and Talonflame can hit both hard with its high-powered STAB moves. Both Hydreigon and Talonflame also fare well against opposing Steel-types, except Heatran in Talonflame's case. Teammates that can beat Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion make for good picks; Latios can outspeed and KO them with its Psyshock, and Aegislash can easily take any of their moves and strike back with its STAB moves. Pokemon that match up well against Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie are also good; bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can strike back with a STAB move, your own Landorus-T can weaken their blows with Intimidate and KO the latter with Earthquake, and Deoxys-A outspeeds and KOes both of them with Psycho Boost.</p> <p>Teammates that can provide speed control support are handy to have, as they can help Mega Kangaskhan get KOs safely by letting it outspeed a wider range of foes. Tailwind from the likes of Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss can be helpful, with the latter also having access to Follow Me and Encore, the latter of which can lock defending foes into Protect. Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Thundurus is also useful, and Cresselia can set up Trick Room in semi-Trick Room builds. It's important to note that Mega Kangaskhan can help these supporters by nabbing opportunities with Fake Out. Redirection helps Mega Kangaskhan greatly by giving it safe opportunities to set up with Power-Up Punch; Amoonguss can redirect moves with Rage Powder and put foes to sleep with Spore, and Togekiss has Follow Me and boasts additional support in Tailwind. Partners that can take advantage of the free turns Mega Kangaskhan can provide also work well; Substitute users such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Aegislash, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Deoxys-A all appreciate the opportunities to set up (or in Deoxys-A's case, attack) brought by Fake Out. Having Bisharp as a partner also works well because, in addition to being able to take out problematic Ghost-types, it takes advantage of any incoming Intimidate users thanks to Defiant.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge lets Mega Kangaskhan KO or at least deal significant damage to foes, though it comes at the cost of recoil. Return is a usable alternative if Double-Edge's recoil is unappealing, though it's weaker and contrasts with the set's goal, which is to land swift KOs. Low Kick hits opposing Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Steel-types such as Bisharp and Heatran for heavy damage. Seismic Toss can also be used, always dealing 200 HP damage thanks to Parental Bond, which is enough to 2HKO a good portion of the metagame, and lets Mega Kangaskhan deal consistent damage regardless of type matchups and opposing Attack control in burns and Intimidate. Sucker Punch lets Mega Kangaskhan circumvent its middling Speed; it also hits Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar, albeit unreliably. Fake Out lets Mega Kangaskhan grab momentum and lets a partner freely set up or take out foes without much trouble; it also hits for decent damage and is useful for stopping a foe from setting up field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Scrappy lets Mega Kangaskhan hit Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, allowing it to use Fake Out on and stop setup from the likes of Jellicent and Chandelure. Inner Focus can be used in order to prevent flinches, letting Mega Kangaskhan surprise and delay foes for a turn without the need to consider opposing Fake Out. Full Attack and Speed EV investment puts Mega Kangaskhan's offensive capabilities to the highest level, and an Adamant nature lets it attain swift OHKOs, such as with Low Kick on opposing Mega Kangaskhan. A Jolly nature can also be run in order to outrun other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and tie with positive-natured ones, though Mega Kangaskhan will hit for noticeably less damage as a result. An alternate EV spread of 144 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 108 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used for considerably more bulk and the same high attacking power while still outrunning most of the same threats that the main spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to, getting the jump on the base 70+ Speed range.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan's goal is, essentially, to wreak as much havoc to the opposing team as possible with its very powerful attacks, allowing teammates to clean up later. Leading with Mega Kangaskhan can be a good idea to punch holes early, with the option to use Fake Out to Mega Evolve and wrest for momentum on the first turn. On a related note, Fake Out can also be useful to attempt to grab momentum mid- or late-game. Watch out, though, as while using Fake Out whenever possible may be tempting, there are times when simply using an attack such as Double-Edge or Low Kick is the better play overall. Mega Kangaskhan can also take advantage of Scrappy by not Mega Evolving immediately, using Fake Out against Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent to stop them from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan should run-and-gun to do as much damage as it can, taking out or at least weakening the checks and counters of its teammates in order to create a win condition with one of them later on; for example, using Mega Kangaskhan's Low Kick to take out Heatran can let your Talonflame be free to pick off foes later on. As Low Kick is generally less seen on Mega Kangaskhan compared to Power-Up Punch, it can be useful for catching opponents off guard and landing a surprise KO. When running Seismic Toss, Mega Kangaskhan can deal consistent damage regardless of the foe's typing or any factors to its Attack, letting it face off against any threat and still deal solid damage with ease. Against a faster foe, use Sucker Punch in order to put some damage in and move first, possibly saving Mega Kangaskhan from unnecessary damage if it attains the KO.</p> <p>Using speed control support such as Tailwind and Thunder Wave can greatly help with Mega Kangaskhan's job, letting it beat down and KO faster threats such as Keldeo and Choice Scarf Landorus-T safely. Take out foes with Intimidate as soon as possible in order to help Mega Kangaskhan perform its job more smoothly, as those Pokemon can easily come in and weaken Mega Kangaskhan's blows. In addition, don't let Mega Kangaskhan get burned, as this will significantly weaken its attacks, turning it into a non-threat for foes to take advantage of; however, a burned Mega Kangaskhan can still be useful if it can use Fake Out again for momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Mega Kangaskhan is an attacker, it appreciates teammates that can deal with its checks and counters. Teammates that can beat Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar are good picks; both Hydreigon and Talonflame can OHKO them with their own STAB moves while also being able to fare well against Steel-types, except for Heatran in Talonflame's case. Pokemon that can take out Fighting-type foes such as Keldeo and Terrakion also serve well as teammates; Latios can KO them with Psyshock, and Aegislash can take their attacks and hit back with its STAB moves. Teammates that match up well against Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie also work; bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune can take them out with their STAB moves, your own Landorus-T can weaken their blows with Intimidate, and Deoxys-A can outspeed and KO them with Psycho Boost.</p> <p>Teammates that can provide speed control support are great to have, as they can help Mega Kangaskhan outspeed and safely KO a wider range of threats. Tailwind setters such as Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss are good options, with the latter also boasting great support moves in Follow Me and Encore, the latter of which can lock foes into Protect. Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Thundurus is also useful, and Cresselia can set up Trick Room for semi-Trick Room builds. Teammates that can clean up foes after Mega Kangaskhan has weakened them work well; spread move users such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Terrakion are good choices, and Talonflame can pick off weakened foes with its Gale Wings Brave Bird. Mega Kangaskhan can be a good teammate for Pokemon that want certain threats removed or weakened; for example, Pokemon that dislike the presence of opposing Heatran, Mega Kangaskhan, and Kyurem-B appreciate Mega Kangaskhan's ability to KO them with Low Kick. Partners that can make use of the free turns Mega Kangaskhan can create with Fake Out also work well; Substitute users such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Aegislash, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Deoxys-A all appreciate the opportunities to set up (or in Deoxys-A's case, attack) brought by Fake Out. Bisharp can be a good partner, as, in addition to being able to take out Ghost-types, it can take advantage of opposing Intimidate users with Defiant.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Zapdos has a great defensive typing and solid bulk that make it one of the premier setters of Tailwind in the tier. A base 125 Special Attack stat allows it to never be too passive on the field after setting Tailwind; in addition, it has access to Roost to keep itself healthy. However, Zapdos faces heavy competition from Thundurus, a support Electric-type with Prankster and access to Taunt, though Zapdos has more bulk and Tailwind to differentiate itself. Although Zapdos has few weaknesses, it is checked offensively by common threats such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B and walled by Pokemon that resist Electric and don't take much from its coverage moves such as Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Yache Berry is an option to take an Ice-type attack such as Kyurem-B's Ice Beam better, allowing Zapdos to set Tailwind in a pinch. Similarly, Charti Berry allows Zapdos to take a Rock-type attack more comfortably, but it suffers from being activated on a weaker hit such as Rock Slide. Light Screen improves Zapdos's team's Special Defense but leaves Zapdos either much more passive without an extra coverage move or with reduced longevity if Roost is dropped. Thunder Wave is an alternative option for speed control, but Thundurus is typically the better option if Tailwind is not used. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to switch out after setting up Tailwind and can be used to bring in a heavy-hitting teammate with more safety. Roar stops Trick Room and setup sweepers from running wild.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-types with powerful STAB attacks such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion deal massive damage to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types that aren't 4x weak to Hidden Power Ice such as Hydreigon and Latios beat Zapdos with their powerful attacks, though Zapdos can Roost on them if they are at -2 Special Attack due to Draco Meteor. Kyurem-B is Zapdos's best counter, as it switches into all of Zapdos's attacks taking little to no damage, sets up free Substitutes on it, and does a ton with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types that aren't weak to Hidden Power Ice or take little damage from it regardless, such as Mega Swampert, easily take on Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Lightining Rod: Lightning Rod Pokemon such as Rhydon redirect Zapdos's Thunderbolts and nullify most of its offensive potential.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye prevent Zapdos from setting up Tailwind, which is its main job.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types for super effective damage and chips away at neutral foes due to Zapdos's respectable Special Attack stat. Tailwind allows Zapdos to support its team, doubling their Speed for three turns. This swings momentum in your team's favor, allowing Pokemon with middling to fast Speed to wreak havoc on the opposing side. Hidden Power Ice hits Landorus-T and Dragon-types such as Salamence, Latios, and Hydreigon for more damage than Thunderbolt. Roost provides recovery, and the extra longevity enables Zapdos to set up Tailwind multiple times in the match and check threats more reliably. Roost also removes Zapdos's Flying typing, allowing it to stay in on Rock- and Ice-types that it outspeeds. Heat Wave may be used over Hidden Power Ice, as it  dents Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and provides spread damage; however, the move is somewhat weak, as it fails to break Kyurem-B's Substitute. As such, it is recommended that the move is only used on sun teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan when they hit Zapdos, which allows Zapdos to rack up consistent residual damage on these Pokemon as it recovers with Roost. Sitrus Berry is a staple item in Doubles for bulkier Pokemon, providing a burst of recovery and increasing Zapdos's lifespan. Safety Goggles can also be used to ignore Spore and Rage Powder from Pokemon like Breloom and Amoonguss, making Zapdos an effective switch-in to both. The EV spread allows Zapdos to take two Rock Slides from Adamant Landorus-T after spread reduction and two Ice Beams from Modest Ludicolo. The Speed investment allows Zapdos to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Bisharp. The rest of the EVs are pumped into Special Attack along with a Modest nature in order to increase Zapdos's offensive presence. If Keldeo or Landorus-T are especially threatening, 96 EVs may be moved from Special Defense to Special Attack to OHKO them with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Static lets Zapdos deter attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan from attacking it by threatening to paralyze them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zapdos's bulk allows it to be easily switched in during the middle of the game to swing the momentum in your favor. Zapdos is also an effective lead against Mega Kangaskhan, threatening Rocky Helmet recoil damage and paralysis through Static if Mega Kangaskhan uses Fake Out on it. Use Roost liberally against Pokemon that Zapdos either threatens out or that can't harm it if you are predicting Protect or a switch out in order to keep Zapdos healthy. Zapdos gives a solid defensive backbone to a team with its excellent bulk and recovery, so utilize that by switching it into common threats such as Talonflame and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Virizion. Tailwind is far from the only option on the first turn; attack if it makes more sense to do so.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y aids Zapdos with sun for its Heat Wave, allowing it to break Kyurem-B's Substitute, and it appreciates the Tailwind Zapdos provides. Zapdos also beats one of the most common checks to sun teams in Talonflame. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape and redirection users such as Jirachi help Zapdos set up Tailwind more easily. Steel-types like Aegislash and Mega Metagross take on Dragon-types and Mega Diancie, two of Zapdos's more difficult matchups. Hard hitters that appreciate Tailwind such as Hoopa-U, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Kangaskhan are able to devastate the opponent's team with their Speed stat doubled. Fighting-types such as Keldeo are able to deal with Ice- and Rock-types such as Kyurem-B and Terrakion that threaten Zapdos with their STAB attacks. Breloom is one of Zapdos's best partners, working extremely well under Tailwind with its ability to incapacitate opposing Pokemon with fast Spores.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Boasting base 100 stats across the board, Mew stands in the metagame as a fast, bulky, and niche supporter. Mew's claim to fame is its ability to Transform into any Pokemon on the field, particularly boosted teammates such as +6 Belly Drum Azumarill; Transform allows Mew to apply intense pressure on the opposing team by being able to turn into another boosted threat on top of its already-boosted partner. Mew also has access to nifty support moves, such as Tailwind and Will-O-Wisp, letting it back up its team outside of using Transform.</p> <p>Outside of Transform and its ability to support its team, Mew is a horribly niche pick; it should only be used as a glue and role compressor for filling several niches as a last resort due to being mediocre overall. Mew usually lacks an offensive move besides Fake Out, leaving it extremely vulnerable to Taunt and forcing it to rely on acquiring attack moves via Transform to deal damage. Mew can be a momentum killer on the field due to its difficulties with strong, fast Pokemon, as they are able to heavily damage it with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can be useful to quickly weaken opposing Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and guarantee some KOs. Super Fang provides Mew with a semi-reliable attacking option, letting it deal chip damage to foes. Ice Beam can be used to swiftly KO Landorus-T, a major threat to physical attackers. Thunder Wave lowers the Speed of foes, letting Mew's teammates outspeed them easily. Trick Room reverses the turn order, giving the Speed advantage to slower Pokemon and letting them move first more often; however, note that priority moves will still move first under Trick Room. Ally Switch is a nifty positioning tool that can let Mew take attacks aimed at its partner by swapping places on the field. Helping Hand lets Mew boost the damage output of its partner, which can be useful to guarantee a KO on a foe. Safeguard can be handy for preventing status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Spore, from hindering Mew's teammates. Safety Goggles can be useful to ignore Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, but Mew will miss the recovery from Leftovers or Sitrus Berry.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Bisharp, can take out Mew with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types, such as Aegislash and Gengar, can easily take out Mew with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: As Mew rarely runs other attacking moves, powerful attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Metagross can easily wear Mew down while fearing nothing back, save for Will-O-Wisp in the case of physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Taunt from common users such as Thundurus and Gyarados can completely shut down Mew, as its primary moveset consists of purely support moves sans Fake Out, which only works on the first turn Mew is on the field.

Transform lets Mew turn into any Pokemon on the field, letting it have presence outside of being a mere supporter; it can also copy stat changes, allowing Mew to stack pressure on the opposing team by using Transform on a boosted partner, such as +6 Azumarill or +2 Mega Kangaskhan. Will-O-Wisp lets Mew cripple opposing physical attackers, lowering their damage output to give teammates opportunities to set up as well as dealing chip damage. Tailwind provides Mew and its team with the Speed advantage, letting them outrun and possibly KO foes they couldn't otherwise. Protect lets Mew stall out field conditions, scout attacks, and shield itself from damage while a partner takes out a particular threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Both of Mew's items aim to prolong its longevity by providing it with recovery; Sitrus Berry is preferred, as the instant recovery is better in the fast-paced DOU metagame, but Leftovers can also be useful by providing continuous incremental recovery. The Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets Mew outrun as many foes as it can without lowering the negligible damage output of Fake Out. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP to maximize its bulk—HP EVs are also the only EVs that carry over after using Transform. 30 Attack and Defense IVs can be used in order to get Hidden Power Ice when using Transform on a Pokemon that runs it, such as Thundurus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew's biggest concern once it's on the field is supporting its teammates. Fake Out lets Mew delay foes, hindering their plans as well as giving its teammates opportunities to set up. When Mew's teammates lack the Speed advantage, Mew can use Tailwind to give it to them. Similarly, Mew can use Will-O-Wisp to lower the offensive presence of opposing physical attackers, letting its teammates set up more easily. Once a partner has already set up, for example a +6 Azumarill after setting up with Belly Drum, Mew can Transform into it, giving its side two boosted threats that apply intense pressure to their foes. As Transform goes through Protect, a partner can shield itself from any harm with Protect while Mew uses Transform in order to avoid any unnecessary damage. Mew can also Transform into a foe, letting it take advantage of any utilities they might have such as Intimidate, redirection, and Helping Hand; Mew can also take advantage of matchups this way. Transforming into Amoonguss can also prove to be beneficial in order to provide redirection support while also getting recovery from Regenerator.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the support that Mew brings to help them set up make for good partners. Teammates that can set up are highly recommended, as Mew can Transform into them and give its side two boosted threats; both Azumarill and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate the support that Mew brings and can set up with Belly Drum and Power-Up Punch, respectively. Mega Diancie beats Thundurus, which could otherwise Taunt Mew and render it useless; its ability to send back Taunt with Magic Bounce is also a huge boon. Teammates that can take out opposing Dark-types and Aegislash make for good teammates; Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, and Sylveon can take out opposing Dark-types with ease, and Dark- and Fire-types such as Hydreigon and Heatran, as well as Landorus-T, make short work of Aegislash. Redirectors, such as Togekiss, Amoonguss, and Jirachi, can be useful to redirect attacks for Mew once it's already Transformed into a boosted setup sweeper; Amoonguss is especially notable for also being able to provide recovery by letting Mew Transform into it and take advantage of Regenerator.</p>"

It works well as a bulky Water-type for teams that also appreciate offensive presence, something that other bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W lack. In spite of these good traits, Azumarill does possess low Speed, and it is threatened by common Grass- and Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Breloom.

Knock Off allows Azumarill to get around a few would-be checks like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, as well as dealing solid damage to highly popular threats Aegislash and Volcanion. Play Rough is Azumarill's best Fairy-type STAB move and allows it to deal respectable damage in the case that it is unable to set up a Belly Drum.

It should only use Belly Drum if Electric-, Steel-, and Grass-type checks have been removed, when there is a teammate with Fake Out or redirection moves on the field, when foes can't threaten or KO it with 75% of its health remaining, or if a double-protect is predicted. Once its checks are removed, Azumarill can go on a rampage and wipe out entire teams with Aqua Jet and Play Rough. After setting up a Belly Drum, Azumarill becomes one of the opponent's primary targets, which you can often take advantage of. By having Azumarill use Protect to soak up hits and switching its partner out to a Pokemon with redirection moves or Fake Out on the same turn, Azumarill is able to better threaten the opposing team on the following turn. Lastly, Azumarill can beat common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty, but it doesn't appreciate the Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support can give Azumarill a free turn to set up Belly Drum. Some common Fake Out users include Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty. Pokemon that can hit Electric-, Grass-, and Steel-types super effectively such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B are good partners that can cover up Azumarill's weaknesses. Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B are particularly good partners for checking common Electric / Flying type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Thundurus. Heatran and Talonflame are good partners for checking Ferrothorn, which completely counters Azumarill. Heatran can also absorb Will-O-Wisps for Azumarill, allowing it to avoid possible burns. Azumarill can also function on a Trick Room team, where it can work with setters such as Cresselia. Mew can provide Fake Out support to help set up Belly Drum, then it can transform into Azumarill, copying its stats and pressuring the opponent by forcing them to face two +6 Azumarills. Azumarill also enjoys Pokemon with status moves, as paralysis and sleep can help Azumarill set up and sweep. Follow Me or Rage Powder support is also crucial when using Belly Drum, as these moves redirect redirects attacks and give Azumarill time to set up. Jirachi is the primary teammate chosen for Azumarill due to their solid type synergy and Jirachi's ability to redirect Grass-type moves, a weakness of Rage Powder users. Amoonguss is another possible such partner, as it has great synergy with Azumarill, as it can spread status and resists both Electric- and Grass-type moves.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed's resistance to Fire and ability to induce rain allow it to switch into Heat Wave from Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, which is basically the only edge that rain has over sand and sun: the typing advantage. Politoed is mostly viable as a bulky rain setter, as its 90 / 75 / 100 bulk allows it to survive many hits, and rain's power boost to Scald lets Politoed fully invest EVs into its defenses without losing out on too much power. Outside of being bulky and having Drizzle, it usually fits no other role than supporting. A big downside to Politoed is the fact that it is dead weight in a lot of matchups. Rain teams are always hyper offense, and Politoed does not fit the mold of a hyper offense Pokemon. Even though it is a viable support Pokemon with Helping Hand and Encore, it doesn't offer offensive pressure like Ludicolo and Mega Swampert do. Rain struggles to match the power of many other weather archetypes, which have an easier time maintaining momentum because of the offensive pressure that Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar can impose on the field. Politoed itself, however, struggles to match the utility or power of other Water-types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, respectively. Additionally, Politoed gets beaten by the numerous Electric- and Grass-types in the metagame such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn, and Water- and Grass-types can take advantage of Politoed as well because it cannot threaten them. However, although Water-, Electric-, and Grass-types beat it, they absolutely hate switching into Politoed because rain-boosted Scald is a decently powerful move with a high burn chance. This is especially annoying for Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn because being burned means they will not be able to keep their utility during the game, as well as Ferrothorn losing out on damage.</p> <p>While Politoed is a decent support Pokemon, it can also run a Choice Specs set that can deal tons of damage, even though you'll trade all its utility away for it. Choice Specs Politoed essentially converts Politoed into both a weather setter and a respectable attacker. Because rain often makes Politoed's partner very threatening, having a slower but still hard-hitting Politoed creates a two-on-two situation rather than allowing your opponent to essentially ignore Politoed. That said, Choice Specs Politoed has its strengths but also its weaknesses, such as being unable to switch moves, lacking Speed, and having less bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Perish Song can be used to force notable threats out, especially bulky threats such as Cresselia and Substitute Kyurem-B. A Choice Specs set with Hydro Pump / Scald / Ice Beam / Focus Blast or Psychic can be used to make up for Politoed's somewhat low offenses, but this makes Politoed a far less reliable setter of rain and only really works on Trick Room teams. Choice Scarf can also be used; although it requires full Speed and Special Attack investment, but you will be able to catch opponents off guard. Note that this set is better suited for teams that aren't reliant on rain and is usually less effective than Politoed's other sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Because sun halves the Base Power of Water-type attacks, opposing Mega Charizard Y and other Fire-type Pokemon don't mind Scald when sun is up. The pair of Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur is able to use strong Grass-type moves on Politoed, and Politoed does hardly any damage in return while sun is up. Hail can also be fairly annoying because Mega Abomasnow resists Politoed's attacks and can do a ton of damage with its Grass-type moves in return.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thundurus and Rotom-W have the ability to 2HKO Politoed with Thunderbolt, the latter also resisting both of Politoed's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Most Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can take any attack from Politoed and hit back hard with their STAB moves. Amoonguss doesn't care about Politoed, even if Politoed locks it into an unfavorable move with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Politoed has trouble with strong attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Hydreigon, all of which can take it out with their sheer power.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald provides Politoed with a reliable STAB attack that has a chance to cripple and burn threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross, which otherwise could be threatening for your team. Icy Wind is a spread move that drops the foes' Speed by one stage. It's mainly used to support the team, but it does a decent amount of damage to Landorus-T and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios. Helping Hand works well with offensive partners, especially Swift Swim sweepers, by boosting their damage output and letting them get key KOs. Encore is an alternative too, allowing Politoed to lock foes into non-threatening moves such as Protect, Substitute, and Fake Out. Protect lets Politoed scout, stall out field conditions, rack up chip and burn damage, and avoid taking an otherwise deadly attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A standard 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD EV spread with a Bold nature allows Politoed to tank as many physical hits as possible and significantly boosts its overall bulk. Sitrus Berry allows Politoed to survive for longer, while Damp Rock allows Politoed to support its team even better by offering more turns of rain. Drizzle immediately sets up rain as Politoed switches in, which is the only reason to use Politoed. You can use 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature on Politoed so that it can lock Trick Room setters such as Cresselia into Trick Room with Encore.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Politoed can use Drizzle to cancel other weather conditions such as sun and sand. Politoed is especially a great switch-in to Mega Charizard Y, as it removes the sun from Drought and forces Mega Charizard Y to switch out with the threat of Scald. It will still have to be careful, though, because if Mega Charizard Y switches back in while Politoed is still on the field, your team is in trouble until rain is up again. It is important to note that to support its teammates as long as possible, Politoed has to stay alive for as long as possible to keep rain up. Use Encore to lock foes into support moves or other harmless moves. Use Helping Hand for a power boost only if necessary. If you use a Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move on your team, be careful with using Scald, as it might burn a foe that you would rather put to sleep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim sweepers such as Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Mega Swampert work well with Politoed, because their Speed stats get doubled by Drizzle. Even though Mega Charizard Y doesn't like to face Politoed, a fast and strong Electric-type such as Thundurus, Raikou, or Thundurus-T is often beneficial to get rid of it. Their offensive presence and perfectly accurate Thunder allow them to check other foes besides Mega Charizard Y, such as opposing Keldeo and Talonflame. The only downside to Electric-types is that they have a lot of trouble switching in directly. Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash resist Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks and benefit from the rain removing their weakness to Fire. Having a Steel-type on your team also helps to check Kyurem-B, which is often used for beating rain teams. However, Kyurem-B still hits really hard with Earth Power and Steel-types have trouble switching in directly. Intimidate support from the likes of Landorus-T can help Politoed survive longer. Teammates that can check opposing Electric- and Grass-types, such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon, also work really well because they can soak up attacks aimed at Politoed. Other strong Flying-types such as Talonflame and Togekiss are very useful for cleaning up bulkier Grass-type Pokemon. Fast Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Latios, and Garchomp to an extent are good picks to beat sun teams and opposing rain teams. Surprisingly, Fire-types such as Talonflame and Heatran are great on rain teams because they check Grass-types and are even stronger when rain faces sun. Fairies such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie are good picks because they can also beat Kyurem-B. Mega Diancie also beats Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y, both of which are big threats to rain too.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Scizor might seem like a potent threat; it has only one weakness, it's considerably strong when it sets up with Swords Dance, and it efficiently uses strong priority. Compelling as these reasons may be, Scizor is, simply put, a less-than-mediocre Pokemon in Doubles OU. Despite it having only one weakness, this same weakness leaves it immediately exploitable for any Fire-type or anything with Fire-type coverage, either of which is commonly found on most teams. Common Water-types also threaten it to a lesser extent by virtue of resisting Scizor's Bullet Punch and being able to do considerable damage or burn it with their own STAB moves. Scizor is also the bearer of lackluster STAB coverage and low Speed, forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch as its main STAB move. Due to this, it is usually outclassed by the likes of Mega Metagross and Aegislash as an offensive Steel-type and by Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Diancie as a Mega Evolution. However, Scizor can still be used, albeit with an ounce of viability. It can become a somewhat threatening setup sweeper with Swords Dance and its strong priority boosted by Technician. Furthermore, being primarily a priority attacker, it can avoid being beaten by opposing forms of speed control, and it still beats Mega Diancie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For an alternative to Knock Off, Bug Bite could be used for a somewhat strong secondary STAB move that also can nab a Sitrus Berry from an opposing Rotom-W if Scizor is running at least 92 Speed EVs. Aerial Ace could also be used for Keldeo and Amoonguss, as can Superpower for Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran. As Scizor has a decent support movepool, it could also run a support set with moves such as Feint, Tailwind, and Quick Guard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Talonflame, Heatran, Infernape, and Mega Charizard Y, or Pokemon that commonly carry Fire-type coverage, such as Hydreigon and Salamence, all immensely threaten Scizor by exploiting its prominent weakness to Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: An opposing Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Gengar and Rotom-W stops Scizor dead in its tracks, but Intimidate is not that much of a menace due to Swords Dance outweighing Intimidate's single drop in Attack.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: As Scizor primarily relies on Bullet Punch for attacking, Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Terrakion weaken Scizor's offensive presence and force it to use only Knock Off to attack.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is Scizor's main attacking move and boasts priority as well a boost from both Technician and STAB. Knock Off provides useful coverage for threats that Bullet Punch cannot hit, such as Aegislash and Jirachi, and is otherwise a useful neutral coverage attack. Swords Dance is the only reason to use Scizor; by boosting Scizor's Attack to threatening levels, it's the best way to prevent Scizor from being outclassed by the likes of Genesect and Mega Metagross. Protect allows Scizor to stall out a turn in order to allow time for an ally to get rid of an opposing threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As Scizor doesn't really rely on its Speed by virtue of being a priority-based attacker, maximum HP and Attack investment and an Adamant nature are recommended. Scizor can also use 252 HP / 80 Atk / 176 SpD with a Careful nature to avoid the 2HKO from offensive Thundurus, allowing for more setup opportunities, albeit at the cost of less immediate attacking power. Scizor's ability pre-Mega Evolution doesn't really matter, but Light Metal is used for the rare instance that Scizor switches in on a weight-dependent move such as Low Kick.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before setting up, it's usually a good idea to remove threats to Scizor, mainly Fire-types, in order to maximize its potential on the field. As it is most effective at threatening opposing teams when boosted by Swords Dance, time is money with Scizor, and it should begin to set up as soon as possible. Fortunately, Scizor has relatively good bulk and is able to set up in the face of many common threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B. Scizor can also be used as an effective late-game sweeper with its strong priority, as it is able to clean up a weakened team even through opposing speed control. It can also use its strong priority to effectively revenge kill faster foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>To be used viably, Scizor mandates teammates that counter opposing Fire-types. For example, Water-types such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Gyarados can all be paired with Scizor to discourage opposing Fire-types from switching in. Landorus-T and Terrakion can also heavily threaten opposing Fire-types with their Ground- or Rock-type coverage. By the same token, a check to opposing sun teams, such as your own Fire-type, is also useful. Fire-types also benefit from Scizor threatening Mega Diancie. Examples of good Fire-type partners include Talonflame, Heatran, and Rotom-H. Redirection is also a useful mode of support to use with Scizor so that it has the easiest time setting up. However, some of the most widely applicable redirectors, such as Jirachi and Amoonguss, stack a Fire-type weakness with Scizor. With that in mind, Scizor teams have limited viable redirection options, but some good ones include Togekiss and Clefairy. Wide Guard users such as Swampert and Conkeldurr also benefit Scizor by letting it avoid an opposing Heat Wave, the most common Fire-type attack, which would ignore redirection by virtue of being a spread move.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's incredible speed in the rain thanks to Swift Swim, unique typing, and access to the spread move Muddy Water make it a top choice for a rain team. It is an exceptional late-game sweeper when backed by the rain boost due to the STAB Water-type spread move combined with its quite decent Special Attack stat. Kingdra's unique typing also gives it many benefits; traditional Water-type checks such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon are blown back by its secondary STAB move, and defensively, the typing only leaves it with two weaknesses while giving it handy resistances to common attacking types like Water and Fire. However, Kingdra has very mediocre stats across the board, including both defenses. It is wide open to being sniped by priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch after only a bit of prior damage. It also faces competition from other common Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Mega Swampert; the former can break past bulky Water-types, the bane of Kingdra, and the latter is immune to Thunder Wave, which cripples Kingdra for the entirety of the match. Finally, Kingdra is nearly worthless without its preferred field conditions intact. If it is not raining or the opponent has the speed advantage from using Trick Room or Tailwind, Kingdra is completely ineffective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scald is a more reliable option to Hydro Pump with an additional chance to burn but lacks the immediate power that Kingdra desires. Similarly, Dragon Pulse is a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move but suffers the same drawback as Scald. Lum Berry is an option to prevent status, specifically paralysis from Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus. Disable disrupts the opponent's move choices and works quite well with Politoed's common support move of Encore, forcing the foe to Struggle, and Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag ability, disallowing the ability to switch. Ice Beam finishes off weakened Amoonguss without forcing Kingdra to incur Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop but suffers from having largely redundant coverage. Splash Plate increases the power of Kingdra's most spammable option while keeping it healthy and out of range of strong priority, though it gives Kingdra less power and does not boost Draco Meteor's damage output.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters:</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss switch into Water-type attacks with ease and are generally Kingdra's best counters, retaliating with Power Whip and Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Kingdra struggles to break through bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Assault Vest Ludicolo, which can proceed to threaten Kingdra or its partner in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill can switch into Draco Meteor thanks to their immunity and stomach a Water-type attack while retaliating with a STAB Fairy-type move.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: When the rain is not up, Kingdra struggles to do anything meaningful to the opposing team, as it loses out on the Swift Swim speed boost. Weather setters such as Mega Charizard Y and Abomasnow, while being directly threatened by Kingdra's strong attacks, are very annoying to deal with, as they get rid of Kingdra's most valuable asset.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: The most effective way of preventing a Kingdra from barreling through a team is a Prankster Thunder Wave from a Pokemon such as Thundurus. A paralyzed Kingdra is unable to do its job and can be easily KOed due to its mediocre defenses. Trick Room, coming from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, and Tailwind, used commonly by Suicune and Hydreigon, also mess with its Speed advantage and prevent it from cleaning up late-game.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Due to Kingdra's mediocre defenses, it is unable to clean up late-game when threatened by strong priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Rain Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Muddy Water functions as Kingdra's primary STAB move, dealing significant damage under the rain to neutral targets while also OHKOing many Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Terrakion. It also has a 30% chance to drop accuracy, which is useful for having a chance to avoid attacks from slower enemies. Draco Meteor is Kingdra's powerful secondary STAB attack that covers the Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon that resist Muddy Water. It also dents Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Volcanion that can take Water-type attacks with ease. Hydro Pump is a single-target move that nukes anything it hits, which is useful for finishing off Pokemon that are not in the range for Muddy Water. Because it is not a spread attack, it hits the foes through Wide Guard's protection, allowing Kingdra to hit the common users, Conkeldurr and Aegislash, for massive damage. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, giving Kingdra the ability to stall out field conditions like Trick Room and allowing its partner to improve Kingdra's position. Substitute is a potential option that makes Kingdra exponentially more difficult to deal with. This shields it from status and allows it to avoid getting hit by Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Bisharp and Mega Kangaskhan, as well as taking a strong hit for Kingdra.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>As an offensive powerhouse, Kingdra needs all the investment it can get into Special Attack, so it opts for as much power as possible as well as a Modest nature. Maximum Speed investment is used to tie with opposing Kingdra and outspeed positive-natured base 70s like Breloom when rain is not up or when the opposition is under Tailwind. Swift Swim gives Kingdra the speed necessary to function well. Life Orb allows Kingdra to hit harder while retaining the ability to switch up moves, which is valuable for a late-game cleaner that needs to position itself well on the field with Protect. 152 HP / 160 SpA / 60 SpD / 136 Spe is an option for a more bulky spread with Substitute. This EV spread lets Kingdra's Substitutes survive an Amoonguss Giga Drain while still outspeeding neutral-natured base 70s outside of rain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its insane power, spread, and lack of drawbacks, Muddy Water is the main attack Kingdra will be using unless it desperately needs to KO a certain Pokemon currently on the field. Be very wary of using Draco Meteor, as having to switch Kingdra out or leave in a crippled one can lead to a huge loss of momentum. Using Draco Meteor on a switch-in that resists it also gives up a ton of momentum. Note that -2 Kingdra is still a threat with its Water-type moves. Try to save Kingdra for the late-game, as it is very hard for a weakened team to be able to tank rain-boosted Muddy Waters, but make sure priority users such as Talonflame and Thundurus are out of the way first. Sacrificing Politoed after rain has run out in the late-game for a free switch in to Kingdra tends to be an effective maneuver, as it leaves Kingdra untouched with five or eight fresh turns of rain. If using Substitute, attempt to set up it on predicted Protects or Sucker Punches, which are especially easy to predict when the opponent is stalling out rain turns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is mandatory with Kingdra, as it provides rain with its ability. Its access to Helping Hand can help Kingdra sweep, and its own Water-type attacks can weaken Kingdra's checks for later. Mega Gengar traps problematic Grass-types with Shadow Tag to get rid of them and can help trap other weather setters like Mega Charizard Y and Abomasnow. Though a somewhat rare situation, it can also prevent the opponent from pivoting around to lure Kingdra into dropping its Special Attack with Draco Meteor. Teammates that take out threats to Kingdra such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are appreciated. Some examples include Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Kingdra requires teammates that can break down bulky Water-types like Suicune. Electric- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Mega Venusaur work quite well.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is a solid Trick Room supporter because its incredible bulk, lack of many weaknesses, and access to Recover make it very difficult to brute force down for the KO. It takes little damage from most attackers, avoiding 2HKOs from even the heaviest hitters in the metagame such as Mega Charizard Y, and it is able to Recover its HP against weaker attackers. Notably, Porygon2 is one of the rare Trick Room setters without a weakness to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, letting it set up Trick Room in the face of Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Aegislash, which otherwise trouble Trick Room setters.</p> <p>However, Porygon2 is reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, meaning it is weak to Knock Off and cannot use any other items such as Safety Goggles. As a result, Taunt and Spore completely nullify Porygon2's presence and deny its attempts at setting up Trick Room. Porygon2 also lacks relevant resistances and needs to stay at high HP to be effective, so it needs to use Recover more often than not. This, combined with its mediocre offenses, turns Porygon2 to a huge momentum sink and in turn opens up the opponent to simply ignore Porygon2 and set up or gang up on its partner.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave instead of Trick Room is another option for speed control. However, Porygon2 is generally outclassed by other Thunder Wave users, such as Thundurus and Ferrothorn. Magic Coat denies Taunt, while Protect takes advantage of double targeting, but losing coverage leaves Porygon2 even more of a sitting duck, while losing Recover makes Porygon2 too easy to take down with repeated attacks. Blizzard can be an option over Ice Beam with Mega Abomasnow as a teammate, but note that Porygon2 needs a Quiet nature with 16 Special Attack EVs to guarantee the OHKO on Landorus-T and Salamence. Hidden Power Ground hits most Steel-types hard and particularly punishes Heatran. Alternatively, Thunderbolt has good coverage alongside Ice Beam, notably hitting Keldeo and Azumarill. Finally, Tri Attack is Porygon2's best STAB move that hits most Pokemon equally hard. Unfortunately, this means that Porygon2 is hitting everything for equally little damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-type moves from the likes of Keldeo, Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Scrafty can threaten Porygon2 with massive damage, forcing it to switch out. Scrafty and Conkeldurr are notable for functioning well in the Trick Room that Porygon2 can set up, while Keldeo and Terrakion are commonly seen with Taunt, which stops it from using Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Bulky hard hitters that aren't weak to any of Porygon2's moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon, can mostly ignore Porygon2's damage. In particular, having Pokemon that can do more damage than Porygon2 can Recover off with a single attack, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Overheat Mega Charizard Y, is an efficient way of taking it down.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Common Taunt users such as Thundurus, Gengar, and Keldeo stop Porygon2 from using Trick Room and Recover altogether, leaving it with little to do.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Spore users such as Amoonguss and Breloom will put Porygon2 to sleep before it can set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Mega Kangaskhan, Scrafty, and Weavile are commonly seen with Fake Out, and they can delay Porygon2 from using Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Scrafty, Weavile, and Bisharp can Knock Off Porygon2's Eviolite and make it much easier to take down. Without its Eviolite, Porygon2 is easily taken down by most offensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage via Leech Seed from Ferrothorn, Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Gengar, or Scald burns from Suicune and Politoed can add up very quickly, forcing Porygon2 to waste more turns using Recover.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Bulky setup Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Calm Mind Cresselia, and Belly Drum Azumarill can ignore Porygon2 for the most part and start setting up.

Foul Play is another offensive option that punishes Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan and Aegislash and generally deals high damage to the likes of Hoopa-U and Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Porygon2's bulk, 160 Defense EVs allow it to survive Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat from full health, and 76 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature let Porygon2 survive a Heat Wave followed by Overheat from Mega Charizard Y with good probability. Finally, 20 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Landorus-T and Salamence with Ice Beam. Eviolite is necessary for the additional bulk. Download's Special Attack boost lets Porygon2 take out Substitutes from common users such as Kyurem-B and generally gives it more offensive presence. Trace can copy helpful abilities such as Intimidate and Magic Bounce, but it is equally likely to copy a useless ability.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Setting up Trick Room should be Porygon2's priority whenever it would be advantageous. Be wary of common checks to Trick Room such as Amoonguss and Thundurus: against obvious Spore or Taunt it is generally better to switch out or attack. Porygon2's biggest perk as a Trick Room supporter is that it can reliably set up Trick Room multiple times in a match. Therefore, it is important to use Recover liberally to get its HP back from setup turns so that it has a chance to come in at a later time. However, if it is still at high HP, it is a good idea to switch out to a more favorable attacker that better takes advantage of the Trick Room turns.</p> <p>Generally, Porygon2 is too weak to be used for attacking, so try to not waste turns by using attacking moves. Still, using super effective moves to pick off weakened foes is often worth it. Because only a few Pokemon can deal meaningful damage to Porygon2, it can function as a wincon in the late-game, and if you aim for it to do so, try to keep it as healthy as possible and avoid switching it into a position where it can be knocked out by hard hitters before getting to do anything. For instance, a combination of hard-hitting attacks or super effective moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Keldeo's Secret Sword, will take it out before it has a chance to do anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support from Scrafty and Mega Kangaskhan lets Porygon2 overcome opposing Taunt or Spore and gives it some freedom to set up. In addition, Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Scrafty soften up physical hits with Intimidate so that Porygon2 is even harder to take down. It is important to make sure your team has enough slow attackers to take advantage of Trick Room. For instance, Heatran, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Abomasnow are good attackers in Trick Room. They also handle Amoonguss and Thundurus, and the former two can take out problematic Steel-types. It is wise to cover Porygon2's weakness to Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion with Pokemon such as Sylveon and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Due to Porygon2's weakness to classic Trick Room solutions such as Taunt, sleep, and Fake Out, it is necessary to have a backup plan to tackle fast attackers without relying on Porygon2 setting up Trick Room. This is typically done by carrying a secondary Trick Room setter or by having your team be functional outside of it. As for secondary Trick Room setters, Pokemon such as Hoopa-U and Reuniclus provide some offensive presence as well as Trick Room support, while Jellicent or Cresselia provides another sturdy Trick Room supporter that beats opposing Fighting-types. Finally, Talonflame provides strong priority as a contingency plan outside of Trick Room, threatens Amoonguss, and beats Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Keldeo.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar looks like a great Pokemon at first glance. It's the only viable setter of sand, and it has an extensive movepool and considerably high attacking stats. However, Tyranitar is, simply put, a lackluster Pokemon in DOU; its bad typing leaves it susceptible to a vast majority of common threats, such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Amoonguss. Furthermore, as Rock-types, Mega Diancie and Terrakion are generally the better pick with their immediate high Speed and more powerful STAB moves. Tyranitar also faces competition as a Dark-type from the likes of Bisharp and Hydreigon, which aren't totally beaten by Landorus-T and are able to fit on a wider range of team styles. Tyranitar's main saving grace is its ability to set sand, which, despite being the main part of a generally inconsistent team style, can be used to support an adjacent Excadrill and break a foe's Focus Sash. Tyranitar can also become a threatening sweeper when Dragon Dance is used in tandem with its decent STAB coverage, but it is so slow that it can't even outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T, its most threatening and most common foe, after a boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar can utilize the elemental punches to eliminate some of its usual checks, such as Thunder Punch for Keldeo, but this would require removing one of Tyranitar's important STAB moves and is usually not very useful overall. Thunder Wave could be used for speed control, but Thundurus is a much better user of it. The Tyranitarite may be forgone in favor of a Mega that better fits the team; however, Tyranitar can only utilize a Dragon Dance set well when given the extra defenses of its Mega forme. Assault Vest could also be used to increase Tyranitar's already-boosted Special Defense. Tyranitar can run a specially oriented set with Rock Slide and Shuca Berry or Life Orb to surprise its usual checks, such as Landorus-T, with its extensive movepool and to mitigate its weakness to Intimidate while also posing a bigger threat to Aegislash with Dark Pulse rather than Crunch. Weakness Policy could be used when running Dragon Dance, as Tyranitar has many weaknesses and may survive some super effective attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Tyranitar's suboptimal typing leaves it with many exploitable flaws. Landorus-T is a prominent threat to Tyranitar, as the common Choice Scarf set outspeeds it even after a boost and proceeds to 2HKO it while ignoring an ally's redirection with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon prove to be threatening to Tyranitar with their Pixilate Hyper Voice. Hyper Voice, being a spread move, also cannot be avoided with an ally's redirection.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, resist both of Tyranitar's STAB types and OHKO it with their own STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types, such as Azumarill and Suicune, can tank Tyranitar's hits and do more damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Amoonguss can survive Tyranitar's attacks and OHKO it back or immobilize it with Spore, in Amoonguss's case.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Tyranitar's boosts are mitigated by opposing Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Scrafty. A Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W also halts Tyranitar's sweeping ability.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Even after obtaining a Dragon Dance boost, Tyranitar can still be outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Superpower Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf Genesect. Tyranitar needs to use Dragon Dance at least twice to outspeed these threats; otherwise, it is OHKOed or takes heavy damage from them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Dragon Dance Tyranitar relies on being fast to shoot off its powerful STAB moves before it gets smacked, so any of these forms of speed control hampers it significantly. Thundurus, Salamence, and Cresselia all commonly carry one of these forms of speed control.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard prevents Tyranitar from consistently spamming Rock Slide. Conkeldurr in particular can use Wide Guard to protect a teammate or OHKO Tyranitar with Mach Punch.</p>",

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is Mega Tyranitar's main attacking move. While relatively weak, it's recommended for its spread coverage and flinch chance, which works notably well after some Speed boosts from Dragon Dance. Crunch functions as Mega Tyranitar's secondary STAB move; it enables Mega Tyranitar to both target a single foe for more damage and threaten the Steel-types that resist Rock Slide, such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Dragon Dance enables Mega Tyranitar to set itself apart from other Rock- and Dark-types by boosting its Attack to impressively high levels, as well as giving it the Speed boost to outpace most Pokemon that would normally threaten it. Protect is a staple move used in doubles formats in order to stall out opposing field conditions such as Tailwind and to scout for enemy attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar needs to be Mega Evolved in order to use this set well, as the Mega forme has the bulk and offenses to utilize Dragon Dance to its fullest extent. Mega Tyranitar should be running Sand Stream in order to disrupt opposing weather conditions on the switch, break Focus Sashes, boost its Special Defense, and potentially support Excadrill. Although Mega Tyranitar cannot outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after just one boost, it can still run maximum Speed in order to outspeed other fast Pokemon when boosted, such as Mega Gengar, Darkrai, and Weavile, while still retaining a potent offensive presence. Adamant can be used over Jolly for more power while also still being able to outspeed base 110 Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In order to make the most use of Mega Tyranitar's bulk, it should start setting up instantly, when it is at a healthy range of HP. That being said, Mega Tyranitar is best used as a late-game sweeper, when its checks are removed and the rest of the opponent's team is weakened. Use Sand Stream to your advantage, as the ability to break an enemy's Focus Sash is incredibly useful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection support in order to help Mega Tyranitar grab boosts greatly benefits it. Specifically, redirection users that can both tank Fighting-type attacks and threaten Landorus-T pair the best with Mega Tyranitar. Therefore, Amoonguss, Togekiss, Jirachi, and Clefairy are all viable choices for this role. Excadrill is one of the most advantageous partners for Mega Tyranitar, as it's the only viable user of Sand Rush. Furthermore, its STAB coverage allows it to remove certain checks to Mega Tyranitar, namely Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie. However, Excadrill stacks weaknesses to Fighting- and Water-type attacks. Wide Guard users, mainly Aegislash and Conkeldurr, support Mega Tyranitar by providing an immunity to opposing Earthquake and Pixilate Hyper Voice. Checks to Landorus-T, such as Keldeo and Rotom-W, are also needed on the team in order to allow Mega Tyranitar to function well. Fighting-types pose a massive threat to Mega Tyranitar, so allies such as Latios and Talonflame are valuable to it. Bulky Grass-types and Spore users such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss also stand in Mega Tyranitar's way of sweeping, so checks to those such as Heatran, Infernape, Talonflame, and most Safety Goggles users support it well. Bulky Water-types threaten Mega Tyranitar's sweep as well, so Pokemon such as Thundurus, Amoonguss, and Rotom-W provide apt support to it.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>After a boost from Speed Boost, Blaziken boasts extremely impressive matchups against common Pokemon, being able to outspeed and OHKO around 2/3 of the top 20 Pokemon in the DOU metagame and deal massive damage to most others. However, Blaziken is awkward to use because its best STAB options, Overheat and Superpower, force it to switch, which meshes poorly with Speed Boost. It ends up being played as a hit-and-run attacker that has to stay on the field for a turn before it can hit, sacrificing momentum. In addition, it's nearly useless in the face of speed control. Blaziken also faces direct competition from Talonflame and Infernape, strong Fire-types that are able to attack immediately thanks to their high base Speeds. Additionally, Talonflame boasts extremely strong priority and Infernape has access to Fake Out and Close Combat. However, nothing else in DOU can match Blaziken's spectacular 1v1 matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Running Blazikenite to Mega Evolve is another option, but Life Orb with the same spread does more damage than the Mega variant. Only run Blazikenite if your team really doesn't need a Mega or if you have another spread in mind that would work better with Mega Blaziken than non-Mega. A physical set with Flare Blitz instead of Overheat may be somewhat viable, but it doesn't really fare well against Landorus-T or Aegislash when it uses King's Shield. Heat Wave is a useful spread attack, but it comes at the cost of doing a lot less damage. As Blaziken wants to keep all of its Speed boosts, you can also use Fire Blast over Overheat so you don't have to switch out after every Overheat or two, but Fire Blast's lower power misses out on several notable KOs, such as against Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types like to have their way with Blaziken. In particular, Politoed and rain teams in general are not so friendly to Blaziken. Keldeo can also take a Superpower from Blaziken and hit back hard with a Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Latios: Latios can take anything Blaziken can hit it with and OHKO back with a Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Anything that can take a hit from Blaziken threaten it greatly as they can easily hit back at its paper-thin defenses. In particular, Blaziken can't touch bulky threats such as Cresselia or Sylveon, both of which hit back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: While Blaziken most certainly does not mind Icy Wind, it becomes nothing short of dead weight when hit by Thunder Wave or under Trick Room. Opposing Tailwind also restricts it because Blaziken typically uses a single Speed boost to threaten foes that are naturally faster than it, which it can't do when the opposition is under Tailwind. However, Tailwind's duration is short enough that it can be played around, as Blaziken continues accumulating Speed boosts each turn.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: While few things will be outspeeding Blaziken in normal circumstances, it falls victim to a lot of common priority moves. Brave Bird from Talonflame instantly destroys Blaziken, while Azumarill's Aqua Jet does a hefty 71.5 - 84.1% to Blaziken. Furthermore, Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out takes out almost half of Blaziken's health while also causing it to flinch, leaving it vulnerable for the rest of the turn. Fake Out threatens Blaziken in general as well. Being left vulnerable for the rest of the turn is very detrimental to Blaziken because of how frail it is.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is Blaziken's best option for a Fire-type STAB move; it picks up many crucial OHKOs that Fire Blast does not and is not dampened by Intimidate or King's Shield like Flare Blitz. It's recommended that you use Superpower over Low Kick due to Low Kick's inconsistency as opposed to Superpower's reliable 120 Base Power. However, Low Kick is indeed a viable option because Superpower drops Blaziken's Attack as well as its Defense, sometimes forcing a switch on your part and removing Blaziken's Speed boosts.</p> <p>Stone Edge allows Blaziken to eliminate Flying-types that would otherwise threaten it greatly such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, provided that Blaziken has Quick Guard support. Alternatively, Blaziken can run Hidden Power Ice in order to OHKO Landorus-T without suffering the Special Attack drop from Overheat. The choice between these two coverage moves is mostly dependent on what kind of support the rest of your team needs more. If your team is rather weak to Landorus-T, then you should consider running Hidden Power Ice. If you're weak to Mega Charizard Y, then consider using Stone Edge instead. Protect is an absolute must for any Blaziken set. Being a Speed Boost Pokemon, using Protect on Blaziken allows it to get a free boost on its Speed stat while also being invulnerable for that turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb lets Blaziken do as much damage as possible. A Hasty nature is recommended so that Blaziken can take on special attacking Fire-types better, which are basically the only Pokemon it can switch in on. However, Naive Blaziken can tank an Azumarill Aqua Jet after two rounds of Life Orb recoil, while Hasty can only tank it after one. This matters because Blaziken OHKOes Azumarill's two most common partners, Jirachi and Amoonguss, with Overheat. 176 Special Attack EVs let Blaziken OHKO Aegislash in Shield Forme with Overheat as well. 252 Speed EVs are used to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one turn of Speed Boost, and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack to power up Blaziken's physical moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Blaziken starts off with a meager base 80 Speed, which doesn't outspeed most of the threats that it's supposed to be able to take care of, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross. The first turn out, you should use Protect if you need to outspeed a threat that's faster than Blaziken. Alternatively, try bringing in Blaziken when you're able to get a free KO in the first turn; by doing this, you aren't forced to Protect on your first turn out while you get the Speed boost up. That being said, it's not usually a good idea to switch in Blaziken in the place of an ally; instead, you might want to bring it in once an ally has fainted. Blaziken works best on offensive teams because of its good STAB coverage and its generally offensive attributes, so consider that when building around it. Although Blaziken has lots of good offensive attributes, you shouldn't try to use it as a sweeper because it doesn't have a lot of staying power. Instead, it works best when assisting its team by targeting and eliminating specific threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Quick Guard users such as Keldeo or Terrakion help Blaziken by blocking the priority moves that would otherwise be very harmful to it. Blaziken can't do much against Water-types, so offensive Grass- or Electric-types such as Serperior or Thundurus help it out a lot. Mega Diancie forms a great core with Blaziken and helps get rid of Pokemon that Blaziken normally has trouble with, such as Talonflame, Latios, Keldeo, and Rotom-H. In turn, Blaziken also eliminates some of Mega Diancie's checks, such as Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Landorus-T. However, this duo will need a lot of team support to get around Water-types. Bisharp, Mega Gengar, and Aegislash all help Blaziken by getting rid of Fairy-types and Cresselia. Taunt users such as Thundurus help Blaziken out by stopping the activation of Trick Room.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Swampert is a very niche rain attacker. It's the only viable physical Swift Swim attacker, as well as the only one that can reliably beat Thundurus, Sylveon, and, depending on its coverage, Ferrothorn. Its immunity to paralysis due to its Ground typing means its Speed cannot be crippled like the others'. Also, as a rain sweeper with good natural bulk, it is less weak to priority moves than other rain sweepers, notably Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. However, being a physical attacker, Swampert is hindered by Intimidate and burns, and it is extremely weak to Grass-types, more so than other rain staples. Unlike other Swift Swimmers, it needs to Mega Evolve before it gains Swift Swim, usually giving your opponent a free turn. Finally, its secondary STAB move Earthquake is significantly weaker due to its spread reduction, and it also hits Mega Swampert's partner.</p> <p>Aside from its Mega forme, Swampert is also able to find a small niche due to its access to Wide Guard and great anti-meta coverage that allows it to take advantage of the users of spread moves that are stopped by Wide Guard, including Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, Volcanion, and Heatran. Additionally, it matches up quite well against common threats such as Talonflame, Thundurus, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Its bulk is well complemented by a strong defensive typing, making up for Swampert's low Speed that forces it to move last or close to it most turns. Like its Mega counterpart, base Swampert suffers from a lot of competition in its role on teams, primarily from Gastrodon, which offers a reliable form of recovery and a better ability in Storm Drain. Aside from Gastrodon, other bulky Water-types like Suicune and Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Conkeldurr often fill Swampert's role on teams better than Swampert can. Although its coverage is nothing to be scoffed at, Swampert's Special Attack stat is far from impressive, leaving its attacks quite weak against resisted or neutral targets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Swampert can run various Speed EVs other than 252 to have some EVs left over for bulk, such as 176 Speed EVs to outspeed Deoxys-A and 144 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, both under rain. For Swampert's Water-type STAB move, Aqua Tail is slightly more powerful than Waterfall, but it lacks perfect accuracy and a chance to flinch the foe. Mega Swampert's coverage move can also be replaced by Stone Edge or Rock Slide to hit Mega Charizard Y outside of rain, but it is almost always better off with Ice Punch or Superpower. Mega Swampert can forgo a coverage move and run Substitute, as a smart Substitute can significantly boost its field time. Swampert can run Rain Dance over a coverage move in order to reduce your need to rely on Politoed to set rain. If Mega Abomasnow is being used beside base Swampert, Blizzard can provide solid, accurate spread damage that Swampert would otherwise be unable to deal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types, namely Breloom, Amoonguss, Ludicolo, and Ferrothorn, resist or take very little damage from both of Swampert's STAB attacks and can either OHKO or cripple it in return.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulkier Water-types like Gyarados and Rotom-W resist Mega Swampert's strongest STAB move, Waterfall, take its coverage options with ease, and can do moderate damage to it (especially in rain) and reduce its overall effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Because Swampert is a physical sweeper, it is crippled by burns that can be spread by Sableye and Rotom-W, the latter of which can also reliably take Swampert's attacks. It's also hindered by Intimidate, which is best provided by Gyarados and Salamence, as they can usually take Swampert's attacks (Salamence only if Swampert isn't running Ice Punch); Scrafty also can utilize Fake Out to stall rain turns.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Swampert relies heavily on rain and is relatively weak to most sun and hail teams, so replacing its weather hinders its effectiveness tremendously. Mega Charizard Y can set sun and threaten to OHKO Mega Swampert with Solar Beam, while Abomasnow threatens it with a Grass-type STAB move while replacing rain with hail.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: These moves take away Mega Swampert's speed advantage, crippling its ability to stay productive on the field. Cresselia, Porygon2, and Jellicent can reliably take anything Swampert has to offer and set Trick Room. Whimsicott can set Tailwind really easily in front of Mega Swampert by making use of Prankster and then potentially OHKO it with a Grass-type STAB move, while Suicune and Zapdos can reliably take Swampert's attacks and set Tailwind in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Gengar and Gyarados prevent non-Mega Swampert from using Wide Guard to protect its allies.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is almost always Mega Swampert's best attack, as it is a reliable and strong physical attack that is boosted by rain. Earthquake is its strongest Ground-type STAB move and also gives Mega Swampert a spread option while providing super effective coverage against Volcanion and Steel-types such as Aegislash. For Mega Swampert's third move, Ice Punch hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss and Latios for good damage, which Mega Swampert's STAB moves can't, while Superpower provides solid coverage versus Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn. Protect is necessary because Swampert must safely Mega Evolve before it gains Swift Swim. It also either allows Swampert to stay safe from a threat for a turn while its partner deals with said threat or allows you to safely scout for a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allows Mega Swampert to hit as hard as possible, while 252 Speed EVs let it outspeed all relevant threats while under rain, including Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Genesect, and Deoxys-A. For pre-Mega abilities, Damp is superior to Torrent, as you won't ever use Torrent due to Swampert needing to Mega Evolve as soon as possible. Damp can also let Swampert prevent an Explosion while switching in on occasion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swampert is only good once it has Mega Evolved and is in rain, because otherwise its damage output is relatively low and its Speed is pretty poor. Because of this, try to maximize its time in rain by bringing it into the drizzle as early possible. When Mega Evolving Swampert, make smart use of Protect so that it can gain the Swift Swim Speed boost without consequences. Mega Swampert is best used as a mid- to late-game sweeper, as it can easily clean up once its threats, such as Grass-types and Water-types, are removed. You can also remove said threats while Swampert is on the field by having another Pokemon that can remove them, like Kyurem-B, Latios, or Talonflame, do so before they threaten Swampert.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>First and foremost, you almost always need Politoed, as Drizzle automatically sets rain so that you don't need to waste a turn doing so. You should also have some answers to Grass-types, such as Kyurem-B and Talonflame, as they will almost always beat Mega Swampert. Swampert is really weak to sun due to it being OHKOed by common sun Pokemon, like Mega Charizard Y with Solar Beam and Venusaur, so bring a few good sun checks, such as Thundurus and Talonflame. If you aren't running Superpower, strong Fighting-types like Terrakion and Conkeldurr are also good to have in order to beat Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B, which are huge threats to rain. Finally, Ground-immune Pokemon like Latios and Talonflame should be on the team so that you can attack with them while Swampert uses Earthquake.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald serves as Swampert's primary STAB attack, as it has decent power and can chip away at foes with the helpful chance to burn. Earth Power is Swampert's strongest accurate attack, which grants Swampert helpful coverage against threats such as Volcanion and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Ice Beam fills out Swampert's coverage, giving it an option to hit Grass- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB moves while also allowing Swampert to OHKO Landorus-T and deal significant damage to Thundurus. Although Icy Wind is far weaker than Ice Beam, the speed control it provides can greatly help Swampert's teammates with more middling Speed. Wide Guard protects Swampert's allies from any spread attack and fits well on Swampert's moveset due to its good matchup against spread attackers such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Landorus-T. Hydro Pump is a viable alternative to Scald; while the drop in accuracy is quite noticeable, so is the increase in power, granting Swampert the ability to OHKO Mega Diancie without a boosting item.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread, when accompanied by a Sitrus Berry, allows Swampert to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Aegislash's Shadow Ball or Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird. Alternatively, an Expert Belt set increases the power behind Swampert's moves and is usable due to its fantastic super effective coverage, though it loses out on the longevity provided by a Sitrus Berry. A Quiet nature is used instead of a Modest one so that Swampert can hit Aegislash in its Blade forme and improve its functionality inside of Trick Room, and its low Speed means that any investment will rarely help under normal field conditions anyway. Damp prevents the rare Explosion Landorus-T or Genesect from dealing major damage to Swampert's team, or Torrent powers up Scald when Swampert is low on health. Both abilities are situational at best, so the choice between the two rarely makes a difference.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Wide Guard as necessary, otherwise leaning on Swampert's decent coverage to hit many common threats. A lack of Protect can leave Swampert vulnerable to weather sweepers and Fake Out, so it may need to be switched out to avoid taking unnecessary damage. Swampert should generally be saved to beat the threats it defeats especially well, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Heatran. With its solid bulk, Swampert should be able to switch in on those threats and defeat them with ease. However, due to its solid matchup against common leads such as Landorus-T and Thundurus, it can function well as a counter-lead to those threats. Due to its low Speed, Swampert should only rarely be saved for endgame scenarios, as it is unlikely to be able to clean opposing teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that is weak to common spread moves can benefit from Swampert's partnership. Especially noteworthy options include Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Gyarados, which also augment Swampert's bulk, and setup attackers such as Volcarona, Kyurem-B, and Mega Charizard X. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Infernape beat Grass-types and appreciate Swampert's Wide Guard stopping Earthquake and Rock Slide. Heatran synergizes particularly well with Swampert, taking advantage of its Wide Guard support to set up Substitutes and remove threatening Grass-types. Dragon-types tend to perform fairly well against Swampert, so teammates to defeat them such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie can serve Swampert quite well. Ice-types are able to defeat Dragon- and Grass-types, so partners such as Weavile and Mega Abomasnow can operate well with Swampert as a partner. Generally speaking, Swampert's anti-meta coverage and defensive utility allow it to fit fairly well on any team, but there are few teams on which it would not be outclassed, so before adding Swampert, make certain that Gastrodon, Suicune, or other Wide Guard users such as Conkeldurr and Aegislash would not better serve the team.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>While the loss of permanent rain was a negative, Ludicolo is still a potent rain attacker; its immunity to powder moves allows it to switch into Spore and ignore Rage Powder, meaning it can get around Amoonguss, a common check to rain teams. Fake Out is an excellent move that lets Ludicolo disrupt opposing strategies, and when rain is up, Ludicolo becomes the fastest Fake Out user in the metagame. However, it does have some problems of its own. For example, while its Water / Grass typing allows it to handle Pokemon such as Rotom-W that normally check rain sweepers, this typing also causes Ludicolo to miss out on some resistances that would've been useful, such as ones to Fire-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. In addition, although Ludicolo isn't frail, it's not especially bulky either, so more powerful attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan can deal heavy damage to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moves such as Energy Ball or Grass Knot are alternative STAB options for Ludicolo due to their higher power than Giga Drain (although in the case of Grass Knot the power depends on the target). However, the healing from Giga Drain usually makes it a better move to use than Energy Ball, and it has a more reliable damage output than Grass Knot as well. Scald could be a replacement for Hydro Pump due to its 100% accuracy and 30% chance to burn the target, but a significantly lower damage output than Hydro Pump typically makes it the less desirable choice. Focus Blast allows Ludicolo to hit threats such as Kyurem-B and Ferrothorn that normally have very little to fear from Ludicolo, but its unreliable accuracy makes it difficult to justify over the moves in the main set. A set with Sitrus Berry could work as a bulky pivot, but loses out on Ludicolo's ability to be a threatening sweeper. Substitute is an interesting  option to shield Ludicolo from priority and status, but Ludicolo must then lose out on Assault Vest as well as a potential attacking move, making it hard to justify on a moveset. A set with Leech Seed and Rain Dish could be used, but it lacks much in the way of offensive presence and will usually be KOed by powerful attackers before it can hope to stall one out. Finally, Teeter Dance should not be used due to the fact that it's luck-based and hits Ludicolo's partner, making it an unreliable strategy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Abomasnow is an excellent counter as it has no problem dealing with Politoed to set up hail, stripping Ludicolo of its preferred weather condition. In addition to this, Abomasnow can comfortably sponge all of Ludicolo's attacks and respond with a powerful attack of its own. Mega Charizard Y is a good check as Drought stops Swift Swim from working while simultaneously weakening one of Ludicolo's main STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Bulky attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan can tank a hit from Ludicolo and deal heavy damage back, making them good checks. Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B can easily take hits from it and wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame is an excellent check to Ludicolo as it has a priority Brave Bird to get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim and OHKO it. <strong>Paralysis and Trick Room</strong>: Thundurus is a good check as it can hit Ludicolo with a priority Thunder Wave, crippling it for the remainder of the match. Bulky Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can turn Ludicolo's high Speed under rain into a major liability, making them excellent checks to it.</p>",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set is the most effective one to use on Ludicolo. Fake Out can disrupt strategies by rendering an opposing Pokemon immobile for a turn, potentially allowing a partner to KO them. Hydro Pump is the main STAB attack and is great due to its neutral coverage, high power, and the fact that it gets a 50% boost from rain. Giga Drain is an accurate secondary STAB attack, hitting Water-types that resist Hydro Pump such as Rotom-W or Keldeo; the passive recovery it provides also helps improve Ludicolo's longevity. Ice Beam is a good coverage option to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types such as Amoonguss and Latios that can sponge Ludicolo's STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread grants Ludicolo as much power as possible as well as the ability to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Landorus-T when under rain. Assault Vest boosts Ludicolo's special bulk, something that proves even more useful due to the fact that Ludicolo typically lacks room for Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>A good idea is typically to bring in Ludicolo late-game once the opponent's team is weakened, where it can clean up with its Speed granted by Swift Swim and Water-type attacks. Also, if your opponent is carrying a Thunder Wave user such as Thundurus, play cautiously, as a paralyzed Ludicolo is infinitely less threatening than a healthy one. Fake Out is a great tool to use selectively to apply pressure on your opponent, force them into making certain plays, and create free turns for a partner, so make sure you use the move wisely. If you're not planning on using Ludicolo for a late-game sweep (or if you're sure you can keep it in good enough health to achieve said sweep), it makes for a great early-game pivot with its bulk (augmented by Assault Vest) and access to Fake Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed makes for an almost essential partner for Ludicolo, as the rain from Drizzle activates Ludicolo's Swift Swim ability and gives Hydro Pump a 50% power boost. Also, Politoed has Helping Hand to boost the power of attacks coming off of Ludicolo's middling base 90 Special Attack. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Diancie appreciate having Ludicolo as a partner due to its ability to handle Water-types such as Rotom-W that are problematic for them. Anything that appreciates the free turns bought by Fake Out, such as Substitute Metagross, could make for a good partner to Ludicolo. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Thundurus that threaten Talonflame are excellent partners as well, as Talonflame can get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim with Gale Wings and KO with a priority Brave Bird. Other good partners are Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty that can patch up Ludicolo's lower Defense stat.</p>"

        "name": "Life Orb Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump, when backed by the power boosts from a Life Orb and the rain, puts a large dent in anything that doesn't resist it. Giga Drain hits many common Pokemon that resist Water such as Rotom-W and Keldeo while also healing up any residual damage racked up from Life Orb recoil. Ice Beam provides good coverage against Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon that would wall Ludicolo otherwise. Protect lets Ludicolo stall out field conditions, shield itself from damage, and give teammates room to work.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb increases Ludicolo's damage output to very respectable levels, making it a powerful special attacker when supported by the rain. Its Special Attack is maximized to hit as hard as possible, and the Speed investment allows it to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Adamant Bisharp and Adamant Breloom outside of the rain and outspeed the vast majority of the metagame while inside it. A Timid nature is unneeded to outspeed any additional threats, making Modest the superior choice to boost Ludicolo's offensive potential as much as possible. Swift Swim allows Ludicolo to take advantage of the rain by doubling its Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ludicolo is best used while in the rain, so try to avoid sending it in unless the rain is up. Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's most powerful attack under the rain and should be used as much as possible. While Protect usually would not get a special mention, most opponents will assume Ludicolo is an Assault Vest variant if it has not taken Life Orb recoil and may be caught off guard by the usage of Protect. Similarly, opponents might play around a potential Fake Out if Ludicolo's set has not been revealed yet.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed and Rain Dance users such as Thundurus are mandatory partners for this set, as they provide the rain it requires to function properly. Talonflame beats opposing Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss that Ludicolo may have trouble breaking through, while Ludicolo beats one of its main checks, Mega Diancie. Pokemon that beat Flying-types like Talonflame such as Landorus-T, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie are great partners for Ludicolo, with a special mention to Mega Diancie because of its ability to get past Dragon-types that Ludicolo would have to rely on Ice Beam to damage heavily. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr prey on the most common defensive checks to Ludicolo, Ferrothorn and Kyurem-B.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>While Mega Manectric does possess blazing Speed and good coverage, its only decent Special Attack and frailty let it down, holding it back from being a decent attacker in DOU. Its attacks often lack the needed power to get a finishing punch on most foes, leaving it open to attacks with its paltry bulk if it doesn't get a KO. Its lack of bulk and notable resistances leave it unable to safely switch into attacks and make it prone to getting significantly damaged by any strong blow; if opposing speed control is up, Mega Manectric simply becomes a liability. Its access to Intimidate is quite nifty, however, giving it a way to support its teammates by weakening opposing physical attacks, and its combination of high Speed and super effective coverage makes it decent for late-game clean-up situations. Being an Electric-type is also a boon for a fast attacker, as this means Mega Manectric can't be paralyzed. Despite that, however, Mega Manectric isn't a recommended pick due to costing a Mega Evolution when it's mostly subpar; a different Mega Evolution such as Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Diancie would often yield better results.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch can be useful in order to keep Mega Manectric safe while it's picking off threats, but using it means losing a reliable STAB move, a valuable coverage move, or a necessity in Protect. Flamethrower is a weaker alternative over Overheat that doesn't have the Special Attack drop. Snarl can be nifty to support teammates against special attacking foes, but this kind of role would be better done by Raikou, which is bulkier and doesn't cost a Mega slot for a supporting role.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Choice Scarf Landorus-T, a very common threat in the metagame, can both outrun Mega Manectric and OHKO it with Earthquake. Gastrodon and Mega Swampert can take any attack and KO with their respective Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Any strong attacker that can take a blow from Mega Manectric, such as Mega Kangaskhan or Kyurem-B, can hit back for good damage at its paper-thin bulk.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Mega Manectric needs the Speed advantage in order to be effective, as it can easily be picked off without it. Tailwind, from the likes of Talonflame and Zapdos, and Trick Room, from threats such as Cresselia and Hoopa-U, are ones to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Defiant: Bisharp can simply take advantage of Mega Manectric's Intimidate with a boost to its Attack.</p>",

        "name": "Fast Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is simply Mega Manectric's reliable STAB move. Overheat lets Mega Manectric get quick major damage on Steel- and Grass-types such as Jirachi, Aegislash, and Amoonguss and lets it get the OHKO on Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice lets Mega Manectric cover Dragon- and Ground-types such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Landorus-T. Protect shields Mega Manectric from attacks, letting it safely Mega Evolve, stall out field conditions such as Trick Room, and position as needed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature are used in order to maximize Mega Manectric's offensive potential and let it outrun Mega Gengar. Lightning Rod is the selected ability in order to let Manectric provide some utility and possibly nab a Special Attack boost pre-Mega.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Manectric should mostly be used as a last-hitter of foes that are in KO range, as, while it is fast, it is also quite frail. Thanks to its Speed and wide coverage, Mega Manectric does well as a cleaner late-game when most foes are already weakened. It can also provide support by threatening KOs on numerous faster foes that ordinarily would be threats to its teammates; an example is it threatening a Keldeo that's pressuring a Heatran partner. While it does have Intimidate to support teammates with, it should be utilized carefully, as Mega Manectric can't take many hits due to its frailty. It can also use its Lightning Rod ability pre-Mega in order to protect teammates from Electric-type attacks and nab a boost; still, it should Mega Evolve as soon as possible because its base 105 Speed leaves it threatened by a good number of foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that can effectively deal with Landorus-T are strongly recommended; Kyurem-B and Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can all KO it with their respective STAB moves. Spread attackers are also good teammates because they can efficiently weaken an opposing team enough for Mega Manectric to be able to KO effectively; Volcanion and Heatran can do good damage with Heat Wave, Sylveon can hit hard with Hyper Voice, and Terrakion can effectively spread damage around with Rock Slide. Landorus-T can also work, but using both can bring the team a deadly weakness to Bisharp, which can take advantage of the duo's Intimidates. Talonflame is also an effective partner, as they can effectively form a one-two punch that can finish off foes with ease with their high Speed and power.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Milotic's access to Competitive allows it to be a great counter to Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Scrafty. Further aided by its access to Recover granting it the ability to stay on the field for longer than most Pokemon, Milotic can be a good niche pick in the Doubles OU metagame.</p> <p>However, Milotic's poor offensive movepool and resulting lack of coverage leave it walled by common Grass- and Water-types such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Because Milotic needs to heavily invest in its Special Attack and defenses in order to be effective, its base 81 Speed can severely hold it back. Finally, without a boost from Competitive, Milotic lacks the offensive presence found in other Water-types such as Keldeo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Milotic can run Toxic to beat bulky Pokemon it would otherwise have trouble damaging, such as Suicune and Cresselia. Hidden Power Electric is another coverage option for that can be run on the offensive set with no extra investment or on the defensive set with 136 Special Attack EVs to always OHKO 252 HP Gyarados with a Competitive boost. However, this causes Milotic to miss out on using a generally much better move, such as Ice Beam or Recover. Mirror Coat can help patch up Milotic's sparse coverage options and makes use of its naturally high Special Defense, allowing it to take a foe's special attack and return it at the attacker for double the damage, but again, Milotic misses out on running a more reliable move. Milotic can run Choice Scarf to catch opponents by surprise. This set would be best run with a moveset of Scald / Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Icy Wind and an EV spread of 96 HP / 252 SpA / 160 Spe with a Modest nature, which would allow Milotic to outspeed Mega Lucario while maximizing its damage output and bolstering its bulk. However, using Choice Scarf locks Milotic into one move and forces it to miss out on utility options like Recover and Protect. Another item option for Milotic is Rocky Helmet, allowing it to punish physical attackers. Milotic can also hold a Maranga Berry in order to gain a +1 Special Defense boost when it is hit by a special attack, allowing it to take hits from and stall out even the strongest special attackers in the Doubles OU metagame. However, these two items lack the overall reliability and utility of the ones listed in the main sets, as the former can sometimes activate only a few times in a game, while the latter may not activate at all.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thundurus can hit it with Thunderbolt or Taunt and is bulky enough to take an unboosted Ice Beam. Rotom-W resists Milotic's whole moveset and can deal significant damage with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Certain Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Ludicolo, and Mega Venusaur take neutral damage from Ice Beam and can KO Milotic with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo totally wall Milotic and can do big damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Kyurem-B is another special case, as with its good defensive typing and bulk, it can handle any of Milotic's attacks with ease, and Milotic is generally going to be Substitute bait for Kyurem-B unless it has a Competitive boost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: With its unremarkable base 81 Speed, Milotic is outsped by most of the top Pokemon in the Doubles OU metagame, and Pokemon with a lower base Speed can invest enough Speed EVs to outspeed it. There also isn't much room for investment without giving up some much-needed bulk. Notably, many common Electric- and Grass-types will be faster than Milotic, namely Serperior, Choice Scarf Rotom formes, Thundurus, and Ludicolo.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Sun halves the damage of Milotic's STAB attacks and activates Chlorophyll for Venusaur to take it out. The lingering effects of sun and the fact that Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur can both deal with an unboosted Milotic fairly easily mean that Milotic can be dead weight in many matchups against sun teams.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Milotic's most reliable STAB move, as it has 100% accuracy, decent power, and a 30% chance to burn the target. Icy Wind provides speed control and can also do good spread damage when Milotic has a Competitive boost. Alternatively, Ice Beam enables Milotic to hit Flying- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Amoonguss for much greater super effective damage. Icy Wind should be used on teams that require the speed control granted by the move, but Ice Beam is a stronger option on teams that already have speed control options in place. Recover gives Milotic reliable recovery, allowing it to stick around longer and continue to check Intimidate users and provide speed control. Protect allows Milotic to scout for moves, stall out opposing speed control, and avoid taking damage while its partner handles a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Special Attack EVs allow Milotic to 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan with Scald at +2 and OHKO Landorus-T with Ice Beam when unboosted. The Speed EVs let Milotic outspeed uninvested Rotom formes. Milotic's HP is maximized and the remaining EVs are put into Defense to maximize its bulk. Sitrus Berry provides instant recovery, which is especially handy against Mega Kangaskhan due to the possibility of Parental Bond activating it between hits. Leftovers is an alternative that gives Milotic permanent passive recovery, which can help later in the game as Milotic attempts to stall out opposing Pokemon. Another option is Safety Goggles, which grants Milotic an immunity to Spore and lets it ignore redirection from Rage Powder, allowing Milotic to improve its matchup against Grass-types by avoiding sleep and attacking its intended target.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switching Milotic in when you think the opponent's Intimidate user is going to come in is a good way to get a Competitive boost. Milotic can also switch in on an Icy Wind or Snarl and gain a Competitive boost that way. A +2 Special Attack boost can turn Milotic into a very capable offensive threat that the opponent has to deal with immediately, which can provide an incredible momentum swing in any game. Milotic's bulk, access to recovery, and ability to burn foes with Scald are all very valuable for the mid- and late-game. Milotic can stall out foes with Recover and Scald, allowing you to win games even when you are down or when Milotic isn't in a particularly favorable matchup. The speed control granted by Icy Wind will prove to be consistently valuable as the game goes on into the mid- and late-game, so it is smart to not let Milotic get KOed in the early-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan benefit from Milotic's deterrence of Intimidate users. Strong attackers with average Speed such as Mega Gardevoir and Hoopa-U benefit from the speed control provided by Milotic's Icy Wind. Milotic will also need teammates like Talonflame and Breloom that can defeat the Pokemon that can do big damage to it while taking very little damage from its attacks, such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. In return, these two appreciate Milotic's ability to discourage Intimidate users from switching in.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Milotic's best STAB move, letting it do serious damage to most Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Heatran, as well as good damage to neutral targets. Ice Beam allows Milotic to hit Flying- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Amoonguss super effectively. Recover allows Milotic to have a reliable way to recover its health, a trait missed out on by many other Water-types, notably Suicune and Keldeo. Protect allows Milotic to scout for moves, stall out opposing speed control, and avoid taking damage while its partner handles a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Competitive sharply boosts Milotic's Special Attack every time one of its stats is lowered, allowing it to take advantage of certain abilities and moves such as Intimidate and Snarl. Life Orb increases Milotic's damage output, giving it some much-needed extra power. The Special Attack EVs provided allow Milotic to OHKO 4 HP Bisharp with Hydro Pump at +0 and 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan while at +2. The given Speed EVs let Milotic outspeed neutral-natured, fully invested, base 70 Speed Pokemon, particularly Bisharp. The remaining HP and Defense EVs allow Milotic to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Return.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Milotic is a good option to choose as a lead if the opponent has an Intimidate user such as the very common Landorus-T. There are two different situations in which it is optimal to switch in Milotic. One is when you have two threatening physical attackers on the field and the opponent is going to bring in their Intimidate user to try to lower their Attack. The other situation is when your opponent is going to go for Icy Wind or Snarl, which Milotic takes little damage from and can use to activate Competitive. Remember to take into account that Milotic will only be affected by Intimidate if it comes onto the field before the Intimidate user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Milotic requires a decent amount of support, so there are a good number of teammate options to keep in mind when using it. For starters, Pokemon that benefit from not having to fear Intimidate are great partners for Milotic, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T. Many Grass-type Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Ludicolo, are good checks to Milotic, so having a Pokemon to beat them is also beneficial. A good choice to fulfill this role is Talonflame, as it also benefits from Milotic's deterrence of Intimidate users. Opposing Water-types, such as Keldeo and Rotom-W, will also cause trouble for Milotic, as they resist both of its attacks. Good options to beat them are Grass-types such as Serperior and Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos. Lastly, Milotic will benefit heavily from the speed control provided by Tailwind users such as Talonflame, Zapdos, and Latios.</p>"

High-Base Power moves with nearly unresisted coverage make it a perfect choice for offensive teams that need a way to break more defensive teams and the speed control advantage. Its access to Intimidate as well as useful resistances to Fire-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves also give it defensive utility on a team. However, its typing gives it unfortunate weaknesses to Fairy-type moves coming from threatening Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, as well as the more rare but just as lethal Ice-type coverage on Pokemon like Thundurus and Suicune. These weaknesses, combined with its relative frailty and average Speed, make it an unreliable Tailwind setter in many cases. Additionally, its most common moves come with an unfortunate chance to miss, lowering its consistency and reliability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Salamence can run a plethora of resist Berries to cover up its weaknesses. Yache Berry covers stray Hidden Power Ices from Pokemon like Thundurus and Blaziken, while Charti Berry allows it to take a Diamond Storm from Mega Diancie or take less from a Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Landorus-T. Rock coverage of its own can be useful for knocking out Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Protect can be used, but Salamence really appreciates its expansive coverage more. Choice Scarf is an option to increase Salamence's Speed immediately; however, Tailwind is generally more useful, and Choice Scarf hinders its ability to effectively utilize its stellar coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Many Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can blast through Salamence with Pixilate Hyper Voice while taking little damage due to their high Special Defense. Azumarill is one of the few Pokemon that either are immune to or resist all of Salamence's common coverage options and can use this to knock Salamence out with Play Rough or set up a relatively safe Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: STAB Ice-type moves coming from Weavile and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B are among the most efficient ways to deal with Salamence. Ice Shard from Pokemon like Abomasnow and Mamoswine can be threatening; however, Intimidate lowers its damage output significantly, forcing them to come in after Salamence to ensure the KO. Many Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos also run Hidden Power Ice, which can catch Salamence for a huge hit. Milotic not only commonly carries Ice Beam, but also gains a huge boost from Competitive if affected by Salamence's Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Fast Rock-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion can hit Salamence for massive damage with their STAB attacks. Rock-type moves used as coverage on Pokemon like Landorus-T can dent it as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Trick Room, and Tailwind</strong>: Speed control on the opposing team negates the speed advantage that Salamence provides with Tailwind and makes it a lot more vulnerable to strong attackers. Paralysis from common users like Thundurus and Gyarados allows normally slower Pokemon like Rhyperior and Kyurem-B, even under Tailwind, to knock out Salamence without taking a hit. Trick Room is similarly catastrophic, allowing threats like Sylveon and Hoopa-U to hit Salamence before it attacks. Common Trick Room setters include Hoopa-U and Cresselia, which Salamence can't break due to their amazing special bulk. Though Tailwind does not necessarily allow the opposing team to outspeed Salamence, it evens the playing field and allows the normally faster Pokemon to threaten Salamence before it can fire off another hit. Many common, bulkier Tailwind setters like Suicune and Zapdos can take any hit from Salamence and set it up.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Fake Out threatens Salamence due to it usually not carrying Protect, which disrupts its plan and allows the other Pokemon to easily take advantage of the free turn.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is a very high-powered attack that can rip holes through the opposing team. For its power, though, it comes with the drawback of a sharp Special Attack drop, so it should be used sparingly. Fire Blast is Salamence's first coverage move and roasts Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Flamethrower may also be used for a weaker but more accurate alternative. Hydro Pump is the second coverage move and KOes the two most common Pokemon that resist the two above moves, Mega Diancie and Heatran. It also covers Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Terrakion that will survive a Draco Meteor. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Salamence's team, providing crucial speed control for offensive teammates. This also allows Salamence to use its coverage to its full potential because it can outspeed and knock out Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Landorus-T that would otherwise threaten it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Salamence invests its EVs into Special Attack and Speed to maximize its offensive potential. A Timid nature is used to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Hydreigon as well as tying with other common base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan. A Modest nature is also viable to hit as hard as possible. Intimidate drops the Attack of the opposing Pokemon, which helps against physical attackers. Life Orb gives Salamence more power on all of its moves while keeping its flexibility in move choice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Fire Blast or Hydro Pump to knock out weakened enemies is generally a better idea than using Draco Meteor, as the Special Attack drop can be crippling and tends to force Salamence to switch out. Setting Tailwind the first turn Salamence is out is generally a good idea to pressure the opponent's team as much as possible, though it is not correct in every scenario. If your team is already faster than the opponent's and Tailwind doesn't improve the situation, do not waste a turn using it. Switching Salamence around as often as possible can circumvent Draco Meteor drops as well as preserve Intimidate to check physical attackers. Try to avoid bringing Salamence in on Defiant and Competitive users such as Bisharp and Milotic, as it gives them an Attack or Special Attack boost, making them a lot scarier to face down. Salamence tends to work well as a lead to get the speed advantage as soon as possible in a match, while Intimidate prevents physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T from doing too much damage early on in the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive partners that can pressure the opponent with the speed advantage that Tailwind provides are the best teammates for Salamence. Notable examples include Mega Kangaskhan, which provides Fake Out support to ease setting up Tailwind, and Keldeo, which can switch into Ice-type moves that Salamence loathes. Steel-types like Aegislash and Heatran are critical on teams with Salamence to switch into its weaknesses, most importantly its Fairy- and Ice-type ones, and to beat Salamence's most dangerous checks like Mega Diancie. Jirachi gets a special mention for resisting all of Salamence's weaknesses and redirecting away dangerous attacks so Salamence can run through the opposing team. Slower Pokemon that would rarely outspeed the other team but pack of a lot of offensive power also mesh well with Salamence's Tailwind support, with Pokemon such as Sylveon and Volcanion fitting into this category.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike the all-out offensive Mega Evolutions such as Diancie, Charizard Y, and Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross is held back by its poor offensive typing and the low Base Power of its STAB moves. It gives free momentum to the opponent's Steel-types, especially Aegislash, and it can be stopped by common Intimidate users, including Landorus-T. It's also pretty useless after being paralyzed or burned, though unlike Diancie and Charizard Y, it has the bulk to ride out temporary field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Moreover, with its good defensive typing, high base Speed, and fantastic stats all around, Mega Metagross is still able to serve as an effective speedy attacker, pivot, and utility check to offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo. It's not forced out too easily, except by Aegislash, and it can come in without much difficulty and threaten to deal major damage to offensive Pokemon or potential switch-ins. While the \"big three\" Mega Evolutions mentioned above may provide immense power, they require a lot of support; Mega Metagross, with its high Speed and numerous resistances, provides both some power and some support and is often a great choice for teams not built around a Mega Evolution.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide is an option to hit Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, but does pitiful damage otherwise. Grass Knot is available to hit Suicune and Mega Swampert while getting a Tough Claws boost, although it forces Metagross to use a nature that lowers a defensive stat. Magnet Rise gives Metagross an immunity to Ground and, when combined with Clear Body, stops Landorus-T cold; it also allows Mega Metagross to definitively beat Earth Power users such as Mega Diancie, and Kyurem-B. Refresh is an option to turn the tables on opposing Rotom-W and Thundurus by removing the status conditions they inflict, getting Metagross back in the game. Hone Claws is Metagross's only reliable option to boost its Attack and makes its STAB attacks 100% accurate. Finally, it gets Earthquake. While it does hit the Steel-types that otherwise wall Mega Metagross, Earthquake does not get STAB nor a Tough Claws boost and is incredibly weak as a result, doing barely more to Heatran than Hammer Arm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: While a non-Mega Metagross can avoid the former with Clear Body, these are very effective ways to neuter Mega Metagross. Landorus-T and Gyarados are significant threats with Intimidate and the ability to cripple or KO it (although Mega Metagross can run Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to beat their respective targets). Sableye, Talonflame, and bulky Rotom-W are the best candidates for burning Metagross; the former two outrun it, while the latter can take a Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Bisharp, Heatran, and Aegislash all resist Metagross's STAB attacks and hit it for massive damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Rotom-H threaten Metagross with boosted Fire attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Darkrai, Greninja, and Hydreigon are notable for their ability to outspeed and hit Mega Metagross with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Gengar and Aegislash both have a decent match up and can destroy Mega Metagross with Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar is even capable of trapping it for a guaranteed revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T: Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a major threat because it outruns Mega Metagross, Intimidates it, and then uses Earthquake; it should be noted, however, that Landorus-T's Earthquake does not OHKO Mega Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Because a large part of Mega Metagross's viability hinges on its high Speed, it is very vulnerable to speed control. Tailwind from the likes of Suicune and Talonflame lets slower partners get the jump on it and its teammates for a few turns. Thunder Wave from Thundurus permanently slows down Mega Metagross, letting even Aegislash outrun it. Trick Room makes an opposing Mega Metagross very vulnerable to attacks from the likes of Mega Camerupt and Aegislash. Cresselia is the Trick Room setter than can most easily set it in front of Metagross, although there are other viable setters, such as Jellicent.</p>",

        "name": "Mega Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Metagross's most important moves are its STAB options. Meteor Mash is Metagross's strongest attack and has a chance to boost its Attack and make it even more threatening. Iron Head can be used over Meteor Mash for its greater accuracy and a 30% chance to flinch its target, but has lower Base Power. This drop is noticeable in at least one common instance: Meteor Mash OHKOes standard Kyurem-B, but Iron Head does not. Zen Headbutt is also quite strong and patches the Steel typing's poor offensive coverage. Protect is important because it allows Metagross to safely Mega Evolve and reach Mega Metagross's higher base Speed; it also helps stall out field conditions such as rain and Trick Room.</p> <p>The final moveslot has many possible options. Hammer Arm is a powerful option that lets Mega Metagross damage Steel-types besides Aegislash, OHKO Hydreigon and have a chance at OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan, but must be used cautiously because of its Speed-lowering effect. Ice Punch can be used for the sole purpose of OHKOing Landorus-T, but Mega Metagross's STAB moves will still do hefty damage at -1, so it's not vital. Substitute lets Metagross avoid status moves from the likes of Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss and lets it soak up a single hit if set up safely. Substitute also blocks Intimidate, which makes using Substitute on the turn Metagross Mega Evolves a cool strategy—Landorus-T's Intimidate is useless on that turn because of Clear Body, and is useless on the next turns because of Substitute. Bullet Punch is rather weak, but very useful for hitting specific threats. It should only be considered on teams that totally lack priority or are uncomfortably weak to Mega Diancie. If necessary for a team's function, Mega Metagross can drop one of its STAB options for one of these moves, although this is not recommended.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>It may seem that Metagross's ability before Mega Evolving does not matter, as it almost certainly will be Mega Evolving as soon as possible. However, this is untrue—Clear Body renders Metagross immune to the weakening effects of Intimidate, making it futile for Landorus-T and other Intimidate users to switch in. The EV spread is simple but effective. Attack and Speed receive full investment to best suit Mega Metagross's stats and ability. A Jolly nature lets it take advantage of its great Speed tier. There are some alternate EV spreads that can be run; 16 HP / 240 Atk / 252 Spe lets Mega Metagross survive a Sucker Punch from Adamant Life Orb Bisharp and makes Substitutes that can be broken by Adamant Landorus-T's U-turn only with a maximum damage roll. Another possible EV spread is 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe with an Adamant nature. This bulkier spread is best used on semi-Trick Room teams. It outruns neutral base 101 Speed Pokemon normally, and after a Hammer Arm it will be slower than opposing Rotom-W, so Mega Metagross will outrun it under Trick Room. The Adamant nature gives it a high chance to OHKO Heatran with Hammer Arm and a small chance to OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Mega Charizard Y with Zen Headbutt, although most Mega Charizard Y are bulkier, so you must be cautious.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If your opponent has a Pokemon that Metagross needs its Speed to dispatch, such as Keldeo or Hydreigon, then it is best to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, even going as far as leading with Metagross to do it, so that you don't need to waste a turn on Protect when you need Mega Metagross ready to switch in. Otherwise, you can wait until you need it to attack to Mega Evolve, sometimes waiting on purpose so that Clear Body can block an Intimidate. Mega Metagross has the bulk to switch in multiple times throughout a match, which it uses to its advantage. Typically, Metagross is best brought in when it can score an OHKO, and then it just uses the appropriate move. Because Mega Metagross's main prey, Keldeo, is typically a cleanup Pokemon, Metagross often comes in after a teammate faints, though its good bulk also lets it come in on weak or resisted hits. Once Mega Metagross is no longer able to OHKO something, or once it's threatened by a Pokemon such as Talonflame, you switch it back out, and it comes back in again later. Metagross gives free momentum to Aegislash and, should it lack Hammer Arm, Heatran. If your opponent has one, you will need to play more aggressively with Metagross than usual, double switching and the like. Substitute Mega Metagross plays somewhat differently from three-attacks, coming in on Pokemon that allow it to set up a Substitute, such as Amoonguss, and only switching once both its Substitute is broken and it cannot KO anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Between its incredible offensive presence and its innate defensive capabilities, it's very difficult to find a team that won't benefit from using Mega Metagross. In many cases where a team is not built around a Mega Pokemon, Metagross will often be the best fit thanks to its supportive capabilities. Mega Metagross's best partners are Pokemon that can beat Steel-types and bulky Water-types, as these two groups are perhaps its biggest threats. Hydreigon is an excellent partner here, as it threatens all of Aegislash, Jirachi, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Mega Metagross greatly appreciates any type of speed control, including Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and even Icy Wind, from partners such as Talonflame, Thundurus, and Cresselia. This allows Mega Metagtoss to outrun foes and lets it get past some Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Politoed is a nice partner for those who want to use rain, as it negates Metagross's Fire weakness and allows Swift Swim partners to remove fast attackers and Choice Scarf users. Like all offensive Pokemon, Mega Metagross enjoys redirection support from the likes of Amoonguss and Togekiss to let it avoid attacks and continue its rampage. When building around Mega Metagross, other Pokemon to add are those that enjoy what it has to offer. Hydreigon is again a great partner, as Mega Metagross removes the Fairy-types and Fighting-types that Hydreigon fears, and together the two hit both physically and specially.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a combination of high Special Attack and Speed, Latios is a force to be reckoned with in the Doubles metagame. Boasting high power, Latios can severely damage or even KO a significant portion of the metagame with Draco Meteor alone. For an attacker, Latios sports good defensive typing, making it a good switch-in for notable Special attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Latios can also provide invaluable support by providing speed control in the form of Tailwind. However, Latios only has average bulk and is notably physically frail. Its strongest move, Draco Meteor, also has the nasty drawback of weakening Latios's power, meaning Latios is much less threatening once it's fired off the move. Lastly, Latios is easily switched in on and beaten by the numerous Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, such as Mega Metagross, Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be run to play around Sucker Punch and to avoid powerful attacks and status. Hidden Power Fire is an option to nab KOs on common Steel-type switch-ins such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, but it can't get past Heatran due to being nullified by Flash Fire and it forces Latios to give up one Speed IV, leaving it outsped by fully invested base 110s. A Mega set should not be run, as it's outclassed by the Life Orb variant, which hits harder and doesn't use the Mega slot. Recover is an option to give Latios longevity, recovering back health lost so it can stay in play longer. Dragon Pulse can be used instead of Draco Meteor for a Dragon STAB move that doesn't lower Latios' Special Attack. Thunderbolt can be run in order to 2HKO Togekiss while also hitting bulky Water-types such as Gyarados and Politoed super effectively. While seen on some Latios, Ice Beam is not recommended because it has redundant coverage with Draco Meteor, which is stronger and already gets the KO on threats Ice Beam hits super effectively, such as Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-type Pokemon such as Bisharp, Darkrai, and Hoopa-U can easily KO Latios with their respective STAB moves, with Bisharp being able to switch in on Latios's STAB moves and hit back with a priority Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Diancie, can switch in on Draco Meteor safely and KO back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, and Heatran can switch in on a majority of Latios's attacks and significantly or, in Heatran's case, gradually damage it. Jirachi can redirect Latios's attacks while being able to take them reliably and completely walling Latios's standard moveset.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan deals significant damage with its Normal-type STAB moves while also packing Sucker Punch to bypass Latios's Speed.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: As Latios is faster than a majority of the metagame, Trick Room puts it at a disadvantage by making it slower than most Pokemon and highlighting its only average bulk. Cresselia can reliably set Trick Room while taking everything Latios has. Diancie can also set Trick Room without fearing Draco Meteor. Opposing Tailwind takes advantage of Latios's average bulk by making the majority of the opposing team move first. Life Orb Talonflame can set it while hitting Latios hard, and Suicune can tank a Draco Meteor and hit back with Ice Beam. Thunder Wave takes away Latios's precious Speed. Thundurus can paralyze Latios with Thunder Wave while being near-guaranteed to get it off thanks to Prankster. Icy Wind lowers Latios's Speed to manageable levels while also hitting super effectively. Politoed is able to hit with Icy Wind while being bulky enough to take a Draco Meteor.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful STAB move and is able to KO or at least deal significant damage to most targets. However, it has the drawback of lowering Latios's Special Attack by two stages, so Draco Meteor has to be used carefully or else Latios will easily become setup bait for switch-ins that resist or are immune to Dragon. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that hits does not lower Latios's power. As Psyshock tagets physical defense, it can also hit foes with lower Defense than Special Defense, such as Mega Charizard Y, and Pokemon holding an Assault Vest harder. Psychic can be used instead for its higher Base Power to hit threats such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T harder. Tailwind lets Latios support its teammates by doubling their Speed, helping them outspeed and KO threats they couldn't safely otherwise. Using Tailwind also lets Latios act while ignoring opposing Sucker Punch, essentially gaining a free turn to set up while avoiding getting KOed. On teams that don't need Tailwind support, Hidden Power Ground is a useful option for OHKOing Heatran and threathening other Steel-types that would otherwise wall Latios, such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross. The final move, Protect, is a staple move, letting Latios stall out field conditions, shield itself from damage, and give teammates room to do work.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb boosts Latios's damage output to higher levels, letting it easily get more KOs. Draco Plate is a usable alternative to still boost Draco Meteor's power but without the recoil, but its lower power boost and limit to Dragon-type moves make it unappealing. The given EV investment maximizes power and Speed. With Timid, Latios outruns many notable threats such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Latios's high power, it is recommended to blast holes in the opposing team early-game with Draco Meteor. Be wary of using Draco Meteor, however, if the opponent still has healthy Steel- or Fairy-type Pokemon to switch in. Due to Draco Meteor's drawbacks and Life Orb recoil, it's recommended to play Latios as a hit-and-run attacker, switching out after a successful hit in order to shake off the Special Attack drop. In cases when using Draco Meteor is not preferred, such as when Latios doesn't want to incur the Special Attack drop, it can attack with Psyshock instead.</p> <p>Thanks to its nice defensive typing along with Levitate, Latios can function as a switch-in for numerous notable attacks, especially special ones such as Hydro Pump and Heat Wave. It's useful to set Tailwind in cases when Latios can safely do so, such as when it can take any move the opposing Pokemon have or when Latios can threaten to KO. Doing so can maintain momentum and let Latios's teammates be much more dangerous, getting KOs on threats they wouldn't be able to otherwise. Using Tailwind can also let Latios avoid opposing Sucker Punch in a pinch while still being helpful to its team. In the late-game, Latios can function effectively as a cleaner thanks to its high power and Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Latios is an offensive Pokemon, it greatly appreciates teammates that can beat or at least switch in on opposing Pokemon that check it. Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Heatran make for good partners, as they can switch in on opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type moves safely. Pokemon that can reliably switch in and beat opposing Dark-types are also recommended. Terrakion matches up well against Dark-type Pokemon, as it is able to get an Attack boost by switching in on Dark-type attacks thanks to Justified, while Mega Kangaskhan can nab KOs on a number of Dark-types and at the same time boost its Attack by using Power-Up Punch. Other Fighting-types such as Breloom and Scrafty can also fare well against Dark-type Pokemon, though Scrafty must be wary of giving opposing Bisharp a Defiant boost with its Intimidate. Latios also appreciates Quick Guard to block strong priority attacks such as Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Gale Wings Brave Bird. Again, Terrakion makes a good teammate because it can beat opposing Dark-types while being able to support Latios with Quick Guard.</p> <p>Fake Out support is useful to give Latios a free turn to set Tailwind or get a free turn to hit with Draco Meteor. Mega Kangaskhan has access to Fake Out and is a very strong attacker overall, and Scrafty can provide additional support with Intimidate. Pokemon that work well in Tailwind appreciate Latios as a partner as well. Breloom works well in Tailwind, as the Speed boost allows it to neuter almost any active threat with Spore. Strong attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y also appreciate being able to attack with less risk of being outrun and damaged.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Possessing high Attack and Speed stats along with access to a powerful STAB move in Psycho Boost, Deoxys-A fits very well on hyper offense teams as a check to fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Diancie. Its Psycho Boost hits most threats neutrally, which, when combined with Fighting-type coverage, covers a significant portion of the metagame. On the other hand, Deoxys-A has a poor matchup against Mega Kangaskhan, which threatens Deoxys-A with Fake Out and can also OHKO it through its Focus Sash with a Parental Bond-boosted Sucker Punch. In addition, Psycho Boost and Superpower lower Deoxys-A's damage output, making it a poor answer to bulkier threats in the metagame. Its extremely poor defenses leave it susceptible to even the weakest of moves and force it to run Focus Sash to compensate for them. Deoxys-A is especially vulnerable to priority attacks, as they will bring it down to its Focus Sash or finish it off after its Focus Sash has been broken before it can move. Opposing speed control such as Trick Room, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave take away Deoxys-A's Speed, which is its biggest asset.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an option that OHKOes Landorus-T without dropping Deoxys-A's Special Attack like Psycho Boost does. However, the other coverage options typically work better for either giving Deoxys-A the ability to outprioritize other threats or helping it cover Aegislash and Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Latios. Life Orb greatly augments Deoxys-A's damage output, but forgoing Focus Sash sacrifices its ability to take a hit.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon:  Psychic-type Pokemon such as Latios, Cresselia, and Mega Metagross can easily take any attack from Deoxys-A hit back at its paper-thin bulk. They have to be wary of Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon Not Weak to Fighting-type Attacks: Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Jirachi, and Bronzong can take Deoxys-A's Psychic- and Fighting-type moves easily and capitalize on its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Priority attacks such as Fake Out, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Mega Metagross's Bullet Punch can outrun Deoxys-A if it doesn't use Extreme Speed, possibly KOing Deoxys-A or its partner before either of them can move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Certain very fast threats, most notably Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, nullify Deoxys-A's most important advantage in its Speed; however, such fast threats are uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Tailwind, Trick Room, and Thunder Wave all reduce Deoxys-A's offensive presence by forcing it to move slower and makes it more prone to getting OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: While Psycho Boost is a special move, Deoxys-A still relies heavily on its physical attacks. As such, Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, respectively, can heavily cripple it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psycho Boost OHKOes most Pokemon that it hits neutrally, except for particularly bulky Pokemon such as Suicune and Zapdos. Superpower lets Deoxys-A cover Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, and Hydreigon, which resist or are immune to Psycho Boost. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority move, which allows Deoxys-A to move before opposing priority moves, such as Sucker Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Thundurus's Thunder Wave, letting Deoxys-A revenge kill these priority users or at least deal damage to them before it faints. Knock Off is an option that enables Deoxys-A to hit Psychic-types such as Latios and Jirachi as well as Aegislash, which resists Psycho Boost and is immune to Superpower. Detect is an all-around good move in Doubles OU, allowing Deoxys-A to avoid being targeted while its partner maneuvers to improve the position for it. In addition, Detect can be used to stall out field conditions such as weather, Trick Room, and Tailwind.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing Special Attack enables Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost to deal the most damage possible. A Naive nature and maximum Speed EVs let Deoxys-A outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and some +1 Pokemon, such as Blaziken and Volcarona. The remaining 4 EVs are put into Attack for a slight boost to Deoxys-A's physical moves. An alternative EV spread of 48 Atk / 208 SpA / 252 Spe guarantees an OHKO on Hydreigon with Superpower, and another EV spread of 112 Atk / 144 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to OHKO Latios with Knock Off. A Focus Sash is necessary to try to make the most out of Deoxys-A's abysmal defenses.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-A's extremely poor bulk means that it can't switch in on any opposing moves, so bring it into play primarily as a lead or after a teammate faints. Deoxys-A works best against other hyper offense teams, as it is the fastest viable Pokemon in the metagame, outspeeding and KOing many Pokemon before they can act, so utilize it to keep opposing offensive threats such as Keldeo and Landorus-T out of the fight. Avoid using Deoxys-A to confront bulky threats it has difficulty breaking down such as Suicune and Aegislash. In addition, Deoxys-A needs to avoid opposing speed control effects such as Trick Room, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave, as these cripple its offensive pressure by forcing it to move slower. Keep it paired with offensively focused Pokemon so that it can maintain the offensive pressure necessary to keep the opposing team at bay in terms of momentum. When using Deoxys-A be conscious of how the stat drops from Psycho Boost, Superpower, and Intimidate severely cripple its damage output; switching it out allows it to restore its damage output when necessary or convenient. Be aware that possible chip damage from switch-ins with Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs can break Deoxys-A's Focus Sash or KO it after it has used its Focus Sash should it hit the switch-in with Superpower or Extreme Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-A appreciates being paired with offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and Talonflame, which can keep up offensive pressure and appreciate its ability to threaten foes like Mega Diancie. In addition, Pokemon that appreciate Choice Scarf Landorus-T removed, such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Diancie, greatly benefit from having Deoxys-A as a partner. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan complement Deoxys-A greatly, as it appreciates the free turn that Fake Out provides. Pokemon like Keldeo have good matchups against Aegislash and Mega Kangaskhan, two of Deoxys-A's biggest threats. Keldeo not only can 2HKO Aegislash with Hydro Pump and OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with Secret Sword but also can support Deoxys-A with Quick Guard or Taunt, depending on the set, which alleviates Deoxys-A's weaknesses to priority moves or Trick Room, respectively. Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar help Deoxys-A against Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Cresselia as well as opposing Aegislash.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon's good typing and bulk, combined with its decent movepool, allow it to be a niche check to some extremely common Pokemon in the Doubles OU metagame, including Landorus-T, Heatran, and Thundurus. Its ability Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to check rain teams and help teammates that are weak to Water-type moves avoid damage. Gastrodon's access to recovery plus its coverage movepool allow it to stay on the field many turns and deal damage to a wide variety of common threats. However, Gastrodon's very low Speed stat means it will always be moving last, and with its poor Special Attack stat, it doesn't really thrive in Trick Room; additionally, Gastrodon often relies on boosts from Storm Drain to be a real offensive threat. This lack of speed and power means that Gastrodon is threatened by strong physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan, when it cannot burn them with Scald. Gastrodon also faces competition from many other Water-types, such as Swampert, which has similar typing, movepool and access to Wide Guard, and Suicune, which is bulkier and can provide speed control. Similarly, Gastrodon has to compete with other common checks to rain teams, such as Kyurem-B and Ferrothorn, which are better Pokemon overall and notably not weak to Grass-type moves from Ludicolo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clear Smog is an optional move to run if the team Gastrodon is on seems weak to setup Pokemon, such as Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan, Quiver Dance Volcarona, and Belly Drum Azumarill. Muddy Water is an optional spread attack for Gastrodon; however, this move is weak without a boost from Storm Drain, so it is usually better to stick with Scald. Counter and Mirror Coat make good use of Gastrodon's bulk by allowing it to take an attack and send it back at the user, but by using these moves Gastrodon will have to drop a move that will usually be better because three damaging attacks are far less situational. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam if Gastrodon is paired with Mega Abomasnow, but the power drop here is definitely noticeable. Icy Wind is another alternative to Ice Beam that provides speed control for Gastrodon's partners, but it removes Gastrodon's ability to deal big damage with its Ice-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Breloom, will cause a lot of trouble for Gastrodon, as they resist both of its STAB attacks, and Gastrodon is 4x weak to Grass-type attacks, so even defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss will be able to do significant damage to Gastrodon with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Gastrodon is dreadfully slow, with only a base 39 Speed, and as such it will usually be taking damage before moving. When this is combined with its average Defense, Gastrodon severely struggles with strong physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Sun Teams</strong>: Opposing sun teams can be a big threat to Gastrodon, as the sun weakens Gastrodon's STAB water moves and Gastrodon will easily be KOed by a Grass-type move from Mega Charizard Y or Venusaur, the two staple Pokemon on traditional sun teams.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Recover + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Gastrodon's most reliable Water-type STAB move, hitting Fire-types like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Rotom-H. Not only does Scald provide decent power in a STAB attack, its 30% chance to burn can be a big help when facing physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan. Earth Power is Gastrodon's second STAB move, and it hits Rock-types like Mega Diancie, Steel-types like Heatran and Aegislash, and the Water-immune Fire-type Volcanion. Ice Beam provides great coverage on Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon, which would otherwise wall Gastrodon, as well as Flying-types like Landorus and Thundurus. Recover allows Gastrodon to restore its health and stay on the field longer than other Pokemon typically would, which can be vital in late-game situations or when taking opportunities of free turns. Alternatively, Protect allows Gastrodon to avoid damage entirely for the turn while its partner handles a threat and scout out an opposing moveset.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>232 HP and 176 Defense EVs let Gastrodon take two Brave Birds from Adamant Life Orb Talonflame, which means Gastrodon can switch in on and defeat it one-on-one. The 52 Special Defense EVs, paired with the given HP EVs, give Gastrodon the ability to survive a Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A. The remaining 48 EVs go into Special Attack to allow Gastrodon to OHKO Salamence and Landorus-T with Ice Beam. A Quiet nature allows Gastrodon to be slower than Aegislash and OHKO it with Earth Power while it is in its Blade forme. This will also allow Gastrodon to outspeed opposing Pokemon on Trick Room teams. Sitrus Berry provides instant recovery of 25% of Gastrodon's health, which helps against double targets and against Mega Kangaskhan due to Parental Bond. Expert Belt allows Gastrodon to do more damage against targets that are hit super effectively, which works well in conjunction with its expansive movepool, and pick up notable OHKOs against foes such as Mega Diancie with Earth Power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gastrodon's ability redirects all Water-type attacks to itself, so it is a great check to rain teams and helps Water weak teammates avoid taking damage, which can put foes in tough spots. Gastrodon shines by redirecting Water-type attacks and gaining Special Attack boosts, so luring a Water-type attack from your opponent with a Pokemon weak to Water and then switching in Gastrodon is a prime way to use this Pokemon. Gastrodon's bulk and typing give it the opportunity to switch in on many common Pokemon, such as Thundurus, Heatran, and Volcanion, as it will take very little damage from their attacks, and threaten them in return. Recover is great to take advantage of turns where the opponent may double Protect, not target Gastrodon, or use a stat-dropping move, such as Draco Meteor or Superpower. Keep in mind that if Gastrodon's partner uses a non-spread Water-type move, Gastrodon will redirect it too!</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gastrodon's biggest threat is any Grass-type Pokemon or move. Great Pokemon to pair with Gastrodon to threaten Grass-types like Amoonguss or Breloom are Fire-types like Heatran or Blaziken, a Flying-type like Talonflame, or an Ice-type like Kyurem-B. Putting Safety Goggles on Heatran makes it an even better Gastrodon partner, since this allows Heatran to switch into Spores from Amoonguss and Breloom. Even with all of the EVs invested into its physical bulk, Gastrodon could still use help in that area, especially due to the ever-present Mega Kangaskhan. An Intimidate Pokemon, such as Landorus-T or Scrafty, can be a big help. Gastrodon can also use Recover more often if it is taking less damage from physical attackers. Gastrodon is a great partner for Pokemon weak to Water-type attacks, such as Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. This is also important on the offensive end — if Gastrodon's teammates aren't going to lure Water-type attacks, Gastrodon can't get Storm Drain boosts. Gastrodon handles Electric-types extremely well, so Pokemon that benefit from this, such as Talonflame and Gyarados, fit well with it.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great bulk and strong supportive movepool, Togekiss works as a solid option to help the rest of its team shine. Primarily used for its access to Follow Me, Togekiss also has access to multiple methods of speed control that can be used in order to further support its partner, with its niche over other redirectors found in its access to Tailwind. These forms of speed control are especially useful to Togekiss given that its ability Serene Grace grants it the ability to cause its foe to flinch more than half the time, provided it moves first. Not only that, but Togekiss is alone among the redirectors in being immune to Ground-type attacks. Its typing also provides it the ability to take Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type moves with ease, all of which are common attacking types. However, as a defensively oriented Pokemon, Togekiss fails to provide much offensive pressure. Togekiss also faces lots of competition from other redirectors like Amoonguss, Jirachi, and Clefable, each of which has its own niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect allows Togekiss to scout for attacks and determine whether redirection is needed. However, Togekiss struggles to find room for the move on its moveset. Leftovers provides gradual recovery that adds up to more health than a Sitrus Berry if Togekiss is on the field for more than four turns, but Doubles is a fast-paced metagame and Togekiss usually won't be out for that long. Leftovers also fails to provide the boost of recovery that may be needed for Togekiss to survive two attacks in a crucial turn. Safeguard and Heal Bell are options for Togekiss to prevent or heal status effects such as burn, paralysis, and sleep, but they are much more situational than the options listed on the main set, and Togekiss can already redirect status moves away from its partner with Follow Me. Charm lets Togekiss lower a foe's Attack severely, opening up the ability to redirect its attacks more safely. However, if that foe switches out, the drops are removed anyway, and if Togekiss's goal is to redirect more attacks, Roost is generally more helpful. Rocky Helmet allows Togekiss to act as a soft check to physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame by providing chip damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-type Pokemon such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie can maul Togekiss with their STAB moves while handily taking an Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Bisharp and Mega Metagross can deal massive damage to Togekiss with Iron Head. Aegislash can also hit Togekiss with Flash Cannon but it hits Togekiss at its much higher Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus resist Air Slash and can deal significant damage with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Weavile can threaten Togekiss with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Without the ability to go first, Togekiss can't get Serene Grace flinches and is much less threatening. Thus, all forms of speed control weaken Togekiss's disruptive capabilities. Trick Room teams also hurt Togekiss's effectiveness, as they often have multiple spread attackers. However, Togekiss can try for flinches with Air Slash to prevent Trick Room from being set.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Gengar can prevent Togekiss from using Follow Me or any of its many other support options, limiting it to only one move. Both also threaten Togekiss with STAB super effective attacks. Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Heatran can freely set up on Togekiss that lack Encore and can attack both Togekiss and its partner from behind their Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attacks: Attackers with spread moves like Heat Wave and Rock Slide make Togekiss's primary purpose as a redirector ineffective. Some relevant examples include Landorus-T and Mega Charizard Y.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Follow Me",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's best attacking option, as it gets a STAB boost and, with Serene Grace, has a 57% chance to cause a slower target to flinch, factoring in accuracy. Follow Me allows Togekiss to give its partner a free turn to attack or set up safely, without fear. Tailwind and Thunder Wave are Togekiss's options for speed control, either of which allows it to support the team as well as outspeed more foes. Tailwind is unique to Togekiss as a redirector and supports Togekiss's whole side. However, unlike Thunder Wave, it isn't permanent and doesn't have the additional chance to prevent the foe from moving. Thunder Wave should be used to check specific threats for the full game, whereas Tailwind supports the entirety of the team for its limited duration. Encore locks a foe into innocuous moves such as Protect and Fake Out, leaving them unable to hurt Togekiss or its partner. It also goes through Substitute, which can prevent common users like Heatran and Aegislash from being effective in battle. Roost allows Togekiss to stick around longer by providing reliable recovery, whereas Helping Hand takes a more offensive approach and can turn Togekiss's partner's attacks from 3HKOs to 2HKOs and 2HKOs to OHKOs in the right situation.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed HP and Defense EVs allow Togekiss to survive a Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, letting it redirect the move once from full HP. 60 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind, with the remainder placed in Special Defense for extra bulk. Togekiss's decent base 120 Special Attack means that Air Slash still hits decently hard without investment. Equipping Safety Goggles allows Togekiss to safely redirect Spore from Amoonguss or Breloom, as well as ignore the effects of Rage Powder, making it a perfect answer to both, as Togekiss resists their STAB attacks and can hit them back with a super effective Air Slash. Sitrus Berry is another option and provides Togekiss with an extra HP buffer to survive more hits. This is especially important for turns where Togekiss needs to take two strong attacks for its partner. If using Thunder Wave over Tailwind, you can move the Speed EVs to Special Defense to allow Togekiss to survive a Life Orb Aegislash's Flash Cannon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Togekiss's goal is to be a disrupter or supporter in whatever way best aids its team. There are many different ways to accomplish this: Follow Me, Air Slash flinches, speed control, and either Encore or Helping Hand, depending on the chosen moveset. Try to avoid switching Togekiss in on any strong neutral or super effective attacks—a healthier Togekiss is a much more effective user of Follow Me. Use Follow Me to help Togekiss's partner when it is threatened to give it a chance to either set up or attack. For Togekiss, outspeeding opposing Pokemon is especially useful, granting it a good chance to immobilize them with Air Slash. Thus, setting some form of speed control in either Tailwind or Thunder Wave before attacking is usually a good idea, as getting a flinch with Air Slash can really help generate momentum for Togekiss's team. However, remember that Air Slash flinches are not guaranteed and shouldn't be treated as such. Use Helping Hand if Togekiss's partner is reasonably safe to attack and the boost is absolutely necessary to get the KO. Helping Hand is usually the best option on a turn where Togekiss will likely be outsped and KOed, as its +5 priority provides Togekiss a last-ditch way to support its teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Togekiss partners well with many different Pokemon in the metagame. Notable options include setup Pokemon, especially ones that appreciate speed control like Mega Kangaskhan, Substitute Heatran, and Substitute Kyurem-B. All Pokemon that don't share Togekiss's weaknesses and have lots of offensive presence to make up for Togekiss's lack thereof make for good teammates, especially if they appreciate the speed control it provides. Some examples that fall into this category are Breloom and Hoopa-U. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash protect Togekiss from Rock Slide and Icy Wind as well as discourage spread moves that Togekiss cannot redirect. Togekiss operates best alongside a teammate with the ability to beat Rock-, Steel-, Electric-, and Poison-types that threaten Togekiss out, so Pokemon with Ground-type attacks like Landorus-T, Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Rhyperior are great. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior get a special mention because Togekiss avoids Earthquake. Pokemon with Intimidate make it easier for Togekiss to do its job redirecting attacks by weakening the incoming physical attacks, so again, Landorus-T works very well beside Togekiss.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H's claim to fame is its Electric / Fire typing, which, combined with Levitate, allows it to check many of Doubles OU's top threats, including Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Amoonguss, Venusaur, and Thundurus. Its ability to beat the popular sun core of Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur is especially useful, as it makes Rotom-H a hard stop to sun teams. However, it is weak to the common Rock- and Water-types in the tier, such as Keldeo, Mega Diancie, and Terrakion. In addition to this, Rotom-H must be used with care, as its only Fire-type STAB attack drops its Special Attack and it can be easily worn down to a point where it cannot properly check the Pokemon it is supposed to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>It can be useful to invest 220 Speed EVs with a neutral nature in order to outspeed and subsequently burn or outright OHKO Breloom and Bisharp. Rotom-H can utilize a Choice Scarf set with Trick, Thunderbolt, Overheat, and Hidden Power Ice to beat a lot of bulky Pokemon such as Calm Mind Cresselia. If you do use a Choice Scarf set, the surprise factor of Rotom-H having Choice Scarf is the most important aspect, as once it's gone, Rotom-H is not very useful. Moreover, Rotom-W is usually better than Rotom-H at this role. While niche, Rotom-H can run a Rest + Chesto Berry set to bolster its longevity and still be able to switch into Spore or Sleep Powder. It can run Volt Switch in order to maintain momentum, but it is hard to justify using over Thunderbolt or Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H can also utilize a Life Orb set in order to hit a lot harder, being able to OHKO standard Aegislash and Mega Charizard Y with Overheat and Thunderbolt, respectively. Electroweb is an option for speed control; however, Thunder Wave is usually better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latias can easily switch into anything Rotom-H has and wall it, although they should be wary of a potential Thunder Wave, which would cripple them. Kyurem-B can take any hit from Rotom-H, set up a Substitute, and KO with Teravolt Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Water- and Rock-types that outspeed Rotom-H such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie can be an especially big problem because they can deal major damage or even threaten to OHKO Rotom-H before it can move.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Rain teams basically render Rotom-H useless.

However, you should be careful when using it because the Special Attack drops usually force Rotom-H to switch out. Thunderbolt should be used most of the time because, unlike Overheat, Rotom-H can use it multiple times without lowering its Special Attack. It allows Rotom-H to check most Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and can also be used to hit Water-types that threaten Rotom-H such as Keldeo and Suicune on the predicted switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-H cripple physical attackers, greatly adding to its utility and durability. However, Thunder Wave is a solid alternative if your team requires speed control and is well prepared for physical attackers. Protect lets Rotom-H scout its foe's moves and can help its partner safely switch or deal with another Pokemon that threatens Rotom-H.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Safety Goggles lets Rotom-H absorb Spore and Sleep Powder, allowing it to safely switch into common sleep inducers such as Amoonguss and Venusaur. If your team can easily deal with them already, Sitrus Berry is an option in order to give Rotom-H more longevity. Levitate removes Rotom-H's weakness to Ground-type moves. Be wary of Kyurem-B though, as it carries Teravolt to negate Levitate's effect, allowing it to easily OHKO Rotom-H with Earth Power. 252 HP EVs give Rotom-H as much bulk as possible both physically and specially. 156 Defense EVs guarantee that Rotom-H will always survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm. Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Rock Slide will also never 2HKO Rotom-H, so it gets an easy opportunity to burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp. 76 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Rotom-H will not be OHKOed by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and will not be 2HKOed by Aegislash's Shadow Ball. The remaining 24 EVs are dropped into Special Attack for a bit of power; however, if your team has Tailwind support, it is recommended to put 12 of the 24 EVs into Speed to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and burn it with Will-O-Wisp before it gets a chance to use a move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-H's is best used as a pivot that can switch in on attacks that don't threaten it and scare out the Pokemon it checks or counters. Be careful about switching in, though, as Rotom-H has no reliable recovery, so it can be worn down pretty quickly. Use Overheat very sparingly because once Rotom-H's Special Attack is dropped, it has no offensive presence whatsoever and is forced to switch or spread status ailments. Rotom-H isn't that great of a Pokemon, as its only niche is being able to hard counter sun teams, particularly Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wide Guard support from Pokemon such as Aegislash is very useful to avoid Rock Slide. Grass-types such as Amoonguss can beat the Rock- and Water-types that threaten Rotom-H and can also help a lot against rain teams, which Rotom-H is dead weight against. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion complement Rotom-H very well because they can deal with Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, and various Rock-types while Rotom-H can deal with Talonflame and other Flying-types that check them. Dragon-types such as Latios help a lot against rain teams and appreciate Rotom-H's ability to handle Steel-types. Rotom-H easily fits into a Fire / Water / Grass core with other bulky Pokemon such as Gyarados and Ferrothorn.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great assets, as both can cripple giant portions of the metagame. Unfortunately for Rotom-W, its HP and Speed stats are rather lackluster, and faster wallbreakers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Latios, can easily break through it. Its offensive coverage is also walled by most Grass- and Dragon-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W can run Electroweb alongside Will-O-Wisp to offer both speed control and burn support, and with 56 Speed EVs, it can outspeed -1 Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This is by far Rotom-W's most consistent set, doing an amazing job at checking or countering various threats in DOU. Hydro Pump is a solid STAB move that allows Rotom-W to score OHKOs on Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, and offensive variants of Heatran. Thunderbolt is usually used to hit Water-types that resist Hydro Pump as well as Pokemon which take roughly equal damage from both attacks, as it is also more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its better accuracy. Will-O-Wisp is a great way to deal with physical attackers, allowing Rotom-W to check Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross among others. It also gives Rotom-W a way to punish its most common switch-in, Amoonguss. However, Thunder Wave is great speed control, and especially important if you plan to use Rotom-W as a rain check, since it survives Ludicolo's Giga Drain and can paralyze it back. Protect keeps Rotom-W alive, stalls field conditions, and scouts for attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With this EV spread, Rotom-W always survives Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out into Return, two Mega Metagross Zen Headbutts, or two Amoonguss Giga Drains. If you're using Rotom-W on a Tailwind team, you should move 12 Special Attack EVs to Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Sitrus Berry is by far the most consistent item option for Rotom-W, but ChestoRest is another option for greater healing, though at the risk of not running Protect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W should be played as a bulky offensive glue Pokemon. This means that it should be switching into opposing threats, usually Water-, Flying-, or Ground-types, and either dealing damage or spreading status. Thanks to its amazing typing, it does this fairly reliably. Rotom-W also does a great job of tanking SlideQuake, which is a very popular coverage combination on Ground-types. The only Pokemon you should really fear with Rotom-W out are Grass- and Dragon-types. Threats with Lum Berry, such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp, like to lure Rotom-W and hit really hard. Make sure Rotom-W stays alive if the opponent is holding back Talonflame or Heatran, because they can be really threatening late-game if Rotom-W is taken out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Charizard are arguably the best partners to Rotom-W, as they benefit from having a partner that can sponge threatening Ground- and Rock-type attacks, and they can take out the Grass-types that threaten Rotom-W. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Lucario, Heatran, and Aegislash complement Rotom-W well defensively, as they resist Dragon- and Grass-type attacks, and Rotom-W resists Fire-type attacks. Ground-types appreciate Rotom-W as a partner, as they can freely use Earthquake beside it. Mamoswine is especially relevant here, as it can snipe Dragon- and Grass-types with ease.</p>"

Thunderbolt is a more accurate STAB move to be locked into if Rotom-W is in a position to clean up, and it also helps deal with Water-types. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to get more momentum if you do not want to lock it in into Hydro Pump or Thunderbolt. The move also chips the Dragon- and Grass-types that will switch in, such as Latios and Amoonguss. Trick allows Rotom-W to get rid of its Choice Scarf and cripple a foe with it, which makes it incredibly useful for dealing with utility Pokemon such as Cresselia and Amoonguss. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also great moves to cripple foes. Will-O-Wisp is effective versus physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross, while Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Latios and Serperior, which Rotom-W normally can't threaten, by massively slowing them down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The main reason to use Choice Scarf on Rotom-W is to be able to outspeed Landorus-T. With the listed EV spread, Rotom-W can KO Landorus-T with Hydro Pump before it moves. Rotom-W also outspeeds Deoxys-A and +1 Blaziken and can burn Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp before they are able to move, which it wouldn't be able to do without a Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a fantastic lead in a lot of situations, being able to either deal heavy damage, cripple foes with status moves, or use Volt Switch to gain momentum. It also has a good matchup against other common leads such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan. Rotom-W functions decently well as a late-game sweeper if all of its checks are gone thanks to its high Speed. Levitate allows it to switch into Ground-type moves such as Earthquake. You should only bring this Rotom-W set in on resisted hits or free switches, as it's much frailer than its defensive sets. Trick can entirely cripple an opponent's utility Pokemon such as Cresselia or Amoonguss by locking it into one move. You can also use Trick on Trick Room attackers such as Aegislash to be able to underspeed them in Trick Room. Removing Rotom-W's Choice Scarf helps it further by allowing it to switch moves. Do not use Trick on Pokemon that have a Mega Stone, such as Kangaskhan and Charizard, as Trick will simply fail and Rotom-W will be vulnerable the next turn, forcing you to either use Trick again or switch out. Being locked into a status move can quickly make you lose offensive presence and can leave Rotom-W a vulnerable target. Use Volt Switch if you want to get a quick KO and immediately switch out as well, giving you a lot of momentum, or when you want to get chip damage off against resistant switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Latios. If you have multiple moves that can net a KO, look at your opponent's team and make sure to choose the best move to lock Rotom-W into.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Good teammates for Rotom-W would be Pokemon that appreciate its ability to pivot well to switch them in often, such as Landorus-T and Scrafty. Pokemon that have a poor matchup versus Landorus-T such as Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Rotom-W's ability to deal with it easily. Considering Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latios resist Rotom-W's attacks, you should use a Fairy-type such as Mega Gardevoir or Sylveon to KO them easily. They can also KO Kyurem-B through its Substitute, which it sets up freely against Rotom-W. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Virizion and Terrakion are good at taking down Hydreigon and Kyurem-B as well. Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Weavile get rid of both Grass-types and Dragon-types; however, Kyurem-B has to look out for Dragon-type attacks itself because it's slower than Latios and Hydreigon, which is is a problem unless Kyurem-B has a Substitute up or your team has good speed control. You could also add Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Volcarona to deal with Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Serperior easily. Flying-types such as Togekiss do this as well, with Togekiss also beating Dragon-types.</p>"

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>While Manaphy is uniquely capable of boosting its Special Attack to the moon and back with Tail Glow, it still faces heavy competition for a team slot as an offensive Water-type from the likes of Azumarill and Keldeo, both of which sport useful secondary typings that allow them to eliminate a wider range of threats. They also have immediate power and access to priority attacks for the former and more Speed for the latter. Furthermore, Manaphy requires dedicated redirection support in order to maximize its potential as a setup sweeper, as well as hail support to be as powerful as possible by spamming Blizzard. Manaphy does, however, set itself apart from other Water-types with its sheer power when using Tail Glow and its ability to beat Grass-types such as Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wacan or Rindo Berry can be used to allow Manaphy to withstand an Electric- or Grass-type attack, respectively, in order to lure and get rid of one of its checks. It can also use Energy Ball, which enables it to beat other Water-types. However, doing so leaves Manaphy with a greater weakness to opposing Grass- and Dragon-types. Dazzling Gleam provides Manaphy an accurate spread attack, but it is quite weak, especially without the Tail Glow boost, failing to OHKO even threats hit 4x effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types, such as Serperior, Chlorophyll Venusaur, and Virizion, inflict massive damage on Manaphy with their super effective STAB moves. Some bulky Grass-types, namely Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, can survive a boosted attack or two and then do heavy damage back to Manaphy.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Electric-types, such as Thundurus and Rotom-W, can OHKO or do big damage to Manaphy with their STAB moves, but Thundurus can't switch in easily.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Sun weakens Manaphy's only STAB attack by a considerable degree and reduces Blizzard's accuracy, subsequently rendering it less of a threat. Mega Charizard Y also has a chance to OHKO Manaphy with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: As Manaphy is rather slow for a setup sweeper, it's not difficult for faster Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Metagross, and Latios to double target it or wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt from the likes of Thundurus and Sableye can prevent Manaphy from setting up with Tail Glow, incapacitating it.</p>",

        "name": "Tail Glow",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald, while being Manaphy's strongest STAB option, also has an added burn chance that discourages physically offensive bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn from switching into Manaphy. Ice Beam is for useful coverage that sets Manaphy apart from Azumarill and Keldeo, which don't beat Grass- and Dragon-types. If Manaphy is being used with Abomasnow, Blizzard is a great option over Ice Beam for powerful spread coverage. Tail Glow quickly makes Manaphy very powerful by boosting its Special Attack by +3 in just one turn. Protect should be used to take a turn to allow one of Manaphy's allies to eliminate a faster threat that would prove fatal to it, as well as to stall out opposing field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Modest Manaphy with maximum Special Attack EVs OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan with a +3 Scald after burn damage and OHKOes Amoonguss with +3 Ice Beam, as well as Speed tying with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan. Timid can also be used in order to attack as fast as possible while also outspeeding Adamant Mega Kangaskhan. Safety Goggles can be used to hit foes with Scald without having to worry about Amoonguss's Rage Powder or Spore and to avoid residual damage when Manaphy is used on hail teams. Sitrus Berry can also be used to make Manaphy survive longer with its immediate recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Generally, Manaphy wants to set up once it's on the field, as it poses zero threat when not boosted. However, sometimes it is vital to remove a certain attacker before letting Manaphy set up. That being said, when using Tail Glow, Manaphy should usually be supported by a teammate's Fake Out or Follow Me. Longevity is key with Manaphy; use Protect when against a faster Pokemon that threatens Manaphy, such as Thundurus, to allow an ally to beat the threat in that turn. Manaphy functions well as a late-game sweeper, so it's usually a good idea to eliminate the fast Pokemon that threaten Manaphy before setting up with it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection in the form of Follow Me or Rage Powder is vital in order to use Manaphy successfully. Pokemon such as Jirachi, Clefairy, Togekiss, and Amoonguss do this well. However, Manaphy should use Safety Goggles when paired with Amoonguss; its inability to redirect moves from other Grass-types hinders Manaphy and Safety Goggles grants it an immunity to an opposing Spore. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape also provide more opportunities to set up. Pokemon that beat Water-types that wall Manaphy, such as Thundurus, Mega Venusaur, and Serperior, are also great partners. Dragon-types, such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B are good partners to Manaphy for their ability to beat some opposing Electric- and Water-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-W. They also benefit from Manaphy's ability to threaten Mega Diancie. Tailwind users, such as Talonflame, Latios, and Togekiss, make Manaphy a significantly more threatening sweeper by enabling it to outspeed Pokemon that would normally be faster than it and OHKO it, such as Virizion, Serperior, and Thundurus. Speed control can also be supplied by Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus and Jirachi. Regular or Mega Abomasnow can also be used with Manaphy to enable it to use Blizzard over Ice Beam, giving Manaphy threatening spread coverage. Abomasnow also has good offensive synergy with Manaphy, as it can threaten opposing Grass- and Water-types with its STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill suffers greatly from the presence of Landorus-T, as the two share many similarities and their few differences make the latter a more reliable pick on most teams. Excadrill's only real niche over Landorus-T is its Sand Rush ability. Sadly, this leaves Excadrill reliant on sand, a field effect that only has one viable setter in Tyranitar. Tyranitar's and Excadrill's similarities leave many holes to be filled by their remaining teammates, so the duo needs lots of support to function effectively. When granted adequate support, Excadrill is a quite threatening cleaner with high offensive stats, decent coverage, and a helpful immunity to Thunder Wave. Its access to two powerful spread moves in Earthquake and Rock Slide allows Excadrill to take full advantage of the limited turns of sand by dealing large amounts of damage to both foes. Unfortunately, if its attack fails to KO its target, Excadrill may be in trouble due to low defensive stats and a poor defensive typing that leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Ground, Fire, Fighting, and Water. If the opposing team is able to remove Excadrill's Speed advantage through speed control or a change in weather, Excadrill's pitiful defenses often prevent it from effectively using its offensive prowess.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Equipping an Air Balloon allows Excadrill to fear Landorus-T slightly less, although it loses out on the benefits that a Focus Sash or Life Orb could provide. Swords Dance can be run over Iron Head to turn Excadrill into a fearsome sweeper, but it has difficulty finding the time to set up due to its frailty and the limited turns of sand. Substitute may be used to shield Excadrill from harmful status ailments, prevent Intimidate users from lowering its Attack, and withstand attacks that it normally would not be able to. Sadly, it is difficult to justify removing one of Excadrill's attacks for it. A Choice Scarf set utilizing Mold Breaker allows it to work somewhat well outside of sand and turns its usual counters such as Rotom-W into easy targets of Earthquake. Unfortunately, this set is fairly predictable, as it is the only situation in which Excadrill would not be paired with Tyranitar, and it is outclassed by Landorus-T in nearly every way due to the latter's higher Attack, better coverage moves, and access to Intimidate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Virizion resist Rock Slide and can typically OHKO Excadrill with their Fighting-type STAB move of choice. Breloom and Conkeldurr even have the advantage of access to Mach Punch, allowing them to bypass Excadrill's boosted Speed.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types are resistant to Iron Head, won't take much from spread-reduced neutrally effective attacks such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, and can hit Excadrill hard with their Water-types STAB moves. Some notable examples include Rotom-W, which is immune to Earthquake and can burn Excadrill, and Suicune, which can also set Tailwind to remove the utility provided by Excadrill's Sand Rush.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Both Landorus formes are at worst affected neutrally by Excadrill's attacks, and they can OHKO back with their STAB Ground-type move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As a physical attacker, Excadrill is quite threatened by common methods of lowering Attack. The most common of such threats are Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Scrafty, and Will-O-Wisp users, such as Gengar and Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Excadrill needs sand in order to function at its highest capability, and opposing weather setters, such as Politoed, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Abomasnow, remove that field effect. Politoed is the most troubling of them, as Excadrill can outspeed and severely damage standard Mega Abomasnow and Mega Charizard Y sets.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Excadrill's best quality is its Speed advantage, which Tailwind setters such as Suicune and Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can remove.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: When running Earthquake instead of Drill Run, Excadrill has only Iron Head to get around a potential Wide Guard. Conkeldurr and Aegislash are especially threatening in this case, as Conkeldurr has Mach Punch to get around Excadrill's blazing Speed and Aegislash resists Iron Head.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Sand Rush Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's main Ground-type STAB attack, used for dealing as much damage as possible to the opposing team. Drill Run is a decent alternative to Earthquake that gets around Wide Guard and doesn't hit Excadrill's partner, which is often Tyranitar. However, Excadrill that are using Drill Run must watch out for Aegislash using King's Shield because, unlike Earthquake, Drill Run makes contact. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB move, which hits bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Ice-types such as Kyurem-B, with a convenient chance to flinch that pairs nicely with Excadrill's high Speed under sand. Rock Slide hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y that are immune to Earthquake and deals decent spread damage, which is especially important if Excadrill runs Drill Run instead of Earthquake. Protect shields Excadrill from attacks while its teammate deals with a threat, stalls out opposing field conditions, and gives it safety while attaining the Sand Rush boost by switching in Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Rush is Excadrill's main niche and is essential to its success. Maximum Attack and Speed investment should be used to help Excadrill hit hard and fast, thus taking advantage of the limited turns of sand. Alongside those EVs, an Adamant nature is chosen over a Jolly one, as Adamant Excadrill already outspeeds nearly everything under sand, including Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and certain Tailwind-boosted threats such as Bisharp and Volcanion. Life Orb makes Excadrill far more threatening, but a Focus Sash can be used to ensure Excadrill survives any one hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Excadrill in as soon as possible to when sand is set so that it starts hitting the foes hard with attacks backed by Sand Rush-boosted Speed. Try to avoid situations where Excadrill needs to use Protect, as this wastes a precious turn of sand. Excadrill typically works best mid- to late-game, to clean up the opposing team after it has taken some damage. Delaying Excadrill's entry into the battle gives the rest of the team time to take out Wide Guard or Intimidate users, as well as problematic Pokemon such as Rotom-W. If running Earthquake, that should be the move Excadrill uses in most cases, with the other attacks used only as needed to supplement its coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is a required partner for Excadrill to be successful, as it is the only viable setter of sand. Due to the similarity in coverage between standard Tyranitar and Excadrill sets, a lure Tyranitar set with moves such as Ice Beam and Fire Blast can help take out Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, respectively, which would normally be solid answers to the duo. Excadrill has many Pokemon that threaten to cut its rampage short, so it needs teammates that are able to take on those threats before they can cause too much trouble. First and foremost is Rotom-W, which is probably the best Excadrill answer in the metagame due to its typing, ability, and access to Will-O-Wisp. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Serperior, and Virizion can help Excadrill out here, as they also take on other troublesome Water-type threats including Keldeo and Suicune. Although Grass-types work as decent partners to Excadrill, opposing Grass-types are problematic, so teammates such as Latios, Talonflame, and Mega Gengar are solid choices. Mega Gengar is especially notable, as it is able to trap and remove opposing weather setters, ensuring that Excadrill's sand turns will not be cut short. Finally, teammates that can take on Landorus-T such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Kyurem-B are absolutely required due to its prevalence and great matchup against Excadrill. If Excadrill is using Earthquake, it needs teammates that can avoid taking damage from the attack, like Ground-immune Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus. Their Electric-type STAB moves also allow them to take on the two most popular weather setters, Politoed and Mega Charizard Y. Wide Guard support from teammates such as Conkeldurr protects Excadrill from the fairly common spread moves it is weak to, Earthquake and Heat Wave. A teammate with Wide Guard also adds another Pokemon that Excadrill can safely use Earthquake beside. Helping Hand support from a teammate such as Cresselia allows Excadrill's spread attacks to deal far more damage and take fuller advantage of the limited sand turns.</p>"

Guts also lets it get a meaningful advantage from switching into Thundurus's Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p>Drain Punch and Ice Punch are Conkeldurr's core offensive tools. Drain Punch is its main attacking option, a STAB attack that provides meaningful healing and targets Normal-types like Mega Kangashkan and Porygon2, as well as Kyurem-B, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. Ice Punch lets Conkeldurr do significant damage to Landorus-T and Thundurus, both common Fighting-resistant threats that are weak to Ice, and it also lets Conkeldurr not be totally helpless against Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Knock Off targets Mega Gengar specifically, as it deals around half to even the bulkiest of Mega Gengar sets. In addition, Knock Off also comes in use as a midground option in cases where Drain Punch and Ice Punch don't threaten to KO, as not only does it have great neutral coverage for dealing meaningful chip damage, it also boasts immense utility in removing items, such Assault Vest from Landorus-T and Volcanion as well as Amoonguss's Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Though generally not strong enough for revenge killing, Mach Punch is occasionally useful for sniping weakened foes and denying them an extra turn to be a threat. Fighting-weak threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Kyurem-B, and Bisharp, often have to fear taking too much chip damage, as it may leave them pinned by a Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, limiting their options severely. Mach Punch is also nifty in the same way for finishing off Focus Sash users such as Deoxys-A and Bisharp.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conkeldurr is best played aggressively in the early- or mid-game to match specific threats on the opposing team, leaning on its massive Special Defense, threatening damage output, and healing from Drain Punch to win out damage trades against key foes. Conkeldurr is one of the best switch-ins to Volcanion and Thundurus, for example, as Conkeldurr can reliably take their attacks and induced statuses while dealing significant damage in return, weakening them to a point where its teammates can then meaningfully capitalize. Conkeldurr is also one of the best ways to answer Mega Kangaskhan, as Conkeldurr's high base HP matches up well against Parental Bond Seismic toss, and it can just heal back its HP through a super effective Drain Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mega Gengar stands out as one of Conkeldurr's best partners. Not only does it force favorable interactions for Conkeldurr, it also virtually prevents Landorus-T from switching into the field mid-turn, as its Intimidate and resistance to Fighting make it one of Conkeldurr's biggest answers. Volcanion and Mega Salamence also make for ideal partners, as they are great offensive answers to Amoonguss, with Conkeldurr checking Thundurus for them in return.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott is the fastest Pokemon with the ability Prankster; this, coupled with its expansive support movepool, makes it a niche choice for a disrupter and Tailwind setter. However, Whimsicott has a myriad of flaws that can hold it back from performing its role in the Doubles OU metagame. For starters, Whimsicott has almost no offensive presence, leaving it able to do real damage only against targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Whimsicott's defenses are also lackluster, forcing it to equip a Focus Sash and making it tough for it to stay on the field and perform its role for more than a couple of turns. Furthermore, Whimsicott's typing is not very good defensively, as it is weak to common Ice-, Fire-, and Flying-type moves. Finally, Whimsicott is almost wholly outclassed by Thundurus and Talonflame. Thundurus also has Prankster but, unlike Whimsicott, also boasts a good typing and offenses, while Talonflame has priority Tailwind and a great offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Beat Up can set you up for a big sweep when used on a partner that has Justified, usually Terrakion, but this is a very situational play and one that many players will see coming. It also limits both Whimsicott, which could be using a more useful move than Beat Up, and the team, which might not be optimal with Terrakion, the only viable Beat Up recipient. Helping Hand allows Whimsicott to boost the power of a partner's move, but it is fairly situational and outclassed by Whimsicott's other moves. Charm is helpful for weakening the power of physical attackers and providing your other Pokemon a chance to set up against a weakened foe. It should only be used on teams that are very weak to physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan, as this move is, like most moves on this list, fairly situational. Sitrus Berry is an item option that allows Whimsicott to have some reliable recovery and avoid a notable OHKO from Mega Kangaskhan, but Focus Sash is generally preferred because Whimsicott wants to make sure it always survives strong attacks from the likes of Talonflame and Kyurem-B. An offensive set with Life Orb and maximum Speed and Special Attack investment can be used as well; the combination of Grass and Fairy coverage with support moves gives it a niche. Even with all of this, however, Whimsicott's damage output is fairly low; therefore, this set is outclassed by many of the other common offensive Grass-types, such as Serperior, Venusaur, and Breloom.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types, such as Heatran and Talonflame, resist both Fairy- and Grass-type attacks and can OHKO or do a lot of damage to Whimsicott.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types resist both Grass- and Fairy-type attacks and can take out Whimsicott. The notable threat here is Aegislash, although Whimsicott can Taunt or Encore Aegislash into King's Shield or Substitute. Other dangerous Steel-types include Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B and Mega Abomasnow are large threats to Whimsicott, and although Whimsicott can Encore Kyurem-B into Substitute, most Kyurem will just use Ice Beam on Whimsicott. Weavile can also break down Whimsicott through Fake Out and Ice Shard, which move before Whimsicott's status moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Even though Whimsicott is the fastest Prankster Taunt user in the game, it still gets shut down by a Taunt from Pokemon such as Thundurus, and without its ability to use support moves, Whimsicott is a near-worthless Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Quick Guard totally shuts down Whimsicott's targeted Prankster moves, which is most of the set's arsenal. It can still use Tailwind and attack, but without the ability to use Encore, Taunt, or Fake Tears, Whimsicott's ability to disrupt is weakened considerably.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is Whimsicott's best STAB move, which offers coverage against Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Dark-types such as Weavile, and Dragon-types such as Latios. Energy Ball is another option for a STAB attack, as it can damage Water-types such as Suicune and Rock-types such as Rhyperior. Encore gives Whimsicott the ability to lock an opposing Pokemon into an unfavorable move, such as Fake Out, Protect, Trick Room, or Substitute. Tailwind provides speed control by doubling the Speed of all allies, and Whimsicott can set Tailwind reliably at least once per game thanks to Prankster. Protect helps Whimsicott scout to see if it wants to Encore the foe the next turn. For example, if the opponent uses Fake Out, Protect can shield Whimsicott from damage and allow it to Encore the opponent the following turn. It is also useful for stalling out opposing speed control and shielding Whimsicott from damage and move disruption while its partner deals with a threat. Fake Tears can allow Whimsicott to help a specially-attacking partner take out foes it normally would not be able to, thanks to the Special Defense drop. Taunt can also be used to stop other Prankster users, most notably Thundurus, from firing off disruptive moves. It can also be used to stop support moves from other Pokemon, such as sleep moves, redirection, setup moves, and speed control.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Giving Whimsicott 216 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows it to outspeed maximum Speed Thundurus, which is vitally important because Thundurus is the most relevant Prankster Pokemon in Doubles OU. 96 Special Attack EVs make sure Whimsicott always OHKOes 252 HP Scrafty with Moonblast. If using Energy Ball, move the Special Attack EVs into HP and Defense, as there is no relevant offensive benchmark for this move. The leftover EVs are placed in HP to allow Whimsicott to take as many hits as possible. Focus Sash allows Whimsicott to survive any one hit, which makes it its best item choice because Whimsicott's defensive stats are so poor and it will often find itself at the mercy of strong and super effective attacks. Prankster boosts the priority of Whimsicott's utility moves, allowing Whimsicott to disrupt its foes before they have a chance to move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Whimsicott works well as a lead to beat opposing Fake Out users and speed control Pokemon with Encore or Taunt, or to set up Tailwind for its own team. Whimsicott can use Protect on opposing Fake Outs and then Encore the Fake Out user the next turn. Keep in mind that other players may be wary of an incoming Encore and may switch out the target Pokemon to avoid this. It is okay for Whimsicott to stay in on a strong attacker such as Talonflame if Whimsicott is at full health and desperately needs to get off a support move. Whimsicott is not supposed to be filling an attacking role; as such, it should only attack when none of its support moves would be useful or when it can take out an opposing Pokemon that is weak to its STAB attack, such as Scrafty or Gastrodon depending on your choice in STAB move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A fantastic Pokemon to pair with Whimsicott is Mega Gengar. Trapping is incredibly valuable for Whimsicott, as it can Encore or Taunt opposing Pokemon while Gengar forces them to stay in. Disable is a fantastic move on a Mega Gengar that is paired with Whimsicott, as it allows you to Encore and Disable an opposing Pokemon into one move on the same turn, forcing it to Struggle and preventing it from switching out. Pokemon that appreciate the Speed boost of Tailwind are great partners for Whimsicott, as it is very good at setting Tailwind at least once per game. Strong attackers with middling Speed tiers, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hoopa-U, and Heatran, are good choices in partners. Whimsicott needs to be paired with Pokemon that beat common Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame, as they are huge threats to Whimsicott. Landorus-T and Rotom-W do extremely well against the previously mentioned Pokemon. Steel-type Pokemon are also extremely threatening to Whimsicott. Aegislash and Mega Metagross are particularly threatening, which makes Heatran and Landorus-T great options to add to the team. If Whimsicott is using Fake Tears, strong special attackers, such as Sylveon, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gengar, benefit greatly from the Special Defense drop.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Scrafty's unique combination of Fake Out, Intimidate, and Quick Guard makes it useful as an offensive supporter. It also has great natural bulk while also having decent offensive presence with STAB Knock Off, which makes it difficult to switch into. While Scrafty's low base Speed leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, it does allow it to function well under Trick Room. Scrafty faces competition from Hitmontop, distinguishing itself with its ability to beat Aegislash reliably, but, unlike Hitmontop, it lacks access to Wide Guard or a powerful STAB move such as Close Combat. Furthermore, Scrafty's relatively low Attack stat prevents it from picking up the same KOs that other Fighting-types in the tier can, and it is also very weak to Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Azumarill, which are very common and hard to switch in to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Trick Room attacker set with Life Orb and three attacks is a viable option that allows Scrafty to take advantage of its low Speed and its combination of Fake Out and Intimidate, which makes setting Trick Room much easier. Assault Vest could be used to improve Scrafty's already nice special bulk. Other move options such as Iron Head or Poison Jab to hit Diancie and Azumarill, respectively; Ice Punch to hit Landorus-T; and Stone Edge to hit Mega Charizard Y could be considered. Super Fang or Snarl can be used to cripple switch-ins without worrying about Intimidate or a potential burn. Low Kick is an option to be used over Drain Punch to hit certain Pokemon harder but others for less damage, notably picking up an OHKO on Terrakion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Scrafty is 4x weak to Fairy and is OHKOed by the likes of Sylveon and Mega Diancie, which are also able to reliably tank both of Scrafty's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can threaten Scrafty with their powerful STAB moves, and even if Scrafty can reliably take one hit, its options to hit them back are limited.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Flying-type attacks threaten Scrafty, and Pokemon such as Talonflame can deal major damage to Scrafty, although it can block Brave Bird with Quick Guard.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As Scrafty is a physical attacker, it is threatened by potential burns from the likes of Rotom-W and Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, which lower its Attack stat, forcing it to switch in order to apply any pressure. However, Lum Berry variants are not bothered by a potential burn.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Quick Guard stops Scrafty's Fake Out, giving the foe the opportunity to attack Scrafty's partner. Scrafty is slower than most Quick Guard users, which means its Fake Out will often be blocked by Quick Guard.</p>",

Drain Punch allows Scrafty to recover health, while Knock Off provides useful utility to remove items from Pokemon and limit switches. Quick Guard shields Scrafty and its partner from Prankster Thunder Wave and Talonflame's Brave Bird as well as other priority attacks such as Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Detect can also be very useful for Scrafty, as it shields it while its partner can remove potential threats, as well as scout for attacks that may threaten it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry allows Scrafty to recover 25% of its HP, while Lum Berry can be used to absorb a status condition once, specifically burns. Intimidate allows Scrafty to weaken physical attackers and increase Scrafty's and its partner's physical bulk. Maximum HP investment and 44 Defense EVs, alongside a Relaxed nature, allow Scrafty to survive a Secret Sword from Life Orb Keldeo and also be slower than Aegislash to hit it in Blade forme, while also maximizing its general bulk. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to increase Scrafty's mediocre damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scrafty should be utilized to support other Pokemon on the team, primarily through Fake Out and Intimidate. Use Fake Out to give teammates free turns to attack or set up. Switch in frequently to utilize Intimidate and weaken physical attackers. Use Knock Off to remove the foes' items, crippling the opposing team. Avoid being burned and sparingly switch in on potential burns unless Scrafty's item is Lum Berry, although Scrafty can still be useful while burned, as its primary function is to support its team rather than attack the enemy directly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Scrafty pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate a free turn such as Substitute users and Trick Room or Tailwind setters. Steel- and Fire-types that can switch into the Fairy-type moves that threaten Scrafty are essential; some examples of these are Heatran, Talonflame, Volcarona, and Volcanion. Scrafty appreciates Pokemon that beat opposing Fighting-types; Azumarill and Mega Diancie help with both of these and really appreciate Scrafty's Quick Guard and Intimidate support. Setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Volcarona are given opportunities to set up with the combination of Fake Out + Intimidate as well as Quick Guard, which helps to shield them from priority moves that try to pick them off.</p>"

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Gothitelle carves itself a niche in the Doubles OU metagame as one of two viable Shadow Tag users, with the other being Mega Gengar. Over its fellow trapper, Gothitelle boasts better defensive stats, the immediate ability to trap, and the ability to be used alongside another Mega Pokemon. Shadow Tag allows Gothitelle to provide excellent setup opportunities for teammates, aided by its wide range of support moves such as Charm, Heal Pulse, and Helping Hand. Gothitelle also fills the role of a bulky Psychic-type Trick Room setter and general supporter, as its great support movepool allows it to assist a variety of teammates.</p> <p>However, Gothitelle faces competition in these roles from other Psychic-types such as Cresselia, which boasts far better defensive stats and more reliable recovery in Moonlight. Gothitelle's pure Psychic typing and low offensive presence leave it particularly weak to Pokemon that greatly threaten Trick Room teams such as Bisharp, Hoopa-U, Heatran, and Aegislash. Due to this, Gothitelle also faces competition from other Trick Room setters such as Hoopa-U, Jellicent, and Reuniclus, which can all alleviate some of these weaknesses. Gothitelle's poor Special Attack stat and limited coverage leave it especially vulnerable to Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt allows Gothitelle to stop Amoonguss from using Spore while also making Aegislash vulnerable and preventing Heatran from using Substitute. However, Amoonguss outspeeds Gothitelle under Trick Room, making Safety Goggles a necessary addition. Safety Goggles by itself can be used on Amoonguss-weak teams, but Gothitelle greatly misses the recovery from Sitrus Berry or ChestoRest. Foul Play allows Gothitelle to hit Pokemon with high Attack stats such as Aegislash, Hoopa-U, Mega Kangaskhan, and Landorus-T for sizable damage, but it further reduces Gothitelle's offensive presence against anything else. Colbur Berry allows Gothitelle to tank a single Dark-type attack, notably allowing it to live a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Adamant Bisharp, but reduces its overall ability to take hits. Mental Herb lets Gothitelle ignore a single Taunt, being most useful for guaranteeing Trick Room on the first turn, but it is single use and less effective than other items in most cases. Tickle is a team-specific version of Charm that reduces an opponent's Attack and Defense stats. If using Tickle, Psyshock should be used over Psychic as well due to its higher damage output after a Defense drop. Fake Tears is another great stat-lowering option to support specially offensive partners such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow while also allowing Gothitelle to OHKO Amoonguss after the drop. Thunder Wave provides Gothitelle with a great single-target speed control move for non-Trick Room teams, but Gothitelle is primarily used on Trick Room so that it can use its support moves before foes can move. Light Screen can be used but is more passive than other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Hoopa-U in particular are a problem because they deal massive super effective damage to Gothitelle, with Bisharp's Knock Off and Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury even OHKOing it, and are immune to Gothitelle's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-type Pokemon such as Bisharp, Heatran, and Aegislash take little to no damage from Gothitelle's attacks, with Heatran and Aegislash being free to use Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Aegislash and other Ghost-types such as Gengar can hit Gothitelle super effectively and are also free to switch out of Gothitelle's Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Gothitelle's lack of direct offensive presence and reliance on support moves leaves it particularly vulnerable to Taunt, although it can still hit some Taunt users, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, for decent damage. Taunting Gothitelle before it can set Trick Room turns it into a liability due to its low Speed and minimal offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Sleep-inducers such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Venusaur can prevent Gothitelle from setting Trick Room. Safety Goggles can block Sleep Powder and Spore, however, and Gothitelle can take them out with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out: Opposing Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can stop Gothitelle from setting Trick Room on the first turn.</p>",

        "name": "Trick Room Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Gothitelle's strongest STAB move, dealing sufficient damage when hitting super effectively but not too much otherwise. Trick Room allows Gothitelle and other slow Pokemon to take advantage of moving first for a few turns. Gothitelle has a wide range of support options that are effective on this set, with Helping Hand being the best option for strengthening a partner's attack. Alternatively, Charm allows Gothitelle to greatly weaken opposing physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T, making them trapped liabilities for teammates to take advantage of. Heal Pulse is another defensive support option that heals Gothitelle's partner by a good amount. Protect is a vitally important move in Doubles, allowing Gothitelle to avoid an attack or Taunt while its partner takes care of the threats. Omitting Protect for another support move can, however, be a viable option on certain teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Sassy nature with maximum HP investment and 56 Special Defense EVs ensures Gothitelle will survive a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon. Sitrus Berry and 160 Defense EVs allow Gothitelle to survive two Brave Birds from Adamant Life Orb Talonflame from full HP. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to help patch up Gothitelle's middling power and guarantee the 2HKO on standard Relaxed Amoonguss. 0 Speed IVs help Gothitelle to move first under Trick Room. Sitrus Berry offers limited recovery, allowing Gothitelle to stay on the field and provide support for longer. A ChestoRest strategy, with Rest being used over Protect, is another option to help Gothitelle instantly restore back to full health, allowing it to recover the damage taken when first setting Trick Room so that it can be more easily set again later in the match. However, this does force Gothitelle to lose Protect or a second support move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gothitelle is best used mid-game, when it can come in on Pokemon that threaten its team to trap and either KO or significantly weaken them. Getting Gothitelle onto the field via U-turn or free switches in particular helps conserve its precious HP and ensures that the opponent cannot switch out predicting a Gothitelle switch. After Trick Room is set, Gothitelle should mainly be using a support move or Protect unless it has trapped Pokemon such as Amoonguss that you really need to attack with it. Gothitelle. If Gothitelle is running Charm, it should try to trap the opponent's physical attackers and use Charm to render them dead weight, giving Gothitelle and its teammates a chance to set up, attack, or set Trick Room safely. Even if Gothitelle is low on health or crippled by status such as sleep, Shadow Tag is still great utility, and through the use of Protect and switching out if need be, as the opponent cannot hard switch out even on a turn when Gothitelle leaves the field, it can still be a great asset to its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out users such as Scrafty and Hariyama help Gothitelle to set Trick Room. Fighting-type Fake Out users can also hit the Dark- and Steel-types that trouble Gothitelle, such as Aegislash, Heatran, Bisharp, and Hydreigon, for super effective damage. Scrafty, as well as other Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, also helps patch up Gothitelle's weaker Defense stat. In combination with Shadow Tag, these Pokemon can also be used for Intimidate shuffling to severely weaken the opponent's physical attackers. Gothitelle also appreciates partners that can remove Pokemon that give it trouble, such as Dark-types, Heatran, and Aegislash, with good options including Mega Camerupt, Hoopa-U, and Scrafty, which all work well under Trick Room as well. Strong Trick Room attackers such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow can take advantage of the reversed move order and appreciate the support provided by Gothitelle. In particular, Gothitelle can trap Fire-types such as Heatran for other teammates to KO, giving Abomasnow a better time.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Azumarill, and Volcarona all appreciate the benefits of Shadow Tag, as Gothitelle can trap foes that provide easy setup opportunities and can also help remove or significantly weaken threats to the setup user, such as by trapping Talonflame for Volcarona to attack unhampered. Using Heal Pulse is very effective for supporting these Pokemon's setup, with Azumarill especially appreciating the recovery due to Belly Drum's health cost. Weather setters such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Charizard Y, and Politoed all receive large benefits from Gothitelle's ability to trap the opponent's weather setter and so win the weather war. This is particularly important for sun versus rain matchups, where the dominating weather can easily determine the winner of the match.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is one of the best supporting Pokemon in Doubles, with the ability to control momentum through redirection and immobilization tactics. Access to Rage Powder lets Amoonguss redirect dangerous attacks away from its partner, and with the help of Regenerator and its great defenses, Amoonguss can afford to take lots of hits. In addition to this, Amoonguss has great defensive typing, resisting common attacking types like Water, Fighting, Electric, and Fairy, which allows it to check big threats like Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Terrakion. Amoonguss is especially valuable because it works during any period of the match and is rarely dead weight. Even in the rare situation where Amoonguss isn't useful, it regains health by switching out. Thanks to Spore and its low Speed, Amoonguss works especially well both as a check to Trick Room teams and as a member of Trick Room teams, usually moving first and putting foes to sleep without the threat of Sleep Clause. Although Amoonguss has a lot going for it, it has very little offensive presence, so it needs to be partnered with an offensive Pokemon in order to do its job. Amoonguss also struggles against opposing Grass-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb can be used over Giga Drain for a better matchup against Grass-types like Breloom, but that makes Amoonguss lose both the possibility of recovery and its great matchup against bulky Water-types like Suicune. Foul Play can be used over Giga Drain to punish physical attackers like Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan more effectively, but it's very situational. Sunny Day further improves Amoonguss's matchup against rain teams, and can help out a partner such as Heatran by giving its Fire-type attacks a boost. Protect can be forgone in favor of one of the above attacking moves considering Amoonguss can likely take whatever attacks it would be avoiding anyway, but this leaves it much more vulnerable, especially when it is revealed that Amoonguss doesn't carry Protect. Mental Herb can stop Taunt from ruining Amoonguss's day, but it's single use and typically not enough to outweigh the benefits of Sitrus Berry. Black Sludge can be used for turn-by-turn recovery, but due to Doubles OU's fast-paced nature, Amoonguss is rarely on the field long enough for it to provide more healing than a Sitrus Berry. If your team has particular trouble with Fire-types or Flying-types, Amoonguss can run an Occa Berry or a Coba Berry to gain the ability to survive one attack and, usually, put the foe to sleep. However, these are fairly specialized items, and Rocky Helmet or Sitrus Berry generally proves more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Mega Charizard-Y and Heatran can deal massive damage to Amoonguss and are able to effectively ignore Rage Powder thanks to Heat Wave. Mega Camerupt can underspeed Amoonguss under Trick Room and take it out.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B and Weavile can take out Amoonguss with their respective Ice-type moves, the former also able to set up a Substitute on Amoonguss for free.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Hoopa-U, Deoxys-A, and Mega Metagross are all capable of hitting Amoonguss hard with a super effective STAB move, the first two strong enough to nab the OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Talonflame can hit Amoonguss hard with both of its STAB moves and has a good chance of OHKOing.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon are immune to Spore and Rage Powder and take little damage from Giga Drain. However, they are typically hardpressed to do much to Amoonguss themselves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Taunt shuts down Amoonguss's main functions on the field, preventing it from using Spore, Rage Powder, or Protect. Substitute blocks Amoonguss's Spore, and the two most common users, Heatran and Kyurem-B, can do lots of damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attacks</strong>: Even if they don't do much damage to Amoonguss, spread moves prevent it from redirecting attacks. Some examples include Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm, and Landorus-T's Rock Slide. Spread utility moves like Icy Wind and Snarl also hurt Amoonguss's partner's effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Safety Goggles and Overcoat: Safety Goggles users such as Cresselia and Jirachi and Pokemon with Overcoat such as Reuniclus are immune to Spore and Rage Powder, and most of them take little damage from Amoonguss's attacking options.</p>",

        "name": "Rage Powder",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rage Powder removes offensive pressure from Amoonguss's partner, allowing it to attack an opposing threat or set up without worry of taking damage. Spore puts a foe to sleep, immobilizing it and reducing the two-on-two scenario to two-on-one. Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to not entirely be Taunt bait and allows it to check Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Terrakion. It also restores some health, which is great for such a defensively oriented Pokemon. Protect allows Amoonguss to scout for attacks or protect itself when you predict a double target.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet is used in order to punish physical attackers, dealing damage with every hit. This is especially nice against Mega Kangaskhan, against which it deals twice as much damage due to Parental Bond, and Focus Sash users that make contact like Breloom, Bisharp, and Terrakion, as it breaks their Focus Sashes. A Sitrus Berry can be a useful alternative on Amoonguss, giving it more health to work with against any attack that does not outright KO it and allowing it to use Rage Powder more freely. 252 HP and 172 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature allow Amoonguss to always survive a Jolly Mega Metagross's Zen Headbutt. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to help Amoonguss survive attacks such as a Kyurem-B's Ice Beam. A Speed-decreasing nature and a 0 Speed IV are chosen to give Amoonguss a better Trick Room matchup, and with a base Speed stat of 30 it isn't going to be outspeeding anything outside of Trick Room anyway. An alternate spread of 240 HP / 216 Def / 52 SpD and a Sassy Nature allows Amoonguss to withstand standard Mega Gardevoir's Psychic, which has a chance to OHKO the listed spread. Amoonguss often gets low on health amidst redirection and switching into attacks for the team, but Regenerator allows it to maintain its HP by healing a third of its health when it switches out. This enables Rocky Helmet Amoonguss in particular to have reliable ways to recover health even though it lacks a Sitrus Berry.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Amoonguss is fairly straightforward; use Spore against Trick Room setters that aren't immune to it, on predicted switches, and while Amoonguss's partner is protecting itself. Use Giga Drain when Amoonguss has been Taunted or when it is super effective and Amoonguss's partner isn't in danger. Use Protect against Fake Out or if the opponent is likely to double target Amoonguss and your other Pokemon can knock out one of the threats. Otherwise, use Rage Powder to redirect non-threatening moves to Amoonguss and allow its partner to move safely, whether it be setting up or attacking. Keep in mind, however, that Rage Powder and Spore do not affect Grass-types, Safety Goggles users, and Pokemon with Overcoat. Amoonguss works well throughout the match, neutralizing big threats with Spore early-game, aiding setup and better positioning during the mid-game, and easing the pressure on its teammates during cleanup in the end-game. Keep in mind that switching Amoonguss out of a dangerous situation has the benefit of restoring its health, so if Amoonguss is highly pressured and a safe switch is available, switching out is often the best option.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss struggles to take multiple super effective hits and appreciates teammates that can hurt threats like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gardevoir, and Talonflame. Pokemon with Rock-type attacks can hurt the Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type Pokemon that scare Amoonguss, so Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie are all good choices. Amoonguss also helps them in return by redirecting Hydro Pumps, Close Combats, Flash Cannons, and any non-STAB Grass-type moves. Amoonguss does a great job at aiding setup, so boosting Pokemon that don't share its weaknesses, such as Azumarill, have a much easier time with Amoonguss on the field. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B have a much easier time getting up a Substitute with Amoonguss around to redirect attacks. Amoonguss works extremely well under Trick Room with its low Speed stat, so Trick Room attackers make for great partners. For example, Mega Camerupt removes the Grass-types that shut down Amoonguss while Amoonguss returns the favor against Water-types. In a similar vein, Cresselia, Hoopa-U, and Jellicent help Amoonguss by setting up Trick Room and beating threats to its success. Amoonguss has almost no offensive presence itself, so it needs partners that can pressure the opposing team offensively. Thus, any offensively oriented pokemon that doesn't share too many weaknesses with Amoonguss is a good teammate.</p>"

With its combination of good bulk, a strong typing, and Water Absorb, Jellicent can switch into and wall quite a few Pokemon. Access to Cursed Body allows it to disrupt opposing attackers effectively. Jellicent fits best on Trick Room teams, as its Ghost typing prevents it from getting hit with non-Scrappy Fake Out, allowing it to set up Trick Room more easily. Moreover, Jellicent is capable of taking on a fair portion of the metagame such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and other physical attackers. It also completely walls most Water-type Pokemon, such as Keldeo. On the downside, while Jellicent has good special bulk, it's held back by its mediocre physical bulk. It also has no real offensive presence even with Hydro Pump or Water Spout.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Ball could be used as a surprise option to assist with teams weak to Aegislash. Water Spout is a cool option due to the possible damage output, but it could potentially useless, as Jellicent may be required to repeatedly use Recover just to put out near-respectable damage, wasting Trick Room turns. Jellicent is also bulky enough to use Disable, being able to take a hit and potentially take away the foe's best move. Hex is a good Ghost-type STAB move in combination with Will-O-Wisp. Blizzard is another move that can be utilized in conjunction with Abomasnow, but should not be used outside of that. Leftovers improves Jellicent's durability should it have to stall out the opposing team. Mental Herb is an option to bypass Taunt once and be guaranteed to set up Trick Room. Colbur Berry can also be used to take Knock Off easily before burning the Knock Off user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W are all able to 2HKO Jellicent, while Jellicent cannot do much in response.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Mega Venusaur is a hard counter to Jellicent, as the best it can do is burn Mega Venusaur and stall for one or two turns if forced to stay on the field, and Breloom can significantly damage Jellicent with Bullet Seed. Amoonguss can take any attack from Jellicent handily and punish back with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon: Aegislash at least Speed ties with Jellicent and 2HKOes it, while the best Jellicent can do back is burn Aegislash and possibly stall it. Gengar can hit Jellicent hard with Shadow Ball and Taunt it to prevent Trick Room from going up.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Darkrai also fare very well against Jellicent, with Hydreigon walling it entirely. Bisharp completely counters Jellicent with its only option being to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, but Jellicent will usually not be able to do so. Hoopa-U can OHKO Jellicent through Protect as well.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y can reduce the power of Jellicent's Water-type moves and 2HKO it with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: When Taunted, Jellicent will only be able to use damaging moves, preventing it from performing its main role of setting up Trick Room.

Scald can prove to be a viable option for teams that are especially physically frail or lack Intimidate users, as a Scald burn will cripple any physical attacker. Will-O-Wisp also neuters physical attackers and gives Jellicent an option to counteract Sucker Punch. Recover assists with keeping Jellicent healthy in the long run, which also helps it stall out the opposing team if necessary.

Recover is useful for stalling out and baiting hits continuously. Protect is used primarily to scout out the opponents moves, as well as double targets, allowing Jellicent's partner to handle opposing Pokemon. With the combination of its Water typing, Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and possibly Water Absorb, Jellicent is capable of walling a fair portion of the metagame, particularly Fighting- and Water-types. Cursed Body is useful as well, as it can disable a foe's primary attack and heavily shift momentum in your favor. Safety Goggles are used as a way to safely set up Trick Room against opposing Spore-users, in particular Amoonguss which is a common check to Trick Room. A Sitrus Berry can be used as means to recover HP and can allow Jellicent to live an extra attack, which can often swing the course of a battle.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jellicent is best used as a lead Trick Room setter, as most Pokemon cannot use Fake Out on it, which allows it to set up Trick Room easily. Due to its bulk and typing, Jellicent is a great stop to Mega Kangaskhan; it can also deal with other important threats before committing to stalling out the opposing team. If using Amoonguss as a sleep inducer, be conscious about whether it would be more effective to burn the foe or put it to sleep. If using Cursed Body, don't be afraid to use Recover liberally in order to disable key moves. Will-O-Wisp thwarts Mega Mawile's and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, making them significantly less threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Scrafty offer Fake Out support, which makes it much easier for Jellicent to set up Trick Room. Mega Camerupt takes advantage of both Trick Room and Jellicent's Water Absorb quite well, with Trick Room capitalizing on its extremely low Speed and Water Absorb covering its 4x weakness to Water. In return, Mega Camerupt can take out Grass-types that would otherwise threaten Jellicent. Hoopa-U is a cool team option to beat Aegislash. It also helps out Trick Room teams with its ability to break through foes that use Protect. Ferrothorn is a great partner that forms a nice Fire / Water / Grass core with Mega Camerupt that's fairly hard to take down. Both Rhydon and Rhyperior provide great physical bulk, helping make up for Jellicent's low Defense. They can also redirect Electric-type moves for Jellicent with Lightning Rod, and they can beat most Electric-types save for Rotom-W effortlessly. In return, Jellicent provides them with an amazing Water-type switch-in and can patch up their terrible Speed with Trick Room. Sylveon benefits from Will-O-Wisp with its poor Defense and helps against all Dark-type Pokemon, which are pretty threatening to Jellicent. Diancie can beat foes such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus, can be a secondary Trick Room setter to ease Jellicent's load, and beats Dark-types. Redirection from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Togekiss can buy free turns in order to set up Trick Room and spread Will-O-Wisp. Both of them also provide useful resistances such as Grass and Electric with Amoonguss and can offensively threaten Pokemon that Jellicent struggles with, with Togekiss beating Grass-types and Amoonguss wrecking Water-types. Mega Abomasnow works well under Trick Room and has good defensive synergy with Jellicent, dealing with Grass-types while Jellicent takes on Fire- and Fighting-types. If Jellicent is used on a full Trick Room team, it is nearly always recommended to bring a second Trick Room setter, such as Cresselia.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn serves well as a bulky attacker that's capable of checking multiple top-tier threats. Thanks to its nifty defensive typing and high bulk, Ferrothorn adds defensive value to a team by being able to check Mega Kangaskhan, Azumarill, Mega Diancie, Latios, and the rain archetype, while its ability Iron Barbs lets it apply chip damage on contact attackers, the main example being Mega Kangaskhan. Ferrothorn also poses a decent threat as an attacker thanks to its respectable Attack stat and powerful STAB attacks in Power Whip and Gyro Ball. Its low Speed is a mixed bag; it makes Ferrothorn a notable threat under Trick Room but leaves it the slowest Pokemon in the entire metagame outside of it. Moreover, Ferrothorn has a glaring weakness to Steel- and Fire-types, as it can't threaten them with any attack, making it setup bait for Substitute users such as Heatran and Aegislash; also, its 4x weakness to Fire leaves it easily forced out by the numerous Fire-types in the metagame such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcanion, and Heatran.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can be useful in order to secure some KOs and put intense pressure on Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Lum Berry can be nifty to let Ferrothorn absorb status once, being useful in particular when trying to KO Rotom-W with Power Whip without getting burned. Chople Berry can be useful to take a Fighting-type attack once, letting it match up well against the likes of Keldeo and Conkeldurr. Knock Off lets Ferrothorn provide some utility by removing items.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran OHKO Ferrothorn while also walling it. Heatran in particular can easily set up a Substitute against it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and the aforementioned Heatran wall Ferrothorn entirely. Both Heatran and Aegislash can easily set up a Substitute on Ferrothorn. Some Steel-types, such as Jirachi, do little back, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Conkeldurr can deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Both Intimidate and burns from the likes of Landorus-T, Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Gengar limit Ferrothorn's offensive presence, with burns also inflicting passive damage that limit Ferrothorn's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Heatran and Aegislash can easily set up Substitutes against Ferrothorn, as it has no way of breaking them with its attacks. Substitute also blocks Leech Seed, potentially making Ferrothorn waste a turn.</p>",

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Power Whip and Gyro Ball are Ferrothorn's STAB attacks; the former has better coverage and reliable damage output, while the latter is useful for hitting Dragon-types such as Latios and Kyurem-B, Mega Diancie, and other speedy threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Gengar. Thunder Wave can be used over Gyro Ball to cripple fast threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Latios, and Hydreigon, which would allow Ferrothorn's partners to deal with them more easily. Leech Seed allows Ferrothorn to slowly whittle down foes while gaining valuable recovery; this applies pressure and makes Ferrothorn harder to KO. Protect allows Ferrothorn to position and defend itself while letting a partner take out threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and 80 Defense EVs allow Ferrothorn to survive a Close Combat from Virizion or two Mach Punches from Breloom. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack, which, in conjunction with a Brave nature, maximizes Ferrothorn's offensive presence. 0 Speed IVs should be used in order to maximize Gyro Ball's damage output and make Ferrothorn's matchup against Trick Room better. Leftovers is used in order to boost Ferrothorn's longevity with passive recovery, making it harder to take down, especially if Leech Seed is also in play. Rocky Helmet is also a useful item, allowing Ferrothorn to punish contact attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan harder than it would with just Iron Barbs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ferrothorn should be picked mostly for its ability to supplement the defensive backbone of any team with its wide array of resistances and high bulk. It excels at switching into physical attacks, particularly those that make contact because of its Iron Barbs ability, which enables it to punish attackers like Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill, especially if it's using Rocky Helmet. Ferrothorn also works well as a pivot, being useful for taking a hit as necessary for its team. Once opposing Fire- and Fighting-types have been dealt with, Ferrothorn can function as a wincon by simply stalling out foes with Leech Seed and Protect, generally healing more HP than it is losing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that have trouble against Water-types such as Mega Diancie and Heatran appreciate Ferrothorn's ability to deal with them with ease. Teammates that can deal with opposing Fire-types are good to have; Water-types such as Keldeo, Volcanion, and Politoed can take out most Fire-type threats, with the latter even bringing rain to neuter them, while Landorus-T can take Fire-types out with either Earthquake or Rock Slide. Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Volcanion, as well as Landorus-T, are also handy to have in order to take out the Steel-types that wall Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to an excellent ability, high Attack, and dangerous STAB moves, Bisharp has no problem threatening opposing teams. Defiant is one of the best abilities in the metagame because it punishes common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados for switching in, as well as letting Bisharp take advantage of moves such as Icy Wind and Snarl for free Attack boosts. Knock Off makes Bisharp very difficult to switch into while dealing large amounts of damage, and Sucker Punch lets it take out frailer Pokemon and helps compensate for its middling Speed. While Bisharp does suffer from frailness coupled with weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, these issues are not enough to stop it from being an excellent attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Low Kick is an option over Iron Head to hit Heatran super effectively, but other than that, Iron Head is better. Also, Swords Dance is an option, as it makes Bisharp even more threatening, and the boosts can't be lowered by Intimidate thanks to Defiant. The listed set is by far the most generally effective one on Bisharp, though, so one should be wary of deviating from it. Choice Band is an option to make Bisharp's attacks even more devastating, but being locked into a move can make Bisharp easy to take advantage of. Choice Scarf is also an option to surprise people expecting a slower set with a powerful hit. Stone Edge is notable on such sets to OHKO Mega Charizard Y, which expects to outspeed and OHKO Bisharp. Lum Berry can be used to cure burns that would cripple Bisharp, but a Life Orb is typically more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr can easily OHKO Bisharp. Mach Punch users such as Conkeldurr and Breloom are especially threatening because they can hit Bisharp before it can use Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona can all OHKO Bisharp with Heat Wave, although they have trouble switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Pokemon that commonly carry Will-O-Wisp, such as Rotom-W and Talonflame, can neuter Bisharp's offensive presence by burning it, although they might take heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Faster Pokemon with Substitute such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can potentially be good Bisharp checks, as Substitute lets them play around Sucker Punch as needed.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is notable for being both more powerful and more reliable than Sucker Punch while also stripping opposing Pokemon of their items, making Bisharp hard to switch into. Sucker Punch is for Pokemon that outspeed Bisharp, allowing it to pick them off before they can strike. However, the fact that it fails when the opponent isn't attacking makes it easier to play around than Knock Off, so when facing a Pokemon that Bisharp outspeeds, it's usually safer to go with Knock Off. Iron Head is a secondary STAB attack that's mainly used when Bisharp encounters something that resists its Dark-type attacks or you're relying on a flinch. Protect is used to shield Bisharp from damage, which is especially useful because a strong attack will often put it out of commission.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb is chosen to augment Bisharp's already high Attack to deal as much damage as possible, making it into an even more threatening attacker. The EVs give Bisharp as much power as possible, with an Adamant nature chosen over Jolly because Bisharp doesn't really need the extra Speed. Defiant allows Bisharp to get free Attack boosts from users of the very common Intimidate and Icy Wind. Focus Sash is an option because Bisharp has a lot of weaknesses and isn't very bulky.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bisharp makes for a great Trick Room check because it can hit most Trick Room setters super effectively, KOing them before they can set it up. Sucker Punch should be used to pick off fast, frail threats on the opposing team. However, if Bisharp outspeeds a Pokemon and you want to use a Dark-type attack, go with Knock Off, as it's more powerful and reliable. If there are other Pokemon on your team that dislike Intimidate, using Bisharp to dissuade the opponent from switching in their Intimidate users is a good idea. Try to avoid letting Bisharp take any hits it doesn't need to, as its frailness coupled with Life Orb recoil means that any extra hits will hamper its effectiveness. It can be a good idea to save Bisharp for late-game so it can clean up weakened teams with high-powered Sucker Punches. While this play can be risky, it's possible to switch Bisharp in on a predicted Icy Wind, Electroweb, or Snarl and get a +2 Attack boost from Defiant while taking very little damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate Bisharp's ability to threaten Intimidate users. Psychic-, Fairy-, and Ghost-types such as Togekiss, Latios, and Gengar make for good partners because they can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Bisharp. Slower Pokemon such as Amoonguss appreciate that Bisharp can check faster threats with Sucker Punch. Faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Keldeo like having Bisharp around because it can threaten most Trick Room setters. Terrakion also makes a particularly good partner because it can threaten Mega Charizard Y and Heatran, both of which can KO Bisharp. Similarly, Mega Diancie can OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Heatran while also threatening the Fighting-types that Bisharp fears, and appreciates Bisharp's ability to keep Landorus-T from switching in. Partners that can redirect powerful hits for Bisharp such as Togekiss or Amoonguss are good to have. Amoonguss also appreciates how Bisharp can threaten the Psychic-types that prey on it, and it has Spore to put a threatening Pokemon out of commission. Speed control from a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Cresselia, or Talonflame is useful because Bisharp is even more threatening when it doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to handle faster Pokemon. Flying-types such as Talonflame make for good partners to Bisharp because they can decimate Fighting-types. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash are good partners because they can shield Bisharp from Heat Waves and Earthquakes that would otherwise KO it.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon packs a great Special Attack stat which ties in nicely with its vast array of coverage choices. Hydreigon's Dark typing sets it apart from other Dragon-type Pokemon, as it can handle Pokemon such as Cresselia, Aegislash, and Bisharp better. Hydreigon can also support its team with Tailwind. Levitate makes Hydreigon immune to Earthquake, which, in conjunction with its typing and decent natural bulk, gives it quite a few switch-in opportunities. The biggest drawback to Hydreigon is its base 98 Speed. Because of it, Hydreigon finds itself slower than a variety of common offensive threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard X, and Terrakion, so its team needs more speed control. Another drawback is the Special Attack drop caused by using Draco Meteor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chople Berry can be used to lure Pokemon like Terrakion and Keldeo, whilst Haban can be used to handle faster Dragon-type Pokemon. Focus Blast hits Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, as well as Steel-types, though its low accuracy can prove to be problematic. Hydreigon can use Thunder Wave to cripple switch-ins and support its teammates. With Substitute, Hydreigon can become a problematic threat; however, the loss of coverage and team support makes this undesirable. With a Choice Scarf, Hydreigon can act as a pivot with U-turn and snipe Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios with Draco Meteor. Flamethrower is a weaker but more accurate option over Fire Blast, and Heat Wave, despite being the weakest of the three, can be used to hit both opponents. Flash Cannon and Iron Tail hit Fairy-type threats super effectively. Through the use of Choice Specs, Hydreigon can boost its damage output to very high levels and break bulky Pokemon much more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon easily tear through Hydreigon. Azumarill is a notable example as it resists all of Hydreigon's common attacks and can OHKO it with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Faster Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Salamence can take Hydreigon out with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Bulky Fighting-types such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Hitmontop can sponge a hit and OHKO back, whilst faster Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster threats with super effective coverage, such as Mega Diancie, Latios, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, can easily force out Hydreigon. Having a lower Speed puts Hydreigon at risk from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Volcarona as well.</p>",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is an extremely powerful attack that can hugely dent, if not outright KO, opposing Pokemon. This move should not be used randomly, though, as Hydreigon will almost certainly have to switch out after this move has been used due to the Special Attack drop. Dark Pulse is a weaker secondary STAB move that hits common Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowbro for super effective damage. Unlike Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse has no drawbacks, so it can be used repeatedly, allowing Hydreigon to stay in for longer. Fire Blast has good coverage with Dragon-type attacks, hitting bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur. Earth Power is another option for the third slot. Although it has slightly less Base Power, it hits Steel-types for super effective damage, nails Diancie on the switch, and deals more damage on average due to higher Base Power and better general coverage than Flash Cannon. If your team can cover the Pokemon that Fire Blast and Earth Power are supposed to hit, Tailwind is also an option for the third slot. With Hydreigon's passable defenses, it can tank a hit and set up Tailwind, providing speed control that gives your team momentum. Protect is good for wasting your opponent's turn and for playing mind games, allowing Hydreigon's partner to strike hard and possibly net a KO while Hydreigon protects itself from the attacks of the opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Hydreigon to hit hard and fast, while the remaining 4 EVs are thrown into Special Defense. Modest is usually the better nature because it allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature can be used to Speed tie with opposing Hydreigon and allows Hydreigon to outspeed anything below base 97 Speed. A Timid nature also allows Hydreigon to outspeed Adamant Mega Kangaskhan and other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, though Hydreigon can only 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan, not to mention that Mega Kangaskhan will have a partner helping her. Life Orb allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible while still being able to change moves without switching out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon can be used early-game to KO a threat to your team with Draco Meteor, and later on it can be used to pick off opposing Pokemon with Dark Pulse and other coverage moves. If Draco Meteor deals more than 66% to the foe, use it again to net a KO rather than immediately switching out. Hydreigon performs well against bulky offense teams because of its decent bulk and high power. Common Pokemon on said teams, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, struggle to deal any meaningful damage to Hydreigon, while Hydreigon can OHKO Heatran with Earth Power and deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn with Fire Blast. Hydreigon also has a good matchup against Trick Room teams because few setters like to take hits from it. Dark Pulse hits the majority of Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Chandelure, for super effective damage, and those that aren't hit super effectively are usually 2HKOed by Earth Power. Despite Hydreigon's good defensive typing and bulk, try to only switch it in on weaker resisted hits such as Thunderbolt from Rotom-W or Thundurus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aegislash is a great partner for Hydreigon due to their near-perfect offensive and defensive synergy. Aegislash can deal with Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon, use Wide Guard to stop common spread moves such as Rock Slide and Hyper Voice, and easily switch into powerful Fighting- and Dragon-type moves such as Keldeo's Secret Sword and opposing Draco Meteor. Aegislash also beats Mega Metagross one-on-one, which is important because Hydreigon loses to Mega Metagross if it carries Hammer Arm. Offensive Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, and the previously mentioned Aegislash are good partners because they can deal with pesky Fairies that would otherwise demolish Hydreigon, and Hydreigon can easily switch in on many of their weaknesses in return. Bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn can take many hits that Hydreigon would not want to take. Just watch out for Fighting-type moves, which hit both Hydreigon and bulky Steel-types for super effective damage. Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can switch in on and demolish the Fighting-types that give Hydreigon trouble, and Hydreigon can weaken or KO most of their checks with Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse, and Earth Power in return. Mega Gardevoir can use Ally Switch as a form of redirection because it can eat up Draco Meteor and Close Combat, while Hydreigon can tank Shadow Ball and Steel-type moves for Mega Gardevoir with relative ease. Redirectors such as Jirachi, Togekiss, and Amoonguss help Hydreigon switch in for free so that it may use Draco Meteor. Landorus-T can beat Mega Diancie, can safely use Earthquake next to Hydreigon because of Hydreigon's Levitate, and has Intimidate to weaken the foes' Attack, augmenting Hydreigon's physical bulk. Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan can help Hydreigon net KOs that it would narrowly miss out on under normal circumstances. Fake Out support can also help Hydreigon set up Tailwind if you opt to run it. With Thunder Wave and Icy Wind, Thundurus and Cresselia help out with Hydreigon's Speed. Cresselia is an especially good partner due to her good type synergy with Hydreigon and her ability to set up Trick Room for semi-Trick Room teams, which Hydreigon shines on.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydreigon has spectacular resistances to a vast amount of the metagame but is normally vulnerable to chip damage if it's played defensively. Roost alleviates this problem, allowing Hydreigon to act as a pivot, repeatedly switching in on Fire-types, Grass-types, and more to soak up hits and fire back with its extremely powerful STAB-boosted attacks. Draco Meteor OHKOes even moderately bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Dark Pulse provides coverage on Steel-types, especially Aegislash, and reliability; because it doesn't force Hydreigon to switch out, it is easy to spam. Another option would be to use Dragon Pulse and Earth Power as Hydreigon's attacks for better coverage on Pokemon such as Bisharp, Diancie, and Azumarill, but then Hydreigon loses its fearsome power. Protect is a staple on any Pokemon that can afford it, thanks to its many applications.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Special Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO on 44 HP Landorus-T with Draco Meteor, an OHKO on 16 HP Mega Metagross with Dark Pulse, and a 2HKO on 252 HP / 4 SpD Cresselia if it uses Calm Mind between hits. The Speed EVs are enough to outrun Jolly Breloom and the rest of the EVs are invested in bulk. The HP hits a Life Orb number. Hydreigon needs Life Orb to get almost all of its OHKOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is used as a pivot: it can come in on a variety of bulky attackers such as Heatran and Aegislash, throw out Dark Pulses or Draco Meteors until it's forced out, and repeat. Roost should be used when Hydreigon is facing Pokemon that cannot outdamage its recovery and either are likely to Protect or are less threatening to your team than Hydreigon is to theirs. If you can avoid revealing Roost until the optimal moment, you can often get it for free and even mess up your opponent's game plan.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Roost Hydreigon is an excellent pick for teams that want to be able to repeatedly handle special Fire-types, such as Heatran and Charizard, without opening up a weakness to rain. Like Kyurem-B, Roost Hydreigon is excellent at dismantling bulky Fire / Water / Grass cores; while Kyurem-B is better against rain, Hydreigon has a better matchup with sun and Aegislash. Hydreigon has a very bad matchup against Terrakion, Keldeo, and Fairy-types and is setup fodder for Azumarill, so it's important to have partners that can patch up these weaknesses. Some good options are Aegislash and Grass-types, particularly Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Those three really appreciate Hydreigon's ability to remove Jirachi as well.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is a unique attacker because it is the only viable Quiver Dance user in the tier, which in combination with great STAB moves in Fire Blast and Heat Wave, decent coverage against Water- and Rock-types in Giga Drain, and high Special Attack and Speed enables it to be a powerful special attacker. Its Speed allows it to Speed tie with Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Gardevoir and more importantly lets it outspeed many threats, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, once it has one Quiver Dance boost. Despite its okay HP and Special Defense, Volcarona is physically frail, so it struggles against powerful physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Talonflame, even though the former can be  burned by Flame Body. Also, it has a tough time hitting Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran. Even though it has access to Giga Drain for Water- and Rock-types such as Keldeo, Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Rhyperior, Volcarona still struggles against these Pokemon unless boosted by Quiver Dance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fiery Dance can be used as Volcarona's Fire-type STAB move for another way to obtain boosts, although it is weaker than both Fiery Dance and Fire Blast. Hidden Power Ground can be useful to get a surprise KO on Heatran, but it must replace another coverage move and thus will usually be very costly. A Sitrus Berry set with a 160 HP / 16 Def / 148 SpA / 184 Spe spread for added bulk allows Volcarona to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return. Coba Berry allows Volcarona to survive Talonflame's Brave Bird, but this is usually useless considering that Volcarona has trouble dealing any damage back to Talonflame. Charcoal boosts the power of Fire-type moves without recoil, unlike Life Orb, but you miss out on some damage, especially with Volcarona's coverage move. Volcarona can also serve as a redirection user by taking advantage of Flame Body, using a set of Rage Powder / Overheat / Tailwind / Protect and a spread of 224 HP / 76 Def / 100 SpA / 108 Spe, but its offensive assets are usually too helpful to pass up. Rocky Helmet is a good option on such a set, as it synergizes well with Flame Body and allows Volcarona to somewhat make up for its vulnerability to physical attacks. However, Volcarona's physical bulk is mediocre even if invested, which makes it outclassed as a redirection user by Pokemon such as Amoonguss or Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame resist both of Volcarona's STAB attacks, which makes it Substitute bait for Heatran and fodder for Talonflame, which can KO it easily with STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can hit Volcarona for significant damage with their STAB moves. However, they have to watch out for Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Mega Diancie and Terrakion can OHKO Volcarona with Diamond Storm and Rock Slide, respectively. They have to watch out for Giga Drain from a +1 Volcarona, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: If it is using Giga Drain instead of Bug Buzz, Volcarona also has trouble hitting Dragon-types such as Latios and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Opposing forms of speed control such as Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room can be tough to deal with for Volcarona because its Speed boosts from Quiver Dance can be nullified, which makes it a less potent sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Volcarona's poor Defense leaves it vulnerable to powerful physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Hoopa-U.</p>",

        "name": "Offensive Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave is a STAB spread move that can take out two foes at the same time, which is especially useful after Volcarona sets up with Quiver Dance. Volcarona can also use Fire Blast over Heat Wave, which makes it more threatening without a boost, most notably letting it OHKO Amoonguss and having a high chance to OHKO Aegislash. The power increase relative to Heat Wave is also helpful at +1, as it guarantees that Volcarona can outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, running Fire Blast over Heat Wave forces Volcarona to forgo its source of spread damage, even though Fire Blast isn't blocked by Wide Guard. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to beat Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune while also dealing with Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Rhyperior. It is also useful for Volcarona to regain some of the HP it has lost from potential Life Orb recoil. Bug Buzz can also be used over Giga Drain if your team is vulnerable to Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon. It is also a powerful STAB move that goes through Substitutes, which helps against users such as Kyurem-B. Quiver Dance allows Volcarona to become a threatening Pokemon once it manages to set up. The Special Defense boost can also come in handy versus slower special attackers such as Rotom-W and Aegislash. Lastly, Protect is a staple move in Doubles that is used to stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room or to protect Volcarona from taking damage while its partner deals with the foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb lets Volcarona do more damage in general, notably allowing it to OHKO Aegislash with Fire Blast. Life Orb Volcarona also has a good chance to OHKO Landorus-T with Heat Wave after one Quiver Dance boost, but Lum Berry is also useful for absorbing one Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Spore from Breloom or Amoonguss, allowing Volcarona to more easily fulfill its role. While Life Orb is helpful for Heat Wave Volcarona to clean up an opposing team, Lum Berry synergizes well with Fire Blast, as the power boost isn't quite as necessary, and the extra utility helps Fire Blast Volcarona because it cannot remove two threats at once. Flame Body is useful to burn foes using contact moves that don't KO Volcarona, such as Fake Out from Mega Kangaskhan and Sucker Punch from Mega Kangaskhan and Bisharp. However, it should be noted that Talonflame can't be burned by Flame Body and many attacks that Volcarona is threatened by, such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, are non-contact moves. The given Speed investment allows Volcarona to outspeed Deoxys-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one Quiver Dance boost and Speed tie with other maximum Speed base 100s when unboosted, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Gardevoir, while maximum Special Attack investment allows it to do as much damage as possible. An alternative spread of 40 Def / 240 SpA / 228 Spe can also be run to let Volcarona survive Rock Slide from Landorus-T at -1 Attack, while still outspeeding Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl after a single Quiver Dance boost. It should, however, be noted that this spread should only be used together with Lum Berry, as Life Orb does not mesh with the defensive benchmarks well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona functions best as a late-game sweeper, and once its checks are gone it can easily set up Quiver Dance and clean the rest of the game with powerful attacks. Volcarona should always look out for opportunities to easily set up Quiver Dance, such as when the foes have trouble harming it, such as Amoonguss and Aegislash, or when teammates can support it with Fake Out and redirection moves such as Follow Me and Rage Powder. If Volcarona can take out a threat with either its Fire-type STAB move or Giga Drain, it should use Giga Drain to improve its situation going into the following turn by healing some HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out support makes setting up a lot easier for Volcarona. Common Fake Out users are Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty, and the latter can also support Volcarona by weakening physical attackers with Intimidate. As redirection support is extremely useful to allow Volcarona to obtain boosts and be effective, Amoonguss makes for a great partner, as it can support Volcarona very well with Rage Powder. Using Amoonguss allows Volcarona to set up in the face of Water-types more easily. Clefairy is an alternative Follow Me user that also helps against opposing spread moves with Friend Guard. Quick Guard users such as Keldeo and Scrafty can help against priority moves such as Thundurus's Thunder Wave, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Conkeldurr can help Volcarona because it struggles against super effective spread moves such as Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Muddy Water. Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W can take care of Fire-types, which Volcarona can't hit. Rock-types and allies with Rock-type coverage moves provide fantastic offensive synergy with Volcarona's strong Fire- and Grass-type coverage. Ground- and Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Landorus-T all help Volcarona's sweeping potential by beating Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, while Volcarona eliminates opposing Steel-types such as Aegislash. Pokemon that can beat common Dragon-types, such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, are good partners if Volcarona isn't using Bug Buzz. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W can deal with both Flying- and Water-types, which can hit Volcarona super effectively. Lastly, Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty can help Volcarona take physical hits more easily.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion's Speed, power, and coverage are very effective in Doubles. With STAB Rock-type attacks and Close Combat, it is able to maintain offensive pressure against most of the metagame, including common threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar. However, Intimidate and burns are very common in Doubles, so until those users are gone, Terrakion won't do much damage unless it lands a super effective hit. In addition, Terrakion's great offensive typing is terrible defensively, leaving it vulnerable to many common attackers, such as Scizor, Latios, and Azumarill. Many strong attacks can KO Terrakion, so one bad prediction can waste Terrakion's teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quick Attack is an option to pick off faster threats, but its damage output is severely lacking. X-Scissor is a good option to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus for good damage. Terrakion can boost its stats with Swords Dance and Rock Polish, but both sets require a lot of support to work. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf set is usable, but Terrakion doesn't enjoy being locked into one move. Lastly, Helping Hand allows Terrakion to support its teammate, but bulkier Pokemon can use it many more times.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Both the burn condition and Intimidate severely hinder Terrakion's performance in battle. Pokemon such as Rotom-W can take a hit and use Will-O-Wisp to check Terrakion. Ghost-types such as Dusclops can switch into Close Combat and take little from Rock Slide. Also, most Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T, don't take much from Terrakion's attacks, so they can easily switch in, lower its Attack, and threaten it with their super effective STAB attacks. Fortunately, Will-O-Wisp is avoidable with Substitute, but if an Intimidate user switches in before Terrakion can set Substitute up, then the damage output will be almost laughable.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash can take any attack in Terrakion's arsenal and OHKO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Psychic-type Pokemon can take both of Terrakion's STAB moves and hit back with a STAB move. Latios in particular outruns Terrakion and OHKOes with Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Speed: Many fast Pokemon can outspeed and severely damage Terrakion. Common threats include Latios, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A.  Lastly, Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf such as Rotom-W and Genesect can surprise and KO Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Trick Room strategies stop Terrakion cold, as they expose its poor defensive typing, allowing most threats to take it out before it can attack. Popular users include Cresselia and Dusclops, which have no trouble setting up Trick Room against Terrakion. Paralysis similarly cripples it because Speed is no longer its strength. Popular Thunder Wave users include Thundurus and Whimsicott, which have Prankster to hit first, and Cresselia, which cannot be broken by Terrakion. Tailwind is a good check to Terrakion, because with Tailwind up, many more threats can outspeed and KO it.</p>",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is Terrakion's main STAB move because it's a spread attack, has decent Base Power, and has a nifty flinch chance. However, Stone Edge is an option to hit threats much harder at the loss of covering both foes. Close Combat hits very hard as well, granting Terrakion the option to snipe particular Pokemon. Quick Guard is used to protect Terrakion and its ally against the many priority attackers in Doubles, including Talonflame, Bisharp, and Azumarill. Terrakion also outspeeds, and therefore blocks, every common Fake Out user in the tier bar Weavile. Substitute allows Terrakion to set up on many status inducers, making its sweep much easier. However, Taunt can be used to reliably stop Trick Room, a playstyle that hurts Terrakion badly.  Protect helps Terrakion scout for attacks, stall field conditions, and ruin double-targeting strategies.</p> <h1>Set Comments</h1> <p>Life Orb is the most reliable item because of the damage output and should be used with Substitute; the extra damage doesn't bother Terrakion much because it won't survive many hits anyway. Terrakion can use a Focus Sash decently as well to guarantee survival against any attack, but it must use Quick Guard in that set. A Lum Berry can easily fit into the set as well, as it allows Terrakion to take a Will-O-Wisp and switch into Heatran's or Mega Charizard Y's Heat Waves more reliably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The best way to use Terrakion in battle is to keep constant offensive pressure on the opponent. Use Close Combat or Stone Edge to snipe particular Pokemon and Rock Slide to get key spread damage on both foes. Terrakion is difficult to use because it is easily damaged beyond repair, so unless the damage is worth it, keep it out of play. This is why Terrakion works well as a late-game sweeper; once its threats are sufficiently damaged, Terrakion can just use Rock Slide and wipe them out. However, if a Focus Sash is being used, Terrakion can revenge kill almost any foe with little fear. Quick Guard is for situational threats, such as Prankster users and priority attackers. With a Focus Sash and Quick Guard, Terrakion makes a very good lead. Taunt should only be used when absolutely necessary, because if Terrakion uses Taunt and the foe attacks, Terrakion's teamslot is wasted. Lastly, remember that Terrakion attracts Intimidate users and faster sweepers like flies, so some smart double-switching is needed to get momentum up against these threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia is a fantastic partner for Terrakion because it can take almost every attack aimed at it, boost the power of its attacks with Helping Hand, and neuter threats such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T with Psyshock and Icy Wind, respectively. Amoonguss can dispose of key threats with its great bulk and Spore, as well as direct attacks aimed at Terrakion towards itself with Rage Powder. Azumarill is a good offensive partner because its STAB attacks threaten almost every Intimidate user that plans on switching into Terrakion. Mega Charizard Y can eliminate the Grass- and Fighting-types that threaten Terrakion. Lastly, Tyranitar and Excadrill can handle the bulky Psychic-types that wall Terrakion.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is a versatile Pokemon that can tailor its set to perform quite well in a variety of roles, both supportive and offensive, making it a premier threat in the metagame. First off, its three most common attacks can OHKO some of the most common Pokemon in the tier in Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard Y, if using an offensive set. Thundurus also has a great Speed tier to be able to take advantage of those offenses, just edging out the many base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. In addition to that, Thundurus also has access to Prankster to further assure that its status moves will precede any other moves on the field. A more bulky Thundurus set that takes full advantage of Prankster is also quite viable, using priority Thunder Wave and Taunt to disrupt the opponent's strategy. However, this set needs significant investment to become sufficiently bulky, leaving its speed and power slightly disappointing. Also, Thundurus's typing isn't doing it many favors; although the secondary Flying typing does help in removing Thundurus's weakness to Ground-type moves, it also leaves Thundurus susceptible to the quite common Rock- and Ice-type attacks. Additionally, the Flying-typing doesn't help Thundurus at all offensively, as it lacks access to any reliable special Flying-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thundurus has a vast movepool, so its set can be tailored to a team's specific needs with a variety of other options. Focus Blast, typically used on the offensive set, is Thundurus's best method of dealing with Ferrothorn and also deals significant damage to threats such as Kyurem-B and Mega Kangaskhan. On rain teams that need the extra weather support, Thundurus makes a decent Rain Dance user. Rain Dance also allows Thundurus to use Thunder in place of Thunderbolt, as Thunder gains perfect accuracy in the rain. Lastly, Hidden Power Flying is Thundurus's only reliable secondary STAB move and may be used to hit Amoonguss harder as well as nail threats such as Mega Venusaur and Volcarona. The offensive set has a few other options for its item; Safety Goggles may be used over a Life Orb on sets without Taunt, which allows Thundurus to ignore the effects of Rage Powder (usually to hit an Azumarill) and become a sleep switch-in. Alternatively, Charti Berry allows Thundurus to fare even better against Landorus-T, taking either a Rock Slide or Stone Edge with ease and retaliating with Hidden Power Ice. Equipping Choice Specs boosts Thundurus's power even higher than if it used a Life Orb, and such sets also get the bonus of being able to run Volt Switch to pivot out of bad matchups. Although Thundurus-T has a higher Special Attack stat, Thundurus has a far better Speed tier, outpacing Keldeo and Mega Diancie. Finally, a Focus Sash may be used to help Thundurus take at least one hit from fast attackers that would otherwise take it out, such as Deoxys-A and Weavile. As Thundurus also has access to Defiant, a physical set can surprise the opponent. This set uses a moveset of Wild Charge / Superpower / Knock Off or Sky Drop / Protect and a Life Orb for an item. However, such sets miss out of priority Thunder Wave and are forced to rely on Thundurus's lower Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert are immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave and commonly have ways to hit Flying-types super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Thundurus is weak to Rock-type STAB-moves from Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion and doesn't have ways to hit them super effectively unless it is running Flash Cannon. Mega Diancie has the added bonus of Magic Bounce preventing Thundurus from using Thunder Wave or Taunt, and Terrakion commonly runs a Lum Berry to shield it from Thundurus's attempts to paralyze it. Rhydon and Rhyperior even have Lightning Rod to prevent Thundurus from hitting their teammates.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Ice-type Pokemon are quite threatening to either Thundurus set, as it is weak to their STAB moves and only has Flash Cannon to hit them back. Each even has additional benefits that allow them to perform well against Thundurus: Kyurem-B has access to Substitute to prevent Thundurus from paralyzing it, Weavile outspeeds the fast set and OHKOes it with Icicle Crash, and Mega Abomasnow doesn't mind being hit by any of Thundurus's moves due to its already low Speed and Grass typing.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Thunder Wave is unable to paralyze the many Electric-types in the metagame, and some, including Rotom-H and Raikou, also resist Thunderbolt while being able to hit Thundurus with a neutrally effective STAB move of their own due to Thundurus's secondary Flying typing.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types resist Thunderbolt and typically have a way to hit Thundurus hard. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are especially notable, as they do not mind the Speed drop accompanied by Thunder Wave and are not hit super effectively by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users are especially problematic for the bulky set, although if the move is predicted, Thundurus can counter with a Taunt of its own before it is hit due to Prankster and a high base Speed.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: The only downside of Prankster is that Thundurus's status moves are blocked by Quick Guard. One of the more common users of the move is Terrakion, which can hit Thundurus hard with its Rock-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: If a foe has a Substitute, it is impervious to Thunder Wave, although Taunt can bypass it to prevent them from setting another Substitute. The main threat here is Substitute Kyurem-B, as Heatran's Substitute is easily broken by a Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thundurus's main attack is Thunderbolt, due to its decent Base Power and perfect accuracy. Flash Cannon is almost exclusively to hit Mega Diancie, although it also deals a significant chunk of damage to other Fairy-types and Kyurem-B. Thunder Wave allows Thundurus to take advantage of Prankster by slowing down fast foes and potentially immobilizing them. Sometimes, Thundurus needs coverage more than speed control, so Hidden Power Ice can be used to defeat both Landorus formes and pick up the quick KO on Salamence. Taunt is also an option in the third slot if Thundurus's team is especially weak to Trick Room or already covers the potential targets of Thunder Wave and Hidden Power Ice. Protect is a staple move in the Doubles metagame, allowing Thundurus to stall out field conditions, shield itself while its partner deals with a threat, and scout incoming attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Thundurus to take full advantage of the offensive nature of this set, with a Timid nature chosen over a Modest one in order to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. Prankster grants Thunder Wave priority, allowing Thundurus to paralyze especially fast threats, including those under Tailwind. Life Orb boosts Thundurus's power, most notably to guarantee the OHKO on Azumarill with Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Thundurus may use a Magnet, which allows it to bluff the bulky set due to the lack of Life Orb recoil while still hitting the same offensive benchmarks. However, this comes at the cost of a fair amount of power behind Thundurus's other attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Thundurus is great at applying pressure to the opposing team with its high-powered moves while also providing support in the form of Prankster Thunder Wave. This set works decently well as a lead to threaten paralysis on the fast Pokemon that tend to be chosen as leads. Another common lead is Mega Diancie, which this set outspeeds and takes out using Flash Cannon. Without any defense investment, this set is incredibly frail, and it should avoid switching in on any attacks. As this is an offensively oriented set, Thundurus should only use Thunder Wave when facing an especially fast foe, and otherwise it should just attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that struggle with Mega Diancie, such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, appreciate the presence of this Thundurus set in particular. Both Landorus formes fear the Water-types that this set can easily beat and remove Terrakion and Rhyperior to aid Thundurus. Especially for sets not carrying Hidden Power Ice, a teammate to handle Dragon-types is essential. Some common and solid choices include Mega Gardevoir, Mega Kangaskhan, and Azumarill. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape have particularly good synergy with Thundurus, as they take on Rock- and Ice-types and benefit from the removal of Flying-types. Weather-oriented teams can use Thundurus's strong matchup against Mega Charizard Y and Politoed, the two most common weather setters, to win the weather war and guarantee their desired field conditions.</p>"
      },
      {
        "name": "Bulky Thunder Wave",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt hits decently hard despite the minimal investment. Hidden Power Ice hits the Landorus formes that are immune to Thundurus's Electric-type moves. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control and general incapacitation, especially when paired with teammates that have setup moves such as Substitute, as a conveniently timed full paralysis can grant free turns to set up. Taunt prevents Trick Room, opposing Taunt, and any other shenanigans the foe might try, such as redirection and speed control. Alternatively, Protect can be useful for catching the opponent off guard, as this set typically does not carry the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread guarantees that Thundurus will survive a Mega Diancie Diamond Storm or Latios's Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. 20 Speed EVs are used to guarantee that Thundurus will outspeed positive-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Breloom. The remaining 4 EVs and a Modest nature are used to prevent standard Azumarill from being able to use Belly Drum by guaranteeing that a Thunderbolt will do at least 75%. A Sitrus Berry is typically Thundurus's best choice for an item, as the added bulk is quite helpful for improving its average defensive stats. The burst recovery provided by a Sitrus Berry allows Thundurus to better stand up to double targets or Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p>A more offensive alternative to this set uses a spread of 160 HP / 96 SpA / 252 Spe, a Timid nature, and Flash Cannon over Thunder Wave or Taunt; this strikes a balance between the two most common sets, allowing Thundurus to get both the speed and some of the bulk. The spread maximizes Speed and, using a Sitrus Berry, guarantees that Thundurus can withstand a Mega Kangaskhan's Return.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Thundurus set is a disruptor and should be used as such, only attacking when necessary or against a foe that will be hit super effectively. Thundurus's access to Prankster Thunder Wave and Taunt makes it a solid lead, able to put a damper on whatever the opponent's initial strategy may be. Unlike the offensive set, this set may act as a more direct counter to threats such as Landorus-T and Talonflame, as it can safely switch in on them due to its added bulk. If a fast attacker is likely to take Thundurus out and there are no safe switch-ins available, Thundurus should use Thunder Wave or Taunt to outprioritize most attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to its supportive nature, this Thundurus set works on a variety of teams and does not require much support of its own to shine. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can take advantage of a fully paralyzed opponent by setting up and appreciate being able to move first. Thundurus also helps out hard hitters with mediocre Speed tiers, including Mega Kangaskhan, Hoopa-U, and Volcanion. Landorus-T is a particularly good teammate, as it grants Thundurus more physical bulk due to Intimidate and enjoys the removal of Water-types. Fighting-types such as Keldeo or Terrakion beat Steel-, Rock-, and Ice-types for Thundurus and appreciate it dealing with Flying-types. They also defeat Mega Kangaskhan, which is a large threat to this set as a bulky Pokemon that Thundurus cannot hit super effectively. Rain teams appreciate Thundurus's removal of Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, as well as its access to Taunt to prevent Trick Room.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Boasting a high 145 Special Attack stat, Thundurus-T cements itself as a strong attacker in the Doubles metagame. Its capability to fire off powerful Thunders makes it a natural pick for rain-based teams. Volt Absorb lets it absorb Thunder Waves aimed at its Swift Swim partners and soak up Electric-type attacks for Politoed. However, Thundurus-T is frail, so it can't often switch in without taking significant damage. Though Thundurus-T is faster than base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan, its base 101 Speed is only decent and leaves it outrun by the likes of Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Another note is that as an attacker, it doesn't have many useful coverage options outside of Hidden Power and Focus Blast. Finally, outside of Choice sets, Thundurus-T is outclassed by Thundurus, which is faster and has more useful abilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Cannon allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Mega Diancie, but doesn't hit much else and is thus an unfortunate move to be locked into. Superpower can be used over Focus Blast for a more accurate alternative. However, it's significantly weaker, as it comes off of the notably lower Attack stat while compounding Thundurus-T's physical frailty. A boosting set with Agility can be used, as the merit of outrunning the majority of the metagame while hitting decently hard and being able to run a Modest nature is tempting. However, it doesn't find much room for setup, nor does it have the bulk to do so. Nasty Plot is another usable move that can be used to power up Thundurus-T's offensive capabilities to monstrous levels, but it holds the same flaws as the Agility set while also being outclassed as a user of the move by Thundurus. Discharge is a usable move that lets Thundurus-T ignore redirection. It can be taken advantage of as well by pairing Thundurus-T with Mega Sceptile to boost its Special Attack with Lightning Rod. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can also be paired with Thundurus-T to safely use the move without hitting a teammate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: Latios and Hydreigon can safely take any attack, even one Hidden Power Ice at full health, and KO with Draco Meteor. Kyurem-B can also take any attack except Focus Blast handily.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert can easily switch in on its Electric-type attacks and KO with an appropriate move. The former has to be wary of switching into a Hidden Power Ice, however.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: If Thundurus-T is not carrying Hidden Power Flying, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur can safely ignore or cripple Thundurus-T; in particular, Amoonguss can redirect and soak up its Electric-type STAB moves with Rage Powder, effectively making Thundurus-T a non-factor in play. Ferrothorn can take Thundurus-T's STAB attacks but has to watch out for Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Thundurus-T is outrun and easily KOed by faster Rock-type foes such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Rhyperior can KO with a STAB move while also redirecting Electric-type attacks with its ability, Lightning Rod.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: If not using Choice Scarf, Thundurus-T can easily get KOed by other users of the item, such as Landorus-T and Genesect.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Since Thundurus-T is naturally fast, Trick Room puts it at a disadvantage by making it move slower than most Pokemon, which also makes its frailty more pronounced. Cresselia can safely set up Trick Room while taking most of Thundurus-T's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: If rain is not present, Thundurus-T can't use Thunder accurately. Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard Y can change the weather to Thundurus-T's displeasure. Mega Charizard Y has to be careful when switching in, however.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is a STAB move that hits decently hard while letting Thundurus-T switch out, allowing it to function as a scout early-game and put in some chip damage. Thunderbolt is a strong Electric-type STAB move that lets Thundurus-T secure KOs and clean up late-game. Hidden Power Ice is a useful coverage move that lets Thundurus-T hit Pokemon that resist or are immune to its Electric-type STAB moves, such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T. Focus Blast covers Excadrill and Ferrothorn and lets Thundurus-T deal massive damage to Heatran and nab a KO on Tyranitar. If Thundurus-T is used in the rain, Thunder is an option to hit foes harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf lets Thundurus-T outspeed and significantly damage or KO threats it wouldn't be able to otherwise and lets it be a fast Pokemon in general; it also lets Thundurus-T function as a revenge killer when needed. Volt Absorb is useful for letting it switch into opposing Electric-type attacks and absorb them for nifty recovery. The EV investment lets Thundurus-T outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Hydreigon and gives it maximum power, with the leftover EVs put into HP. A Modest nature is used to maximize offensive potential, as Thundurus-T already outspeeds the majority of the metagame with Choice Scarf. However, a Timid nature can be used to outrun Swift Swim Ludicolo in rain, but it misses out on some power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Thundurus-T is quite fast, it can function as a lead most of the time and scout moves with Volt Switch. However, when against the threat of a Fake Out, it's best to switch out to an appropriate Pokemon. Thundurus-T can be useful to get some chip damage early-game using Volt Switch. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T's frailty means that it can't afford to not be able to switch out. It can also function as a cleaner late-game once most of its checks are gone or weakened, as its Speed can make it hard to hit while it gets KOs.</p> <p>Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to Thundurus-T's STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a Landorus-T switch-in, using Hidden Power Ice can nab an easy KO. Another example of predicting is using Volt Switch on a predicted resisted switch-in. Don't recklessly switch in Thundurus-T, since it's frail and can't really afford to take a hit. Only do so when predicting an Earthquake or an Electric-type attack is coming its way. In particular, it can be a nifty switch-in on incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates from paralysis while giving it recovery. In a pinch, Thundurus-T can function as a revenge killer thanks to its Speed, power, and coverage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the luring and removal of Landorus-T enjoy Thundurus-T as a partner. Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Terrakion appreciate being able to come in without Landorus-T neutering their Attack and forcing them to switch out. A Pokemon with Fake Out can pair well with Thundurus-T to function as a scouting lead. Mega Kangaskhan can use Fake Out while forcing some switches thanks to its strong offensive presence, which pairs well with Volt Switch. Ludicolo also has Fake Out and can take out annoying Ground-types with Hydro Pump. Since opposing Latios is a huge thorn in Thundurus-T's side, Thundurus-T appreciates partners that can consistently threaten to KO Latios. Aegislash can switch into both Draco Meteor and Psyshock and threaten to KO with Shadow Ball, while also having Wide Guard to shield Thundurus-T from opposing Rock Slide and other powerful spread attacks. Thundurus-T also appreciates partners that can remove opposing Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which can both soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type STAB moves and take a Hidden Power Ice, threatening to cripple or significantly damage Thundurus-T afterward. Kyurem-B and Talonflame can both net a KO on most Grass-types with their STAB moves, the former being notable for also being able to handle opposing Ground-types, which can soak up Thundurus-T's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners as well. Keldeo can switch in while threatening Rock Slide's major users Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch in on Terrakion. If using Thunder instead of Thunderbolt, Politoed makes for a viable partner to make said move more accurate.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is the first STAB move, which hits hard and deals significant chip damage while scouting for moves. Thunder, the second STAB move, packs a strong punch with Choice Specs and lets Thundurus-T significantly damage or KO opponents. However, it should only be used while rain is present, as it is inaccurate otherwise. Thunderbolt makes for a fine alternative, but it loses out on a notable amount of power. Hidden Power Flying hits Grass-type Pokemon troublesome to the rain archetype such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur for significant damage. Hidden Power Ice is an option to be able to hit predicted Landorus-T and Garchomp switch-ins while still hitting Amoonguss. However, it misses out on Mega Venusaur because the weakness is negated by Thick Fat. Focus Blast rounds out the moveset, covering Excadrill and Ferrothorn while netting quick KOs on Heatran and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs boosts Thundurus-T's already high Special Attack to greater levels, letting it do significant damage with its attacks; it boasts so much power that it can even net a 2HKO on Latios with Thunder. Volt Absorb lets it safely switch into opposing Electric-type attacks for recovery in a pinch. Using the given combination of nature and EV investment, Thundurus-T outruns positive-natured base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y while having maximum offensive potential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Specs Thundurus-T should only be used in rain, as it can't safely use its powerful Thunder without it. Any team without rain should be using another set instead. Thundurus-T can function early-game by dealing decently strong chip damage with Volt Switch, which is useful for letting its teammates clean later on. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T can't afford to not be able to switch out, due to its frailty. Use Thunder when you need something KOed or broken down, since it's really strong and deals significant damage even to switch-ins that resist it. It's also the move to use generally, as it's really powerful and can significantly weaken most threats. Thundurus-T can be paired with a Fake Out user such as Ludicolo to safely net chip damage and possibly maintain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p>Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to its STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a switch-in that resists Thundurus-T's other moves, use Volt Switch to maintain momentum. Use the appropriate coverage move for the threats they were meant for; use Hidden Power Flying to break down Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, and use Focus Blast to hit Ferrothorn. Finally, don't blindly switch in Thundurus-T, as it can't really afford to take a hit, due to its frailty. Only do so when predicting an opposing Earthquake or Electric-type move. In particular, it can switch into incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates, especially its Swift Swim sweeper partners, from paralysis while giving it nifty recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is an excellent partner for this particular set, as the rain it brings lets Thundurus-T fire off its monstrous Thunder with never-miss accuracy. Partners that can eliminate opposing Ground-types that may soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type moves serve well as partners. Swift Swim Ludicolo and Mega Swampert can outspeed and KO the omnipresent Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the most notable Ground-type, while being staples on rain teams in general. Keldeo can remove Ground-types as well, while also netting a KO on Ferrothorn, another thorn in Thundurus-T's side. If not running Hidden Power Flying, Thundurus-T appreciates Pokemon that can remove opposing Grass-types, which wall it. Both Kyurem-B and Talonflame can net a KO on common Grass-types with their respective super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners. Physically defensive Politoed can safely come in while threatening the move's major users, Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch into Terrakion. To patch up Thundurus-T's only decent Speed, a Tailwind setter could be a viable partner. Both Latios and Talonflame can set it while being able to take out faster threats to Thundurus-T such as Terrakion and Keldeo.</p>"

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus is able to destroy Steel-types like Aegislash and Heatran using its combination of Sheer Force, Life Orb, and STAB Earth Power. It works well on teams that appreciate Fire- and Steel-types removed, such as hail teams, as threats to hail teams such as Heatran and Aegislash are able to easily stand up to Blizzard and Giga Drain. While Landorus is able to outspeed fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon, it is threatened by Pokemon that can outspeed it and commonly carry an Ice- or Water-type move, such as Weavile and Keldeo. Also, using Landorus means you can't use Landorus-T, which can be classed as a drawback because Landorus has no defensive utility. Landorus's edge over other Ground-types is that it has access to a single-target special Ground-type move that is boosted by Sheer Force, making it incredibly powerful. Unlike Earthquake, Earth Power allows Landorus to threaten Aegislash without worrying about Wide Guard and use Ground-type coverage without worrying about hitting teammates. Landorus also doesn't suffer from a drop in power due to Intimidate or burns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus forces a lot of switches with its powerful moves, so Substitute can be used to catch opponents off-guard. Landorus has a shallow movepool and shouldn't really be using anything not listed on the main set besides that. It can also run a Choice Scarf to surprise foes such as Landorus-T, but this misses out on the compounding power behind Life Orb + Sheer Force.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon: Kyurem-B can survive a hit other than Focus Blast and OHKO with Ice Beam, and the Choice Scarf variant can outspeed and OHKO without worry. Mamoswine can OHKO with Ice Shard, and Weavile can outspeed and OHKO with Icicle Crash.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Rotom-W is immune to Earth Power and can easily survive any of Landorus's coverage moves and OHKO it back with Hydro Pump. Keldeo can OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump, while Icy Wind has a high chance to OHKO and will also drop Landorus's teammate's Speed. Politoed, Gyarados, Suicune, Jellicent, and Ludicolo can all take a hit and KO with their STAB moves. Landorus is threatened by different Pokemon depending on its coverage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon:  Mega Metagross KOs with Ice Punch, while offensive Thundurus and Raikou outspeed and OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. Darkrai also outspeeds and commonly carries Ice Beam. Latios outspeeds and OHKOes Landorus with a Life Orb-boostsed Draco Meteor. Gengar can hit hard with Icy Wind and drop Landorus's Speed, leaving it open to attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Landorus has a very poor matchup against Trick Room, as it can't do much to Cresselia, which can either take a hit and use Trick Room or attack Landorus with Ice Beam. Mega Abomasnow can destroy Landorus with Blizzard while Trick Room is up. Zapdos can take a hit and set up Tailwind, putting Landorus in a bad position, or simply OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. Suicune can get Tailwind up, use Snarl to weaken Landorus, or OHKO it with Ice Beam. In general, a lot of slower Pokemon with powerful STAB moves beat Landorus that normally wouldn't while Trick Room or Tailwind is up, as Landorus is fairly frail.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power gains a boost from Sheer Force, meaning it is able to always OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran. Sludge Bomb deals big damage to Fairy- and Grass-types, and Psychic can also hit Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage mainly used for Landorus-T. Rock Slide is another option; with the Sheer Force and Life Orb boosts, it has a chance to OHKO Mega Charizard Y, who Landorus narrowly outruns, also nailing Talonflame. On the other hand, Focus Blast can always OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and standard Ferrothorn. Protect keeps Landorus safe for the turn and stalls out opposing Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs paired with Sheer Force allow for maximum damage output. 252 Speed EVs coupled with a Timid Nature ensure Landorus outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon. The 4 spare EVs go into Special Defense. Life Orb boosts the power of Landorus's attacks with secondary effects, and Sheer Force means that Landorus won't take Life Orb recoil when using such moves. If running Rock Slide, Landorus can run a Naive or Hasty Nature in order to guarantee the OHKO on bulky variants of Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus's ability to always OHKO Shuca Berry Heatran is great, as it takes the guessing out of whether Heatran will survive and hit back or not. Landorus works best mid- and late-game when foes that can outspeed and threaten it have been removed, as Sheer Force- and Life Orb-boosted Earth Power will finish off almost anything under half health that doesn't resist it. Landorus is frail and doesn't take neutral hits well, so it is not a great switch-in most of the time. Its good defensive typing is rendered almost useless due to its frailty, and its Electric-type immunity is almost useless because most Electric-types carry Hidden Power Ice or are immune to Ground, such as Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Thundurus, and other Electric-types, such as Raikou and Choice Scarf Rotom-W, outspeed it. Its resistance to Fighting doesn't help much either, as Terrakion's Close Combat followed by a Rock Slide 2HKOes Landorus, so it can't switch in. It is vulnerable to speed control, as it likes to move first to attempt to get a KO without suffering a hit back.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross like Landorus's ability to obliterate Fire- and Steel-types with Earth Power, and they can remove Ice-types such as Kyurem-B for Landorus. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir also appreciate how well Landorus beats Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types with Earth Power. Cresselia and Jirachi can use Icy Wind or Thunder Wave to slow down a faster threat and use Helping Hand to let Landorus net a KO that would otherwise be out of its reach. Jirachi can also switch in to Ice-type attacks for Landorus. Thundurus is able to use Thunder Wave to slow threats down and Taunt to stop opposing speed control users, while Landorus beats the Electric-types that Thundurus can't. Bulky Water-types to switch into Water- and Ice-types for Landorus are appreciated. Suicune is a nice example, as it has access to Tailwind and Icy Wind and can beat most Ice-types; Rotom-W can beat Ice- and Water-types as well. Landorus can beat Grass-types for them both with Sludge Bomb. Zapdos beats Water-types and can provide Tailwind to allow Landorus to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Serperior and Breloom also beat Water-types. Mega Abomasnow appreciates Fire- and Steel-type foes such as Heatran and Aegislash being removed so that it can spam Blizzard without worrying about them switching in, so it appreciates Landorus as a partner.</p>"

Assault Vest Landorus-T acts as a soft check to the majority of the tier thanks to its power, bulk, and offensive coverage. The bulk that Assault Vest grants it cannot be understated, as attacks like uninvested Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice and consecutive Psycho Boosts from Deoxys-A fail to 2HKO it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Landorus-T's offensive coverage is virtually perfect, as it always has something it can throw at any Pokemon. Volcanion and Mega Gengar are cleanly 2HKOed by Earthquake, Talonflame is obliterated by Stone Edge, while Thundurus and Mega Salamence are 2HKOed, and Mega Kagaskhan, Porygon2, and Ferrothorn all get smacked hard by Superpower.

    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-B is a fantastic answer to defensive or bulkier teams, especially with its Substitute set. Teravolt allows Kyurem-B to bypass abilities on Pokemon that would otherwise slow it down, like Levitate on Rotom-W and Thick Fat on Mega Venusaur. It can also run a decent mixed attacking set thanks to its great offensive stats complemented by decent coverage. Due to the high number of common Pokemon that it threatens, including Amoonguss, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, Kyurem-B can find a place on almost any team. However, it is especially notable as a good choice for rain teams, considering its ability to beat bulky Grass-types and Thundurus, as well as a good choice to counter rain teams thanks to its ability to wall Ludicolo and bulky Water-types. Although it is powerful and bulky, Kyurem-B is stuck with an unfortunate Speed tier, just missing out on base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gardevoir, and Salamence. It also lacks a good physical movepool, leaving Kyurem-B unable to take advantage of its sky-high Attack stat. In addition to this, while many popular threats are beaten by Kyurem-B, it can also find itself in matchups where it is dead weight, especially if running Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blizzard can be used with hail support on either set, as it provides massive spread damage. Draco Meteor can be used on the Choice Scarf set, but the drop in power after the first use usually makes this an inferior choice. Outrage is extremely powerful and could also find a place on the Choice Scarf set, but it doesn't allow you to choose a target and prevents Kyurem-B from switching out of unfavorable matchups. Zen Headbutt could be used on the Choice Scarf set to take care of the Fighting-types that give Kyurem-B trouble, but most Pokemon that would fear Zen Headbutt are already threatened by its other, superior coverage options. Icy Wind is the only support move that could be considered viable on Kyurem-B, providing some speed control. However, it is quite weak and Kyurem-B is usually better off with Ice Beam. Roost could be used over Protect on the Substitute set for more longevity, but Protect tends to be more useful. A Life Orb set with Fusion Bolt / Ice Beam / Earth Power / Protect can act as a good middle ground between the Substitute and Choice Scarf sets, but usually those sets are more useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Substitute Kyurem-B struggles with fast Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion, which can outspeed and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can take any attack except for Iron Head and OHKO through Kyurem-B's Substitute with Hyper Voice, making them really strong counters. Mega Diancie can beat either set unless the Choice Scarf variant is carrying Iron Head; otherwise, it can take anything from either set and OHKO the Choice Scarf set with Diamond Storm or outspeed the Substitute set and 2HKO it with Diamond Storm or Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Mega Metagross takes any of Choice Scarf Kyurem-B's attacks and OHKOes it with Iron Head, as well as outspeeding the Substitute set and getting the same result. Ferrothorn resists all of Kyurem-B's attacks and can KO either set with Gyro Ball. Aegislash can handily take an Earth Power and KO with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Burns whittle down Substitute Kyurem-B's health, preventing it from lasting as long, and severely weaken the majority of Choice Scarf Kyurem-B's moves. Intimidate also hinders the Choice Scarf set's effectiveness, though much less strongly.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick oom</strong>: Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room take away the biggest draw to using Choice Scarf Kyurem-B over any other set and should be avoided or prevented if possible.</p>",

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute gives the set its name, allowing Kyurem-B to avoid status and chip damage. It also gives Kyurem-B a defensive buffer, letting it avoid the KO from threats that would normally remove it from play and allowing it to attack safely. Ice Beam gets STAB and hits Grass-, Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-types for lots of damage. Earth Power gives Kyurem-B perfect neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam, and it hits Levitate Pokemon like Rotom-W with the help of Teravolt. Protect allows you to scout for attacks, stall out field conditions such as Tailwind and Trick Room, and regain Kyurem-B's health with Leftovers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers restores health lost from creating a Substitute, allowing Kyurem-B to live longer. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature are used to deal the most damage possible, as Kyurem-B already has great natural bulk without investment. Running 148 Speed EVs allows Kyurem-B to outspeed all base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom, forcing Bisharp to use Sucker Punch instead of Iron Head and avoiding Breloom's Spore with Substitute. Note that Breloom has a chance to 2HKO with Mach Punch, so play around it carefully. The remaining 108 EVs are placed into HP to create bigger Substitutes. Another spread you could opt for would be 52 HP / 232 SpA / 224 Spe and a Timid Nature, which has the advantage of outspeeding all non-Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Modest Hydreigon. The bulk investment guarantees that standard Rotom-W sets cannot break Substitute, and while the power drop is noticeable due to the loss of Modest, Kyurem-B still hits many of the same OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem-B should use Substitute on a predicted switch or Protect, against non-threatening foes, or to avoid status, and from there it can target a threat safely behind its Substitute. When Kyurem-B has a Substitute set up, the opponent is likely to target it with both of their Pokemon on the field in order to remove the Substitute and KO it in the same turn. Accordingly, if you can predict a double target, it helps to use Protect in order to grant your partner a free turn. If Kyurem-B's checks are removed, getting up a Substitute often puts enough pressure on the opponent between its bulk and offensive presence that it almost acts as a 'win' button. However, don't feel like getting up a substitute is necessary; while it is very nice, Kyurem-B also does well without it, and sometimes getting an attack off is more important.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B can fit on the majority of teams thanks to its ability to pressure nearly everything in the metagame. That said, there are a few choices that can help Kyurem-B do its job better. Kyurem-B appreciates redirection support to help it set up Substitute. Amoonguss works well for this, as it resists the Fighting-type attacks that Kyurem-B hates and doesn't share any weaknesses with it. Kyurem-B also partners well with Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune and Rotom-W, as it resists everything they are weak to, while they threaten Rock-type Pokemon and Landorus-T, which can hit Kyurem-B for lots of damage. Mega Diancie works great as a teammate, because it checks most Dragon- and Fighting-types as well as Mega Charizard Y and benefits from the removal of Pokemon that Substitute Kyurem-B beats such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Grass-types. Landorus-T works as a good offensive partner for similar reasons to Mega Diancie, with the added bonus of beating Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power as well as providing Intimidate support to make setting up and keeping a Substitute up easier for Kyurem-B. Substitute Kyurem-B is generally a good choice for rain teams, as it beats many of the common threats to rain sweepers, such as Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss. It also fits well on sun teams, taking advantage of Mega Charizard Y's powerful Heat Waves to set up Substitutes and checking the rain teams that give sun trouble. Aegislash stands out as a good partner for Kyurem-B, because it can block Rock Slide or Diamond Storm with Wide Guard and easily switches in on Fighting- and Rock-type attacks that force Kyurem-B out.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam gets STAB and hits hard, even with only 108 Special Attack EVs. Fusion Bolt completes a pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, hitting Water-types and Mega Charizard Y super effectively. Dragon Claw is Kyurem-B's strongest STAB move available, and coming from a fully invested base 170 Attack, it hits super hard. This also allows Kyurem-B to OHKO Dragon-types that avoid the KO from Ice Beam, such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Kingdra. The last moveslot depends on your team's needs. Iron Head KOes Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, which otherwise give Kyurem-B lots of trouble. Earth Power hits Heatran and Rotom formes much harder than Kyurem-B's other options. Rock Slide provides spread damage as well as a 30% chance to induce flinch. Because Choice Scarf Kyurem-B is mostly used to pick off specific threats, Dragon Claw can be dropped from its moveset in favor of more coverage. One example of when to do this would be if the team struggles with Fairies as well as Heatran and other Steel-types, requiring Kyurem-B to run Iron Head and Earth Power on the same set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Choice Scarf, 224 Speed EVs, and a Naive nature, Kyurem-B outspeeds all Choice Scarf Landorus-T sets as well as the entire unboosted metagame. 108 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Ice Beam will OHKO offensive Thundurus sets, and the remaining 176 EVs are placed in Attack to power up Kyurem-B's other moves, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Hydreigon using Dragon Claw.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring this set in after a teammate has fallen or as a lead the majority of the time; it doesn't have nearly the bulk that other sets enjoy. Be mindful of opposing Intimidate users or burns for a few reasons. First, this set is primarily focused on physical attacks, so either one hurts its effectiveness. Additionally, Kyurem-B is a Choice Scarf user that lacks access to a pivoting move, and if the opponent pressures Kyurem-B out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or Intimidate, it will be forced to make a hard switch in order to avoid losing effectiveness. This can be difficult to do safely or without the loss of momentum. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B is fairly uncommon, so use it to net surprise KOs on Pokemon like Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Mega Diancie, which expect to outspeed Kyurem-B and deal serious damage. Keep in mind the rest of the opponent's team when attacking; if multiple different moves work to get the KO that you're hoping for, go for the move that works best against the rest of the team, as Kyurem-B will be locked into it. This is especially relevant when deciding if you should use Dragon Claw: if the opponent has a Fairy-type in the back, it's probably a better idea to opt for a different move if possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Choice Scarf locks Kyurem-B into one specific move, it often finds itself in unfavorable matchups and needs a partner to switch out to. Thus, teammates with good defensive synergy with Kyurem-B such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, Suicune, and Rotom-W work well as partners. Aegislash and Metagross also beat the Rock-, Fighting-, and Fairy-types that trouble Kyurem-B. Bisharp works well to discourage Intimidate and remove Fairy-types, which is especially useful if you opt for a fourth move other than Iron Head. This Kyurem-B set has trouble with most Steel-types, so Heatran and Mega Charizard Y can help by taking care of them. Anything that has trouble with Landorus-T pairs well with Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, as this set is primarily geared towards removing Choice Scarf Landorus-T. This includes Heatran, Mega Diancie, Talonflame, and many others.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo's unique Water / Fighting typing allows it to check many common threats in the metagame. This includes, but is not limited to, Heatran, Landorus-T, Bisharp, and Mega Kangaskhan. Keldeo also sports a very high base 108 Speed and strong base 129 Special Attack, allowing it to not only outspeed the aforementioned threats but OHKO them as well when holding a Life Orb, a rarity in this metagame. Keldeo's base 91 / 90 / 90 defenses aren't that bad either, helping it take a neutral hit or two and retaliate hard. It also has a few solid support options, including Icy Wind and Quick Guard. While all this makes Keldeo seem amazing, it does have its flaws. The Water typing which gives Keldeo such a large offensive presence also gives it a weakness to common Electric-types in the metagame, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus. While its bulk isn't bad, it is not amazing either, which, when coupled with Keldeo's reliance on its high Speed stat, leaves it vulnerable to speed control. Keldeo also has a very limited movepool, making it predictable and therefore easier to play around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Substitute set with Leftovers, where Substitute is used over Quick Guard, is a solid option, making use of the switches Keldeo tends to force to protect itself from an incoming attack. Focus Blast can be used over Secret Sword due to its higher Base Power of 120, but usually the risk of it missing 30% of the time is not worth the increase in power, as Keldeo still gets the OHKOs it needs to with Secret Sword. Stone Edge is an incredibly surprising move that Keldeo can use to hit Mega Charizard Y. It OHKOes Charizard without any investment, something that Hydro Pump cannot do when Drought is active. Helping Hand can give an ally a 50% boost in power for their next attack, which is useful if Keldeo cannot do much damage to the opposing side or has removed all of the Pokemon it needed to, though these situations rarely occur. Safeguard can protect allies from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder, and Spore. Coba Berry is a nifty item that Keldeo can make use of, as it helps it survive a Brave Bird from any Talonflame set, proceeding to OHKO it with a Water-type attack. Choice Specs is another item Keldeo can use, as it hits much harder than Life Orb without its harmful recoil effect. However, as a result, Keldeo cannot switch moves, forcing it to switch out if an opponent that resists its attacks switches in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind and Trick Room: Opposing speed control shuts down Keldeo, as its Speed is its most important trait and without it Keldeo becomes very easy to 2HKO, if not OHKO. Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room will all halt Keldeo's offensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame can come in on a Secret Sword or Icy Wind and OHKO Keldeo with a priority Brave Bird, ignoring any Speed drops. It has to watch out for Hydro Pump, however.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Latios can switch into Keldeo's STAB attacks and proceed to OHKO it with Psyshock. It must be wary of a super effective Icy Wind which makes it slower than Keldeo, though. Cresselia and other bulky Psychic-types are similar to Jellicent in that they can comfortably take multiple Hydro Pumps while hitting Keldeo with Psyshock, Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, or simply setting up Trick Room to \"slow it down\" for 5 turns, crippling Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Bulky Rotom-W can tank two Secret Swords when factoring in Sitrus Berry and deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt. Fast Electric-types such as Thunduru and Raikou can deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt / Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Trevenant, Gourgeist-S, and Amoonguss can comfortably sit in front of Keldeo as they resist both of its STAB attacks, and because Icy Wind has a very low Base Power, it will be doing very little to them. These Grass-types can then proceed to hit Keldeo with their Grass-type STAB attacks or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder or Spore.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent: Jellicent is a complete wall to Keldeo, as it is immune to both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and resists Icy Wind, and can chip away at it with Shadow Ball, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or simply set up Trick Room for its teammates.</p>",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This is Keldeo's most viable set, and it uses it very well. Hydro Pump is the chosen Water-type STAB, and it deals a lot of damage to any non-resisting opponent, of which, due to the great neutral coverage of Water-type attacks, there are many. Secret Sword is Keldeo's most reliable Fighting-type STAB attack, and it scores an OHKO on 4 / 0 Mega Kangaskhan. It can also hit opposing Water-types which resist Hydro Pump, like Rotom-W and Ludicolo, as well as hitting Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Quick Guard blocks opposing priority moves such as incoming Fake Out and Talonflame's Brave Bird, which is super effective against Keldeo. Taunt is always a useful move, stopping Protect, Spore, and most importantly Trick Room. Icy Wind is another support option here, as it gives Keldeo a spread attack that slows the opposing Pokemon down, letting Keldeo's ally outspeed them. Finally, Protect is a staple move in Doubles, as it can stall out weather conditions and Trick Room turns, as well as protect Keldeo from any attack while its partner takes its turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Keldeo simply maximizes its Special Attack and Speed because it is meant to be hitting as hard as possible and Keldeo and Terrakion speed ties are fairly common. Life Orb is the preferred item for this set, as it allows Keldeo to get several OHKOs it couldn't achieve otherwise.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo should be brought in against Pokemon that it can threaten, such as Heatran, Landorus-T,  Mega Kangaskhan, and Bisharp. However, Keldeo should not be played recklessly, and it must be brought in on an expected attack that it resists or after a teammate has fainted, or else Life Orb recoil and switch in damage will build up quickly. If Quick Guard is used over Icy Wind, Keldeo should be mainly used against Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan so its partner can attack without fear of getting flinched. It can also be used to block powerful priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, and can stop Prankster Thunder Wave, among other things. However, this often requires proper prediction, as the opponent might expect it and use an attack without priority instead, wasting your turn. If carried, Icy Wind can be used to slow down opposing threats for a partner or to hit both opponents when a Follow Me / Rage Powder supporter like Togekiss or Amoonguss, respectively, is on the field. It can also help Keldeo slow down faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T and pick them off afterwards. Once Keldeo has defeated the foes it was meant to check, it can proceed to hit everything as hard as possible. Be careful of Hoopa-U, as although Keldeo outspeeds and hits Hoopa-U hard, Secret Sword is not likely to OHKO even uninvested Hoopa-U, which can easily OHKO back with Hyperspace Hole. As long as its teammates can handle the remaining members of the opposing team, keeping Keldeo alive won't be a major issue.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because of its ability to counter multiple major Doubles threats, Keldeo can find a spot on almost any team. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Gourgeist-S make good teammates, as they can switch into common Electric- and Grass-type attacks that are super effective against Keldeo. In particular, they are great for being able to handle Rotom-W, which is probably the most common threat to Keldeo. Electric- and Rock-types are also good teammates, being useful for dealing with Talonflame and other Flying-types that Keldeo is weak to. A notable choice here is Mega Manectric. Before Mega Evolving, it has the ability Lightning Rod to draw in super effective Electric-type attacks for Keldeo. Once it has Mega Evolved, it gains the useful ability Intimidate to weaken physical attackers. It also acts as a good Talonflame switch-in, resisting its priority Brave Bird. Dark-types, such as Bisharp, make good teammates as well, handling Psychic-types for Keldeo. Those with access to Sucker Punch are particularly helpful for dealing with Latios, a very common threat to Keldeo which resists both of its STAB attacks. Fire-types that beat Pokemon like Amoonguss and Venusaur are particularly helpful, as those two resist both of Keldeo's STAB attacks too. Heatran and Rotom-H are especially effective as they also wall Talonflame, though Chandelure, Talonflame, and others are also very effective. Rage Powder / Follow Me support from Amoonguss or Togekiss is a useful asset to Keldeo, redirecting particularly threatening attacks and helping it stay around for longer to check the Pokemon it needs to.</p>"

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect is a great Pokemon in the Doubles metagame, as it's considerable for building its team's momentum thanks to a powerful U-turn. Download can provide Genesect with offensive presence once it has switched in, but Genesect has no way to control the chances of getting the boost it requires. Genesect can be very vulnerable to attacks when running Choice Scarf, as it can make Genesect Choice-locked into a poor move that gives certain opposing Pokemon a free switch in, such as Fire-types switching into Ice Beam. While Genesect isn't too flexible, it can use items besides Choice Scarf, but they give Genesect an odd Speed tier, making it slower than positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y, and because Genesect has mediocre defenses it requires a lot of team support in order to function well. On the other hand, Choice Scarf grants Genesect the ability to outspeed and OHKO top threats, most notably Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Genesect can also use a specially offensive Choice Scarf set with Energy Ball or Thunderbolt if you really need coverage against Water-types. Thunder is usable if you want to use Genesect on a rain team. A non-Choice Scarf set with either Life Orb or Expert Belt is a decent option, as it capitalizes on Genesect's wide range of coverage and allows Genesect to bluff a Choice Scarf and get surprise KOs. Choice Band is also an option, as it allows Genesect to hit foes really hard. Extreme Speed can help Genesect outprioritize other priority move users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Bisharp, and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame can easily beat Genesect, especially if Genesect lacks Thunderbolt. Bulkier Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Heatran, and Mega Camerupt can also easily beat Genesect, as Genesect's attacks do pitiful damage against them, while they can all retaliate back with their own super effective STAB Fire-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Suicune, Politoed tank most of the moves that Genesect throws at them, but they don't appreciate taking a U-turn and losing momentum.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Finally, Aegislash can tank all of Genesect's moves, as even Flamethrower is a 3HKO without the Download boost, and hit it right back with Shadow Ball. Aegislash can also carry Weakness Policy, and if the player is completely unaware of that, Aegislash will tank the Flamethrower from Genesect and OHKO it right back with a +2 Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Gyarados can easily frighten Genesect, as Genesect's attacks won't do much to any of these Pokemon. Gyarados, however, isn't much of a threat if Genesect is running Thunderbolt. Genesect also needs to avoid burns as much as possible, as its STAB moves won't be doing that much if it gets crippled by burns and the residual damage will also wear down it quickly. Thus, Genesect needs to stay away from Pokemon that can use Will-O-Wisp, including Rotom-W, Gengar, and Jellicent.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Moves such as Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room can cripple Genesect by taking away its Speed advantage. Common users of these moves include Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Thundurus, Suicune, Talonflame, Jirachi, Cresselia, and Jellicent.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn is Genesect's main STAB move, and it also allows Genesect to switch out from a foe that checks it to an appropriate partner. Iron Head is Genesect's secondary STAB move and is more spammable as well, if you have some momentum to spare. It also has a nifty chance to cause the target to flinch, and without this move Genesect pretty much can't do anything to Fairy-types. Ice Beam helps Genesect take on foes such as Landorus-T, which Genesect is dead weight against otherwise. Explosion is another option for Genesect, as it allows it to pull off a last-ditch effort once it's weakened enough to the point where it can't do much back to the opposing team. Flamethrower is another option that gives Genesect coverage against a wide range of foes, namely Steel-types such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Metagross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>192 Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow Genesect to outspeed threats such as Jolly Landorus-T equipped with Choice Scarf and Naive Deoxys-A. The Attack EVs maximize Genesect's physical damage output, allowing its STAB moves to deal as much damage as possible. The leftover EVs are dumped into Special Attack to increase Genesect's special offense. A Naive nature is used over Hasty to prevent Genesect from being more susceptible to priority moves than it already is.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Genesect is a good choice in the early-game, as it can utilize its powerful U-turn to switch into the Pokemon appropriate for the situation, quickly putting your opponent on the defensive. However, Genesect should play carefully around Protect, the most common move in the metagame, as its poor defenses prevent it from taking hits well and even neutral damage will quickly shorten its lifespan. Another thing to remember is that Genesect should not be used as a sweeper, but rather as a means of putting holes into your opponent's team and gathering offensive momentum. That being said, Genesect is also capable of being a revenge killer thanks to its high Speed and offenses.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Genesect has a rough time dealing with opposing speed control, so Pokemon that can prevent the use of Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Tailwind are viable teammates. This includes Taunt users such as Gyarados, Thundurus, and Terrakion. Pokemon that can handle Fire-types are exceptional teammates for Genesect. This includes Water-types such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Gyarados. Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie can also check Fire-types. Garchomp is a solid option, because it beats common Fire-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame while Genesect deals with Garchomp's checks such as Diancie, Latios, Kyurem-B, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Landorus-T. Genesect also fears opposing Water-types because they can force it out, as it really wouldn't like burned by Scald. Dragon-types do an excellent job of dealing with Water-types because they don't mind switching in on them, and Genesect can help them in return by dealing with Fairy-types, Landorus-T, and even Steel-types. Pokemon that take advantage of Genesect's momentum are good teammates, especially those that capitalize on the Fire-types that Genesect lures in. Pokemon that can take advantage of Genesect's momentum and its ability to lure in Fire-types, such as Calm Mind Cresselia, Substitute attackers such as Kyurem B and Heatran, and even Belly Drum Azumarill, are great teammates. If you're using Explosion on Genesect, using a Ghost-type partner such as Gengar is a good idea, as it gives you something to switch in while Genesect is going for Explosion so none of your Pokemon get caught in the crossfire.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie's movepool may be somewhat limited, but when backed by high base Speed and attacking stats, it is able to propel Mega Diancie to the forefront of the Doubles metagame. Mega Diancie achieves solid mixed attacking coverage between two strong STAB attacks, with Earth Power filling in many of the few holes that are left. Using that coverage, Mega Diancie can take out many relevant threats such as Hydreigon, Heatran, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y. Perhaps Mega Diancie's greatest asset is found in its exclusive primary STAB move, Diamond Storm, which has everything a Doubles Pokemon could want: high Base Power, high accuracy, and a helpful secondary effect that gives some protection against physical attackers. Mega Diancie also has a superb ability in Magic Bounce, shielding it from moves that would otherwise severely hinder it such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a low HP stat further offset by uninvested defenses and weaknesses to decently common types in Water and Ground leaves Mega Diancie somewhat frail. More specifically, a weakness to the omnipresent Landorus-T's Earthquake makes it difficult for Mega Diancie to perform as well as it could otherwise. Having a low base Speed prior to Mega Evolving also holds it back, forcing it to rely on Protect to Mega Evolve safely. On the other hand, this low base Speed lets Diancie possess a little bit of flexibility in using its base forme to operate as a Trick Room setter with far more bulk than its Mega counterpart. Utilizing both Clear Body and a powerful Diamond Storm lets this set thrive in sweeping unprepared teams. However, Trick Room Diancie is hindered by the same critical typing weaknesses, as well as being countered by common Trick Room checks Amoonguss and Aegislash.</p>",

However, those two choices force Mega Diancie to drop either Moonblast or Earth Power, leaving it hard stopped by either Fighting- or Steel-types such as Keldeo, Virizion, and Aegislash. Trick Room Diancie can utilize Weakness Policy to gain boosts after taking a super effective hit, but the only super effective hits that won't OHKO Diancie are Earth Power and Earthquake, and Weakness Policy significantly reduces Diancie's damage output, preventing several 2HKOs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types that are not OHKOed by Earth Power, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong, are solid answers to Diancie, as they can switch in on either STAB move and OHKO it comfortably. Diancie is also weak to Bullet Punch users such as Mega Metagross, as the attack outprioritizes any of Mega Diancie's options and easily OHKOes it, assuming that Mega Diancie doesn't have too many Defense boosts.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W can easily take any hit from Diancie and KO with with their STAB moves. Kingdra in rain outruns Mega Diancie and OHKO with Hydro Pump, though it has to be wary of switching in on Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Venusaur can take out Diancie with their STAB moves while being able to tank any of Diancie's blows. Venusaur in sun easily outruns and KOes with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users can reliably outspeed and OHKO Mega Diancie, including Landorus-T through Earthquake, Kyurem-B or Genesect using Iron Head, and Rotom-W with Hydro Pump. Some naturally fast Pokemon, such as Deoxys-A, Mega Aerodactyl, Flash Cannon Thundurus, and Steel Wing Talonflame outspeed Mega Diancie and take it out.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Although Mega Diancie is immune to Thunder Wave through Magic Bounce, both Trick Room, from threats such as Cresselia or Jellicent, and Tailwind, from Suicune or Talonflame, take away Mega Diancie's Speed advantage, leaving it almost unsalvageably frail.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Will-O-Wisp is conveniently avoided due to Magic Bounce, but Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados can weaken Mega Diancie's main attacking move, leaving it considerably less threatening. Regular Diancie, as it is lacking Magic Bounce, has to fear Will-O-Wisp, which not only cuts its Attack but also lowers its longevity to be able to set Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Sleep-inducers such as Breloom and Amoonguss prevent the Trick Room set from being effective due to them being able to put Diancie to sleep before it can even move.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard users such as Conkeldurr and Aegislash prevent Diamond Storm from being succesful, and they are commonly used beside Rock-weak teammates due to the prevalence of Rock Slide.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diamond Storm functions as Mega Diancie's primary STAB move, dealing significant spread damage to both foes with a 50% chance to raise Mega Diancie's Defense stat for each foe it hits. These boosts can allow Mega Diancie to avoid getting revenge killed, most notably surviving a Landorus-T Earthquake after one Defense boost. With Diamond Storm, Mega Diancie can take out Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, and Kyurem-B with nearly perfect accuracy. Moonblast stands as a solid option for Mega Diancie's secondary STAB attack, helping it cover many threats that Diamond Storm cannot, including the common Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types such as Keldeo, Hoopa-U, and Latios. Earth Power rounds out Mega Diancie's fantastic coverage, hitting Steel- and Rock-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, and opposing Mega Diancie that would otherwise shrug it off. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, allowing Mega Diancie to stall out various field conditions or shield itself while a threat is eliminated by its partner. It also importantly because it allows Mega Diancie to safely gain its full base 110 Speed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and a boosting nature are needed to outrun many significant threats such as Keldeo, Salamence, and Mega Gardevoir, as well as Speed tie with opposing base 110s such as Gengar and Latios. 48 Special Attack EVs are used to guarantee an OHKO on Bisharp with Earth Power, with the remaining EVs placed in Attack to boost the power of Diamond Storm as much as possible. A Hasty nature is typically chosen over a Naive one, as its lowered Defense stat can be remedied by Diamond Storm boosts. This also allows Mega Diancie to survive an Earth Power from Kyurem-B, Heatran, or opposing Mega Diancie. However, Naive is an option to take more advantage of Diamond Storm boosts. A more specially based spread, using 56 Atk / 200 SpA / 252 Spe, is an option to guarantee the 2HKO on Mega Kangaskhan with Moonblast. However, this sacrifices a lot of Diamond Storm's power, which is the move Mega Diancie will be using a majority of its time on the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Mega Diancie should use Diamond Storm in order to deal the most damage possible to the opposing team, filling in any gaps in Diamond Storm's coverage with its other attacks. Protect should be used Diancie's first turn out a majority of the time, since it then only hits 218 Speed, leaving it slower than most of the metagame. This turn of Protect allows Diancie to Mega Evolve safely and gain not only its full Speed but also the useful Magic Bounce. Diancie works quite well as a lead, avoiding any Intimidate Attack drops coming from popular leads thanks to Clear Body and using Magic Bounce to deal with many common disruption tactics after it has Mega Evolved. Since Mega Evolution happens after any Pokemon are switched, Diancie is also able to avoid Intimidate from a Pokemon that switches in on the turn it Mega Evolves. With that in mind, Mega Diancie works at any point of the game, either opening up and clearing the path for a teammate to clean or doing so itself in the mid- or late-game. If Mega Diancie absolutely needs to survive a hit and attack back on its first turn on the field, it can postpone Mega Evolution to stay in its base forme, which has significantly higher defenses. This extra bulk is particularly notable when facing Trick Room teams, as it is not so necessary to get the boost in Speed provided by Mega Evolving, and it can mean the difference between surviving to the end of Trick Room's duration and being knocked out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Talonflame, Heatran, and Volcarona beat many of the Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Venusaur that scare out Mega Diancie. Grass-types such as Breloom and Ferrothorn can remove Water-types for Mega Diancie, resist the Ground-type moves it's weak to, and appreciate the removal of Flying-types. Similarly, Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus do well against Water-types. Grass- and Electric-types also help ease Mega Diancie's otherwise difficult rain matchup. Strong Dark-type teammates are greatly appreciated as checks to Dark-weak Steel-types such as Aegislash, Bronzong, and Mega Metagross; some examples include Hoopa-U, Bisharp, and Hydreigon. Bisharp also has the advantage of discouraging Intimidate users from switching in with its Defiant ability. They also have the benefit of threatening bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Cresselia that can practically ignore Mega Diancie thanks to their solid bulk. Anything that beats Landorus-T is much appreciated as a teammate by Mega Diancie, including Kyurem-B (especially Choice Scarf variants) and Keldeo. Similarly, a teammate such as Kyurem-B or Raikou that can take care of Thundurus is greatly appreciated, as fast sets with Flash Cannon outrun and OHKO Mega Diancie. Dragon-types, including Hydreigon and Salamence, benefit from Mega Diancie's ability to beat opposing Dragon-types without fearing their moves in return, and they also act as a solid switch-ins to Water- and Grass-type attacks. They also typically perform well against rain teams, which are one of Mega Diancie's weakest matchups. Steel-types have decent synergy with Mega Diancie, mostly appreciating the removal of Fire-types that Mega Diancie is so good at. Aegislash in particular is a great partner, as it can carry Wide Guard to protect Mega Diancie from Muddy Water or Earthquake and takes care of Bronzong or Mega Metagross. Jirachi also stands out as notable, helping Mega Diancie with redirection support and Icy Wind to help it take on especially fast foes.</p>"

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diamond Storm is Diancie's main STAB move, dealing powerful spread damage while having a chance to boost Diancie's Defense. This Rock-type coverage, when combined with Fairy-type coverage in the form of Moonblast, which covers Fighting-types, leaves Diancie only walled by opposing Steel-types. Trick Room is a potent speed control move that gives Diancie's team the upper hand speed-wise for four more turns, allowing Diancie and its teammates room to sweep. Protect is useful for avoiding opposing damage and maneuvering for a better position with Diancie's partner.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Stone Plate and 252 EVs in Attack bring Trick Room Diancie's Diamond Storm damage on par with Mega Diancie's, notably allowing it to 2HKO most neutral targets. Maximum HP EVs are used to compensate for Diancie's low base HP stat and to give it a respectable amount of bulk. While Stone Plate is preferred to avoid recoil damage, Life Orb can be used to give Diancie more damage output, notably having a better roll to KO defensive Thundurus while also boosting Moonblast enough to KO Keldeo with 108 Special Attack EVs—without Life Orb, however, there aren't any notable Special Attack benchmarks, and hence the standard spread has no Special Attack investment. If using Life Orb, a spread of 152 HP / 248 Atk / 108 SpA should be used, as this minimizes Life Orb recoil and hits the aforementioned Special Attack benchmark.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The only foes that resist Diancie's dual coverage are Steel-types, so get rid of these immediately. More often than not, eliminating Aegislash or Jirachi early on grants Diancie a paved road to finish the game, so Diancie often works best mid- or late-game when these threats are eliminated.</p> <p>Defensively, Diancie brings many things to the table that no other setter can due to its unique Rock / Fairy typing. Take advantage of these unique good matchups—against Talonflame, Kangaskhan, Thundurus, and Hydreigon—for an opportunity to set up Trick Room, usually with Fake Out or redirection support. On the other hand, Diancie should do its best to avoid its difficult matchups, such as against opposing Steel-types, rain sweepers and bulky Water-types, and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Defensive boosts are also extremely useful: these can be used to easily tank and prevent a late-game Earthquake sweep after Trick Room goes down. Diancie's decent bulk also allows it to tank opposing Earth Power from Heatran, Kyurem-B, or Mega Diancie, as well as Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p>Diancie possesses the option to simply use Diamond Storm if you foresee a foe using using Taunt (typically Thundurus, which is weak to Diamond Storm), potentially picking up KOs or dealing large amounts of damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Diancie's team members should generally be geared towards dealing with its difficult matchups. Especially notable are attackers that can deal with Steel-types such as Volcanion, Scrafty, Heatran, Mega Camerupt, and Hoopa-U and Ground-immune Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Latios, and Hydreigon. In addition, checks to opposing Water-types such as Dragon-types, Grass-types (Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur), and Mega Charizard Y, as well as Fairy checks in the form of Aegislash, Heatran, and Bronzong, are needed. Fake Out and redirection are two forms of support Diancie greatly appreciates for setting Trick Room; Scrafty and Mega Kangaskhan provide Fake Out, whereas Amoonguss supplies Diancie with redirection. Scrafty and Amoonguss are both very good for compensating for Diancie's weaknesses to Steel-types and Water-types, respectively.</p>"

  "Hoopa-Unbound": {
    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U is widely known for its monstrous power as well as its two signature moves that break one of the most common moves in Doubles, Protect. With base 160 Attack and base 170 Special Attack, Hoopa can viably run a mixed attacking set sporting both Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole to OHKO common threats like Aegislash and Amoonguss while also nearly OHKOing most of the metagame that doesn't resist these STAB-boosted moves. In addition to breaking Protect and variants like Spiky Shield, King's Shield, and Wide Guard like Feint does, Hyperspace Hole and Hyperspace Fury also hit Pokemon that are behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Hoopa-U's Speed tier is not generally the best to take full advantage of its offensive power, so it's most commonly paired with multiple speed control options on the same team, ranging from Trick Room to Tailwind. Additionally, Hoopa-U's ability to break Protect pressures the opponent, as they can't simply use Protect to stall out turns of Tailwind or Trick Room reliably. Its Psychic / Dark typing also does not really grant it much defensively beyond an immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Due to its low Defense, physical attackers that can outspeed it such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T are the biggest threats to Hoopa-U. On the other hand, though, Hoopa-U has a high base 130 Special Defense that can be used to take a lot of special hits nicely. Dark-types like Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Scrafty are also an issue, as they resist Hoopa's dual STAB Hyperspace moves, and Fairy-type Pokemon also threaten to KO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The elemental punches, primarily Fire and Ice Punch, are additional coverage options. Fire Punch helps Hoopa-U beat Ferrothorn while also hitting Bisharp for super effective damage, whereas Ice Punch is mainly for Landorus-T. For similar reasons to the elemental punches, Hoopa-U can make use of Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice, using its Special Attack stat over its Attack to beat the same threats. Ally Switch is a support option that allows Hoopa-U to catch your opponent off guard by swapping places with its ally on a pivotal turn, but Hoopa-U generally gets more mileage out of attacking the foes for heavy damage rather than supporting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon: If Hoopa-U is lacking Drain Punch, Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, Hydreigon, and Darkrai threaten it because they resist and are immune to Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon:Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Azumarill are also big threats to Hoopa-U when they outspeed it or it does not have Gunk Shot on its set to cover them. Notably, Mega Gardevoir should easily be knocked out from full by Hyperspace Fury, so there is no need to risk a Gunk Shot miss when attacking it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Hoopa-U really struggles against attackers that hit it with physical moves because it has only base 60 Defense. These include threats that are able to tank a hit and hit it hard such as Scrafty, Azumarill, Gyarados, and Ferrothorn as well as Pokemon that outspeed Hoopa such as Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, Landorus-T, and even Keldeo thanks to its signature move Secret Sword targeting the foe's Defense.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Mega Gardevoir can all outrun and OHKO Hoopa-U if they are already present on the field. None can really switch into Hoopa-U too comfortably, however.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room</strong>: Hoopa-U is dependent on its own team's speed control, so if the opponent either uses their own form of speed control or prevents Hoopa-U's team from getting up theirs, Hoopa-U may struggle to be an effective threat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns make Hoopa-U much easier to play around by almost forcing it to use only Hyperspace Hole, letting the opponent find more reliable ways to switch into it. Pokemon such as Darkrai have the typing advantage mentioned previously as well as the ability to outspeed and burn Hoopa-U before it gets off an attack.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's strongest physical attack and often its go-to move to hammer away at the opponent, and, like Feint, it also breaks Protect. Hyperspace Hole is Hoopa-U's main special attack to help it beat Amoonguss as well as still deal heavy damage when it is either burned or Intimidated. Gunk Shot is a coverage move to handle Fairies such as Azumarill and Sylveon, which would otherwise threaten Hoopa-U. Substitute is a little more difficult to set up for Hoopa-U compared to other common users due to its lack of a good defensive typing, but it can often set it up on passive threats like Amoonguss or when it scares out a foe thanks to its offensive pressure. A Hoopa-U behind a Substitute is able to take physical hits it would otherwise not be able to take and respond with heavy damage. Drain Punch gives Hoopa-U a coverage move to hit Dark-type Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. Protect is self explanatory as a staple move in Doubles to help stall out field conditions or get Hoopa-U in a position where its partner can help it threaten the opposing team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb boosts Hoopa-U's mixed offensive stats to high levels to pick up key KOs and deal heavy damage. The Hasty nature was chosen to both increase Hoopa-U's Speed and preserve its outstanding Special Defense stat, as it wouldn't be taking most physical hits anyway. The Special Attack investment lets Hoopa-U always OHKO standard Relaxed Amoonguss with Hyperspace Hole. The Speed investment lets it outrun maximum Speed positive-natured base 70 Pokemon such as Breloom. The rest is dumped into Attack to hit as hard as possible with Hyperspace Fury, which easily OHKOes threats like Aegislash. An alternate spread with 116 Atk / 140 SpA / 252 Spe and a Hasty nature can be used to outrun as many Pokemon as possible while still netting an OHKO on both standard Relaxed Amoonguss and standard Aegislash. A Trick Room team may attempt to use an alternate spread of 232 HP / 136 Atk / 140 SpA with a Quiet nature to outspeed as many threats as possible in Trick Room. Zen Headbutt is also a viable option on Hoopa if one wants to forgo the special mechanics of Hyperspace Hole and opt for a full physical set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hoopa-U should avoid Will-O-Wisp, as it lowers the damage output of Hyperspace Fury, preventing it from picking up OHKOs on some Pokemon and denting others for heavy damage. If Hoopa-U is faster than its partner, you can use a Hyperspace move to break opposing Protect so that the partner can attack through it. The same applies for breaking Wide Guard from Pokemon such as Aegislash, allowing a slower Mega Gardevoir to get off its Hyper Voice. Try not to switch in Hoopa-U too often except on a U-turn or safe switch after a team member faints, because its low Defense and lack of decent resistances make it take heavy damage otherwise. Leading with a Fake Out user alongside Hoopa-U puts on a lot of pressure because people generally try to burn out Fake Out with Protect, but thanks to Hoopa-U's ability to break Protect with its Hyperspace moves, this is no longer very safe. Due to Hoopa-U's awkward mid-tier base 80 Speed, it's best to get speed control into play such as that of Trick Room, Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind. Obviously, Hoopa-U is great for pressuring Pokemon slower than it due to its monstrous offensive stats. Hoopa-U is also very great against Trick Room, as it can hit most Trick Room setters for super effective damage with Hyperspace Fury, either KOing them or weakening them to the point where they will be unable to set up Trick Room again. If you are using the Substitute set on Hoopa-U, do not have it set up a Substitute when it is not anywhere close to full health, because it may end up fainting to Life Orb recoil behind the Substitute before it can get enough hits off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tailwind setters are great partners for Hoopa-U because they provide it with necessary speed control. Latios gets a special mention for its offensive synergy with Hoopa-U, appreciating its ability to OHKO Aegislash. Trick Room setters such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Porygon2 give speed control for Hoopa to go to town under Trick Room. Redirection support Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Jirachi are good to take physical hits for Hoopa-U, allowing it to safely fire off attacks. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Infernape can help Hoopa-U attack the foes safely, and, as a bonus, they also have a decent matchup versus Dark-types. Mega Kangaskhan also greatly appreciates Hoopa-U, as Hoopa-U helps it by getting rid of pesky Ghost-types like Aegislash and other Mega Kangaskhan checks like Amoonguss, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to plow through teams. Mega Kangaskhan also beats most Fairies, which would otherwise threaten Hoopa-U. Keldeo is a great partner, as it helps get rid of Dark- and Steel-types, as well as big threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T that would OHKO Hoopa-U. Aegislash and Amoonguss are good defensive partners for Hoopa-U, as they take Fairy-type attacks and are good switch-ins to threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Keldeo, which would otherwise OHKO Hoopa. Aegislash also offers Wide Guard support to block out spread Fairy-type moves such as Pixilate Hyper Voice. Mega Gardevoir in particular really appreciates Hoopa-U beating Aegislash for it so it can freely spam Hyper Voice, while Gardevoir handles pesky Dark-types for Hoopa-U. Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are also great partners because they beat threats to Hoopa-U in Dark-types like Bisharp and Scrafty as well as Fairy-types in Sylveon.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole are STAB attacks that can break through Protect and Wide Guard, the former being more powerful and having the better offensive typing and the latter being more spammable because it does not reduce Hoopa-U's Defense upon use and is unaffected by the Attack drop from Intimidate and burns. Trick Room supports the team by providing speed control, allowing Hoopa-U and other slow teammates to move first most of the time. Protect lets Hoopa-U stall out field conditions and allows partners to KO threats without it having to switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes the damage from Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while also providing enough bulk to survive a Secret Sword from Keldeo or a Moonblast from Mega Diancie. Safety Goggles allows to set up Trick Room on Amoonguss and other sleep spreaders, while Focus Sash allows Hoopa-U to take at least one hit and set up Trick Room. Life Orb lets Hoopa-U hit harder and notably OHKO Aegislash and Amoonguss, though it sacrifices Hoopa-U's longevity. Alternatively, a spread of 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 SpD can be used with a Focus Sash because the defensive benchmarks aren't as relevant when Hoopa-U is guaranteed to survive one hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Hoopa-U is frail, it functions best as a mid- or late-game Trick Room setter, as many of its checks will often be KOed or out of position. Due to Hoopa-U's low Defense, it should avoid taking physical attacks. Spamming Hyperspace Hole and Hyperspace Fury is great to stop the opponent from using Protect to stall out Trick Room turns, also breaking Protect and Wide Guard for Hoopa-U's partner to deal damage. Fake Out support can make setting Trick Room easier. Because some Pokemon are naturally slower than Hoopa-U, setting Trick Room sometimes isn't the priority and when facing Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Amoonguss, it's best to just attack. Also, don't set Trick Room if you feel that a Taunt user will use Taunt on Hoopa-U; instead, use Protect or attack the Taunt user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan and Scrafty make for good partners, as they help Hoopa-U set Trick Room more easily. An Intimidate user such as Gyarados or Landorus-T can help to alleviate Hoopa-U's poor Defense. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Fairy-types like Sylveon help deal with Dark-types, which Hoopa-U struggles to damage. Amoonguss also helps redirect attacks, which makes setting Trick Room easier and is also great under Trick Room, as it easily spreads sleep to the opposing team thanks to its low Speed. Spread attackers such as Heatran are great because Hyperspace Fury and Hyperspace Hole also break Wide Guard, so fewer Trick Room turns are wasted if the opponent clicks Wide Guard. Make sure these spread attackers are IVed to be slower than Hoopa-U so that Wide Guard is broken when they attack in Trick Room. Other Trick Room setters can be good to further support a team that may require more Trick Room support, preferably a setter that isn't as weak to Kangaskhan such as Bronzong or Jellicent.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Volcanion's excellent offensive coverage, backed by a base 130 Special Attack, makes it one of XY DOU's most prominent special attackers. Furthermore, its solid natural bulk coupled with Assault Vest makes it a defensive behemoth that is near impossible to take out in one hit. As a result of these excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, it's extremely difficult to trade KOs with it one for one. Steam Eruption and Heat Wave form Volcanion's core offensive suite, hitting virtually every prominent Pokemonthat isn't Water- or Dragon-type for neutral damage. Notably, Volcanion burns foes often because of the aforementioned moves' chances to inflict burns. Earth Power hits other Volcanion and other Water-types that resist its STAB attacks. Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon and the rare Jellicent, but it primarily flips the matchup against the former on its head. Overheat is notable for being a high-damage option, KOing Amoonguss after minimal chip damage, though the Special Attack drop greatly reduces Volcanion's offensive pressure. While more niche, Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Mega Salamence and Hydreigon, and Sludge Bomb can hit Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon. Assault Vest Volcanion can be brought in really easily, as it often finds fields where neither opposing Pokemon threatens it too much. Removing its scariest checks, like Mega Kangaskhan and Conkeldurr, before it enters battle will make it much more menacing, however. Landorus-T is an excellent partner for Volcanion, primarily because of how well it matches up against opposing Landorus-T, weakning its Earthquake so Volcanion can use Steam Eruption much more safely. Thundurus's ability to spam Thunder Wave makes Volcanion's middling Speed much less of an issue. Volcanion will go down to two Seismic Tosses from Mega Kangaskhan; pairing it with a Rocky Helmet user like Amoonguss or Cresselia will go a long way in wearing Mega Kangaskhan down for it.</p>"

Volcanion runs maximum Special Attack to pressure Amoonguss as much as possible with strong Heat Waves. An odd HP stat allows it to survive switching into Stealth Rock four times. Switching Volcanion into Amoonguss's Spore when the other foe can't threaten it is one of the strongest plays available with this set. Landorus-T and Thundurus greatly support Volcanion with their respective abilities and immunity to Ground. Specially bulky Pokemon like Sylveon, Porygon2, and Conkeldurr can switch into Thunderbolts aimed at Volcanion.
