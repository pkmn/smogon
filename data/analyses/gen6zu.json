    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion, especially when paired with Custap Berry, is one way for Gigalith to trade massive damage when it's already at low HP. It is Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, which can come in handy to ensure Stealth Rock stays up, given Vibrava will likely want to come in and use Defog in the favorable matchup, only to get blown up. Custap Berry sets work great as leads so Gigalith can get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed, letting a teammate come in afterwards and threaten Defoggers like Vibrava and Dustox. Investing some EVs into Special Defense can improve Gigalith's matchups against Swoobat and Vanilluxe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Marshtomp and Hippopotas are easily the best counters to Gigalith, even versus its Choice Band variant. Other Ground-types like Vibrava and Krokorok may deter Stone Edge, but they fear stronger coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: One of Gigalith's most common weaknesses, faster Grass-types like Servine and Ivysaur easily force it out. Physically defensive Grass-types like Gourgeist-L and Meganium are faster than Gigalith, and even ignoring the threat of Giga Drain, they can fish for a Stone Edge miss and recover with Synthesis and Leech Seed. Ivysaur and Meganium are particularly annoying, since they can deal with Toxic through their typing and Aromatherapy, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Politoed and special variants of Huntail can take a hit from Gigalith and threaten great damage as well as potential burn with Scald from Politoed. Simipour and Frogadier have a harder time coming in safely but can threaten to OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Special and Mixed Attackers</strong>: Gigalith's bulk is only remarkable on the physical side, so any special attacker with strong coverage like Electabuzz or Magmar with Focus Blast is an issue. Even worse, physical attackers like Persian and Simisage can afford coverage like Water Pulse and Leaf Storm, respectively, to bypass Gigalith's great physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor shrugs off Stone Edge, Toxic, and Earthquake. It doesn't fear much from Gigalith unless it's a specially defensive variant against the Choice Band set.</p>",

Its typing means that physically offensive Normal-types like Persian, Furfrou, and Raticate struggle to take it down, whereas Pokemon with stronger coverage versus Gigalith like Pignite and Swalot will struggle to trade hits successfully. Stone Edge will deal more damage than Rock Blast on average, consistently 2HKOing Servine and Politoed, whereas Rock Blast is more consistent with its accuracy and the ability to break Substitute and Focus Sash on the likes of Swoobat and Butterfree. Earthquake pairs best with Gigalith's Rock-type coverage, especially versus foes like Swalot and Lairon. Superpower nails Krokorok and Lairon, especially useful given Earthquake lacks a chance to OHKO the latter. It is also Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, although Toxic is another option to punish Vibrava along with other checks like Gourgeist-L. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Leftovers that chips at offensive pivots like Persian and Furfrou. Lastly, Custap Berry offers the chance for Gigalith to get an extra hit off when it's at low health, which also works as an emergency check to most sweepers if it is still at full health for Sturdy.</p> <p>A staple on most cores, Gigalith pairs with special walls like Duosion, Dustox, and Klang. They deal with the strong special attackers that Gigalith is forced out by, whereas it can check physical attackers like Lairon and Persian. Specially offensive pivots like Electabuzz and Frogadier can position Gigalith on the field to set up Stealth Rock and fire off strong attacks. Poison-types like Ivysaur and Swalot make for good partners, as they can take on Grass-types like Servine and Simisage. In the same vein, teammates like Politoed and specially defensive Servine check offensive Water-types. A Grass-type that can comfortably switch into Earthquake, like Servine or Quilladin, is also a must. Servine specifically can dissuade Defog attempts from Vibrava, which is a Pokemon that gives Gigalith trouble.</p>"

It can OHKO slower foes like Duosion and Swalot, and even potential switch-ins tend to be shoddy at best given the raw damage of Stone Edge. However, Gigalith is still slower than physical walls like Gourgeist-L and Meganium, so even with a stronger Superpower, it fails to get past these foes by itself. Heavy Slam offers good neutral coverage, 2HKOing Vibrava as an example. Toxic is an alternative to deal with the aforementioned Grass-type walls that Gigalith still struggles against.</p> <p>Pivots like Electabuzz, Dustox, Frogadier, and Vibrava are all great teammates to position Gigalith on the field versus slower, vulnerable targets. Physical sweepers like Huntail and Klang are also great to have once Gigalith is able to break down opposing physical walls. Knock Off users like Servine, Ivysaur, and Persian are excellent to soften up Eviolite-reliant walls like Bronzor and Vibrava soften up for Gigalith; it can then OHKO these foes with Superpower. Special wallbreakers like Magmar and Swoobat are great to pivot into when Gigalith is forced out by a faster Grass-type.</p>"

Psychic gives Meowstic-M some offensive presence, doing notable damage to common switch-ins like Dustox and Vibrava that want to remove its dual screens and Poison-types that might want to set up hazards on it like Whirlipede and Trubbish.

An EV spread of 248 HP / 164 SpA / 96 Spe turns Ivysaur into more of a stallbreaker, more consistent at checking Grass-types like Servine and Gogoat at the cost of giving up some of its bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Ivysaur struggles to make progress against Poison-types like Swalot and Dustox; Swalot can repeatedly whittle its Synthesis PP down with various attacks, while Dustox can freely pivot to another check or even phaze it with Whirlwind.

However, it is much weaker than other Chlorophyll wallbreakers such as Sawsbuck and Ivysaur and is by no means mandatory on these teams. Jumpluff can also run a Leech Seed + Substitute set to wear down Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, but this means giving up Swords Dance and lowering its overall damage output.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Lairon and Klang shrug off any attacks from Jumpluff and, unless Sleep Powder is a threat, can freely set up on it. Bronzor is equally impossible to take down for Jumpluff.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Swalot and Trubbish can handle Jumpluff's attacks fairly well, with the former also absorbing sleep fairly well due to using Sleep Talk while also threatening massive damage against it. Choice Scarf Seviper can revenge kill Jumpluff, although it may struggle to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Magcargo and Dusclops are near impossible for Jumpluff to break past, which is only worsened by both also being able to burn it. Even Gigalith and Gourgeist-L make for decent answers despite being weak to Jumpluff's STAB attacks thanks to their naturally high physical bulk. Gigalith can tank a +2 Seed Bomb and OHKO Jumpluff back, while Gourgeist-L can just cripple Jumpluff with a burn, making it far easier to manage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock can make it hard for Jumpluff to set up and act as a pivot. Similarly, status like burn and poison can heavily limit setup opportunities, as Jumpluff does not run any recovery.</p> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Electabuzz and to a lesser extent Magmar, despite being slower than Jumpluff, can still pose a great threat to it due to their immunity to Sleep Powder. Electabuzz has the added benefit of resisting Acrobatics, making it a more reliable Jumpluff answer than Magmar, which needs to be at full health to avoid a 2HKO. Magmar may sometimes run Flame Body to deter Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Jumpluff is third fastest Pokemon in the metagame, both Pokemon that are faster, Persian and Swoobat, can revenge kill it reliably. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Simisage, Frogadier, and Vanilluxe can also outpace Jumpluff and threaten it with super effective coverage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jumpluff serves as one of the most reliable revenge killers and cleaners in ZU thanks to its incredible Speed. Swords Dance remedies its otherwise-measly Attack, which is further helped by Acrobatics's insane power at the cost of not using a held item. Sleep Powder not only provides potential setup opportunities but can shut down Pokemon Jumpluff cannot easily break past such as Lairon, Bronzor, and Trubbish. Seed Bomb complements Acrobatics by nailing Rock-types like Gigalith and Carbink. U-turn lets Jumpluff safely escape from some of the aforementioned poor matchups while keeping momentum, while Encore can force slower Pokemon to lock into undesirable moves, creating setup turns, and shut down opposing setup Pokemon like Duosion and Swalot that can otherwise outmatch Jumpluff.</p> <p>Jumpluff cannot deal with Steel-types like Bronzor, Klang, and Lairon on its own; Fire-types and Ground-types like Pignite and Whiscash can all handle them with ease and also appreciate being brought in safely by U-turn. Even with Seed Bomb, Rock-types are physically bulky enough to withstand multiple hits from Jumpluff, and Gigalith in particular poses a great threat because it can OHKO Jumpluff in return; therefore, answers to Rock-types such as Vibrava, Marshtomp, and Scraggy make for great partners. These Pokemon also provide additional benefits: Vibrava's access to Defog allows for easier setup opportunities, Marshtomp's Stealth Rock helps weaken foes into Jumpluff's effective cleaning range, and Scraggy can remove important items like Eviolite and Rocky Helmet to aid Jumpluff's sweep. Spikes setters such as Quilladin, Whirlipede, and Glalie are also great partners, as many of Jumpluff's reliable answers are grounded. Special wallbreakers such as Simipour, Simisage, and Magmar can take down physical walls such as Swalot and Dusclops, as well as better dealing with the previously mentioned Steel- and Rock-types, which are typically weaker specially. Teams with many Eviolite-dependent Pokemon like Electabuzz, Bronzor, and Hippopotas can use Jumpluff as a Knock Off absorber. U-turn Jumpluff also makes for a great addition to VoltTurn teams, which feature the likes of Electabuzz, Frogadier, and Dustox.</p>"

Politoed gets a special mention here; Dustox is one of its best switch-ins, since it doesn't have to be concerned with burn from Scald due to Shield Dust. This provides opportunities for it to clear entry hazards with Defog as well as gain momentum with STAB U-turn. Toxic allows Dustox to punish switch-ins like Gigalith and Pignite, a more proactive approach of dealing with its checks in comparison to pivoting. Whirlwind forces out sweepers like Klang and Scraggy, and it can also gain momentum when drawing in a Pokemon that cannot threaten Dustox with a subsequent U-turn. Sludge Bomb is another option Dustox may opt for to spread status while also nailing the Grass-types it checks like Servine, Simisage, and Gogoat.

Offensive pivots like Electabuzz and Furfrou also generate momentum in tandem with Dustox.

Waterfall's potential to flinch physically bulky targets like Swalot and Bronzor may allow it to continue spiraling out of control. Sucker Punch catches Choice Scarf users like Simisage, Simipour, and Electabuzz off guard, finishing them off after some chip damage. Return targets Politoed, which would otherwise completely wall Huntail. Ice Beam can OHKO Jumpluff and Gourgeist formes after Stealth Rock. Water Veil protects Huntail from burn from Pokemon like Politoed and Gourgeist formes, while Swift Swim is preferred on rain teams.</p> <p>Like its special set, Huntail prefers being on offensive and hyper offense teams. Utility support from Meowstic-M and Swoobat can give more leeway for Huntail to set up. As this set is physically offensive, Huntail has a more difficult time breaking down physical walls like Swalot and Klang due to its more limited physical movepool. Special wallbreakers like Vanilluxe and Magmar can soften these walls so Huntail can have an easier time cleaning late-game; these Pokemon can also help deal with Grass-types like Gourgeist formes and Servine, especially if Huntail is running Return over Ice Beam. In return, it can take on walls that they struggle with, like Dustox and Carbink. Grass-type checks like Swalot and Jumpluff can make it easier for Huntail to sweep. Grass-types like Servine and Sawsbuck themselves make for great teammates, as they can help Huntail check Water-types like Politoed and Seaking. Entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Carbink are appreciated so Huntail can achieve benchmarks like the OHKO on Electabuzz at +2 Attack. On rain builds, fellow rain sweepers like Golduck and Beartic work well with Huntail through their sweeping or wallbreaking capabilities, and rain setters like Volbeat and Murkrow allow Huntail to continue threatening the opposition.</p>"

Power-Up Punch is an alternative option on the tank set to potentially pick off a weakened target and then use the extra power to sweep with a stronger Sucker Punch. Flame Charge with extra Speed investment allows Pignite to potentially clean late-game, although Curse + Sucker Punch offers a more reliable vehicle to success. Wild Charge nails Water-types attempting to switch in, although all notable examples will be just as vulnerable to Superpower, which also comes with the perk of lacking recoil. Roar works as some bulky setup sweepers like Scraggy and Iron Defense Klang can become too hard for Pignite to break itself. Bulldoze is helpful for the mirror and works like Flame Charge to a lesser extent, getting the jump on faster attackers like Magmar and Electabuzz. Sometimes, the offensive potential of Blaze can be worth forfeiting Pignite's ability to easily switch into Vanilluxe with Thick Fat, especially given its good synergy with Flare Blitz recoil. RestTalk over Toxic and Sucker Punch on an offensive set is great for helping Pignite stick around while making it arguably the best long-term answer to Bronzor. Although RestTalk makes Pignite much bulkier, it leaves it vulnerable to being revenge KOed more easily. Heavy Slam is a good option to OHKO a common counter in Carbink.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Vibrava, Hippopotas, and Marshtomp are hard for Pignite to trade hits against, even if they lose their Eviolite or get poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types do not want to switch in against Pignite's strong coverage, but the likes of Simipour and Whiscash can come in against its Fire-type attacks and force it out. Politoed's bulk and access to Protect and Encore makes it one of the hardest checks to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Swalot</strong>: Physically defensive Swalot is a pain for Pignite to get through, especially when Flare Blitz recoil is compounded with Rocky Helmet chip damage. Some variants also carry Encore to shut down Curse Pignite.</p> <p><strong>Duosion</strong>: Duosion's overall bulk and access to STAB Psychic and Future Sight make it a good check to Pignite, even absorbing its strong Flare Blitz thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Faster, hard-hitting attackers like Life Orb Murkrow and Choice Specs Electabuzz can force out Pignite.

Many Grass-types have a hard time trading hits and preventing Pignite from coming in against them, and many other walls and sweepers such as Dustox, Bronzor, Klang, and Scraggy all struggle versus it. Sucker Punch means that even when Pignite is at low HP, it can still pose a threat to revenge killers, especially frailer examples like Swoobat and Pikachu. For bulkier targets it fails to break through, like Regenerator Duosion, Marshtomp, and Hippopotas, Pignite can still threaten them with Toxic on the switch in. Thick Fat is an asset for discouraging STAB attacks from wallbreakers like Choice Specs Magmar and Vanilluxe.

Servine and Politoed work on bulky offense, being able to spread status and pivot Pignite in on Grass-types like Ivysaur and Gogoat. Alternatively, the likes of Simisage and Frogadier support Pignite with their revenge killing capabilities, and in return it forces heavy hits on important walls. Duosion's Future Sight support is a great way to make sure Pignite will net hefty damage, as walls like Swalot and Trubbish stop being safe switch-ins to Superpower. Pivots like Volt Switch Electabuzz and Klang can force out Water-types and bring Pignite in on susceptible special walls. Klang, Krokorok, and Lairon appreciate Pignite's ability to break down defensive walls with its powerful STAB moves, giving them an easier time to sweep in the endgame.

Intimidate offers some defensive utility against physical attackers like Swalot and opposing Krokorok, whereas Krokorok is not able to make great use of Moxie, as it will likely be forced out by a faster threat whenever it picks up a KO.</p> <p>Setup sweepers and Choice Scarf users such as Huntail, Lairon, Simipour, and Simisage can more easily clean as a result of Krokorok's wallbreaking capabilities. Swalot, Jumpluff, and Meowstic-F appreciate Krokorok's ability to remove Psychic-types like Duosion and Bronzor. In return, they can check Grass-types for Krokorok or act as sweepers themselves. Entry hazard support from Carbink, Whirlipede, and Glalie wears down physically defensive walls like Quilladin and Hippopotas, allowing Krokorok to overwhelm them. It also helps Krokorok to secure better KO ranges; a single layer of Spikes allows Krokorok to OHKO the likes of Dustox, Gigalith, Swalot, and Klang. Krokorok is threatened out by faster Grass-types like Simisage, Jumpluff, and Sawsbuck, so switch-ins to them like Swalot and Gourgeist-L are ideal teammates. Similarly, Krokorok has issues against fast Water-types like Simipour and Frogadier; some good answers to them include Politoed, Servine, and Dustox. Steel-types like Klang, Bronzor, and Lairon help Krokorok's poor matchup against Vanilluxe and Wigglytuff, as well as being solid switch-ins to some of the aforementioned Grass-types.</p>"

Knock Off allows Krokorok to provide utility outside of its main roles by weakening item-dependent Pokemon like Servine, Marshtomp, and Vibrava. Earthquake revenge kills the likes of Electabuzz, Magmar, and +2 Speed Rock Polish Lairon after Stealth Rock chip damage. The additional Speed gained from Choice Scarf allows Krokorok to more reliably trap Swoobat, and it remains a good option in punishing escaping Duosion and Bronzor. Stone Edge is Krokorok's best option for revenge killing Flying-types like Jumpluff and Murkrow, while Assurance synergizes greatly with entry hazards and is Krokorok's best option against fully evolved defensive Grass-types such as Gogoat and Meganium. Moxie is preferred over Intimidate, as it allows Krokorok to snowball after a KO, and unlike its other sets, Choice Scarf means fewer Pokemon can revenge kill it.</p> <p>Krokorok benefits greatly when paired with strong wallbreakers like Simisage, Pignite, and Lairon, which can pave the way for it to clean up teams. Grass-types are a nuisance to Krokorok, as Earthquake and Knock Off bounce off defensive walls like Quilladin and Meganium, while Choice Scarf Grass-types like Simisage and Servine can revenge kill it. Therefore, Grass-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Ivysaur, Klang, and Gogoat make for good partners. Choice Scarf Water- and Ice-types like Frogadier and Vanilluxe are also faster than Krokorok, with solid answers to them including Politoed and Bronzor, respectively. Gourgeist-L and Swalot can cover Krokorok's weakness to Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Scraggy, respectively, and have solid defensive profiles that generally synergize well with it. In return, Krokorok is able to deal with Fire-types like Magmar and Psychic-types like Bronzor and Duosion for them,respectively. Krokorok benefits greatly from entry hazard support from Gigalith, Lairon, and Trubbish, as this helps wear down bulky Pokemon like Scraggy, Ivysaur, and Marshtomp into its cleaning range.</p>"

Physical walls like Bronzor and Swalot make for excellent partners; both can provide utility via setting up Stealth Rock and absorbing Knock Off, respectively, and resist Fairy-type attacks from Carbink. Additionally, Bronzor can resist Flying-type attacks from Jumpluff. Clerics like Meganium and Wigglytuff can make Scraggy less reliant on Rest and Shed Skin, and the latter can even pass large Wishes to augment Scraggy's longevity. In return, Scraggy can make progress for its team through Knock Off support, crippling item-reliant Pokemon like Politoed and Servine, while consistently walling Duosion's Future Sights. Physical walls like Hippopotas and Carbink can often halt its progress as a late-game sweeper, so checks to them like Ivysaur and Bronzor can be quite helpful.

Drain Punch can be used as a safer move against Protect users like Politoed and Ghost-types like Dusclops. Taunt stops bulky Pokemon like Whirlipede, Dustox, and Vibrava from using their utility moves, enabling Scraggy to continue setting up and potentially snowball KOs with Moxie boosts.

In return, Scraggy can break down defensive stalwarts like Bronzor, Dustox, and Klang. Meowstic-M stands out as a great support partner, setting up screens and spreading status via Thunder Wave so that Scraggy has an easier time breaking or cleaning.

Unlike other walls, Duosion circumvents passivity issues by possessing an incredibly high Special Attack stat and Future Sight. This allows it to double up as an excellent progress-maker against most of the metagame due to bulky Psychic-resistant and -immune Pokemon being hard to come by. Signal Beam nails frail Dark-type Pokemon such as Krokorok and Mightyena; the former is especially threatening if it gets in safely because it commonly utilizes Pursuit. Protect not only allows Duosion to scout Choice Krokorok sets but also synergizes greatly with Future Sight. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can punish foes like Servine and offensive Klang sets that may attempt to boost on Duosion. The EV spread allows Duosion to reliably switch into Electabuzz's Volt Switch and heal off any damage with Regenerator. Magic Guard is an alternative that allows Duosion to bypass residual damage from entry hazards and status, although this worsens its functionality as a pivot.</p> <p>Duosion pairs well with Pokemon that take advantage of its Future Sight; some of the most notable examples are Pignite, Simisage, and Scraggy, as they can all hit Dark- and Steel-types for super effective damage and appreciate Future Sight threatening Poison- and Fighting-types switching in. These Pokemon tend to also have the added benefit of covering Duosion's defensive weaknesses. Pignite and Scraggy sometimes use Roar when paired with Future Sight Duosion, as it can phaze in preferred targets. Physically bulky Pokemon like Lairon, Hippopotas, and Gourgeist-L all appreciate Duosion's ability to withstand even the strongest of special attacks from the likes of Simipour, Vanilluxe, and Magmar. Due to Duosion's middling defensive stats without Eviolite, it should be paired with Knock Off absorbers such as Swalot, Jumpluff, and Carbink.

If you opt for Psychic over Psyshock, then Steel- and Dark-types such as Klang, Lairon, Scraggy, and Zweilous cover Calm Mind Carbink and opposing Duosion, respectively. To have an easier time setting up late-game, preserving Duosion's Eviolite is pivotal, so Sticky Hold Pokemon like Swalot and Trubbish make for good teammates.

Life Orb allows Frogadier to hit several benchmarks, such as OHKOing Eviolite Magmar with Hydro Pump and 2HKOing bulky Servine with Ice Beam. Eviolite, on the other hand, lets Frogadier better switch into attacks in general, notably letting it avoid an OHKO from Gigalith's Stone Edge and Duosion's Future Sight, although it should only be switching into strong attacks like these in a pinch.

        "description": "<p>Carbink is one of the tier's premier physical walls due to its great role compression, ability to check Normal- and Fire-types and Scraggy, and access to Stealth Rock. STAB Moonblast does notably well against the likes of Vibrava, Scraggy, and Krokorok while also hitting the majority of the tier neutrally. Calm Mind is used as a win condition and to minimize damage from many weaker special threats like Electabuzz and defensive Ivysaur, which would take advantage of it otherwise. Carbink can switch in on a plethora of Pokemon like Scraggy, Pignite, and Persian, so Rest is important to let it consistently check them. Rocky Helmet is the item of choice to further help chip down the aforementioned Pokemon and punish U-turn and Knock Off users, on top of the Stealth Rock damage they take upon entry.</p> <p>Balance and stall teams look to Carbink as an option for a Stealth Rock setter and physical wall. Carbink struggles to perform well against Steel- and Grass-types like Klang and Servine, so Pignite, Swalot, and Magmar all make good partners to help alleviate this. Other defensive walls like Bronzor and Duosion appreciate Carbink's ability to take on Scraggy. Bronzor, as well as Grass-types like Ivysaur and Gogoat, also appreciates Carbink's ability to take hits from Pignite and Magmar. Carbink pairs well with offensive Pokemon like Simipour, Sawsbuck, and Murkrow because it switches into and chips down faster pivots like Persian and Furfrou with Rocky Helmet. Carbink also greatly benefits from clerics like Meganium and Wigglytuff, since they give Carbink an easier time using Rest.</p>"
