    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion, especially when paired with Custap Berry, is one way for Gigalith to trade massive damage when it's already at low HP. It is Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, which can come in handy to ensure Stealth Rock stays up, given Vibrava will likely want to come in and use Defog in the favorable matchup, only to get blown up. Custap Berry sets work great as leads so Gigalith can get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed, letting a teammate come in afterwards and threaten Defoggers like Vibrava and Dustox. Investing some EVs into Special Defense can improve Gigalith's matchups against Swoobat and Vanilluxe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Marshtomp and Hippopotas are easily the best counters to Gigalith, even versus its Choice Band variant. Other Ground-types like Vibrava and Krokorok may deter Stone Edge, but they fear stronger coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: One of Gigalith's most common weaknesses, faster Grass-types like Servine and Ivysaur easily force it out. Physically defensive Grass-types like Gourgeist-L and Meganium are faster than Gigalith, and even ignoring the threat of Giga Drain, they can fish for a Stone Edge miss and recover with Synthesis and Leech Seed. Ivysaur and Meganium are particularly annoying, since they can deal with Toxic through their typing and Aromatherapy, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Politoed and special variants of Huntail can take a hit from Gigalith and threaten great damage as well as potential burn with Scald from Politoed. Simipour and Frogadier have a harder time coming in safely but can threaten to OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Special and Mixed Attackers</strong>: Gigalith's bulk is only remarkable on the physical side, so any special attacker with strong coverage like Electabuzz or Magmar with Focus Blast is an issue. Even worse, physical attackers like Persian and Simisage can afford coverage like Water Pulse and Leaf Storm, respectively, to bypass Gigalith's great physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor shrugs off Stone Edge, Toxic, and Earthquake. It doesn't fear much from Gigalith unless it's a specially defensive variant against the Choice Band set.</p>",

Its typing means that physically offensive Normal-types like Persian, Furfrou, and Raticate struggle to take it down, whereas Pokemon with stronger coverage versus Gigalith like Pignite and Swalot will struggle to trade hits successfully. Stone Edge will deal more damage than Rock Blast on average, consistently 2HKOing Servine and Politoed, whereas Rock Blast is more consistent with its accuracy and the ability to break Substitute and Focus Sash on the likes of Swoobat and Butterfree. Earthquake pairs best with Gigalith's Rock-type coverage, especially versus foes like Swalot and Lairon. Superpower nails Krokorok and Lairon, especially useful given Earthquake lacks a chance to OHKO the latter. It is also Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, although Toxic is another option to punish Vibrava along with other checks like Gourgeist-L. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Leftovers that chips at offensive pivots like Persian and Furfrou. Lastly, Custap Berry offers the chance for Gigalith to get an extra hit off when it's at low health, which also works as an emergency check to most sweepers if it is still at full health for Sturdy.</p> <p>A staple on most cores, Gigalith pairs with special walls like Duosion, Dustox, and Klang. They deal with the strong special attackers that Gigalith is forced out by, whereas it can check physical attackers like Lairon and Persian. Specially offensive pivots like Electabuzz and Frogadier can position Gigalith on the field to set up Stealth Rock and fire off strong attacks. Poison-types like Ivysaur and Swalot make for good partners, as they can take on Grass-types like Servine and Simisage. In the same vein, teammates like Politoed and specially defensive Servine check offensive Water-types. A Grass-type that can comfortably switch into Earthquake, like Servine or Quilladin, is also a must. Servine specifically can dissuade Defog attempts from Vibrava, which is a Pokemon that gives Gigalith trouble.</p>"

It can OHKO slower foes like Duosion and Swalot, and even potential switch-ins tend to be shoddy at best given the raw damage of Stone Edge. However, Gigalith is still slower than physical walls like Gourgeist-L and Meganium, so even with a stronger Superpower, it fails to get past these foes by itself. Heavy Slam offers good neutral coverage, 2HKOing Vibrava as an example. Toxic is an alternative to deal with the aforementioned Grass-type walls that Gigalith still struggles against.</p> <p>Pivots like Electabuzz, Dustox, Frogadier, and Vibrava are all great teammates to position Gigalith on the field versus slower, vulnerable targets. Physical sweepers like Huntail and Klang are also great to have once Gigalith is able to break down opposing physical walls. Knock Off users like Servine, Ivysaur, and Persian are excellent to soften up Eviolite-reliant walls like Bronzor and Vibrava soften up for Gigalith; it can then OHKO these foes with Superpower. Special wallbreakers like Magmar and Swoobat are great to pivot into when Gigalith is forced out by a faster Grass-type.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire over Hidden Power Ground has a small chance of 2HKOing Bronzor after Stealth Rock while still hitting Dustox, most Steel-types, and Grass-types for super effective damage. However, a super effective Hidden Power Fire is weaker than a neutral Ice Beam against all other targets, and this worsens Vanilluxe's matchup against Lairon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzor is Vanilluxe's worst matchup, as, barring the rare Hidden Power Fire, it resists everything in Vanilluxe's arsenal, can retaliate with either Stealth Rock, Toxic, or Psywave, and can heal off any damage it accumulates with Rest. Defensive Klang does similarly well and can even avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ground, though offensive Klang and Lairon cannot risk switching into said coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive behemoths like Duosion and specially defensive variants of Dusclops and Swalot can avoid the 2HKO from Vanilluxe's Ice Beam; they can threaten it out with their STAB moves, and the former two even have recovery moves to outlast repeated hits from its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Magmar, Pignite, and Lampent resist Vanilluxe's STAB moves and Flash Cannon and can retaliate back with their own STAB moves, with the first of these even outspeeding Vanilluxe. However, they do not want to face Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Vanilluxe's merely decent Speed, lack of defensive utility, and mediocre bulk, it is quite susceptible to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Toxic shortens its already low longevity, while Thunder Wave negates its offensive threat potential.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats like Simipour, Simisage, and Furfrou can revenge kill it after some prior chip damage, though physical revenge killers have to watch out for accidentally triggering a Weak Armor boost from Vanilluxe.</p>",

Flash Cannon OHKOes Carbink, Wigglytuff, and opposing Vanilluxe, OHKOing the latter two after Stealth Rock. Frost Breath 2HKOes Duosion and Carbink, bypassing any Calm Mind boosts they may have obtained. Weak Armor provides Vanilluxe with a situational Speed boost after being hit with contact moves like Knock Off and U-turn, which can be useful in endgames against attackers like Persian.</p> <p>Vanilluxe's wallbreaking capabilities best suit it on balanced and offensive teams, taking advantage of cores that rely on Politoed and bulky Grass-types for their defensive cores. Despite having coverage, Vanilluxe has difficulty forcing out Fire- and Steel-types like Pignite and Bronzor, which can freely switch into its STAB moves. Therefore, Fire-types like Pignite and Magmar can force out Steel-types, while Water-types like Simipour and Frogadier can force out Fire-types, making them good partners to Vanilluxe. Owing to its lack of defensive utility, Vanilluxe appreaciates slow pivots and Defoggers like Dustox and Vibrava to enter the field more safely and remove hazards to allow it to continue wallbreaking. Other pivots like Persian and Jumpluff enjoy Vanilluxe weakening Steel-types so that they can have an easier time revenge killing later in the game. Late-game cleaners like Huntail and Sawsbuck likewise value Vanilluxe's power that lets them pick off weakened foes late-game.

Fire-types such as Pignite and Magmar are problematic for Gourgeist-L given their burn immunity, Eviolite-backed bulk, and strong STAB moves to break through Gourgeist-L, so it relies on partners such as Marshtomp, Whiscash, and Carbink to cover its poor matchup against Fire-types. Wigglytuff's Heal Bell heals Toxic status that Gigalith, Lairon, and Furfrou might inflict on Gourgeist-L. In turn, Gourgeist-L's Attack-lowering burns and physical bulk give Wigglytuff more opportunities to use Wish. Ice-types like Vanilluxe, Glaceon, and Glalie are dangerous for Gourgeist-L, so it benefits from the support of Pokemon like Magmar, Pignite, and Klang.

Similarly, status like burn and poison can heavily limit setup opportunities, as Jumpluff does not run any recovery.</p> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Electabuzz and to a lesser extent Magmar, despite being slower than Jumpluff, can still pose a great threat to it due to their immunity to Sleep Powder. Electabuzz has the added benefit of resisting Acrobatics, making it a more reliable Jumpluff answer than Magmar, which needs to be at full health to avoid a 2HKO. Magmar may sometimes run Flame Body to deter Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Jumpluff is third fastest Pokemon in the metagame, both Pokemon that are faster, Persian and Swoobat, can revenge kill it reliably. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Simisage, Frogadier, and Vanilluxe can also outpace Jumpluff and threaten it with super effective coverage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jumpluff serves as one of the most reliable revenge killers and cleaners in ZU thanks to its incredible Speed. Swords Dance remedies its otherwise-measly Attack, which is further helped by Acrobatics's insane power at the cost of not using a held item. Sleep Powder not only provides potential setup opportunities but can shut down Pokemon Jumpluff cannot easily break past such as Lairon, Bronzor, and Trubbish. Seed Bomb complements Acrobatics by nailing Rock-types like Gigalith and Carbink. U-turn lets Jumpluff safely escape from some of the aforementioned poor matchups while keeping momentum, while Encore can force slower Pokemon to lock into undesirable moves, creating setup turns, and shut down opposing setup Pokemon like Duosion and Swalot that can otherwise outmatch Jumpluff.</p> <p>Jumpluff cannot deal with Steel-types like Bronzor, Klang, and Lairon on its own; Fire-types and Ground-types like Pignite and Whiscash can all handle them with ease and also appreciate being brought in safely by U-turn. Even with Seed Bomb, Rock-types are physically bulky enough to withstand multiple hits from Jumpluff, and Gigalith in particular poses a great threat because it can OHKO Jumpluff in return; therefore, answers to Rock-types such as Vibrava, Marshtomp, and Scraggy make for great partners. These Pokemon also provide additional benefits: Vibrava's access to Defog allows for easier setup opportunities, Marshtomp's Stealth Rock helps weaken foes into Jumpluff's effective cleaning range, and Scraggy can remove important items like Eviolite and Rocky Helmet to aid Jumpluff's sweep. Spikes setters such as Quilladin, Whirlipede, and Glalie are also great partners, as many of Jumpluff's reliable answers are grounded. Special wallbreakers such as Simipour, Simisage, and Magmar can take down physical walls such as Swalot and Dusclops, as well as better dealing with the previously mentioned Steel- and Rock-types, which are typically weaker specially. Teams with many Eviolite-dependent Pokemon like Electabuzz, Bronzor, and Hippopotas can use Jumpluff as a Knock Off absorber. U-turn Jumpluff also makes for a great addition to VoltTurn teams, which feature the likes of Electabuzz, Frogadier, and Dustox.</p>"

Politoed gets a special mention here; Dustox is one of its best switch-ins, since it doesn't have to be concerned with burn from Scald due to Shield Dust. This provides opportunities for it to clear entry hazards with Defog as well as gain momentum with STAB U-turn. Toxic allows Dustox to punish switch-ins like Gigalith and Pignite, a more proactive approach of dealing with its checks in comparison to pivoting. Whirlwind forces out sweepers like Klang and Scraggy, and it can also gain momentum when drawing in a Pokemon that cannot threaten Dustox with a subsequent U-turn. Sludge Bomb is another option Dustox may opt for to spread status while also nailing the Grass-types it checks like Servine, Simisage, and Gogoat. Physically defensive and mixed defensive investments work well too, given the appropriate team support.

Physical walls like Gigalith and Carbink make for a good core to pair with Dustox because it takes on the Grass- and Water-types that threaten them while they handle the Normal- and Fire-types that threaten Dustox. Offensive pivots like Electabuzz and Furfrou also generate momentum in tandem with Dustox.

As this set is physically offensive, Huntail has a more difficult time breaking down physical walls like Swalot and Klang due to its more limited physical movepool. Special wallbreakers like Vanilluxe and Magmar can soften these walls so Huntail can have an easier time cleaning late-game; these Pokemon can also help deal with Grass-types like Gourgeist formes and Servine, especially if Huntail is running Return over Ice Beam. In return, it can take on walls that they struggle with, like Dustox and Carbink. Grass-type checks like Swalot and Jumpluff can make it easier for Huntail to sweep. Grass-types like Servine and Sawsbuck themselves make for great teammates, as they can help Huntail check Water-types like Politoed and Seaking. Entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Carbink are appreciated so Huntail can achieve benchmarks like the OHKO on Electabuzz at +2 Attack. On rain builds, fellow rain sweepers like Golduck and Beartic work well with Huntail through their sweeping or wallbreaking capabilities, and rain setters like Volbeat and Murkrow allow Huntail to continue threatening the opposition.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A faster set with Taunt + Toxic can shut down some walls and switch-ins, but it comes at the cost of Pignite's coverage and defensive capabilities, which are generally more valuable. Power-Up Punch is an alternative option on the tank set to potentially pick off a weakened target and then use the extra power to sweep with a stronger Sucker Punch. Flame Charge with extra Speed investment allows Pignite to potentially clean late-game, although Curse + Sucker Punch offers a more reliable vehicle to success. Wild Charge nails Water-types attempting to switch in, although all notable examples will be just as vulnerable to Superpower, which also comes with the perk of lacking recoil. Roar works as some bulky setup sweepers like Scraggy and Iron Defense Klang can become too hard for Pignite to break itself. Bulldoze is helpful for the mirror and works like Flame Charge to a lesser extent, getting the jump on faster attackers like Magmar and Electabuzz. Sometimes, the offensive potential of Blaze can be worth forfeiting Pignite's ability to easily switch into Vanilluxe with Thick Fat, especially given its good synergy with Flare Blitz recoil. RestTalk over Toxic and Sucker Punch on an offensive set is great for helping Pignite stick around while making it arguably the best long-term answer to Bronzor. Although RestTalk makes Pignite much bulkier, it leaves it vulnerable to being revenge KOed more easily. Heavy Slam is a good option to OHKO a common counter in Carbink.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Vibrava, Hippopotas, and Marshtomp are hard for Pignite to trade hits against, even if they lose their Eviolite or get poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types do not want to switch in against Pignite's strong coverage, but the likes of Simipour and Whiscash can come in against its Fire-type attacks and force it out. Politoed's bulk and access to Protect and Encore makes it one of the hardest checks to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Swalot</strong>: Physically defensive Swalot is a pain for Pignite to get through, especially when Flare Blitz recoil is compounded with Rocky Helmet chip damage. Some variants also carry Encore to shut down Curse Pignite.</p> <p><strong>Duosion</strong>: Duosion's overall bulk and access to STAB Psychic and Future Sight make it a good check to Pignite, even absorbing its strong Flare Blitz thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Faster, hard-hitting attackers like Life Orb Murkrow and Choice Specs Electabuzz can force out Pignite. Even some of the wallbreakers that Pignite can discourage, like Vanilluxe and Magmar, run coverage like Hidden Power Ground and Psychic, respectively, that can 2HKO Pignite.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As a bulky offensive threat, Pignite ends up being the offensive glue that holds a lot of teams together, with its good all-around bulk and solid offensive coverage always coming in handy. Many Grass-types have a hard time trading hits and preventing Pignite from coming in against them, and many other walls and sweepers such as Dustox, Bronzor, Klang, and Scraggy all struggle versus it. Sucker Punch means that even when Pignite is at low HP, it can still pose a threat to revenge killers, especially frailer examples like Swoobat and Pikachu. For bulkier targets it fails to break through, like Regenerator Duosion, Marshtomp, and Hippopotas, Pignite can still threaten them with Toxic on the switch in. Thick Fat is an asset for discouraging STAB attacks from wallbreakers like Choice Specs Magmar and Vanilluxe. The given EV spread outspeeds Adamant Lairon, although a faster spread to outspeed Adamant Klang is also viable.</p> <p>Grass- and Water-types are some of the best teammates for Pignite, as they complete the Fire / Water / Grass core. Servine and Politoed work on bulky offense, being able to spread status and pivot Pignite in on Grass-types like Ivysaur and Gogoat. Alternatively, the likes of Simisage and Frogadier support Pignite with their revenge killing capabilities, and in return it forces heavy hits on important walls. Duosion's Future Sight support is a great way to make sure Pignite will net hefty damage, as walls like Swalot and Trubbish stop being safe switch-ins to Superpower. Pivots like Volt Switch Electabuzz and Klang can force out Water-types and bring Pignite in on susceptible special walls. Klang, Krokorok, and Lairon appreciate Pignite's ability to break down defensive walls with its powerful STAB moves, giving them an easier time to sweep in the endgame. Entry hazard removers like Vibrava and Dustox are appreciated to reduce the amount of chip damage Pignite takes, since it already deals with Flare Blitz recoil.</p>"

It can then recover with Rest late-game and start to set up with Sleep Talk + Curse. Given the lack of viable Flash Fire users, Fire Punch suffices as Pignite's only attack. Brick Break can also work either over Sleep Talk or, seldomly, by itself over Fire Punch, but being unable to force out Gourgiest-L and being completely walled by Ghost-types is usually too much of a liability.</p> <p>Water-types like Politoed and Whiscash make for great teammates, as they can eliminate the Rock-types like Gigalith and Carbink that Pignite struggles to set up against.

Ivysaur and Servine can remove items with Knock Off, spread status, and force out Water-types like Huntail and Politoed, making it easier for Pignite to sweep, and in return they rely on Pignite to tank the strong Fire- and Ice-type attacks that force them out. Clerics like Meganium and Wigglytuff make Pignite less reliant on Rest for recovery and relieve its role as a status absorber.</p>"

Similarly, Synthesis can be used over a coverage move on the mixed all-out attacker set to provide Simisage with more longevity. Substitute can be used over Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ice on the Nasty Plot set to avoid status against Gourgeist-L and Servine as well as protect against revenge killers like Persian, Fufrou, and Choice Scarf Magmar. However, Simisage typically wants coverage to beat Grass- and Steel-types. Choice Scarf Simisage can run Superpower or Gunk Shot over Leaf Storm to revenge kill Dragon Dance Scraggy, Shift Gear Klang, and Choice Scarf Vanilluxe or to have a way around Servine and Gogoat. However, being locked into Superpower or Gunk Shot is easy to exploit, so Simisage usually doesn't run them. Choice Specs can be used instead of Choice Scarf to turn Simisage into a special wallbreaker not reliant on Nasty Plot. However, Choice Specs Simisage is not that consistent because it is quite prediction reliant and still struggles against common Pokemon such as Swalot, Servine, Dustox, and Pignite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types like Swalot and Trubbish switch into Simisage comfortably and can set up on it or set up entry hazards in Trubbish's case. Other Poison-types like Ivysaur, Dustox, and Whirlipede can switch into Simisage and force it out, but they dislike losing their item from Knock Off and are threatened by Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist-L, Servine, Gogoat, and Meganium pivot into Leaf Storm and really only fear Gunk Shot or +2 Hidden Power Ice from Simisage's Nasty Plot set. As such, these Grass-types can often switch into Simisage to scout its set. Moreover, Gourgeist-L, Meganium, and Servine can cripple Simisage with status, whereas Bulk Up Gogoat can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fast Pokemon like Persian, Jumpluff, and Furfrou outspeed and revenge kill Life Orb Simisage. More niche Pokemon like Choice Specs Swoobat and Emolga outspeed it and can OHKO Life Orb variants. Choice Scarf users such as Simipour, Frogadier, Magmar, and Vanilluxe can also revenge kill Simisage from full HP. However, Choice Scarf Simisage can threaten these Pokemon if locked into the right coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Simisage has poor bulk and lacks recovery, so even resisted attacks like Electabuzz's Volt Switch and Hippopotas's Earthquake put in KO range for faster attackers. Simisage wears itself down quickly because it is vulnerable to all entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Pignite</strong>: Outside of Superpower and Hidden Power Flying, Pignite tanks Simisage's attacks and OHKOes in return.

Superpower helps Simisage punch through Steel-types like Klang and Lairon as well as Pokemon like Scraggy, non-Choice Scarf Vanilluxe, and Sawsbuck that would otherwise force Simisage out. Rock Slide rounds out Simisage's coverage, allowing it to hit would-be switch-ins such as Dustox, Jumpluff, Magmar, and Pidgeot. Gunk Shot can be used over either Superpower or Rock Slide so Simisage can break through bulky Grass-types like Servine, Gogoat, and Meganium. Most of Simisage's coverage is physical, and Leaf Storm is absurdly strong anyway, so Simisage prefers maximum Attack over Special Attack.</p> <p>Simisage has poor bulk and is easy to wear down due to Life Orb recoil, so pair it with pivots. Offensively, pivots such as Electabuzz, Frogadier, and Furfrou are excellent partners. Electabuzz pressures faster Pokemon like Jumpluff and Furfrou that threaten Simisage, while Simisage beats Ground-types for Electabuzz. Similarly, Frogadier and Furfrou break through Simisage's Fire- and Poison-type checks like Pignite and Swalot. Defensive pivots like Dustox and Vibrava cover Simisage's weakness to Poison- and Fire-types, bring it in safely with a slow U-turn, and remove entry hazards with Defog to increase its longevity. Simisage struggles to break through bulky Poison-types like Swalot, Trubbish, and Ivysaur, so pair it with Ground- and Psychic-types like Krokorok, Marshtomp, and Duosion. Similarly, Water-types like Politoed, Simipour, and Huntail are solid partners because they check Fire-types for Simisage. Simisage forces many switches, so entry hazard setters such as Gigalith, Lairon, and Whirlipede provide additional chip damage and help Simisage break more effectively. For example, Simisage can OHKO Jumpluff and Dustox with Rock Slide after Stealth Rock damage. Faster Pokemon like Persian, Jumpluff, and Furfrou are huge threats to Simisage, so pair it with defensive Pokemon like Carbink and Klang that switch into them.

Giga Drain gives it more longevity when it's time to break or sweep. It offsets Life Orb recoil, making Simisage more difficult to take down. Focus Blast is used to hit Steel-types like Klang and Bronzor and can OHKO bulky Pokemon like Scraggy and Pignite after a Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Ice is preferred over Hidden Power Flying because while both hit Grass-types, Hidden Power Ice also hits Flying- and Dragon-types such as Pidgeot and Dragonair. Hidden Power Flying can be used to nail Dustox, Whirlipede, and Pignite, but it fails to OHKO Jumpluff like Hidden Power Ice does.</p> <p>This set is countered by bulky Poison-types like Swalot and Trubbish, so Psychic- and Ground-types like Duosion, Krokorok, and Marshtomp make for good partners. In return, Simisage breaks down Scraggy and Water-types like Politoed and Golduck for them. Simisage helps setup sweepers like Huntail, Shift Gear Klang, and Dragon Dance Scraggy clean in the late-game because it tears holes in teams. It should be paired with powerful attackers like Choice Band Furfrou, Pignite, and Murkrow to break through walls like Dustox, Swalot, Servine, and Ivysaur for it to break or clean. Entry hazard setters such as Gigalith, Lairon, Whirlipede, and Glalie make for good partners, as they provide necessary chip damage. For example, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes ensure the OHKO on Dustox with +2 Hidden Power Flying if it is used. Because of its poor bulk, pair Simisage with slow pivots such as Dustox, Vibrava, and Klang to bring it in safely. It is pressured by faster Pokemon such as Persian, Jumpluff, and Swoobat, so bulky Pokemon like Carbink, Rocky Helmet Swalot, and Bronzor make for good partners because they switch into these threats. Lastly, Water-types like Politoed, Simipour, and Frogadier make for good partners because they check Fire-types for it, while Simisage pressures Electabuzz and Gogoat for them.</p>"

Seed Bomb is its primary way to revenge kill offensive Pokemon like Electabuzz and Simipour. Gunk Shot can be used over Seed Bomb to hit Grass-types like Servine, Meganium, and Sawsbuck. Knock Off gives it more utility to cripple incoming switch-ins like Pignite and Bronzor by removing their Eviolite. Rock Slide is used to 2HKO Dustox, Jumpluff, and Pidgeot after Stealth Rock. Maximum Attack is needed because most of Simisage's coverage is physical. A Naive nature ensures Leaf Storm's damage output isn't lowered.</p> <p>Simisage fits best on balance and offensive teams that need a revenge killer that pressures Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types alongside its diverse coverage. As such, Pokemon like Pignite, Furfrou, and Electabuzz appreciate its ability to pressure those types of Pokemon. It has very limited opportunities to switch in, so pivots like Persian, Frogadier, and Dustox are great partners. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Magmar, Choice Specs Vanilluxe, and Choice Band Furfrou break down teams for it to revenge kill or clean late-game. These wallbreakers appreciate its ability to revenge kill faster Pokemon so they can wallbreak more easily. Entry hazard setters like Gigalith, Whirlipede, and Bronzor make for good partners because they provide chip damage and defensive support. For example, Simisage can OHKO Choice Scarf Magmar with Rock Slide after Stealth Rock. Gigalith checks Swalot and Furfrou, Whirlipede checks bulky Grass-types, and Bronzor walls Jumpluff and Dustox. Similarly, entry hazard removers like Dustox, Sandshrew, and Pidgeot improve its longevity because it is vulnerable to residual chip. Bulky Pokemon like Carbink, Politoed, and Duosion provide solid defensive support for it, as they take on Normal- and Fire-types and absorb status in Duosion's case. Lastly, Simisage provides solid support to offensive Pokemon such as Simipour, Vanilluxe, and Swoobat because it can use Knock Off to remove Eviolite from their checks like Servine, Pignite, and Bronzor.</p>"

Knock Off also removes Eviolite from Hippopotas and Quilladin, which allows Krokorok to 2HKO them with Earthquake and Assurance with one layer of Spikes, respectively. Earthquake OHKOes Pignite and deals heavy damage to other Dark-resistant Pokemon like Carbink, Scraggy, and Wigglytuff. Pursuit OHKOes Duosion and Swoobat that are trying to switch out and heavily chips Bronzor. Assurance is Krokorok's strongest option against incoming switch-ins like Jumpluff, Politoed, and Furfrou when entry hazards are up, while Stone Edge is Krokorok's best option for Flying-types like Jumpluff and Pidgeot.

Alternatively, Thunder Wave can punish foes like Servine and offensive Klang sets that may attempt to boost on Duosion.

Magic Guard is an alternative that allows Duosion to bypass residual damage from entry hazards and status, although this worsens its functionality as a pivot.</p> <p>Duosion pairs well with Pokemon that take advantage of its Future Sight; some of the most notable examples are Pignite, Simisage, and Scraggy, as they can all hit Dark- and Steel-types for super effective damage and appreciate Future Sight threatening Poison- and Fighting-types switching in.

Some examples that match up well against Dark-types are Pignite, Carbink, and Wigglytuff. These Pokemon also make for good partners for non-Acid Armor variants, as they can switch into potential revenge killers like mixed Simisage and Choice Band Krokorok. Non-Acid Armor Duosion also appreciates help from Pignite and Hippopotas to help it with Klang, since Klang will win the setup war. If you opt for Psychic over Psyshock, then Steel- and Dark-types such as Klang, Lairon, Scraggy, and Zweilous cover Calm Mind Carbink and opposing Duosion, respectively. To have an easier time setting up late-game, preserving Duosion's Eviolite is pivotal, so Sticky Hold Pokemon like Swalot and Trubbish make for good teammates. They also have the added benefit of spreading status via Toxic and Toxic Spikes, which is another means for Duosion to stall out Dark-types if necessary. Wallbreakers like Vanilluxe and Magmar can take advantage of defensive phazers and Taunt users such as Hippopotas, Meganium, and Quilladin, which are typically troublesome for Duosion's setup attempts.</p>"

Quilladin has a deep movepool of coverage options like Poison Jab for opposing Grass-types, but other coverage moves tend to be weak, Quilladin struggles to fit them, and they offer very little extra coverage. Super Fang can deal a lot of damage to healthy targets and help Quilladin stallbreak better with Taunt, but it struggles to fit this move over coverage for its checks.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Furfrou can opt for a Choice Scarf to outspeed the likes of Persian, Swoobat, and Electabuzz; however, it then greatly loses out on its wallbreaking ability. Thunder Wave is an option to cripple fast targets like Sawsbuck, Jumpluff, and Klang, making them easier for teammates to take down. However, Furfrou usually prefers to pivot out of them and bring in teammates to keep up the momentum. Facade is an option in its last slot for a very strong STAB move if Furfrou takes a Toxic or gets burned. However, it prefers to have one of the other two options, as they give it a more reliable way to wallbreak. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes Lairon but compromises Furfrou's bulk and doesn't hit other targets hard enough.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Furfrou has nothing to hit Bronzor, Lairon, and offensive Klang for significant damage, while they can all chip it back. The best Furfrou can do is pivot out of them to bring in a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gourgeist-L and Dusclops wall Furfrou, since they are immune to Return. Gourgeist-L can be hit with Toxic, making it easier to take down over the course of the game, but Dusclops can just heal off any status with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and status greatly limit Furfrou's role as a pivot, since they reduce its chances to come in. Rocky Helmet from the likes of Swalot, Carbink, and Gigalith can deal additional chip damage, but Swalot can't take Return well, and Carbink and Gigalith don't do well against Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Electabuzz and Swoobat naturally outspeed Furfrou, while Frogadier, Simipour, and Magmar outspeed it with a Choice Scarf and threaten to take it out after some chip damage due to its low special bulk.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Furfrou is a great wallbreaker with its solid Attack, Speed, and coverage moves to take down common walls. U-turn gives Furfrou the ability to pivot out from the likes of Bronzor, Dusclops, and Lairon, bringing in a teammate that matches up favorably against them. Sucker Punch is great for picking up KOs against faster foes like Swoobat, Persian, and Electabuzz after some chip damage; however, this is usually for endgame scenarios, as Furfrou wants to avoid being taken advantage of if it's locked into Sucker Punch. Iron Tail allows Furfrou to 2HKO common switch-ins such as, Gigalith and Carbink. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon that Furfrou wouldn't be able to take on otherwise like Gourgeist-L and Hippopotas, giving Furfrou an easier time dealing with them later in the game.</p> <p>Furfrou forms a great pivoting core with Frogadier and Electabuzz, helping each other chip down their checks. It has trouble dealing with Steel-types like Bronzor, Klang, and Lairon, so it prefers to pivot out of them and bring in teammates like Pignite and Magmar. Hippopotas and Gourgeist-L can easily take on Furfrou, making it rely on partners like Vanilluxe and Politoed to come in and force them out. Furfrou appreciates Knock Off users like Servine, Scraggy, and Simipour, since they can weaken physical walls that rely on Eviolite like Quilladin and Hippopotas. Physical cleaners like Shell Smash Huntail, Dragon Dance Scraggy, and Choice Scarf Krokorok appreciate Furfrou's ability to break through physical walls like Carbink, Swalot, and Duosion for them.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If paired with a Stealth Rock user like Bronzor or Hippopotas, Carbink can opt for Iron Defense instead of Stealth Rock to become a threatening setup sweeper that is hard to take down when it starts boosting. Carbink can use Earth Power over Calm Mind on its physical wall set to catch the likes of Lairon, Magmar, and Swalot off guard, even if it does middling damage. It can also choose to run Power Gem instead of Calm Mind to better hit Jumpluff and Dustox. However, Carbink is incredibly passive without Calm Mind, so that's the preferred option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klang and Lairon can come in on Carbink's Moonblast safely and threaten to OHKO it back with their Steel-type STAB moves, although Lairon has to be wary of getting outsped and OHKOed by Earth Power from offensive Stealth Rock Carbink. Bronzor completely walls Carbink and can whittle it down with Toxic and Psywave while shrugging off its +6 Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Frogadier, Politoed, Simipour, and special Huntail can take a Moonblast fine enough and threaten Carbink back for big damage with their STAB moves. Seaking can sit on offensive Carbink and beat it. However, these checks struggle to take down Carbink if it has used a couple of Calm Minds. Meanwhile, Marshtomp and Whiscash can threaten heavy damage on Carbink, 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippopotas, Marshtomp, and Whiscash can all outdamage and take down Carbink with their STAB Earthquakes. Choice Band Krokorok can 2HKO Carbink with Earthquake, while the other Krokorok sets only 3HKO it, meaning it always win one-on-one if it catches Carbink with Earthquake on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Grass-types</strong>: Servine, Gogoat, Jumpluff, and Simisage can boost and take down Carbink while taking minimal damage. However, Jumpluff needs to watch out for offensive Carbink, since Carbink can 2HKO it with Power Gem.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Carbink can be heavily damaged or even OHKOed by Steel-type coverage moves like Furfrou and Mightyena's Iron Tail and Pignite and Gigalith's Heavy Slam.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Carbink is one of the tier's premier physical walls due to its great role compression, ability to check Normal- and Fire-types and Scraggy, and access to Stealth Rock. STAB Moonblast does notably well against the likes of Vibrava, Scraggy, and Krokorok while also hitting the majority of the tier neutrally. Calm Mind is used as a win condition and to minimize damage from many weaker special threats like Electabuzz and defensive Ivysaur, which would take advantage of it otherwise. Carbink can switch in on a plethora of Pokemon like Scraggy, Pignite, and Persian, so Rest is important to let it consistently check them. Rocky Helmet is the item of choice to further help chip down the aforementioned Pokemon and punish U-turn and Knock Off users, on top of the Stealth Rock damage they take upon entry.</p> <p>Balance and stall teams look to Carbink as an option for a Stealth Rock setter and physical wall. Carbink struggles to perform well against Steel- and Grass-types like Klang and Servine, so Pignite, Swalot, and Magmar all make good partners to help alleviate this. Other defensive walls like Bronzor and Duosion appreciate Carbink's ability to take on Scraggy. Bronzor, as well as Grass-types like Ivysaur and Gogoat, also appreciates Carbink's ability to take hits from Pignite and Magmar. Carbink pairs well with offensive Pokemon like Simipour, Sawsbuck, and Murkrow because it switches into and chips down faster pivots like Persian and Furfrou with Rocky Helmet. Carbink also greatly benefits from clerics like Meganium and Wigglytuff, since they give Carbink an easier time using Rest.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Carbink can opt to run an offensive Stealth Rock set that can threaten entry hazard removers like Vibrava and Dustox with its STAB moves. Earth Power is great coverage to surprise Pokemon that can normally switch in on its defensive set, OHKOing Lairon and 3HKOing Swalot and offensive Klang. Power Gem can safely 2HKO Whirlipede and Dustox after Stealth Rock, which is especially helpful when the former would otherwise set up a full set of Spikes. Rocky Helmet is to help chip down physical threats that Carbink can switch in on like Pignite and Persian. Without a Modest nature, Carbink can't safely hit any of the damage ranges above; it doesn't need more Speed to perform its job regardless.</p> <p>Carbink does best on balance teams looking for a threatening Stealth Rock user that can keep its entry hazards up. Carbink is completely walled by Bronzor, so teammates like Scraggy and Krokorok are appreciated to help force it out. Frailer teammates like Simisage and Murkrow appreciate Carbink's ability to switch in safely against Normal-types like Persian and Furfrou. Water-types like Simipour and Frogadier greatly threaten Carbink, so teammates like Politoed, Servine, and Ivysaur can help alleviate this issue. These same Grass-types appreciate Carbink switching into Magmar and Pignite's STAB moves. Opposing Servine, Ivysaur, and the like also threaten Carbink and hardly take any damage in return, so Swalot and Klang make for good partners to handle them. Swalot and Klang also do well at absorbing status for Carbink, since poison and burn can quickly wear it down. Although Carbink can greatly damage it on its switch in with Earth Power, Klang can still destroy Carbink the following turn unless Carbink has teammates like Pignite, Magmar, and Electabuzz to come in and take the hit for it. Bronzor and Duosion are completely helpless against Scraggy, so they appreciate having Carbink as a partner to counter it. Klang, Huntail, and Scraggy appreciate the Stealth Rock support that Carbink provides, helping them reach easier KO ranges against Electabuzz, Sawsbuck, and Dusclops, respectively.</p>"
