Aside from a stronger Fairy-type STAB move, a slightly better Speed tier, and access to some nifty utility moves like Will-O-Wisp and Healing Wish, Gardevoir is entirely outclassed by Tapu Lele, which can run an item, doesn't take up your Mega slot, and has stronger Psychic-type moves thanks to Psychic Terrain. It is also outclassed by Mega Alakazam, which is much faster and stronger and has access to recovery.</p>",

However, there is still little to no reason to use it over Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam.</p>"}},

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's near-exclusive access to Magnet Pull gives it a very unique and valuable niche in the OU metagame as a trapper and eliminator of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela. It also functions as a solid revenge killer with Choice Scarf, being able to check a number of dangerous Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and weakened Celesteela. However, its lackluster Speed stat, even with a Choice Scarf, means that it typically struggles to retain its utility after it has trapped what it aims to trap; it is often forced to take a hit before it can attack with its other sets and doesn't have recovery to offset this damage. Its good set of resistances is somewhat undermined by its weakness to three common types in Ground, Fighting, and Fire, which makes it easy for dangerous Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X to KO and leaves it unable to safely trap Heatran and Excadrill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest is an option if you're desperate for compression, but is often an inferior method of using Magnezone as it needs a lot of power to reliably trap some of the defensive Steel-types and a Choice Scarf to effectively trap Swords Dance Kartana. Chople Berry can be used to check Psychic-type Focus Blast users like Alakazam and Tapu Lele as well as trap the extremely rare fast Superpower Mega Scizor, allowing Magnezone to either eliminate them with one of its attacks or cripple them with Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill are significantly faster than Magnezone and OHKO with Earthquake, with the latter two also resisting Flash Cannon. While less common, Gastrodon takes pitiful damage from anything that Magnezone can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran doesn't appreciate switching into Thunderbolt, but it OHKOes all variants of Magnezone with Magma Storm or Earth Power. Volcarona and Mega Charizard X easily use Magnezone for setup after it traps something; Mega Charizard X resists every move that Magnezone packs, allowing it to set up with ease, whereas Volcarona resists everything other than Magnezone's Electric-type coverage and is extremely dangerous to give setup opportunities due to its very limited counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny are significantly faster than Magnezone and OHKO with High Jump Kick. Mega Heracross also achieves an OHKO with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes pathetic damage from anything that Magnezone can throw at it and can use the switch that the Magnezone player is forced to make to utilize any of its support options.</p>",

      "Substitute Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is mainly intended to take advantage of Celesteela using Protect, but it is also nice for when other Steel-types give Magnezone a free turn or when you are unsure about which attack to choose, especially since the likes of Ferrothorn and some Mega Scizor variants are unable to break it easily. Thunderbolt can be used in conjunction with Electrium Z in order to OHKO Pokemon like Celesteela or offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock. Flash Cannon can be used in conjunction with Steelium Z over Electrium Z to get a KO on incoming Landorus-T, Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and Mega Latios with Stealth Rock up. Hidden Power Fire is utilized in order to trap and eliminate Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are straightforward, boosting Magnezone's damage output while making it as fast as possible, allowing Magnezone to outrun Pokemon such as uninvested Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, Suicune, and specially defensive Heatran. A Modest nature is used in order to maximize damage output. This allows Magnezone to always KO offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock and almost always do so against Shift Gear Magearna if using Electrium Z. Additionally, Modest nature assures an OHKO on offensive Landorus-T from full and almost always OHKOes Garchomp, defensive Landorus-T, or Mega Latios after Stealth Rock if using Steelium Z. The only reasons to use Timid are assuring Magnezone outruns bulky Landorus-T and Choice Band Tyranitar, but you lose out on most of the KOs Magnezone gets with Steelium Z and Electrium Z, and Magnezone simply doesn't stay in on these Pokemon unless a Substitute is up, so this is rarely worthwhile. On the topic of the aforementioned items, Steelium Z is used when you do not truly need to OHKO Steel-types like Celesteela and Heatran, and would prefer to enable Magnezone to eliminate incoming offensive pivots. Electrium Z is used when your focus is solely is upon abusing Magnet Pull to the best of Magnezone's ability. An EV spread consisting of 136 HP / 24 Def / 156 SpA / 192 Spe can be run to take a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The goals of this set are to eliminate any Steel-type that Magnezone may encounter and do as much damage as possible when not facing a Steel-type. Moreover, utilization of Substitute to make Magnezone less prediction reliant is key, and this should be kept in mind when trying to make the most use of Magnezone in battle. Substitute is also useful when you expect the opponent to use moves such as Protect, Sucker Punch, and Leech Seed. It is best to bring Magnezone into battle when you expect a vulnerable Steel-type like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, or Celesteela to come in. Alternatively, if they manage to get in, switching Magnezone in to trap them is a good idea if you believe they will stay in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that abuse the removal of opposing Steel-types, particularly Celesteela, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, are generally ideal. The best abusers of this tend to be strong physical attackers like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Pokemon that simply do not fare well against Steel-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Latios, and Mega Diancie can all work well alongside this variant of Magnezone. Finally, if you are using Steelium Z as your item, then you should put specific emphasis on luring in Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor when building. Fire-types like Heatran and Rock-types like Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar take advantage of this. On the contrary, if you are using Electrium Z, then the same can be said for removal of Celesteela and integrating Pokemon that benefit from it, such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele and Mega Latios, into to your team.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Magnezone's primary STAB move to use against Celesteela and Skarmory. When foes that are resistant or immune to it are eliminated, it can do a decent amount of damage thanks to Magnezone's stellar Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire is very important in disposing Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Flash Cannon provides a neutral hit against Ground-types while doing a significant amount of damage to Tyranitar, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele. Volt Switch completes the set to allow Magnezone to keep up momentum provided, of course, it isn't used against an opposing Ground-type. Volt Switch is a great move to use in the event that you predict a foe that resists Electric will switch into Magnezone such as Tangrowth or Mega Venusaur. Thunder Wave can be used over Thunderbolt to cripple and emergency check foes it can't immediately threaten, such as Mega Latias, Mega Alakazam, Serperior, and Victini.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with a Choice Scarf helps Magnezone reach 360 Speed to outspeed Kartana and everything up to Serperior. 4 HP and 4 Defense EVs allow Magnezone to live an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana from full HP after Stealth Rock damage. Magnet Pull is the preferred ability to prevent opposing Steel-types from switching out of Magnezone as well as assisting in fulfilling its role.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone isn't an excellent revenge killer; however, it should be seen as a Pokemon that can trap and dispose of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. There will be circumstances where locking onto Thunderbolt isn't optimal, as it draws in Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. For circumstances such as this, Flash Cannon is the recommended move to lock Magnezone onto. Thanks to Magnezone's solid typing, it can be used in emergency situations to take a hit for its teammates. Magnezone's typing is solid against threats such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele, though be aware of their coverage moves such as Earth Power, Superpower, and Focus Blast, respectively. Magnezone's underwhelming Speed tier does put it to failure against threats such as Greninja, so bear this in mind when seeking out teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Landorus-T is one of Magnezone's greatest partners. On top of having a Ground-type immunity to switch into Earthquake, Landorus-T has Intimidate and U-turn to help further check opposing Pokemon. In best-case scenarios, defensive Landorus-T can be used in a dire emergency versus Kartana to weaken its Attack with Intimidate, U-turn into Magnezone, and secure Kartana's demise thanks to Magnezone's Magnet Pull. Stealth Rock also draws in Defog variants of Skarmory and Mega Scizor onto the field, since Landorus-T has an insignificant threat level against them. Swords Dance Gliscor is a notable teammate as it appreciates Magnezone trapping and removing troublesome Steel-types like Celesteela, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Swords Dance Kartana, the latter of which can easily overwhelm Gliscor and the balance teams it is commonly found in. Magnezone being slower than threats such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam leaves it and its teammates needing Pokemon that can effectively tackle faster Pokemon without many issues. A great example of a Pokemon that can handle Greninja and Mega Alakazam effectively is Assault Vest Magearna, which has excellent typing and great special bulk while sporting Volt Switch to help with momentum and STAB Fleur Cannon to discourage Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp from switching into it to block Volt Switch. Assault Vest Tangrowth is a solid example that can handle most variants of Greninja and Tapu Koko. Thanks to its pure Grass typing, Tangrowth can also withstand Ground-type attacks aimed at it. Choice Scarf Magnezone does lack a significant amount of power, but trapping Steel-types can help certain wallbreakers create massive dents in the opponent's teams. Kyurem-B and Manaphy greatly appreciate the removal of Ferrothorn and Kartana. Mega Diancie, Mega Latios, Calm Mind Clefable, and Tapu Bulu are Pokemon that support Celesteela and Mega Scizor being eliminated as well.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most reliable STAB move, letting it successfully trap the likes of Celesteela and Skarmory while still hitting walls that don't resist it hard. Hidden Power Fire is key for trapping Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Flash Cannon lets Magnezone heavily punish Ground-type switch-ins, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor; it also throttles Tapu Bulu, which is usually a solid answer to Electric-types. Finally, Volt Switch lets Magnezone pivot out against Grass-types that can avoid a 2HKO from Flash Cannon, such as Tangrowth, Assault Vest Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur. Volt Switch can also generate as well as maintain momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magnet Pull lets Magnezone fulfill its role as a trapper, enabling it to remove and KO the likes of Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Choice Specs gives Magnezone immediate power behind its moves, notably taking Celesteela and Ferrothorn down more quickly, as the former could potentially beat Magnezone in a one-on-one situation between Leech Seed and Protect if healthy, whereas the latter could otherwise stack layers of Spikes against it. Maximum investment in Special Attack alongside a Modest nature allows Magnezone to hit as hard as possible, most notably having a chance to 2HKO Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock. 252 Speed EVs let it tie with opposing Modest Magnezone while still getting the jump on several important foes, such as Mega Scizor and most Tyranitar. A Timid nature could be used to outrun Landorus-T with little Speed investment and Adamant Tyranitar with maximum Speed investment, but these two are somewhat rare, making the trade-off more often than not suboptimal while losing out on potentially 2HKOing Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur. An EV spread consisting of 136 HP / 24 Def / 156 SpA / 192 Spe can be run to take a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to put your opponent into a position in which Magnezone can trap the Steel-types it should, namely Celesteela, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Switching into Magnezone as you expect them to go into their Steel-type is a solid option; similarly, sacrificing an expendable Pokemon to entry hazards or a predicted attack from one of these Steel-types can let Magnezone come in freely. Magnezone can switch into the likes of Clefable and Ferrothorn without getting punished provided they lack Knock Off, so try to take advantage of these Pokemon to switch Magnezone in. However, be careful not to leave it low on HP. When Magnezone is on the field, opponents could attempt to pivot a Ground-type in to block its Volt Switch; under these scenarios, hitting the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor with a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon is more often than not the best bet. If your opponent's team lacks a Ground-type or if their Ground-type has already been taken down, spamming Volt Switch can be a great idea on something Magnezone forces out, as it is surprisingly strong after Choice Specs is factored in. After Steel-types have been successfully trapped and removed, Magnezone can act as a regular wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Partners that appreciate certain Steel-types trapped by Magnezone are great choices. Strong Psychic-types such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios are arguably two of the Pokemon that benefit the most from Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Celesteela being out of the equation, as Mega Alakazam doesn't appreciate taking a Bullet Punch and has some trouble overcoming Celesteela, while Mega Latios can't really break the aforementioned Pokemon without resorting to Hidden Power Fire for Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn or the very odd Thunderbolt for Celesteela. Kartana also notably appreciates Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory getting trapped and KOed, and the same applies to the likes of Mega Pinsir, Tapu Lele, and several others. Pivots that can bring Magnezone in are appreciated, especially those that can bait Steel-types in. For instance, Ash-Greninja can force Ferrothorn in, which gives Magnezone a free switch in, putting a lot of pressure on Ferrothorn's player; of course, Ash-Greninja also appreciates Ferrothorn getting trapped, and Magnezone acts as a decent pivot to most Grass-types that take it on. Clefable is also a solid partner, as it can keep Magnezone healthy with Wish and lure the Steel-types Magnezone likes to trap in, most notably Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as well as Mega Scizor and Celesteela. Knock Off users can remove Skarmory's Shed Shell, allowing Magnezone to trap it.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gallade is a decent wallbreaker thanks to its high Attack stat paired with its strong STAB moves and useful coverage moves in Knock Off and Ice Punch. Having access to Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to boost its Attack stat to even higher levels, which can make it difficult for defensive teams to take on. Knock Off is particularly useful for pressuring bulky Psychic-types that other Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham tend to struggle with. Mega Gallade's good Speed tier allows it to outspeed foes such as Kartana, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele, giving it an edge against some offensive teams. Its decent bulk, notably in Special Defense, gives it setup opportunities against a majority of defensive Pokemon. It also allows Mega Gallade to take a hit from certain offensive threats in a pinch. Unfortunately, it faces competition from other Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, which doesn't rely on setup in order to beat bulkier teams, and Mega Heracross, which has an easier time against stall teams as well as a more useful defensive typing. Despite the fact that its bulk isn't terrible, Mega Gallade's poor defensive typing means it's still prone to being revenge killed by a bunch of common faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T as well as most Choice Scarf users; this is especially true after a Defense drop from Close Combat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drain Punch and Psycho Cut might seem like reasonable options due to their reliability as well as the former move keeping Mega Gallade healthier, but the severe loss in power is too costly for them to be worth using.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Slowbro is one of the best counters to Mega Gallade; it takes a +2 Knock Off with relative ease and can threaten to burn Mega Gallade with Scald or cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Unaware Clefable ignores Mega Gallade's boosts and can take any two attacks, but it has to be careful of switching in if entry hazards are up, especially if it lost its item due to Knock Off. Tapu Fini can live a +2 Zen Headbutt from full HP, but it lacks reliable recovery and dislikes losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Tornadus-T can switch into any attack from Mega Gallade as long as Stealth Rock isn't up and threaten it with Hurricane. Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko outspeed and threaten Mega Gallade, although they struggle to switch in. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Kartana can revenge kill Mega Gallade; however, they can't switch into Mega Gallade's attacks, and losing their item costs them the ability to act as checks.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye can switch into any of Mega Gallade's attacks, take a +2 Knock Off or Ice Punch, and burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Gallade's already high Attack stat, helping it overwhelm bulkier teams and break through defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Mega Latias, and Zapdos. Zen Headbutt is used to beat Pokemon that resist Close Combat like Toxapex, Clefable, and Tapu Fini; it's also the best option against Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor if Ice Punch isn't used. Knock Off allows Mega Gallade to beat bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Mew that would otherwise wall it. Crippling foes by removing their items such as Clefable's Leftovers and Landorus-T's Choice Scarf is also useful in general. Ice Punch targets Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor; it also OHKOes offensive Garchomp without a boost and does more to Mega Latias and Mega Latios than Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Justified is used as Gallade's pre-Mega ability, as it can punish Knock Off from weaker foes such as Toxapex and Tangrowth.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gallade is best used early- to mid-game to break through defensive cores; however, thanks to its solid Speed tier, it can also be used to clean late-game. Be careful when switching it in, as taking too much damage early on can limit its ability to wallbreak. Status conditions, especially paralysis and burn, also limit Mega Gallade's wallbreaking ability, so avoid directly switching it into foes like Rotom-W, Heatran, and Toxapex. It'll also struggle to use Swords Dance safely if it's continuously being worn down. For these reasons, Mega Gallade should be brought in through aggressive switches or VoltTurn support from teammates. Use Swords Dance against weaker defensive Pokemon or on forced switches. It's best to set up if a boost is needed to threaten a defensive switch-in such as Reuniclus or Clefable. If an offensive pivot such as Tornadus-T or Choice Scarf Landorus-T is predicted, hitting them hard with the appropriate move or removing their item with Knock Off is recommended. Knock Off can be spammed early-game against most teams to chip down certain checks and counters, especially since most Pokemon holding a Mega Stone or Z-Crystal won't want to switch in. Mega Gallade's decent Special Defense means it can take attacks like Moonblast from Clefable and Tapu Fini or multiple Ice Beams from Mega Latias and set up against them, trading its health to weaken them for a teammate. Similarly, it can take a hit from offensive foes such as Greninja and Mega Alakazam, sacrificing most of its health to remove or weaken them. However, this should only be done if Mega Gallade's health is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gallade fits best on bulky offense teams with VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Jirachi. The former two can also switch into Tornadus-T. Other wallbreakers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as Choice Band Kartana can weaken physically defensive walls, giving Mega Gallade an easier time cleaning up. The former two also can set up Stealth Rock and pressure common Defog users. Tapu Lele is a particularly useful partner that can assist in wallbreaking while also providing Psychic Terrain to boost Mega Gallade's Zen Headbutt and block priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile and Fake Out from Mega Medicham. Mega Gallade is forced out by Tornadus-T and Mega Alakazam when at low health, so switch-ins to them are necessary. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos can switch into Tornadus-T and generate momentum with Volt Switch. Steel-types like Magearna and Celesteela can switch into Mega Alakazam and also take on Fairy-types for Mega Gallade. If not using Knock Off, Mega Gallade struggles to break through bulky Psychic-types. In this case, Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Weavile are useful partners. They can also use Pursuit to weaken Tornadus-T.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame thanks to a variety of different traits. Its typing and really well-rounded stats make it a good check to top threats within the metagame like Magearna, Mega Mawile, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, because of Z-Moves, it's hard to consistently keep Heatran in check defensively. For example, it can easily overwhelm checks like Garchomp and Mega Alakazam with Steelium Z as well as Tapu Fini and Rotom-W with Grassium Z. It's an exceptionally useful Stealth Rock setter because it can easily pressure common Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. It can also function as a stallbreaker with the combination of Magma Storm, Toxic, and Taunt, only adding to its overall versatility. However, Heatran's popularity is not entirely positive. Because of how popular it is, Pokemon like Magearna, Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele—Pokemon that Heatran is supposed to check—often elect to use super effective coverage moves to handle it. In addition to this, Heatran has no reliable recovery, which makes it pretty easy to wear down with entry hazards and even resisted moves like Hurricane over time. Heatran's middling Speed tier also leaves it susceptible to offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be run instead of Toxic on Firium Z variants to cripple Mega Mawile and Garchomp as well as activate Flash Fire against Mega Sableye teams, but it leaves Heatran completely helpless against Mega Alakazam. Metal Sound allows Heatran to reliably deal with Reuniclus, which can otherwise slowly overwhelm it. It also makes it easy for Heatran to weaken slower Tapu Fini variants. However, it doesn't provide much besides that, so other moves are often preferred. Roar can be run in a few niche circumstances on teams that don't want to give Reuniclus and Substitute Mega Latias free turns to set up with Calm Mind. However, Heatran can't really afford to fit it on its moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can be hard for Heatran to deal with without Bloom Doom or Toxic. Tapu Fini can also prevent Heatran from crippling grounded Pokemon like Garchomp with Toxic. Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados can also switch into Heatran a few times.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor are capable of forcing Heatran out but struggle to consistently switch in because of the threat of a Z-Move. Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tangrowth, and Mega Charizard X often run Ground-type coverage to deal with Heatran, so it should be wary of switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon resist Heatran's Fire-type STAB attack and can pressure it with Earthquake or Earth Power or use it as setup bait. They should be wary of Toxic and Corkscrew Crash, though.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar doesn't mind much from specially defensive Heatran and can pressure it with Earthquake or Pursuit trap it. It should be wary of Z-Move variants, though, because they can easily overwhelm it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade can easily pressure Heatran with their STAB moves but struggle to switch into it. Some Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Tornadus-T often run Fighting-type coverage to pressure Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Heatran lacks any form of reliable recovery and has to rely on Leftovers. Because of this, it's easily worn down by entry hazards, Leech Seed, as well as Knock Off, which makes it more liable to chip damage.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm enables Heatran to trap and take out Chansey, Clefable, and Toxapex in combination with Taunt and do passive damage to other switch-ins. It also enables you to switch to a check of the Pokemon that took Magma Storm more reliably as a result of Magma Storm's trapping, which is especially notable with potential targets of a Pursuit partner like Mega Latios and Mega Latias. Lava Plume can be used over Magma Storm to burn switch-ins such as Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, Toxapex, Mega Latios, and Gliscor before its Toxic Orb has been activated while also having better accuracy and PP at the expense of not being able to trap and KO Pokemon like Chansey, Toxapex, and Clefable. Earth Power allows Heatran to pressure Toxapex after trapping it with Magma Storm while also hitting opposing Heatran, which would otherwise be able to freely switch in and take advantage of it. It also does decent damage to Pokemon like Tyranitar and provides an accurate attack if used with Magma Storm. Protect allows Heatran to gain extra Leftovers recovery, which is important due to its lack of reliable recovery, rack up free Magma Storm damage against switch-ins, safely scout moves from Choice-item Pokemon like Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Greninja, and make High Jump Kick users such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny take recoil damage for trying to take Heatran out. Toxic enables Heatran to pressure several of its usual checks, including Mega Alakazam, Garchomp, Mega Latias, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon, as well as other Pokemon like Volcarona and Tornadus-T and works very well in wearing the opponent down in tandem with Magma Storm's residual damage. Heatran is a fantastic Stealth Rock setter due to its bulk, typing, and ability to check Defog users like Tornadus-T, Mega Latias lacking Ground-type coverage, and Zapdos, giving it many opportunities to set it up. Taunt prevents passive Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Toxapex from healing, making them easier to break past and remove with Magma Storm.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Rotom-W and Mega Mawile while the remaining EVs aid it in checking strong special attackers like Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Tornadus-T. 52 Special Attack EVs can be used to OHKO opposing offensive Heatran with Earth Power. However, this makes Heatran worse at taking on other special attackers, and wearing opposing Heatran down into KO range of Earth Power isn't usually too difficult a task. Heatran should be used as a defensive answer to Pokemon such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Volcarona. However, be cautious of coverage options that can easily break Heatran, such as Hidden Power Ground from Mega Latias and Volcarona or Focus Blast from Magearna.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In the early-game, attempt to spread status with Toxic and Lava Plume to wear the opposing team down over time. Should you be running it, set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon that can't badly cripple Heatran, like Kyurem-B lacking Earth Power, Tapu Koko, and Toxapex, as well as on forced switches. Avoid taking unnecessary damage so Heatran can consistently check what it's supposed to throughout the game. This is especially pertinent against bulkier teams since Heatran is unable to trap Pokemon such as Chansey and Toxapex if it's been weakened too much. Be careful when pivoting into Pokemon that run Knock Off, since they're often Pokemon Heatran is meant to check, like Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Tangrowth, because losing Leftovers hurts its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog users such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, Mega Latias, and Gliscor can clear entry hazards to help improve Heatran's longevity. Tornadus-T is able to check and Defog on threatening Fighting- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T, with Heatran pivoting into strong Ice-type moves for it, while Tapu Fini can check the aforementioned Fighting-types as well as Battle Bond Greninja while appreciating Heatran answering Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn. Mega Latias can better answer Kartana, Ground-types, Water-types like Rotom-W, and opposing Heatran while enjoying Heatran checking Fairy-types like Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Mawile. Gliscor can check and Defog on Ground-types, Toxapex, and opposing Heatran while also pivoting into them and spreading Toxic in tandem with Heatran, while Heatran can pivot into Ice- and Grass-type attacks. Bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn check common Ground- and Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Garchomp, and Gliscor as well as Dragon-types like Mega Latios and Mega Latias while enjoying Heatran taking common Ice-, Flying- and Fire-type attacks for them. Tapu Bulu brings Grassy Terrain, which aids in increasing its longevity and enables it to switch into Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele much more consistently. Ferrothorn is able to provide even more passive damage in tandem with Heatran by setting Spikes, using Leech Seed, and removing foes' Leftovers with Knock Off. Swords Dance Gliscor is a fantastic partner on bulkier teams since it can break through bulky targets like Mega Latias if Heatran spreads status to them. Defensive Water-types such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon share great defensive synergy with Heatran, checking other Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Fini while liking Heatran's ability to pivot into Grass-types. In particular, Toxapex is a great partner due to its ability to switch into Mega Lopunny consistently and spread status with Toxic and Toxic Spikes. Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap checks like Mega Latios, Hidden Power Ground Mega Latias, and Reuniclus if Heatran lacks Taunt while also bringing sandstorm, which further wears down foes in tandem with Heatran's Magma Storm and Toxic; additionally, its ability to run Stealth Rock frees up a moveslot on Heatran. Weavile can also Pursuit trap these targets and Knock Off bulky Pokemon's Leftovers, but lacks Tyranitar's sandstorm and ability to get up Stealth Rock. Both of them benefit from Heatran pivoting into Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko.</p>"

      "Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that traps and wears down switch-ins like Landorus-T and Tapu Fini, which help teammates like Ash-Greninja and Kartana break past them in the long term; it also allows Heatran to trap and eliminate Pokemon such as Toxapex and Chansey, denying them to safely pivot in. Earth Power is crucial for hitting opposing Heatran and Toxapex, all while pressuring Victini, Volcarona, and Mega Diancie. Toxic lets Heatran wear down checks such as Gastrodon, Mega Latios, and Kommo-o, allowing Heatran to beat them over the long term. Firium Z from Magma Storm provides Heatran with a 100% accurate nuke that lets it eviscerate even neutral targets such as Gliscor and Mega Sableye, as well as score the OHKO on specially defensive Magearna. Using Firium Z also lets it use an extra utility move such as Toxic, Taunt, or Stealth Rock. Solar Beam in conjunction with Grassium Z, however, allows Heatran to immediately eliminate Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini, common would-be stopgaps to it. Furthermore, if boosted by Grassy Terrain, Heatran's Bloom Doom is capable of OHKOing the likes of Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mega Tyranitar. Flash Cannon combined with Steelium Z allows Heatran to chunk Tapu Fini and Kommo-o, as well as soft check Calm Mind Clefable. Corkscrew Crash also allows Heatran to net consistent KOs on Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar, which it would normally require Grassy Terrain to do with Grassium Z, while also allowing it to break through Mega Latios, which the other Z-Moves are unable to do. Taunt prevents Heatran from being setup fodder for the likes of Calm Mind Clefable, Substitute Serperior, and Substitute Volcarona and prevent the use of recovery moves from Chansey, Toxapex, and Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid Nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon that EV to creep Modest Heatran, such as Landorus-T and Tapu Fini, though it cuts into Heatran's offensive prowess, namely missing out on the OHKO on Gliscor with Inferno Overdrive and on Garchomp with Corkscrew Crash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Heatran is often forced out by many of its targets, such as Gliscor and Mega Latios, the Heatran user needs to make aggressive plays, such as using the Z-Move as they switch in. Heatran is a great Stealth Rock user, as it can beat the best Defoggers in the tier in Tornadus-T, Mega Latias, and Kartana, as well as Rotom-W and Tapu Fini depending on the Z-Move it is using. It also finds multiple opportunities to set entry hazards due to the numerous switches it forces. Even while uninvested, Heatran's natural bulk allows it to trade damage with the likes of Tapu Koko and Kyurem-B from full health, which is very useful early-game if Heatran is able to get in before entry hazards have been set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran works best on teams that appreciate its ability to check potent threats like Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Mega Scizor, as well as force progress with its ability to trap and remove key Pokemon and nuke others with its Z-Move. Tapu Bulu and Heatran possess amazing defensive synergy, with Tapu Bulu checking Ground- and Water-types like Gastrodon and Ash-Greninja and Heatran dealing with opposing Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types like Tornadus-T and Volcarona in return. Furthermore, Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain, which boosts Heatran's Bloom Doom, provides a source of recovery to boost its longevity, and weakens Earthquake. Grassy Terrain also removes the factor of prediction versus the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, as Heatran can now survive Earthquake from them. Due to Heatran's low Speed stat, faster teammates like Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam work well with it. Strong pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Tornadus-T is useful, as it allows Heatran to preserve its HP to break opposing walls further on in the game. Other Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Mega Scizor are also solid teammates, as offensive Heatran is unable to check threats like Tapu Lele and Shift Gear Magearna on its own. Ground-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos are mandated alongside Heatran to make up for its terrible 4x Ground-type weakness. Lastly, Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Victini further exacerbate Heatran's wallbreaking capabilities, with Mega Charizard Y's sun boosting the power of Heatran's Fire-type STAB, forming a potent Fire-type spam offensive core.</p>"

  "Hawlucha": {
    "overview": "<p>Hawlucha is a very threatening sweeper with the combination of a terrain seed such as Electric Seed, Grassy Seed, or Psychic Seed and the Unburden ability, capable of outspeeding even extremely fast foes, such as all common Choice Scarf users, Mega Alakazam, and sweepers such as Shift Gear Magearna and Mega Swampert in rain. Additionally, it can threaten out many defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Heatran by virtue of its offensive typing. Hawlucha is also able to set up on defensive variants of Landorus-T, which is fairly common in the current metagame. Its relatively low base Attack leaves it unable to OHKO foes such as Mega Latios and Tornadus-T without a Swords Dance boost and even more defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini after a Swords Dance boost. It is also prone to being revenge killed by strong priority moves, such as Weavile's Ice Shard, Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out + Quick Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge is an option to hit Zapdos, but doesn't offer much outside of that. Misty Seed can also be run if Hawlucha is paired with Tapu Fini, but generally the other Island Guardians provide better synergy with Hawlucha and are more effective in the metagame. A 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread can be used for teams weak against opposing Hawlucha, but the lack of bulk makes it a lot tougher for it to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Mega Pinsir can revenge kill Hawlucha by negating its Unburden boost through their priority. However, Hawlucha's Defense boost from Electric or Grassy Seed reduces the damage taken by the latter two, whereas Psychic Seed allows a better matchup with the former. Still, none of the three can outright OHKO Hawlucha.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Zapdos, Mew, Clefable, and Celesteela can take hits from Hawlucha and wear it down with status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, or super effective attacks. Note that Clefable fails to OHKO Hawlucha with Moonblast, however.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon that resist Fighting-type Moves</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Flyinium Z Landorus-T can avoid the OHKO from +2 Hawlucha's attacks and OHKO it in return. However, entry hazards can quickly wear down the former into range of a +2 High Jump Kick.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Terrain Seed Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics and High Jump Kick are Hawlucha's STAB moves of choice because of their high Base Power. Because of the fact that Hawlucha's Electric Seed is used immediately after switching into Electric Terrain, Acrobatics's Base Power is instantly doubled. Swords Dance boosts Hawlucha's Attack stat, allowing it to OHKO foes such as Mega Swampert, Tapu Lele, and Shift Gear Magearna. Roost helps Hawlucha set up on Pokemon such as defensive Landorus-T and Celesteela thanks to its defensive boost with Electric Seed. Drain Punch offers reliable Fighting-type STAB and helps sustain Hawlucha's sweep by keeping it healthy. Substitute is an option to dodge status moves such as Leech Seed and Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A terrain seed in conjunction with Unburden instantly doubles Hawlucha's Speed stat if it is brought into the correct terrain; Electric Seed should be used alongside Tapu Koko, Grassy Seed alongside Tapu Bulu, and lastly Psychic Seed alongside Tapu Lele. Additionally, the Defense boost it receives is helpful for allowing Hawlucha to set up Swords Dance more easily, whereas Psychic Seed offers an interesting twist that boosts Hawlucha's Special Defense one stage instead, allowing Hawlucha to take on Hidden Power Ice from Landorus-T as well as Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja much more easily. Maximum Attack is used so Hawlucha hits as hard as possible, and 124 Speed EVs help it outspeed all Pokemon up to Jolly Sand Rush Excadrill. 96 HP EVs, along with 36 SpD EVs, enable Hawlucha to survive a Moonblast from Clefable and 2HKO it with Acrobatics. Such investment is unecessary if Hawlucha is running a Psychic Seed though, leaving the SpD EV points to be invested onto HP. A bulkier spread of 104 HP / 244 Atk / 88 SpD / 72 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used on Electric or Grassy Seed Substitute variants to set up on Toxapex.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hawlucha works best as a late-game sweeper, aiming to break through teams once defensive threats such as Zapdos, Reuniclus, and Toxapex have been eliminated or sufficiently weakened. It is necessary to preserve Hawlucha's Terrain Seed until this time because otherwise, Hawlucha will lack the speed necessary to outrun offensive Pokemon. The Defense boost granted by Electric or Grassy Seed improve's Hawlucha's matchup against physical attackers such as Tapu Bulu and Kartana, whereas Psychic Seed's Special Defense increase ensures a better matchup against Ash-Greninja and Clefable. Hawlucha can use these boosts to its bulk to set up Swords Dance before breaking through the opposing team with its STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Koko is a mandatory teammate for Electric Seed variants because it can reliably set up Electric Terrain. Shuca Berry variants of Tapu Koko provide the most support for Hawlucha but mostly any Tapu Koko set is fair game. Similarly, Tapu Bulu can be paired with Grassy Seed sets, being an effective defensive glue with the advantages of preventing Ash-Greninja from evolving and possibly being able to lure Zapdos with Stone Edge. Finally, Tapu Lele pairs with Hawlucha holding a Psychic Seed, and it can take down most physical walls such as Toxapex and Zapdos that roadblock Hawlucha's path to a sweep. Spikes users can provide Hawlucha with chip damage, assisting its sweeping capabilities. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are prime options. Ground-types, including Landorus-T and Garchomp, also have good offensive synergy with Hawlucha. Rockium Z or Smack Down variants of Landorus-T in particular help Hawlucha against stall teams. Rain teams consisting of Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Pelipper also synergize well with Hawlucha because they can break walls that Hawlucha struggles with, like Toxic Landorus-T, and vice versa, such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth.</p>"

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>Avalugg is a niche pick as a physical wall for bulkier archetypes such as stall. Its massive physical bulk allows it to stomach hits from pretty much any physical attacker that lacks super effective coverage to hit it, including physically oriented Gliscor, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile lacking Iron Head. Rapid Spin also enables it to be a situational entry hazard remover, as it can switch into setters such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert and spin their Stealth Rock away while they're forced out. Furthermore, Sturdy allows it to act as a last resort if Avalugg is at full health and a certain wallbreaker runs out of control, enabling it to tank a hit and fire back with a decently powerful Avalanche. Nonetheless, its defensive typing is possibly one of the worst in the game, allowing many physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Kartana, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Mega Medicham, to overcome Avalugg without much struggle. Said typing also leaves it prone to being worn down by hazards, mostly Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Avalugg's Special Defense is also very lackluster, leaving pretty much any special attacker able to break through it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar can be used over either Rapid Spin or Toxic to phaze setup sweepers; nonetheless, both Rapid Spin and Toxic are very important for Avalugg, and Roar is just a lot more situational than both moves. Leftovers is an option over Rocky Helmet to benefit from the passive recovery it gives, but Rocky Helmet is usually more valuable to chip away physical attackers and help Avalugg KO them with a boosted Avalanche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Thanks to Avalugg's poor Special Defense stat, nearly any special attacker in the tier can take it down. Examples include Heatran, Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Physical attackers with strong super effective coverage can also take Avalugg down; Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Tyranitar are notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Avalugg is easily pressured by residual damage, most notably entry hazards. Stealth Rock strips a fourth of Avalugg's health, leaving it prone to being taken down by Pokemon it's supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Pinsir. Toxic Spikes is also very detrimental, as being poisoned really makes Avalugg a lot less consistent on walling what it should. In general, entry hazards also break its Sturdy, removing its ability to act as a last-ditch effort to stop a wallbreaker. Burn and sand damage also greatly hinder Avalugg, making it less consistent when checking what it needs to.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Avalanche is Avalugg's only notable Ice-type physical move and is important for OHKOing the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Pinsir. Its added effect of increasing power when Avalugg is hit by a move also makes it surprisingly strong in tandem with Avalugg's considerable Attack stat. Recover is important to keep Avalugg healthy and let it continually check what it needs to. Rapid Spin may seem counterintuitive on an Ice-type, but it allows Avalugg to switch into entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert as they set up their hazards and spin them away as the aforementioned Ground-types switch out. Earthquake allows Avalugg to deal with Mega Mawile lacking Iron Head, and can also be useful to catch troublesome Pokemon such as Heatran looking to take advantage of Avalugg. Lastly, Toxic can be used and gives Avalugg the possibility to threaten foes outside of Avalanche, allowing it to beat Kyurem-B, for example.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rocky Helmet is run to gradually wear down physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Landorus-T. Sturdy enables a last-ditch hit on an out-of-control wallbreaker if Avalugg is at full health. 88 Attack EVs allow Avalanche to OHKO Mega Pinsir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avalugg acts as a switch-in for some physical attackers such as Gliscor, Mega Pinsir, and certain Mega Mawile sets. However, watch out for entry hazards when switching it in, as the likes of Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes can wear it down quickly. Avalugg should also be switched into Stealth Rock setters it can beat, such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert, removing their hazards while not getting damaged by them. If a wallbreaker is a threat to Avalugg's team and it can be taken down by a 120-Base Power-Avalanche, it might be smart to keep Avalugg at full HP for it to be able to make use of its Sturdy ability and act as a last-resort-countermeasure against said wallbreaker. The likes of Tapu Lele, Hoopa-U, and Kartana take a considerable amount of damage from Avalanche and thus can be taken down by the aforementioned method after some slight prior damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite having Rapid Spin on its own, entry hazard removal partners are important for Avalugg. Avalugg prefers to only use Rapid Spin situationally, leaving the role of a reliable hazard remover to teammates. Mega Sableye is a great option thanks to its Magic Bounce ability; Defog users such as Zapdos and Gliscor also fit the bill very well. Walls capable of taking on special attackers, namely Chansey and Jirachi, are great options to cover the multitude of special attackers that can take Avalugg down. Similarly, walls that have great defensive synergy with Avalugg, such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and the aforementioned Zapdos, can cover Avalugg's weaknesses. Overall, Avalugg's narrow niche makes it only viable on stall and semi-stall and thus leaves it with only a handful of teammates to work with, as such archetypes are rather formulaic by nature.</p>"

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier due to its Speed tier combined with its versatility and frightening power in Electric Terrain. Access to U-turn and Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to pivot into teammates and generate momentum throughout the game. Tapu Koko has a solid movepool for its role, including access to utility options like Roost, Taunt, and dual screens, which increases its versatility in addition to its adequate selection of coverage moves. Tapu Koko's resistances to Dark and Flying coupled with access to Roost allows it to check some of the more problematic Pokemon in the tier, most notably Tornadus-T. However, Tapu Koko's underwhelming offensive stats make its coverage moves much weaker than its STAB moves, so bulky Pokemon that resist Electric are severely problematic from a defensive standpoint. Additionally, Tapu Koko's mediocre bulk means that it will take significant damage from any decently strong neutral attack, especially special ones.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Koko can utilize a dual screens set on hyper offensive teams with setup sweepers, but these teams are quite niche and are often ineffective. Tapu Koko can also run a physically based Choice Scarf set to revenge kill offensive threats, most notably Volcarona and Mega Alakazam, but it's very reliant on prediction to be effective and is much weaker than the Choice Specs set. Toxic can be used over Hidden Power Ice on the pivot set on rain teams, as it allows Tapu Koko to cripple checks like Gastrodon and Tangrowth for teammates, but the inability to hit Ground-types is very noticeable. Finally, Defog can be used on the pivot set due to Tapu Koko's ability to force out Toxapex and remove its Toxic Spikes, but it's important to note that it's very difficult to make room for it. Electrium Z with Thunderbolt is another viable wallbreaking option, though unlike when from Wild Charge, Chansey can easily handle Gigavolt Havoc.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Grass-types, such as Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Tangrowth, are very strong checks for Tapu Koko due to their natural bulk in conjunction with their resistance to Thunderbolt, but it must be noted that Ferrothorn has to be wary of a potential Hidden Power Fire. Offensive Grass-types, such as Choice Scarf Kartana and Choice Scarf Serperior, can also threaten out Tapu Koko with the threat of outspeeding it and either heavily damaging or KOing it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, exert an immense amount of pressure on Tapu Koko, particularly the Choice Specs set, due to their ability to prevent Tapu Koko from spamming Volt Switch. However, it must be noted that neither of the aforementioned Ground-types can switch into Hidden Power Ice very well. On the other hand, Ground-types that are not weak to Hidden Power Ice, such as Gastrodon and Excadrill, are much more consistent answers to Tapu Koko, but it must be noted that offensive Excadrill sets can be worn down over time by U-turn in conjunction with entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive walls, such as Assault Vest Magearna and Chansey can switch into most Tapu Koko sets fairly comfortably and threaten it out with strong STAB attacks and status moves. However, these Pokemon can be taken down by the Z-Wild Charge set.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Lopunny can come in against Tapu Koko with the help of U-turn and Volt Switch support and dispatch it fairly easily, but they cannot switch directly into Tapu Koko. Similarly, priority moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch can revenge kill Tapu Koko or wear it down further in conjunction with entry hazards.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam provides a strong secondary STAB attack to hit Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T while also having strong neutral coverage against many Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt, such as Tapu Bulu and Kyurem-B. Hidden Power Ice is useful for its increased damage output against Gliscor as well as its ability to cleanly OHKO Landorus-T. Roost may appear to be an odd option on a Choice item set, but can be very useful for healing off chip damage from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini, allowing Tapu Koko to check them more consistently. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can be used to do heavy damage to Ferrothorn for teammates like Ash-Greninja and Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs increases the power of all of Tapu Koko's moves, somewhat making up for its poor Special Attack stat and making its Electric-type moves frighteningly powerful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Tapu Koko functions as both a wallbreaker and a pivot in the early-game. As such, correct prediction is paramount to using this set successfully, as using Volt Switch against a Ground-type is a huge momentum killer, and using Dazzling Gleam on a Pokemon that can OHKO Tapu Koko and takes very little damage from it can also be problematic. Switch Tapu Koko into Pokemon that it fears little from, such as Tornadus-T and Toxapex, and continue generating momentum from there. Make aggressive plays, such as double switches, against Protect users like Celesteela and Mega Diancie in order to stop them from disrupting Tapu Koko's momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Tapu Koko usually finds itself at home as a pivot on more offensive teams that can pressure its traditional switchins. Wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Heatran that appreciate the momentum that Tapu Koko provides, especially its ability to lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth, make for excellent partners. If this set runs Hidden Power Fire to beat Ferrothorn, offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja make for good partners. Similarly, Pokemon that can lure and remove bulky Grass- and Ground-types like Protean Greninja and Swords Dance + Z-Fly Landorus-T work well with this set. Magnezone gets special mention here because it can trap and remove Ferrothorn while also benefiting from the power boost that Tapu Koko provides with Electric Surge. Finally, Toxic Spikes support from Protean Greninja and Toxapex is very useful for crippling many Tapu Koko answers like Gastrodon and Tangrowth.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Tapu Koko to take advantage of its high Speed to become incredibly hard to play around for opposing offense teams, as it even outspeeds and OHKOes fast revenge killers like Greninja and Weavile. Tapu Koko makes use of Twinkle Tackle as a remarkably efficient neutral hit that threatens Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Seismitoad, and the uncommon Hippowdon after a boost. Twinkle Tackle is additionally useful for other neutral targets that are not Ground-types, like Serperior, Mega Charizard X, and opposing Tapu Koko. Dazzling Gleam also generally synergizes well with Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, as it can hit Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Mega Latias super effectively and Ground-types and Grass-types like Landorus-T and Serperior neutrally. Roost allows Tapu Koko to consistently set up on special attackers like Zapdos and Assault Vest Magearna by making use of Special Defense boosts to outheal anything thrown at it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used to outspeed Weavile and Greninja, which are two crucial targets. 8 HP and 4 Defense EVs ensure that Tapu Koko survives a +2 High Jump Kick from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock. Tapu Koko can also run a spread of 24 HP / 16 Def / 252 SpA / 216 Spe to survive a Leaf Blade from Kartana after Stealth Rock while still outspeeding Weavile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite its unimpressive defensive stats, Tapu Koko's great typing allows it to switch in on Zapdos and Tornadus-T and threaten to set up. Tapu Koko is most effective when Pokemon that can revenge kill it, like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, are out of the picture, as there is very little some teams can do to Tapu Koko once it gets going due to its Speed. Tapu Koko should save its Z-Move until after setting up to reach crucial OHKO ranges such as defensive Landorus-T and Serperior, as well as efficiently picking off chipped Seismitoad and Gastrodon. It can be helpful to keep an eye on Tapu Koko's health, as at high HP it can set up on the aforementioned special attacking Pokemon as well as check Hawlucha. Tapu Koko is incredibly threatening against hyper offense teams, as it can freely set up on the incredibly common lead Mew, force a Calm Mind against an unboosted Serperior due to its immunity to Glare, and threaten to OHKO Kommo-o and Gyarados without a boost. In matchups that are too volatile for Tapu Koko to safely set up a Calm Mind, its Z-Move can be used to maximize damage, being even stronger than terrain-boosted Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best at supporting offense and balance teams that appreciate its incredible matchup against opposing offense and hyper offense teams. Spikes support from Greninja or Ferrothorn can chip down Gastrodon, opposing Ferrothorn, and Chansey for Tapu Koko, which is helpful as they are some of Tapu Koko's best checks. Defensive Landorus-T and Rotom-W can handle Sand Rush Excadrill and Mega Swampert, which are two blazingly fast weather threats that are well equipped against Tapu Koko due to their typing; these teammates can also bring the relatively frail Tapu Koko safely onto the field with slow pivoting. Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Victini can easily threaten Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu for Tapu Koko and appreciate Tapu Koko threatening Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Kommo-o. Kartana can plow through Ground-types like Gastrodon and bait in the likes of Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skarmory for Tapu Koko to take advantage of, as well as blocking Leech Seed attempts from Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Mega Charizard X, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Kyurem-B appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to force switches, and in return, they can clear the way for Tapu Koko to clean late-game.</p>"

      "Physical Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set uses Wild Charge over Thunderbolt in order to weaken specially defensive Pokemon like Magearna and Chansey that normally switch into Thunderbolt. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to pivot out against Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T without having to worry about its attempt being blocked like it would with Volt Switch. Taunt can be useful for shutting down defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Ferrothorn, improving this set's ability to break down defensive teams, but Tapu Koko becomes significantly less effective at checking Tornadus-T and Toxapex without Roost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Hasty nature is preferred over a Naive nature to switch into Tornadus-T consistently while not hindering Tapu Koko's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wild Charge is seldom used outside of revenge killing offensive threats, so this set should really be focused on generating momentum and attempting to lure its intended targets. As such, switch Tapu Koko into Pokemon that it checks, such as Tornadus-T, early and often in order to allow it to exert offensive pressure on the opposing team and generate momentum with U-turn. Be patient when determining when to use Gigavolt Havoc, as it can be essential for removing or weakening key bulky Pokemon, such as Magearna and Heatran, that believe they can take a hit from Tapu Koko.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Tapu Koko set is best used on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to lure specially defensive Pokemon, particularly Magearna, Jirachi, and Chansey. As such, offensive Psychic-types, such as Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele make good teammates. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Kyurem-B that can take advantage of the bulky Grass-types that Tapu Koko baits in make for excellent teammates. Finally, other pivots that can form VoltTurn cores in conjunction with Tapu Koko, such as Landorus-T and Mega Scizor, can make it significantly easier to maintain momentum in the match.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's consistent source of damage, and it's still worth using even alongside Volt Switch to be able to avoid the forced switch when it's unwanted. Hidden Power Ice punishes Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor coming in to pivot on Thunderbolt or block Volt Switch. Volt Switch is a more active way to spread damage while accomplishing the main goal of generating momentum, but U-turn is a solid option to prevent the likes of Seismitoad and Excadrill from killing Tapu Koko's momentum, though on Life Orb sets it isn't ideal due to both revealing Tapu Koko's item and racking up recoil in exchange for often minimal damage. Roost lets Tapu Koko heal off entry hazard damage and recoil from Life Orb, preventing opponents from relying on chip damage alone to handle it. Hidden Power Fire is a niche option for Life Orb sets that can more directly punish Ferrothorn as it switches in, 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>8 HP EVs and 4 Defense EVs ensure Tapu Koko survives +2 High Jump Kick from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock. A Timid nature is used to outspeed Weavile and Greninja. Alternatively, a spread of 24 HP / 16 Def / 252 SpA / 216 Spe can be used to avoid the OHKO from Kartana's Leaf Blade after Stealth Rock while hitting the aforementioned Speed benchmarks. Life Orb is a great balance between the immediate power and prediction-reliant nature of Choice Specs and the less immediately powerful variants like Calm Mind. However, the recoil damage from Life Orb gives Tapu Koko a harder time staying healthy enough to answer the likes of Hawlucha, Tornadus-T, and Mega Pinsir. Electrium Z is great for burst damage against the likes of Heatran and Tapu Lele. Shuca Berry allows Tapu Koko to safely attack against potential Choice Scarf Landorus-T, being able to 2HKO both Landorus-T and Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice. It also comes in handy against sweepers that use Ground-type coverage to hit Tapu Koko, like Mega Gyarados and Mega Pinsir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set generates momentum to bring in offensive teammates while also spreading chip damage and providing useful speed control. Entry hazards are important to get on the field early; Life Orb Tapu Koko is very consistently able to grab a KO with Hidden Power Ice against maximum HP Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, and Spikes are generally useful against the metagame, compounding with Volt Switch or U-turn damage against the likes of Ferrothorn, Seismitoad, and Chansey. Volt Switch variants aren't worth bringing in as much when facing a Ground-type that is unbothered by Hidden Power Ice, but when the opposing Ground-type is something like Landorus-T or, better yet, has been KOed, then it's highly beneficial to get Tapu Koko on the field often to chip down the likes of Assault Vest Magearna and Chansey with Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is generally seen on offense and bulky offense teams, similar to its Choice Specs variant, with the main benefit being that it has less risk when pivoting out because it can switch moves. Spikes from Greninja or Ferrothorn are a very natural addition to this set, making its Volt Switch sting more against the likes of opposing Ferrothorn and Chansey and U-turn aggravating Seismitoad, Excadrill, and Gastrodon much more. Electric Seed Hawlucha, Kyurem-B, and Thunder Punch Mega Medicham are great benefactors of both Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, which triggers Hawlucha's Unburden ability and powers up Kyurem-B's and Mega Medicham's Electric-type coverage moves, and its proficiency at safely bringing them in with offensive pressure. Landorus-T and Magearna are already near auto-inclusions for offense teams, but they're worth mentioning as good examples of other pivots to pair with Tapu Koko to further the goal of generating offensive pressure with repeated pivoting into threats. Another example of a pivoting teammate is Mega Scizor, which has the added benefit of setting up on various Pokemon that check Tapu Koko, such as Mega Latias and Tapu Bulu.</p>"

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Lele easily sets itself apart from a jungle of powerful wallbreakers in OU due to its unique ability: Psychic Surge. Said ability sets Psychic Terrain automatically, boosting Tapu Lele's Psychic-type attacks for free and making them wickedly difficult to tank or switch into directly. The Terrain also protects grounded Pokemon from priority attacks; as many priority users such as Mega Mawile, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Scizor rely on their respective attacks to stop faster threats, Tapu Lele can limit their actions and allow itself or teammates to completely overpower these threats. With these traits combined with great offensive stats and a good typing, Tapu Lele is a frightening force of nature, capable of utterly breaking numerous team archetypes while boasting unique threat coverage along with downright scary flexibility in its item and set usage. However, Tapu Lele dislikes the fact that many bulky Steel-types, especially Magearna and Celesteela, can easily switch into both of its STAB attacks. The coverage attacks it usually runs to address them as well as other checks and counters tend to be too weak or shaky to use consistently without fair prediction or prior damage. Tapu Lele's average physical bulk and good—but not fantastic—Speed also tend to hold it back, making it often vulnerable to revenge killing. Regardless, as Tapu Lele is always rather unforgiving in its power and versatility, all team archetypes must exercise caution against it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest improves Tapu Lele's bulk massively and gives it a lot of freedom to trade damage with the likes of Magearna and Greninja. Twisted Spoon is an option to boost Tapu Lele's Psychic-type attacks without the downside of being locked into them via a Choice item. Taunt is a great option on these sets to shut down the likes of Clefable and Cresselia. Tapu Lele can use an Electric-type attack of choice to inflict more solid damage on Celesteela specifically—Psychic Terrain-boosted attacks will usually do more damage to Water- and Flying-types except Skarmory. In particular, a combination of Electrium Z and Thunder becomes Tapu Lele's best attack against specially defensive Celesteela, KOing it after a bit of prior damage. Thunderbolt is a more reliable move should the user choose to use another item. Nature's Madness in tandem with Tapunium Z can also be used to severely weaken checks like Magearna and Jirachi. Similarly, other Z-Crystals such as Ghostium Z can be used to lure in and take out specific checks and counters, like Jirachi and specially defensive Mew.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Although Tapu Lele usually runs coverage like Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast to get past Steel-types, such attacks are too weak or unreliable to be used constantly or get locked into from a Choice item. Assault Vest Magearna and Jirachi are a couple of Tapu Lele's more solid checks under this category, as they easily switch into any attack except Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire—which they don't appreciate but can easily tank at reasonable health—while KOing back with Steel-type STAB attacks. Specially defensive Celesteela is a very solid counter to Tapu Lele, as it can tank every commonly used attack except for the odd Thunder and can apply pressure by using Leech Seed or Heavy Slam. As long as Tapu Lele isn't locked into or lacks Hidden Power Fire, Mega Scizor can switch in easily and Roost off damage while wearing Tapu Lele down with U-turn or Pursuit. If Tapu Lele lacks any one of Hidden Power Fire, Focus Blast, or All-Out Pummeling, the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran also switch into it rather easily, though they all risk being worn down due to a lack of reliable recovery and take major damage from a boosted Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Speed-based Revenge Killing</strong>: Tapu Lele's Speed and bulk are only slightly above average, making it easily susceptible to standard revenge killing. Note that priority attacks will not work due to Psychic Terrain being active the majority of the time. If Tapu Lele is not holding a Choice Scarf itself, a variety of faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Kartana, Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko can pick it off at slightly high percents. Even the Choice Scarf set has some problems due to being locked into a single move, as well as still being outrun by faster Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Miscellaneous Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Being locked into the wrong attack or lacking Psyshock means some particularly specially defensive Pokemon can afford to switch in on Tapu Lele rather confidently, though many of them are hindered significantly by Taunt if fighting against the Taunt + Three Attacks set. Chansey and Cresselia are prime examples, as they mind nothing else from Tapu Lele except Psyshock and Shadow Ball, respectively. Specially defensive Gastrodon cannot be 2HKOed by non-boosted Psychic and can use Toxic and Recover until Psychic Terrain expires. Similarly, Clefable can utilize Wish and Protect to stall out Psychic Terrain turns, though physically defensive variants are still pressured hard by Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: As Tapu Lele will be wanting to serve as a juggernaut with its Psychic-type attacks most of the time, healthy Dark-types simply prevent it from doing so, especially if it's locked into a move by a Choice item. Using Dark-types should only be a last resort, however; save Alolan Muk, many will simply be decimated by well-timed Moonblasts on the switch. Weavile and both formes of Greninja are notable, as they outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets and can easily take advantage of Tapu Lele locked into Psychic or Psyshock by hitting it or a switch-in extremely hard. Thanks to a Special Defense buff from sandstorm, most healthy, bulkier variants of Tyranitar will eat up a Moonblast while taking all other attacks except Focus Blast pretty well. It can then proceed to wear Tapu Lele down with Pursuit or its other STAB moves. Similarly, Hoopa-U is bulky enough to switch into Choice-locked coverage attacks and Psychic-type attacks if desperately needed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic deals an insane amount of damage to even the most semi-bulky of resistant targets; 252 HP Heatran, for instance, gets 2HKOed with one layer of Spikes or equivalent prior damage. Dark- and Psychic-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Latias daring enough to try switching into Psychic are maimed by a STAB Moonblast instead, which also has great Base Power and general coverage. Though running two parallel Psychic-type attacks on the same set may seem redundant, Psyshock is an integral attack in the third slot for its ability to break physically frail Pokemon; for example, it beats Chansey and specially defensive Gastrodon while making dents in Assault Vest Magearna and defensive Celesteela. Hidden Power Fire cleanly OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing either from responding with an attack or recovery move. It also picks off Skarmory, Mega Mawile, Excadrill, and Magnezone at higher percents while being a sufficient option against Jirachi. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to OHKO Heatran at the expense of losing out on a strong hit on Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is preferred for the extra power, with the terrain multiplier amplifying every extra bit of power more so than usual.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Though this set sports terrifying nuking power that can let it potentially tear through threats early- or mid-game, it is important to ascertain its worth in a match depending on the opposing team structure. In particular, this set breaks balanced teams almost completely, as Tapu Lele is fast and powerful enough to overwhelm typical defensive Pokemon while limiting frailer offensive targets' opportunities to switch in. Still, this set should typically be played cautiously, as these archetypes can adapt to unfavorable situations with more bulky or resistant units. Against offensive teams with usually fast and defensively average Pokemon, Tapu Lele can typically exert pressure with Psychic and Moonblast all day until it eventually faints; in such cases, it has probably amassed more than enough damage for fellow cleaners to come in.</p> <p>It is generally not advised to switch in Tapu Lele too aggressively because it is a fantastic offensive asset against nearly all team archetypes. Due to Choice Specs locking Tapu Lele in a single move, prediction should be exercised against opponents with multiple resistant or immune Pokemon. For instance, seeing a Dark-type or two in Team Preview means using Moonblast is the safer choice over Psychic early-game; especially if they are Pursuit trappers like Weavile or Mega Tyranitar, which can take advantage of a Choice-locked Tapu Lele and heavily damage it. Likewise, otherwise good switch-ins such as Celesteela and Jirachi can have a chunk of their health taken off with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Though Tapu Lele can break through most threats with the correct coverage move and prediction, it would rather have the ease of choosing its STAB moves instead of its weaker and unreliable coverage attacks. Tapu Lele is also easy to check due to its only decent Speed and its being locked into one attack, so at least some support against Dark- and Steel-types makes things easier. For example, Magnezone traps and KOes most Steel-types that love switching into Tapu Lele, including Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Jirachi, and Mega Scizor.</p> <p>In general, U-turn and Volt Switch users are good teammates to get Tapu Lele in the field safely—slower ones are especially valued because they are typically bulky enough to take hits and provide further ease in prediction. Defensive Landorus-T is exemplary of this, as it also blanket checks most physical attackers and Steel-types thanks to Intimidate while providing Stealth Rock support. Likewise, Mega Scizor and Rotom-W can also provide a slower U-turn or Volt Switch while keeping several of Tapu Lele's checks and counters in check, especially Celesteela in the case of Rotom-W. Tapu Koko is also worth consideration, as its fast offensive sets threaten a variety of checks and counters to Tapu Lele, including Celesteela and Greninja. Both Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko can also reset each other's Terrains to prevent each other's from expiring at inconvenient times. Since Tapu Lele applies a great deal of pressure and tends to force switches, entry hazard setters can further assist in breaking down switch-ins and defensive Pokemon. Ferrothorn is good in this respect, since it can run either Stealth Rock or Spikes while owning other pros, including fantastic defenses as well as Leech Seed and Iron Barbs to wear down the opposition. Greninja is a more offensive choice that can lay Spikes and be offensively tailored depending on team needs. For instance, a physically offensive Protean set can lure in Tapu Lele's checks, such as Low Kick to nearly 2HKO Celesteela or Dig alongside Groundium Z for Assault Vest Magearna, while Ash-Greninja has the option of utterly decimating offensive teams when Tapu Lele is through and done. Both appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to pressure Toxapex in return. Do note that Psychic Terrain stops Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken from threatening grounded foes, however.</p> <p>In terms of teammates that benefit from Psychic Terrain in particular, Mega Medicham and Mega Gallade enjoys the extra power for their Zen Headbutt as well as Tapu Lele's ability to break through defensive checks and counters, most notably Mega Sableye, allowing them to clean up when appropriate. Though Mega Alakazam is rather redundant with Tapu Lele because they run similar coverage moves, it benefits from Psychic Terrain's powering up its Psychic-type moves and preventing priority from hitting. Mega Alakazam also boasts high offensive stats as well as the ability to revenge kill Sand Rush Excadrill and other weather sweepers thanks to Trace. Other usually priority-weak sweepers such as Volcarona and the aforementioned Ash-Greninja also benefit from Psychic Terrain; however, in practice, they only have a couple of turns to make good use of the Terrain unless Tapu Lele faints the same turn one of them is sent in.</p>"
      },
      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is the best STAB option for non-Choice variants of Tapu Lele because it hits specially defensive walls like Magearna and Chansey harder, and the difference in power compared to Psychic is negligible. It can even be powered up by Psychium Z for a monstrously strong STAB attack that can OHKO neutral targets like Gliscor and Clefable and hit opposing Special Defense stats rather than Defense. Moonblast rounds out Tapu Lele's coverage, hitting Dark-types like Ash-Greninja and Mega Tyranitar. Focus Blast can be used in combination with Fightinium Z to dispatch Heatran and Mega Mawile and break through weakened Steel-types like Jirachi and Celesteela after a boost. Hidden Power Fire is especially lethal against Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, OHKOing the former and KOing the latter after insignificant chip damage. Hidden Power Fire also doesn't require a Z-Crystal to be consistent, so it's the move of choice for Psychium Z and Twisted Spoon variants, with the added bonus of hitting Shedinja. Calm Mind allows Tapu Lele to boost All-Out Pummeling and Hidden Power Fire into KO ranges and hit harder without being prediction reliant. The Special Defense boost aids Tapu Lele in setting up against the likes of Rotom-W, Magearna lacking a Steel-type move, and Tapu Fini. Taunt can be used to invalidate passive checks to Tapu Lele like Chansey and especially Cresselia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is used to maximize Tapu Lele's wallbreaking power, but Timid can be used to outspeed Jolly Excadrill, Kommo-o, and offensive Landorus-T and Speed tie with opposing Timid Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B. Fightinium Z is used alongside Focus Blast, but if Focus Blast isn't present on the set, then Psychium Z or Twisted Spoon should be used instead, with Hidden Power Fire replacing Focus Blast. Psychium Z allows Tapu Lele to hit incredibly hard neutrally, and Twisted Spoon stacks with Psychic Terrain to make Psyshock consistently stronger without using up a Z-Crystal; some notable examples include a very likely 2HKO on Chansey and also Heatran if Tapu Lele used Calm Mind previously.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tapu Lele works great early-game, softening up defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Magearna and Heatran; it has an impressive Special Defense stat, so it can do this incredibly aggressively by trading its own HP to accrue even more damage and set up a teammate like Mega Alakazam for later. It should aim to set up before using its Z-Move, as this lets All-Out Pummeling reach KO ranges and maximizes the efficiency of the one-time nuke, Shattered Psyche. Tapu Lele should be mindful of its HP, as at higher percentages, it can take advantage of weaker special attackers by setting up on them with Calm Mind, and Taunt variants can beat Chansey and Cresselia one-on-one without risking being KOed by repeated Seismic Tosses and Ice Beams. Tapu Lele should avoid status at all costs, as it won't have the longevity to break through bulky teams after being put on a timer, and it can't threaten defensive Pokemon as potently when slower than them due to paralysis. This set is great against stall teams, as it can set up a Calm Mind against lead Mega Sableye and cannot be handled via prediction. Hidden Power Fire is more specialized for the stall matchup, as Fightinium Z variants are blanked by Shedinja.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works great on offense teams, which appreciate how Tapu Lele can break down defensive stopgaps like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Magearna so that its teammates can clean up. Mega Mawile and Ash-Greninja appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to threaten Toxapex and chip down Assault Vest Magearna, and they can threaten its checks, like Victini and Jirachi, in return; it's important to note that Psychic Terrain puts a stop to Mega Mawile and Greninja's Sucker Punch and Water Shuriken, respectively, against grounded foes. Mega Alakazam shares similar Steel-type checks with Tapu Lele, heavily appreciates how it can force its way through them over time, and loves the Psychic Terrain that it brings, as it prevents Mega Alakazam from being revenge killed by priority users like Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Mawile and boosts the power of its STAB Psychic. Offensive Magearna variants like Shift Gear and Trick Room sets appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to break past Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, and they can clean up late-game. Pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Magearna, and Tornadus-T allows Tapu Lele to get in unscathed and threaten to set up. Fast Pokemon like Greninja and Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana can help balance out Tapu Lele's middling Speed stat.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Tapu Lele's strongest attack, capable of KOing many common fast, offensive Pokemon and doing a chunk to Pokemon that resist it. Moonblast is a strong alternative attack to fall back on in case the opposing team has Dark-types or healthy Psychic-types. Hidden Power Fire is a passably sufficient weapon against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, which like to switch in otherwise thanks to this set's lack of boosted power. Thunderbolt is a good coverage attack, allowing this set to slay regular Gyarados in a single hit and Mantine in two (other moves can only 3HKO it while it stalls with Roost). Thunderbolt also pressures cores that rely on multiple Electric-weak Pokemon, such as Greninja + Toxapex or Celesteela + Tapu Fini. Nature's Madness can be run to punish Pokemon that switch into Tapu Lele for free otherwise, such as Assault Vest Magearna and Celesteela. As a quick note, Psyshock is not very useful on this set, as it barely scratches physically weaker targets such as Chansey without a boosting item. Thus, this set prefers the raw power of Psychic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature is simply straightforward for a Choice Scarf set, enabling Tapu Lele to safely revenge kill Mega Alakazam, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and anything slower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With the increased Speed provided by Choice Scarf as well as superb natural special offense, Tapu Lele can act as both a revenge killer and a cleaner. Depending on the opposing team, it may be wise to preserve Tapu Lele to do either later in the match. Be careful about simply using Psychic if the opponent has healthy Dark- and Steel-types active. In this case, use coverage moves to KO or wear such targets down on the switch. Even without a boosting item, Tapu Lele still has marginally enough power to wallbreak on rare occasions, in which case you can utilize it to weaken foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Lele will be cleaning up and revenge killing, so teammates that can weaken Psychic- and Fairy-resistant or immune Pokemon make it much easier for Tapu Lele to spam Psychic and Moonblast without resorting to weaker or inaccurate coverage attacks. Heatran, for instance, instantly threatens and checks a majority of Steel-types with its offensive sets. A specialized solution is to use Magnezone, which traps pesky Steel-types that tend to switch into Tapu Lele's STAB moves. Toxapex can be a good partner on more balanced teams, as it typically handles some boosted and faster threats that Tapu Lele cannot revenge kill itself, such as Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Greninja.</p> <p>Tapu Lele tends to force switches, and since this set is rather lacking in power outside of Psychic, entry hazard support is necessary to pressure and wear down the opposition. The aforementioned Heatran, Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Landorus-T are examples of Pokemon that fit on a wide variety of offensive or balance teams and can set up either Stealth Rock or Spikes. Though Shuckle is rather specialized, it deserves mention for also setting Sticky Web, allowing Tapu Lele and its teammates to pressure and beat threats they could not trump before, such as Choice Scarf Greninja and +1 Volcarona. To further apply offensive pressure, wallbreakers are greatly helpful; Hoopa-U is a prime example due to benefiting from Psychic Terrain while sporting a colorful and unpredictable array of attacks to whittle down Tapu Lele's checks and counters. Mega Medicham is a terrifying wallbreaker under Psychic Terrain that can help pressure Tapu Lele's checks in Chansey and Steel-types.</p>"

  "Tapu Bulu": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Bulu is capable of checking prominent threats in the OU tier like Gliscor, Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam thanks to its typing and well-rounded bulk. Solid recovery options in Synthesis, Horn Leech, and Grassy Terrain make Tapu Bulu incredibly hard to wear down. Grassy Surge offers vital team support by powering up Grass-type attacks, weakening Earthquake, and providing grounded Pokemon with passive recovery. Tapu Bulu's incredibly strong Grass-type moves turn it into a devastating wallbreaker capable of breaking through many Grass-resistant foes such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn, especially with strong coverage moves in Stone Edge and Superpower. However, Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier leaves a lot to be desired, as it is outsped by threatening Pokemon like Heatran and Hoopa-U. Furthermore, the popularity of Steel-types that aren't weak to Superpower such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor as well as defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur hurt Tapu Bulu's offensive capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Bulu could utilize Leech Seed on its specially defensive set to wear down Celesteela; however, it often prefers more consistent recovery like Synthesis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona can outspeed Tapu Bulu, 4x resist its STAB attacks, and can respond with a super effective STAB Fire-type attack. They must watch out for Superpower in the case of Heatran or Stone Edge in the case of Mega Charizard Y and X, but otherwise they are strong offensive checks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Zapdos and Tornadus-T must watch out for Stone Edge, but they can switch in on Tapu Bulu's attacks and threaten it out with a super effective Heat Wave in the case of Zapdos or a STAB Hurricane in the case of Tornadus-T. They also can take advantage of the momentum they get from forcing out Tapu Bulu with Volt Switch and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While all must watch for All-Out Pummeling and Choice Band-boosted Superpower, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela can take Tapu Bulu's STAB moves with ease and heal off the damage. Celesteela can throw out a strong Heavy Slam that significantly dents Tapu Bulu. Mega Scizor can Defog on Choice-locked variants or set up Swords Dance and threaten out Tapu Bulu. Skarmory specifically must take care, as it can still lose to Swords Dance variants without Brave Bird, Iron Head, Whirlwind, or Counter.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: If Tapu Bulu lacks Megahorn, Rocky Helmet Tangrowth is a strong answer to it, as it can remove its Choice item with Knock Off or hit it with the rare Sludge Bomb. Mega Venusaur must watch out for Choice Band-boosted Megahorn and Zen Headbutt, but defensive variants can easily stomach Tapu Bulu's hits and respond with a 4x super effective STAB Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss, while not as bulky as Mega Venusaur, still deals with Tapu Bulu in a similar fashion while being able to repeatedly switch into its attacks due to Regenerator.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer and Horn Leech provide two very different roles for Tapu Bulu. The former packs a massive punch at the cost of some recoil damage that's often somewhat mitigated by Grassy Terrain, whereas the latter is used when Tapu Bulu is low on HP to get some health back and still does some respectable damage on even Pokemon resistant to it like Tornadus-T and Mega Mawile. Superpower is instrumental as Tapu Bulu's main weapon against Steel-types. It deals massive damage to the likes of Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Kartana and hits Celesteela and Jirachi for slightly less damage than Wood Hammer, without taking recoil. Stone Edge is preferred in the last slot to hit Pokemon doubly resistant to Grass-type moves like Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes on the switch while hitting Tornadus-T without recoil and still acting as Tapu Bulu's best bet against Zapdos. Megahorn is an option that targets the ever common Mega Latias, Tangrowth, and Mega Latios while still hitting Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur hard enough. Zen Headbutt is also an option for Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Heracross, but missing out on Tangrowth makes Megahorn far superior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band bestows Tapu Bulu with even more power behind its moves, which lets it blow past switch-ins such as Tornadus-T and Magearna. The HP investment allows Tapu Bulu to always avoid a 2HKO from Ash-Greninja prior to transformation after Stealth Rock. Meanwhile, the Speed investment allows Tapu Bulu to get the jump on the likes of Tyranitar and Crawdaunt. The remainder of EVs are pooled into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prediction isn't usually too necessary with Choice Band Tapu Bulu. Spamming Tapu Bulu's Grass-type STAB moves is often the right step, with Horn Leech to get some HP back and Wood Hammer for a strong hit on the likes of Tornadus-T and Tangrowth. However, occasionally catching incoming Grass-resistant Pokemon is pivotal for the fate of a match. Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Kartana get a free opportunity to come in if Tapu Bulu uses either Grass-type STAB move; ergo, nailing them with Superpower is surely smart, as the former can set up entry hazards, whereas the latter two can land a powerful blow on Tapu Bulu's team. On the other hand, Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes are pretty free to switch into Horn Leech or Wood Hammer, so catching them with a Stone Edge doesn't make Tapu Bulu setup bait. Try to keep up momentum with double switches to not let the likes of Mega Heracross and Mega Mawile in for free. Lastly, Tapu Bulu can pivot into offensive Pokemon whose STAB combo it walls, such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Kommo-o. It can also switch in on predicted resisted hits, like Tapu Lele's Focus Blast and Magnezone's Thunderbolt, for example. However, Tapu Bulu should be mindful of Hydro Pump rolls from Ash-Greninja after more than a layer of Spikes, Ice Punch from Mega Swampert, and Poison Jab from Kommo-o. As a rule of thumb, letting Tapu Bulu get worn down isn't the best of ideas in most matches, but trading might be useful in some situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is a stellar teammate, as it rids the opposing team of troublesome Pokemon such as Kartana, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Another outstanding teammate is Kartana, especially Choice Scarf Kartana, as it immensely appreciates Grassy Terrain increasing the power of its Leaf Blade, allowing Choice Scarf variants to have an easier time sweeping. Choice Band and Z-Move Kartana could potentially work, but they do have quite some overlap with Tapu Bulu itself as a Grass-type wallbreaker. Ash-Greninja is a threat that every team needs to cover, but without investment in Special Defense, Tapu Bulu is far from a reliable check, so another check such as Assault Vest Magearna, Toxapex, or Tapu Fini is strongly recommended. Entry hazards really help Tapu Bulu wallbreak by chipping at would-be switch-ins. Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Gliscor are formidable teammates, and Spikes from Ash-Greninja is very welcomed too.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Tapu Bulu's Attack by two stages, allowing it to break past passive Pokemon such as Clefable and Reuniclus. Bulk Up can be run to take on Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Celesteela safer. Horn Leech is the STAB attack of choice, having a respectable damage output under Grassy Terrain and providing Tapu Bulu with an additional means of recovery. Superpower has good offensive coverage alongside Horn Leech and allows Tapu Bulu to break past Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Protect allows Tapu Bulu to gain additional recovery to effectively deal with Mega Alakazam, and to scout moves from Choice item users like Greninja, Weavile, and Kartana. Synthesis lets Tapu Bulu take advantage of its bulk and restore its HP against Pokemon it forces out, such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Wood Hammer can be used alongside Grassium Z if a stronger attack is wanted; however, this leaves Tapu Bulu without a reliable form of recovery. Stone Edge is useful for hitting Flying- and Fire-types like Tornadus-T and Volcarona harder; however, it has little utility outside of that.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs and 252 Special Defense EVs coupled with a Careful nature allow Tapu Bulu to survive strong super effective hits such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Tornadus-T's Hurricane from full health after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers provides passive recovery and keeps Tapu Bulu healthy alongside Grassy Terrain. Grassium Z can also be used without Wood Hammer to OHKO defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Gliscor, and Reuniclus after a Swords Dance. If Tapu Bulu's team is weak to Adamant Crawdaunt, 96 Speed EVs can be run on Tapu Bulu to outspeed it. Alternatively, if maximum offensive firepower is desired, a spread consisting of 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature can be utilized, but it significantly cuts down on Tapu Bulu's bulk and utility and makes it harder to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Tapu Bulu's defensive typing to pivot into dangerous attackers that it can generally check, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp. Tapu Bulu forces many switches when it comes in against Pokemon it beats one-on-one, such as Clefable, Choice Scarf and defensive Landorus-T, and Ash-Greninja. Take advantage of these opportunities to set up a Swords Dance or recover Tapu Bulu's health with Synthesis. If the opponent has a bulky Steel-type that doesn't mind Grass- or Fighting-type moves, such as Mega Scizor or Celesteela, recovering Tapu Bulu's health or double switching accordingly is recommended to keep momentum, as Tapu Bulu is hard walled by these Pokemon. Don't hesitate to take a hit from Heatran and Tornadus-T if it means removing them from the game, as Tapu Bulu can stomach a hit from them and recover its HP later on in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types, such as Gastrodon and Toxapex, can handle problematic Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona. Toxapex deserves a special mention because it can reliably handle Mega Scizor and poison Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos. In return, Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake for Toxapex. Heatran is a phenomenal teammate for Tapu Bulu due to their perfect defensive type synergy. Grassy Terrain also weakens Earthquake for Heatran and Tapu Bulu absorbs Water-type attacks from the likes of Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Tapu Fini rather easily; however, it should be wary of being burned by Scald. Tyranitar also benefits from Grassy Terrain and can Pursuit trap Mega Latios and Mega Latias, which can be problematic for Tapu Bulu due to their versatile movepools and defensive profile. Kartana forms a powerful Grass-type spam core with Tapu Bulu, hitting hard under Grassy Terrain with Leaf Blade due to its huge base Attack.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance turns Tapu Bulu into a frightening wallbreaker, allowing it to beat Pokemon like Celesteela, Magearna, and Tangrowth. Although Horn Leech is held back by its low Base Power, it provides Tapu Bulu with vital recovery. Superpower provides Tapu Bulu with coverage for Steel-types like Heatran, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, as well as Fire-types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X. Wood Hammer is an option over Stone Edge that, together with Grassium Z, gives Tapu Bulu an extremely powerful nuke capable of KOing even Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Magearna, and Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Special Defense investment allows Tapu Bulu to avoid being 2HKOed by Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Ash-Greninja. 96 Speed EVs enable Tapu Bulu to outspeed Crawdaunt and uninvested Rotom-W, while the rest of the EVs are pooled into Attack alongside an Adamant nature. This in combination with Fightinium Z notably allows Tapu Bulu to OHKO Steel-types such as Magearna, Celesteela, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile at +2 with All-Out Pummeling. Rockium Z is an alternative option that allows Tapu Bulu to defeat bulky Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Zapdos, while still targetting Celesteela. It also helps with bulky Tornadus-T variants. Grassium Z is an option that should be run with Wood Hammer, granting Tapu Bulu a very strong move capable of KOing Pokemon such as Magearna and Tangrowth at +2. However, it doesn't help Tapu Bulu with beating Celesteela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should attempt to bring Tapu Bulu in on Pokemon that it can force out, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp. Be wary of Tapu Bulu's health, though, as it can quickly be worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery, especially if running Wood Hammer. Once you have brought Tapu Bulu into play, you should attempt to set up with Swords Dance, as opponents will often attempt to check Tapu Bulu with Steel-types, which it can break past at +2. However, it is worth considering using Superpower, Stone Edge, or Continental Crush instead of setting up with Swords Dance if the opponent has a Pokemon like Heatran, Kartana, Tornadus-T, or Volcarona.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can struggle to deal with Steel-types, such as Mega Latias, appreciate Tapu Bulu's ability to lure them and take them out. Tapu Bulu struggles to take on Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Latios, and even Tornadus-T can be annoying at times despite Stone Edge, so it's a good idea to pair Tapu Bulu with a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar or Weavile. Because of its lack of reliable recovery, Tapu Bulu can struggle to consistently check Ash-Greninja. As a result, it's very important to use another, more consistent check, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, or Kommo-o.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is Tapu Bulu's strongest STAB attack; it does a lot more damage to Clefable and Landorus-T than Horn Leech, as well as OHKO Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele. Superpower allows Tapu Bulu to hit Grass-type switch-ins like Heatran, Kartana, and Magnezone. Stone Edge lets Tapu Bulu catch switch-ins such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona. Megahorn is an alternative to nail switch-ins such as Mega Latias, Tangrowth, and Serperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature allows Tapu Bulu to outspeed Greninja, Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu should be used as a revenge killer, being able to pick off frail Pokemon with its good coverage and attacking power. It can make for a surprise Choice Scarf user, so use this to your advantage. Be careful with Grassy Terrain's healing mechanics giving away that Tapu Bulu is faster than opposing Pokemon. Grassy Terrain's useful role compression is backed up by Tapu Bulu's adequate defensive typing and bulk, which let it take some hits, such as Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, but not too well. Because this is a more offensively oriented set, Tapu Bulu should not be relied upon as a switch-in to potent attackers like Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Mega Alakazam. Do not let Tapu Bulu get freely burned or paralyzed, as these status conditions will heavily hamper Tapu Bulu in its role as a revenge killer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can surprise offensive threats that otherwise would be able to KO it with ease such as Weavile and Tornadus-T. Pokemon such as Mega Medicham that can take advantage of offensive threats being eliminated appreciate this. Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain can provide some defensive utility to teammates. Heatran and Magnezone support Tapu Bulu by taking care of Steel-types, while Tapu Bulu returns them the favor via Grassy Terrain, softening blows from Earthquake and restoring their health. Grassy Terrain can also be used to boost its teammate's Grass-type attacks such as Heatran's Bloom Doom and Kartana's Leaf Blade. An additional and more reliable check to Ash-Greninja is needed, as with entry hazards and chip damage, Tapu Bulu will lose the ability to take hits from it over time.</p>"

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>With its wonderful defensive typing and incredible ability, Tapu Fini is an immense support presence in the tier, being able to check threats like Ash-Greninja and Kommo-o and give its offensive teammates a layer of protection against opposing status. Its great utility movepool includes Defog, letting it clear entry hazards from the likes of Heatran and Ash-Greninja as it threatens them out, and Taunt, which allows Tapu Fini to pester defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Toxapex and further help it in preventing hazards. It can also give hyper offense teams a headache with an offensive Calm Mind set, forcing through the likes of Volcarona one-on-one with boosts. However, Tapu Fini's fatal flaw is its complete lack of consistent recovery, giving it a total reliance on its item for healing and subsequently a vulnerability to Knock Off, meaning it doesn't want to be tasked with handling the otherwise-walled Weavile. Additionally, being a grounded user of Defog has the downside of needing to take, upon switch-in, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and, worst of all, Toxic Spikes, which activate before Misty Terrain and ruin Tapu Fini permanently. Lastly, Tapu Fini isn't entirely safe to switch into Greninja and Kommo-o without prior scouting, as it can be nastily surprised by a Protean set wielding Gunk Shot from the former and Electrium Z or Poisonium Z sets of the latter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Fini can run a Choice Scarf set utilizing maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and Trick, using its Speed to either revenge kill or pick up surprise KOs against weakened threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam, with the extra option of crippling walls like Ferrothorn and Chansey with Trick. Surf is often the Water-type STAB move of choice for this set, giving Tapu Fini the extra power it wants to pick off the aforementioned offensive threats and hit the likes of Heatran and Gliscor harder. Icium Z in conjunction with Haze gives Tapu Fini a one-time burst of healing that can't be spoiled by item removal, though removing Tapu Fini's passive recovery puts it on an exploitable and often short timer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Ferrothorn are able to take Tapu Fini's attacks without much bother and threaten it out. Interestingly, since Tapu Bulu sets its own Grassy Terrain to replace Misty Terrain, it must be careful of burn from Scald as it switches in. Kartana is similarly threatening, though its awful special bulk means it's often risky to switch it directly into Tapu Fini.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W are able to quite straightforwardly threaten to chunk Tapu Fini with super effective Electric-type attacks, though Tapu Koko doesn't love to switch into Tapu Fini's attacks, especially if not carrying Roost.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Super effective coverage rains in from all over the metagame. Grassium Z Heatran, Solar Beam Mega Charizard Y, and Giga Drain Volcarona utilize Grass-type coverage moves, and Mega Charizard Y is able to switch in safely thanks to its Drought weakening Tapu Fini's Water-type moves. Bolt Strike Victini and Thunder Punch Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile wield Electric-type coverage moves, and Gunk Shot Protean Greninja and Poison Jab Kommo-o tech on Poison-type attacks with Tapu Fini in mind.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex completely walls Tapu Fini's STAB combination and sets the most aggravating entry hazard possible for Tapu Fini, Toxic Spikes, making it the bane of Tapu Fini's existence. It can even be especially nasty and carry Knock Off, instantly ruining Tapu Fini's chances at longevity. However, an unsuspecting Toxapex can have the matchup flipped on it by the Whirlpool + Nature's Madness variant.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Passive damage from entry hazards is aggravating to the grounded, recovery-lacking Tapu Fini, which is only exacerbated when its Leftovers are cancelled out by sand or, worse, removed entirely by Knock Off. Though not a straightforward task due to Tapu Fini's ability, it's ruined by poison, which is most commonly inflicted by Toxic Spikes, or burn from Scald after a lengthy stalemate with Toxapex that has outlasted Misty Terrain.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald allows Tapu Fini to hit back at Fire-types like Heatran and Victini and threaten burns against Landorus-T and Tapu Bulu switching in, though Surf can be used to hit harder, pressuring the likes of specially defensive Gliscor and offensive Heatran better; this is sometimes preferable due to Scald not being able to burn many targets. Moonblast is crucial to threaten Ash-Greninja as well as others like Kommo-o and Weavile. Defog can be used on Tapu Fini when it can't be fit elsewhere on the team, allowing it to negate progress with entry hazards from Ash-Greninja and Heatran. Taunt has a wide variety of uses, such as blocking recovery and entry hazards from Chansey, Clefable, and Toxapex. Nature's Madness is another option that can be slotted on instead of Scald or Defog, brutally punishing a variety of targets including Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Magearna as they switch in. Nature's Madness pairs well with Taunt, as it then becomes massively threatening against the likes of Chansey and Clefable when Taunt can block their method of healing the damage off. Knock Off is a safe punishing option that can hurt the longevity of the likes of Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and opposing Tapu Fini by removing their Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>92 Defense EVs allow Tapu Fini to always survive +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock, and 32 Special Attack EVs ensure that Moonblast OHKOes it after Stealth Rock. 16 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Crawdaunt. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to best take on the likes of Ash-Greninja and Heatran. If Tapu Fini is paired with another Hawlucha answer, such as Zapdos, then it's free to shift its EVs around to hit 192 Speed, outspeeding Modest Heatran. Another option for an EV spread is a physically defensive set consisting of 248 HP / 156 Def / 40 SpD / 64 Spe with a Bold nature, suiting Tapu Fini to better handle physical threats like Mega Charizard X and Mega Lopunny, with the Defense EVs letting it survive two Zen Headbutts from Mega Medicham from full health with Leftovers recovery. 64 Speed EVs let Tapu Fini outspeed Adamant non-Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The biggest priority when using Tapu Fini is dodging Knock Off, as without a way to heal, it's virtually finished without Leftovers. The exceptions to this are if Tapu Fini is required to handle Weavile in a pinch or in certain situations where it's favorable enough to trade chip damage against the likes of Landorus-T. Greninja isn't easy at all; if you are unable to deduce whether the foe is Battle Bond or Protean Greninja from team preview and guess wrong, Tapu Fini will be severely damaged by Gunk Shot as it switches in. Grassium Z Heatran is equally as threatening, though once Heatran takes entry hazards and it's revealed to not have Leftovers, you know to be suspicious of it. Tapu Fini should be switched in frequently to set Misty Terrain to neuter opposing Scald and block Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Toxapex, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, providing safer entry for physical attackers like Weavile, Kartana, and Kyurem-B and assisting teammates that use contact moves like Mega Charizard X and the aforementioned Kartana by protecting them from Static from Zapdos and Flame Body from Volcarona. If Tapu Fini is your team's only Hawlucha check, you should generally not use it until it is needed, if possible, considering the small margin for chip damage afforded against +2 Acrobatics. When facing a Toxic Spikes setter with Tapu Fini as your team's Defogger, take note of the amount of turns of Misty Terrain remaining; you have to get Tapu Fini in to clear the Toxic Spikes before the Misty Terrain runs out, or it'll never be able to remove them without braving poison again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Fini primarily finds its home on fast-paced offense teams, which appreciate its immense short-term defensive prowess and especially the Misty Terrain it brings to the field. Physical attackers, including Weavile, Kyurem-B, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, are vitalized by a temporary immunity to burn as well as other effects like Toxic poison and paralysis, giving them bold entry opportunities against the likes of Toxapex, Seismitoad, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Mega Charizard X is another attacker that appreciates Misty Terrain, as it can freely set up on Toxapex and Slowbro without fear of Toxic while it's active. Secondary or alternative Defoggers like Landorus-T and Kartana can either lift the pressure off of Tapu Fini in the face of Toxic Spikes Toxapex or free up a moveslot for it entirely. Fire-types like Heatran and either Mega Charizard forme can take care of Ferrothorn and other annoying Grass-types like Serperior and Choice-locked Kartana for Tapu Fini, with Tapu Fini providing them a safe switch into Ash-Greninja. Tapu Fini fits well on Mega Charizard Y teams as it's a Water-type that doesn't necessarily require a Water-type STAB move, which would be weakened, as well as its proficiency at weakening Toxapex and Chansey for Mega Charizard Y with its combination of Nature's Madness and Taunt.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Holding onto its defensive utility that comes with its great typing and bulk, Tapu Fini's threat as a Calm Mind sweeper lies in how difficult it is to cleanly revenge kill, giving it a great matchup into offensive teams. Calm Mind allows Tapu Fini to boost up alongside and beat Volcarona and, combined with Taunt, turn Toxapex into setup fodder. The Special Defense boosts are great for blunting weaker special attacks like Volt Switch from Rotom-W and Magearna and Moonblast from Clefable. Surf is chosen over Scald due to the Base Power difference becoming more significant with boosts, with one notable advantage being that it cleanly OHKOes Swords Dance Gliscor after a Calm Mind boost and has much better odds to OHKO specially defensive Heatran at +2. Defog can be used over Taunt if Tapu Fini's team really can't fit it anywhere else, still maintaining a threat level without Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>96 Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed Jolly Crawdaunt and Modest Magearna. 216 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature ensure the 2HKO on Mega Scizor with +1 Surf after Stealth Rock. Wiki Berry synergizes great with this set's main strategy, allowing it to trade damage with the likes of Tapu Koko and Magearna and recoup health immediately. Leftovers is another viable option that sacrifices this to have more consistent early- and mid-game usage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Heatran that Tapu Fini checks and threatens out make for a perfect opportunity to set up a free Calm Mind boost. A lot of offensive teams have to rely on Pokemon that can't safely switch directly into Tapu Fini, like Kartana and Tapu Koko, in order to threaten out Tapu Fini after it grabs an early Calm Mind boost, giving it an opportunity to take chunks out of slower pivots like Rotom-W and Magearna as they attempt to bring the revenge killers in. Although Toxapex seems like a straightforward matchup, Toxapex still holds the threat of burning Tapu Fini with Scald after the Terrain runs dry, so this interaction is not something you should charge headfirst into at the start of a match; a better idea is to wait until Toxapex's teammates are too weakened to safely take a hit once Toxapex is forced out by boosted attacks and Taunt. Although Tapu Fini is adept at trading off HP and spreading chip damage, it's best to avoid taking unnecessary hits like Rotom-W's Volt Switch if Tapu Fini's health needs to be preserved to defensively check Ash-Greninja or pose a late-game threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well onto bulky offensive structures to give them some defensive solidity while also being a threat itself, improving their matchup against opposing offensive teams. Wallbreakers like Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B can soften up the opposing team to give Tapu Fini an easier time making progress and vice versa, with both of these examples appreciating the temporary status immunity from Misty Terrain when dealing with the likes of Toxapex. Offensive Magearna sets, such as offensive Trick Room, make for interesting partners, as they appreciate Tapu Fini taking the heat off of them defensively against the likes of Greninja and Kommo-o, and they can work away at Fairy-type checks like opposing defensive Magearna, Celesteela, and Toxapex. Cresselia is a great teammate, as it can provide Lunar Dance support, instantly recouping Tapu Fini's HP and giving it more free reign for defensive usage and to trade HP early- to mid-game. Mega Heracross synergizes well with both Tapu Fini and the aforementioned Cresselia, appreciating Misty Terrain preventing Scald burns and Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and Chansey as it switches in as well as Trick Room from Cresselia.</p>"
      },
      "Whirlpool Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Whirlpool allows Tapu Fini to lock a passive Pokemon, like Toxapex or Chansey, into a one-on-one, forcibly removing them from the game when used in conjunction with Taunt and Nature's Madness. Taunt prevents healing attempts from Toxapex, Chansey, and Clefable and is essential to their removal. Nature's Madness is the main driving force of Tapu Fini's trapping operation, chipping down its targets with its repeated use. Moonblast is the finishing move in this sequence while giving this set more viability when its targets are not present and allowing Tapu Fini to check Choice Specs Greninja, Kommo-o, and Hawlucha.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>64 Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed Adamant non-Mega Tyranitar. 156 Defense EVs let Tapu Fini avoid the 2HKO from Mega Medicham's Zen Headbutt after Leftovers recovery. The remaining EVs are pooled into Special Defense, helping out Tapu Fini with special attackers like Ash-Greninja. Though a physically defensive spread is great for the likes of Mega Charizard X and Mega Lopunny, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 92 Def / 32 SpA / 120 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm nature can be used instead, with the physical bulk letting Tapu Fini dodge the OHKO from +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock, 32 Special Attack EVs ensuring Moonblast OHKOes Hawlucha after Stealth Rock, and 16 Speed EVs to outpace Adamant Crawdaunt. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to best take on the likes of Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tapu Fini has lots of opportunity to switch in during a game using its stellar defensive typing to come in on resisted attacks from the likes of Greninja and Heatran, as well as using Misty Terrain to avoid status from Toxapex or Chansey to switch in unscathed. You should refrain from using Whirlpool until you are faced with one of the aforementioned targets, as revealing Whirlpool too early can dissuade them from switching in. Once Tapu Fini has imprisoned them with Whirlpool, use Taunt immediately, as any time wasted by the opponent being able to heal could result in Whirlpool running out of turns and setting the opposing Pokemon free. Use Nature's Madness until the opposing Pokemon is drained low enough to be finished off by Moonblast. It's important to note that Tapu Fini is essentially trading itself for Chansey due to the high amount of damage it can rack up in response with repeated Seismic Tosses, so consider whether you need Tapu Fini to check an opposing threat before trapping a target. Other than trapping, it supports its teammates with Misty Terrain and uses its defensive typing to handle the likes of Ash-Greninja.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant is a great addition to offense and bulky offense teams, as Tapu Fini wants strong wallbreakers and efficient cleaners to take advantage of the holes it leaves with its forcible removal. Among the Pokemon that take advantage of a team missing Toxapex and Chansey are Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona; the former becomes a much more threatening wallbreaking presence and the latter is often left with little to stand up to its sweep. Kartana is a nice idea for a Defogger teammate, as it benefits greatly from Misty Terrain removing the threat of weak Scalds from the likes of Toxapex and Slowbro and adverse contact effects like Zapdos's Static and Volcarona's Flame Body. Heatran can handle Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Serperior for Tapu Fini and appreciates having Chansey and Toxapex handled by something else so that it can drop Taunt with less downsides.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia's incredible bulk as well as its important defensive typing gives it a strong place in the tier, as it is one of the best defensive answers to the incredibly threatening Mega Medicham and can handle other offensive mainstays like Tapu Lele. Cresselia can act as a soft check to most Pokemon in the tier, being unthreatened by the majority of neutral attacks. Its Calm Mind variant can be incredibly difficult for some offense teams to handle, as Cresselia has the bulk to withstand strong physical hits such as Kyurem-B's Subzero Slammer. Alternatively, it serves as an important part of Trick Room teams, setting Trick Room incredibly consistently due to how difficult it is to KO. The cherry on top of its support capabilities is its signature move Lunar Dance, giving a second life to common Trick Room teammates like Alolan Marowak and Crawdaunt. However, despite Cresselia's hit-taking capabilities, it is significantly held back by needing to use Moonlight for recovery, due to its low PP. It can also be significantly passive, inviting in threats such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Mawile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cresselia can also function as support for hyper offense teams, using Thunder Wave in place of Trick Room and a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 136 SpD / 56 Spe with a Calm nature. The Defense investment allows it to survive +1 Knock Off from Kartana after Stealth Rock. The 56 EVs in Speed allow it to outspeed a paralyzed Mega Alakazam. This variant may also hold an Eject Button to reverse momentum against U-turn and Volt Switch users. Another option is a Choice Scarf set, utilizing Trick to punish common switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Chansey, as well as Thunder Wave, Ice Beam and Lunar Dance, forgoing recovery in its moveset to make space for more utility options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Cresselia does very little damage to Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, Greninja, and Crawdaunt, and it additionally has to fear Pursuit trapping from the first two.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Cresselia can be shut down by Taunt from the likes of Tornadus-T, Heatran, Serperior, and Tapu Fini, as it shuts down Cresselia from setting up Calm Mind, using Trick Room or Lunar Dance, and healing with Moonlight. Mental Herb can counteract this, but it can only do so a single time, meaning Cresselia can be vulnerable to Taunt later on.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: When Cresselia is burned or poisoned, it has a much harder time keeping healthy in conjunction with Moonlight's limited PP. This can be made even worse if Cresselia loses its Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile can switch into Cresselia completely for free and take advantage of it by setting up Stealth Rock or Swords Dance as it is threatened out. Heart Swap Magearna can also completely invalidate the Calm Mind variant of Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Non-sun Weather</strong>: Rain, sand, and hail halve Moonlight's healing capabilities, which severely limits Cresselia's longevity. The last two have the added detriment of chipping away at Cresselia's health, further diminishing its capability to keep healthy.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cresselia's impressive bulk makes it a great user of Calm Mind, setting up on multiple physical attackers, such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny. It is especially threatening against offense teams that rely on Pokemon with no recovery, such as Greninja, to check it. Ice Beam allows Cresselia to threaten Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Swords Dance Gliscor, which this set can beat one-on-one. Psyshock is Cresselia's choice of STAB move, notably being able to bypass opposing Calm Mind boosts from the likes of Clefable and Magearna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 Speed EVs are used to outpace uninvested Rotom-W. 92 Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature allows Cresselia to avoid the 3HKO from Mega Lopunny's Frustration after Stealth Rock and two rounds of Leftovers. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack, notably reaching benchmarks such as OHKOing most variants of specially defensive Gliscor with +1 Ice Beam, 2HKOing Tapu Koko with +1 Psyshock, and OHKOing Mega Lopunny with +1 Psyshock after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Cresselia has outstanding bulk, it relies on Moonlight to heal itself, which can be problematic due to the move's low PP. This means that both status and the removal of its Leftovers are to be avoided if possible. Cresselia is considered one of the best defensive checks to Mega Medicham, so do not be afraid to switch Cresselia into it. Early- to mid-game, Cresselia's usage is mostly defensive, putting a stop to the aforementioned Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny, as well as pivoting in on Tapu Lele's Psyshock to give Steel-type teammates like Magearna and Heatran some relief. Late-game, when checks such as Greninja, Heatran, and Mega Mawile have been dealt with, Cresselia can go for a sweep with Calm Mind, being able to shrug off most neutral physical attacks and even weak super effective ones like U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Tornadus-T as it accrues boosts. What sets Cresselia apart from other defensive Psychic-types is how it can set up alongside opposing bulky setup threats, including Swords Dance Gliscor and Calm Mind Clefable, Magearna, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias, and beat them one-on-one. However, Cresselia does need to be mindful about Moonlight PP, especially against the last two.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia appreciates Toxic Spikes from Toxapex, punishing Dark-types like Greninja and Weavile and putting them on a timer. Pairing Cresselia with a Dark-resistant teammate such as Clefable or Magearna is vital, as it has a tendency to invite them in. Magearna is an especially good partner, as it helps check Psychic-types too, lessening Cresselia's burden when facing Tapu Lele teams. A consistent check to Heatran, such as Gliscor or Seismitoad, is useful, as Heatran can switch into Cresselia completely freely. Sun support from Mega Charizard Y gives Cresselia a more efficient Moonlight, which is especially useful due to its low PP. Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T can remove opposing Leftovers from Cresselia's checks, such as Heatran and Tapu Fini, allowing them to get chipped down much more easily.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set heavily taps into Cresselia's support capabilities, acting as a great mid- to late-game Trick Room setter. Ice Beam allows Cresselia to hit back at Landorus-T and Garchomp, preventing Cresselia from being completely passive against them. Moonlight allows Cresselia to remain healthy and act as as a valuable defensive piece that handles big threats to Trick Room teams like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny. Trick Room enables Cresselia's slow teammates and can be immediately followed up by a Lunar Dance to both completely replenish a chipped down or statused teammate and give them as many Trick Room turns as possible to work with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>152 Defense EVs allow Cresselia to survive Subzero Slammer from Kyurem-B with an Attack-boosting nature after Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs are pooled into Special Defense to give Cresselia an easier time setting up Trick Room against premier special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, Ash-Greninja, and offensive Magearna.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is relatively straightforward to use in the context of a Trick Room team, setting Trick Room in front of the many Pokemon that cannot threaten it. It can be used to effortlessly check Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny at any point throughout a game, as well as act as a stopgap against Tapu Lele, which is something to take into consideration when deciding whether to use Lunar Dance. Cresselia can provide value at any point in the match; however, it especially shines late-game, as it is able to sacrifice itself after serving its purpose to bring back a teammate that was previously out of commission with Lunar Dance, alongside giving it the optimal amount of Trick Room turns. It is important to be mindful of Cresselia's often passive nature, as it lets in threats like Mega Mawile completely for free.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set should not be used on anything other than a dedicated Trick Room team, as Trick Room support is quite underwhelming when not paired with offensive partners to exploit it. Good choices for offensive teammates include Alolan Marowak, Crawdaunt, and Mega Mawile, as they are all able to use their low Speed to their advantage under Trick Room, and they all appreciate Lunar Dance from Cresselia replenishing their health as well as curing any potential statuses. One Trick Room setter on its own is not enough to facilitate the team style, so Cresselia should always be paired with other Trick Room setters like Magearna and Uxie to be used early- to mid-game.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur's great physical and special bulk, key resistances to prominent types like Water, Electric, Grass, and Fairy, and ability Thick Fat to take away two weaknesses render it a great defensive check to a number of the best Pokemon in the tier. More specifically, it is able to switch into and beat almost every variant of Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, and Magearna and check Kartana and Tapu Koko very handily. It can also take advantage of a lot of more passive defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Fini, and Tangrowth. Mega Venusaur's Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes on entry, making it a valuable addition to teams weak to them. It is able to differentiate itself from Amoonguss with Thick Fat, which enables it to take moves like Ice Beam from Magearna and Fire Fang from Mega Mawile comfortably, much bigger immediate bulk, and significantly better offensive presence. However, Amoonguss has access to Regenerator, can hold an item, and doesn't take up the team's Mega slot, giving it a decent niche over Mega Venusaur. While it is a good Water-type answer, it is not a reliable Choice Specs Greninja switch-in on its own, as Dark Pulse does too much for Mega Venusaur to check it consistently; thus, it requires a different one besides itself. While Mega Venusaur's typing is fantastic defensively, wallbreakers that can exploit said typing like Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele pose a huge threat to it. Furthermore, its main form of reliable recovery, Synthesis, has a measly 8 PP, meaning Mega Venusaur cannot last deep into late-game without outside support, especially since it can be forced into awkward situations where it is forced to use Synthesis more often than it'd like. Its recovery is also lowered to 25% by both rain and sand, reducing its otherwise high effectiveness against those archetypes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Deviating from the main set is generally not advised; however, some alternatives are available if absolutely required. Earthquake can be used over Hidden Power Fire if Magnezone is used alongside Mega Venusaur as a different way of dealing with Mega Mawile and Magearna along with hitting Heatran. Giga Drain is Mega Venusaur's best option for an offensive Grass-type STAB attack but doesn't function nearly as effectively as other options and should be avoided unless absolutely needed. Sleep Powder and Knock Off are both semi-viable alternatives to Leech Seed; however, they are extremely fringe and should not be considered in the very vast majority of cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: With the exception of Reuniclus, most Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele can't directly switch into Mega Venusaur, but they can take advantage of it after getting in through double switches and U-turn or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T dislikes being poisoned by Sludge Bomb; however, due to Regenerator, it can get away with it and put pressure on Mega Venusaur. Gliscor completely walls Mega Venusaur and can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, both Charizard Mega Evolutions, Volcarona, and even Victini can muscle through Venusaur despite Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of consistent long-term healing, Mega Venusaur is quite prone to being chipped down, especially through entry hazards, and can be put into scenarios where it can no longer check what it's supposed to.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar prevents Mega Venusaur's Synthesis from healing it any significant amount, rendering it significantly harder to use, can Pursuit trap it, and doesn't fear Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Reuniclus is able to ignore Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb poisoning thanks to Magic Guard while taking insignificant damage from the latter, meaning it can freely use Mega Venusaur as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: While not being able to touch it directly outside of burning it with Scald, Toxapex completely walls Mega Venusaur and has access to Regenerator, coming out of their exchange ahead quite comfortably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed allows Mega Venusaur to keep itself healthy throughout the game without relying on Synthesis's small number of PP. It works great on forced switches, allowing Mega Venusaur to beat Mega Mawile and Magearna with a lot more ease, gradually chip its checks, and avoid being entirely passive while healing, helping its teammates in the process. Mega Venusaur is also able to deter the Grass-types that would be able to absorb it otherwise thanks to Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Fire. Sludge Bomb is its strongest option against the Fairy-types it checks so well like Clefable and the Island Guardians. Its 30% chance of poisoning also disrupts checks like Tornadus-T and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire is required in order to beat Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Magearna, Celesteela, Kartana, and Mega Scizor and prevent Ferrothorn from getting free turns to set up Spikes against Mega Venusaur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chlorophyll is chosen as the pre-Mega ability in case of sun being present, as Overgrow is entirely useless; this set does not carry a Grass-type move. The EV spread listed allows Venusaur to survive two Dark Pulses from Choice Specs Greninja after Stealth Rock while outspeeding maximum Speed Mega Mawile. The rest is dumped into Defense to make Mega Venusaur a worthwhile Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Venusaur appreciates being brought in safely through doubles and U-turn or Volt Switch in order to threaten the opposition with Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb. Despite this, it's very capable of switching into a large number of attacks and shrugging them off, such as Mega Mawile's Play Rough, Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech, Kartana's Leaf Blade, and Magearna's Fleur Cannon. However, Mega Venusaur is much more limited in recovery compared to defensive walls like Toxapex due to Synthesis's low PP; it should not be brought in on powerful attacks repeatedly, as it can be overwhelmed. For this reason, Mega Venusaur should be wary of switching into entry hazards, and accordingly, try to limit or remove them as much as possible. Mega Venusaur should attempt to use Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb as often as possible, as those moves provide the greatest results, both immediately and long-term. Using Leech Seed often will help both Mega Venusaur itself and its teammates, as it will allow Mega Venusaur to prolong its life without relying on Synthesis but also alleviate pressure for a teammate switching into Heatran or Tornadus-T, and Sludge Bomb poisoning Tornadus-T makes Mega Venusaur's life much easier. Hidden Power Fire should be used on Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Celesteela after they have already been hit by Leech Seed as well as on Ferrothorn and Kartana. Synthesis should only be used when Mega Venusaur absolutely requires the instant healing burst, as it kills momentum for the user and has very limited use due to its low PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Celesteela is arguably Mega Venusaur's most effective partner; it can switch into Pokemon Mega Venusaur cannot deal with, such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele while Venusaur itself deals with Pokemon Celesteela hates facing, such as Tangrowth and Zapdos. It also helps pressure their mutual checks, like Heatran, and alleviate pressure off Mega Venusaur for checking Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Tapu Fini is an excellent entry hazard remover and Heatran check and provides another Ash-Greninja check. Conversely, Mega Venusaur checks Grass-types like Kartana and Electric-types like Tapu Koko for it. Tornadus-T is another great entry hazard remover for Mega Venusaur. It can also get Mega Venusaur in for free on Celesteela, Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Magearna, while both Tornadus-T and Mega Venusaur pressure Heatran. Rotom-W can use Defog for Mega Venusaur, switch into Heatran and Tornadus-T, and pressure common checks like Toxapex. It also provides a secondary Water-type answer, albeit not an Ash-Greninja check. Defensive Magearna variants like Assault Vest and Heart Swap can switch into and check Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Ash-Greninja, helping Mega Venusaur perform its role more easily. They also pressure Heatran and can bring Mega Venusaur in safely through Volt Switch. Swords Dance Garchomp is a strong Heatran check and a good Fire-type answer and can take advantage of Toxapex, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T while providing Stealth Rock utility to the team.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<h3>Mega Charizard X</h3> <p>Mega Charizard X is an extremely strong wallbreaker and setup sweeper that can offensively pressure key Steel- and Grass-types such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth. Its great offensive typing after Mega Evolving and strong STAB options boosted by Tough Claws allow it to break past most of the metagame with near-unresisted STAB and coverage options. Mega Charizard X's good Speed tier enables it to outpace fast foes such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Gliscor, giving it the edge over other slower wallbreakers. Access to Dragon Dance makes Mega Charizard X extremely threatening after a boost, outspeeding even some Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T. However, it is extremely susceptible to entry hazards; before Charizard Mega Evolves, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and struggles to effectively switch in, and after Mega Evolving it becomes vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards. Furthermore, it is also chipped down by residual damage like Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T and Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn as well as taking substantial Flare Blitz recoil to deal with these foes, which limits its ability to break these Pokemon without being worn down into range of faster attackers or priority itself.</p> <h3>Mega Charizard Y</h3> <p>Mega Charizard Y shines in OU as the best sun setter in the tier thanks to its ability Drought and a premier attacker with its strong coverage options, allowing it to rip through offensive teams. Not only does it take advantage of its own sun thanks to its high Special Attack, Fire typing, and access to Solar Beam, Mega Charizard Y also enables a wide array of different Pokemon, be it Synthesis, Moonlight, and Morning Sun users or Fire-types seeking to fire off boosted versions of their STAB moves and to face weakened Water-type moves. Moreover, Mega Charizard Y is blessed with an extensive movepool, allowing it to run strong options such as Focus Blast to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran, and it has access to Roost to improve its staying power, which meshes well with its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes provided by its Flying typing. Finally, its ability Drought is a formidable tool against teams relying on weather other than sun to function such as rain and sand, allowing Mega Charizard Y to stop some threats seen in those structures such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill. However, its Fire / Flying typing is also a curse; Stealth Rock, a move present on virtually every team, cuts Mega Charizard Y's HP in half once it enters the field. Additionally, its average Speed makes it prone to being easily revenge killed by offensive threats such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. Despite Mega Charizard Y being a hard hitter, it is still walled by common balance picks such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Mega Latias.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Mega Charizard X</h4> <p>Fire Punch can be run instead of Flare Blitz on Mega Charizard X's Dragon Dance set, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Substitute can be used to help ensure safe setup against status users and eliminate 50-50s around Landorus-T's Intimidate. Outrage can be run instead of Dragon Claw to 2HKO stall staples such as Quagsire and Pyukumuku, but having to lock itself into it to hit Pokemon like Garchomp is often undesirable for Mega Charizard X. Will-O-Wisp can be run to cripple potential switch-ins such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T. Toxic can also be run to ease Mega Charizard X's matchup against stall and to be able to break through bulky Water-types like Quagsire and Pyukumuku without having to lock itself into Outrage in the long run. Swords Dance and Flame Charge can be used alongside Dragon Claw and Earthquake. Swords Dance allows Mega Charizard X to overcome Toxapex and Tapu Fini more easily with Earthquake, while Flame Charge still offers a Speed boost with modest enough power to help Mega Charizard X from being walled by Celesteela and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Mega Charizard Y</h4> <p>Overheat is the highest-Base Power viable STAB move available for Mega Charizard Y, but the following Special Attack drop means that it can't be used as a main option and needs to be coupled with Flamethrower, meaning Mega Charizard Y is giving up a coverage moveslot for it. Surprisingly, Mega Charizard Y can be a decent secondary Defog user against the likes of Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor. Toxic is an option to punish common switch-ins to Mega Charizard Y such as Kommo-o and Mega Latias, but it's useless against the likes of Chansey and Toxapex. Will-O-Wisp, while still not helpful against the aforementioned Pokemon, allows Mega Charizard Y to punish offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Mega Swampert and avoids shenanigans from Sucker Punch users such as Mega Mawile and Bisharp. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe with a Bold nature lets Mega Charizard Y block the likes of Kartana and Mega Mawile more effectively and outpace Mega Swampert out of rain. However, the losses of power and Speed worsen its wallbreaking ability a lot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Mega Charizard X</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types and Stealth Rock</strong>: Prior to Mega Evolving, Charizard is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and is heavily crippled by switching in; after Mega Evolving, it is still weakened by the entry hazard. Mega Charizard X is also extremely vulnerable to Rock-type attackers such as Mega Diancie, Mega Tyranitar, and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Due to their resistance to Fire, bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can switch into its main STAB move to cripple it with status or weaken it with Scald. Tapu Fini is Mega Charizard X's most notable counter due to its Dragon immunity, allowing it to wall Mega Charizard X's STAB combination; Misty Terrain also weakens Dragon-type attacks for Tapu Fini's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As well as Mega Charizard X's vulnerability to Stealth Rock, it is extremely susceptible to Spikes and Toxic Spikes after Mega Evolving. Other residual damage, such as Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T, Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn, and Rough Skin from Garchomp, also weakens Mega Charizard X into range of faster attackers and priority.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mega Charizard X is extremely vulnerable to Ground-type moves after Mega Evolving, and foes such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon can switch into it and threaten to KO it.</p> <h4>Mega Charizard Y</h4> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Tapu Koko outspeeds and OHKOes Mega Charizard Y with its STAB Thunderbolt. Mega Lopunny can OHKO it with Fake Out followed by Frustration. Mega Pinsir can also OHKO it with Frustration boosted by Aerilate. However, most offensive threats are unable to switch into Mega Charizard Y directly.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Mega Latias walls Mega Charizard Y, heals off any damage taken, and spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave. Mega Latios, even without bulk investment, is able to switch into any hit from Mega Charizard Y and, thanks to its better Speed, can heal off the damage and force it out with its STAB moves. Kommo-o resists Mega Charizard Y's STAB Fire-type moves and Solar Beam and is immune to Focus Blast thanks to Bulletproof, but it must be wary of the rare Air Slash. Kommo-o can also set up Stealth Rock. Garchomp can stomach some attacks, force Mega Charizard Y out with a faster Devastating Drake or Continental Crush, and set up Stealth Rock. Hydreigon, with bulk investment, walls Mega Charizard Y variants lacking Focus Blast and heals off any damage taken. Dragonite, especially with Multiscale, can take any hit from Mega Charizard Y and threaten it with Supersonic Skystrike. While uncommon, Mega Altaria walls Mega Charizard Y, heals off any damage taken, and spreads paralysis with Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex walls Mega Charizard Y and can threaten it back with Toxic. Volcanion with Assault Vest can take a few hits, allowing it to chip away at Mega Charizard Y and put it in the range of Explosion. Pelipper, thanks to Drizzle, weakens the power of Mega Charizard Y's STAB Fire-type moves, allowing Pelipper to either force it out with a boosted Scald or bring a rain-oriented threat on the field such as Ash-Greninja or Mega Swampert with a slower U-turn. Moreover, Pelipper is able to lock down Mega Charizard Y using Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type coverage</strong>: Mega Diancie resists Mega Charizard Y's STAB moves, outpaces it, and threatens an OHKO with Diamond Storm, additionally being able to set up Stealth Rock. The uncommon Mega Aerodactyl does the same thing but with the advantage of healing off damage thanks to Roost. Mega Charizard Y should be especially aware of not locking itself with Solar Beam if facing Tyranitar, as Tyranitar can OHKO it with Rock Slide. Moreover, Tyranitar can outpace Mega Charizard Y with Choice Scarf and potentially punish it with Pursuit. Mega Charizard Y also has to keep an eye on Rock-type coverage such as Stone Edge, commonly used by the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Thanks to its bulk boosted by Eviolite, Chansey walls Mega Charizard Y and can set up Stealth Rock and spread paralysis and poison with Thunder Wave and Toxic, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Due to its quadruple weakness to Rock, the presence of Stealth Rock greatly limits the ability of Mega Charizard Y to switch in and wallbreak.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance X": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Mega Charizard X's best way to hit Heatran and Toxapex, and it can significantly damage Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. It also provides a way to hit Ground-weak Steel-types such as Magearna and Magnezone without suffering from recoil damage. However, Earthquake can be dropped in favor of Dragon Claw, as Mega Charizard X can opt to not Mega Evolve right away to use Heatran as setup fodder instead. Roost is run over a third coverage option to allow Mega Charizard X to recover HP that it loses from Flare Blitz recoil or switching into Stealth Rock. This allows Mega Charizard X to more consistently check Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Serperior. However, on more offensively geared teams, Roost can be foregone for Dragon Claw; Dragon Claw still 2HKOes specially defensive Toxapex and hits important targets like Rotom-W, Garchomp, and Mega Latias. It also has better neutral coverage in general. Neither Dragon Claw nor Outrage should be run if Tapu Fini is on Mega Charizard X's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature enables Mega Charizard X to outspeed Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B. Running Blaze as Charizard's pre-Mega ability prevents it from being damaged by Solar Power if it is brought in when sun is up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X should avoid switching in directly on neutral attacks, especially when Stealth Rock is up. It is optimal to bring it in either on weaker moves, through pivot support, or after a teammate has fainted. Mega Evolving as soon as possible is optimal to grant Mega Charizard X a new resistance to Electric as well as a neutrality to Water. This also removes Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock; however, it becomes susceptible to Spikes and Toxic Spikes as a result. However, if Charizard has the opportunity to set up on Landorus-T lacking Stone Edge, it can hold off on Mega Evolving to avoid Ground-type attacks. Despite its ability to check a variety of Grass-types, Mega Charizard X's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving and vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards after mean it cannot consistently pivot into them. It can, however, use weak Grass-type attacks such as Tangrowth's Giga Drain as an opportunity to switch in and gain setup turns. It is best to use Mega Charizard X and set up mid- or late-game after its checks in bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex have been weakened or eliminated. Priority users such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Mawile should also be removed if Mega Charizard X is not able to heal itself with Roost, as these Pokemon can revenge kill it after some chip damage. Mega Charizard X should be cautious of using its STAB moves; Flare Blitz forces it to take heavy recoil damage, which can be used to weaken Mega Charizard X into range of priority, so when it KOes a Fire-weak foe, it should be wary of its HP. Outrage, on the other hand, locks Mega Charizard X in, meaning that if it KOes a foe, a powerful Fairy-type such as Mega Mawile, Magearna, or Tapu Lele can be brought in for free to KO it. While Mega Charizard X is an effective sweeper late-game, it can also wallbreak earlier in the match to soften its own checks like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Mega Charizard X should proactively use Roost when its HP is getting low; it can take advantage of free turns where it forces opposing Pokemon out in order to switch to a counter to regain its HP. Toxic poison and paralysis heavily cripple Mega Charizard X, so it should avoid directly switching into foes such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Clefable. Mega Charizard X is also heavily reliant on its Attack stat to break through and sweep teams, so it struggles against Intimidate from Landorus-T and struggles to find setup opportunities when it pivots in; make sure it is weakened before setting up so it cannot pivot around Mega Charizard X and weaken its offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X fits best on offensive or bulky offense teams that appreciate a setup sweeper that can punish common Steel- and Grass-types. Due to Mega Charizard X's vulnerability to entry hazards due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, it appreciates partners that can clear those hazards, such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Tapu Fini; the latter also protects it from status after Mega Evolving due to Misty Terrain. It also appreciates secondary forms of hazard removal such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Serperior. Mega Charizard X also appreciates entry hazard support from its own teammates to chip its switch-ins such as Tapu Fini. Thus, Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Clefable pair well with Mega Charizard X. Pivot support such as U-turn from Tornadus-T and Landorus-T helps to bring Mega Charizard X in on a free switch so it avoids taking extra damage and allows it to complete its role more easily. Bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex are difficult for Mega Charizard X to break through, especially when it's unboosted. Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Tapu Lele that can take advantage of these foes benefit Mega Charizard X, with the latter appreciating Mega Charizard X removing Steel-types for it. Due to Mega Charizard X's susceptibility to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp after Mega Evolving, reliable switch-ins and checks to these foes like Celesteela and Tapu Bulu are good teammates. In return, Mega Charizard X can break through Steel-types for them. As Mega Charizard X can effectively sweep weakened teams at +1, wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana can help to weaken the opposing team and break through some of its checks.</p>"

      "Drought Wallbreaker Y": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flamethrower, boosted by sun, allows Mega Charizard Y to deal significant damage to Pokemon neutral to Fire such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Zapdos. Moreover, the high amount of PP with the odds to inflict burn makes it the most consistent option during longer matchups against Pokemon such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Mega Latias. However, the higher Base Power of Fire Blast can be vital, since it allows Mega Charizard Y to reach better rolls and OHKO the likes of Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and defensive Landorus-T. Focus Blast lets Mega Charizard Y OHKO Mega Tyranitar and 2HKO specially defensive Heatran. Hidden Power Ground, on teams where Mega Charizard Y doesn't need to hit Tyranitar hard, keeps the 2HKO on Heatran and has more PP and perfect accuracy. Solar Beam complements Drought superbly, giving Mega Charizard Y an option to hit Water-types such as Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W. Roost greatly improves Mega Charizard Y's longevity, allowing it to better handle the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Swampert and to heal off damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Blaze is preferred over Solar Power to avoid taking damage from opposing sun setters before Mega Evolving. A Timid nature with maximum Speed investment is preferred to outpace Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele and ensure it Speed ties with other base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Manaphy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A fundamental aspect with Mega Charizard Y is to understand Drought is the main enabler that allows its teammates to thrive. To allow this dynamic, the field must be free of Stealth Rock, letting Mega Charizard Y access the field without issue. Against offensive teams, Mega Charizard Y should be brought safely onto the field as many times as possible via the support of U-turn and Volt Switch as well as taking advantage of Mega Charizard Y's typing to make aggressive switches on specific situations such as Kartana using its STAB moves and more passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and defensive Landorus-T setting up entry hazards. Its ability to wallbreak and the lack of real checks to it in those matchups mean Mega Charizard Y will often claim a KO, quickly disassembling those structures and giving opportunities to its teammates to clean up. However, during long-drawn matches, Mega Charizard Y has to be used more carefully, using its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Roost, Flamethrower, and other teammates to slowly drain PP from its checks' recovery moves until it can finally break through. When facing opposing weather teams, Mega Charizard Y is essential with its ability to turn the weather into sun and shut down the main threats in those teams such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Charizard Y fits best on balance and bulky offense, since they are the main playstyles able to provide the necessary support. When it comes to Mega Charizard Y, having two ways of removing entry hazards is generally necessary. The best candidates for that role are Kartana, Gliscor, and Tapu Fini, with Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill able to act as secondary hazard removal. Kartana can also remove items from the likes of Toxapex and Chansey with Knock Off, and it appreciates Mega Charizard Y clearing other weathers, boosting the amount of HP recovered by Synthesis. Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Excadrill provide an essential immunity to Electric, with Excadrill able to set up Stealth Rock and Landorus-T and Gliscor able to bring Mega Charizard Y onto the field more easily thanks to U-turn. Although it's not intuitive, Tapu Fini is not always dependant of the power of its Water-type moves to function, so its ability to act as a check for the likes of Ash-Greninja and Heatran is still valid in the context of sun. Moreover, a trapper set, with Nature's Madness, Whirlpool, and Taunt, makes for a good partner with Mega Charizard Y, since it can remove the likes of Toxapex and Chansey for it. Pursuit support from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar, although not mandatory, is appreciated to deal with the likes of Mega Latias and Chansey more effectively. Weavile is helpful to threaten Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Kommo-o and remove Toxapex and Chansey's items with Knock Off, with Mega Charizard Y able to pressure Mega Scizor and Fairy-types for Weavile. The ability of Tyranitar to chip down Mega Charizard Y's counters such as Chansey and Toxapex with sand is a nice addition, especially if Excadrill is used in the mix, as sand allows Excadrill to provide additional speed control thanks to Sand Rush. Since Mega Charizard Y brings sun on the field, users of recovery moves dependant on weather such as Cresselia, Necrozma, and Serperior are all good partners. Cresselia can act as a late-game wincon thanks to Calm Mind or support Mega Charizard Y with Future Sight for Toxapex and Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Pinsir, while Mega Charizard Y can pressure Steel-types for Cresselia. Necrozma can set up Stealth Rock and is able to threaten out Toxapex with Photon Geyser and Heatran with Earth Power. Serperior can harass Mega Charizard Y's counters with Glare, Knock Off, and Taunt. In the same logic, Fire-types, having the power of their STAB moves boosted thanks to Drought, form a deadly core with Mega Charizard Y, able to overwhelm shared checks. The best examples of this are Heatran and Victini. Heatran provides a useful Fire-type immunity, sets up Stealth Rock, and can trap Toxapex and Chansey with Magma Storm and Taunt for Mega Charizard Y. Victini can not only act as a nuclear warhead under sun with V-create but also lure the likes of Toxapex and Mega Latias to KO them with Final Gambit, greatly helping Mega Charizard Y. Certain offensive Dragon-types make for decent partners with Mega Charizard Y; Garchomp is a Ground-type that can set up Stealth Rock and potentially lure Mega Latias to KO it with Devastating Drake. Kyurem pressures Toxapex with Earth Power and Mega Latias with Ice Beam, and it can also drain Chansey's PP with a combination of Pressure, Substitute, and Roost, helping Mega Charizard Y break through it long-term.</p>"

      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage allows Mega Charizard X to break through common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex and Garchomp. It does lock Mega Charizard X in and prevents it from switching out of problematic Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile, however. Dragon Claw can be run instead of Outrage to circumvent Mega Charizard X being trapped and confused by the move, but it is a lot weaker than Outrage and fails to pressure common Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex and does not OHKO bulky variants of Garchomp. Unlike Outrage, it also does not 2HKO Pyukumuku and Quagsire. Earthquake enables Mega Charizard X to hit Heatran super effectively, and it can also be used to damage some other Ground-weak Steel-types like Magearna and Magnezone without Mega Charizard X having to take recoil damage. Roost maintains Mega Charizard X's HP due to it being whittled down easily by Stealth Rock, Flare Blitz recoil, and passive damage such as Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature enables Mega Charizard X to outspeed Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Gliscor. As a wallbreaker, it doesn't need to invest in bulk. Running Blaze as Charizard's pre-Mega ability prevents it from being damaged by Solar Power if it is brought in when sun is up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X can act as a powerful wallbreaker early- or mid-game able to weaken several key metagame staples such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Tangrowth. Safely bringing Mega Charizard X in on a free turn either from pivot support or after a teammate has fainted is optimal; however, it can be brought in on weak resisted attacks such as Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech to give it free turns to Mega Evolve. Mega Evolving early-game is preferred to mitigate Mega Charizard X's 4x Stealth Rock weakness; however, it does become susceptible to every other form of entry hazard while preserving a Stealth Rock weakness. If entry hazards aren't present and after Charizard has Mega Evolved, it can switch into Pokemon it checks more proactively. Mega Charizard X's STAB moves are easy to punish, so it should be cautious when using them, as Flare Blitz's recoil can be used to weaken Mega Charizard X into range of priority. When it KOes a Pokemon weak to Fire such as Tangrowth or Ferrothorn, it should be wary of its HP. Outrage traps Mega Charizard X, so if it KOes a foe, a Fairy-type such as Tapu Lele or Mega Mawile can come in for free and KO Mega Charizard X. Thus, it should only use the move if Fairy-types are all eliminated or it is required for it to KO a threat to itself and its teammates. Mega Charizard X should actively predict foes to switch in; if a Fire-resistant or -immune foe such as Toxapex or Heatran is predicted to switch in, using Outrage or Earthquake can severely weaken or KO one is Mega Charizard X's checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is crucial when running Mega Charizard X due to its need to switch in often to wallbreak; before it Mega Evolves, Stealth Rock removes half of its HP, and it is vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes after it does. Partners such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor, as well as secondary forms of hazard removal such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Kartana, provide this removal. Tapu Fini also provides reliable hazard removal as well as Misty Terrain to block status once Charizard has Mega Evolved. Mega Charizard X's weakness to common Ground-type attackers like Garchomp and Landorus-T warrants checks for these; the aforementioned Defoggers as well as other checks like Tangrowth provide this for Mega Charizard X. Due to Mega Charizard X's lack of a setup move, it struggles to break through bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. As a result, checks to those like Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko benefit Mega Charizard X. Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking ability can be further aided by teammates that can set up entry hazards for it such as Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. It can also wallbreak more effectively when brought in via pivot support; Tornadus-T and Rotom-W can bring Mega Charizard X in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch. Since Mega Charizard X is unable to boost its only average Speed stat and as a result struggles with faster Pokemon, teammates that can check these faster foes such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Ash-Greninja are good partners for Mega Charizard X. In return, Mega Charizard X can break through their checks such as Tangrowth.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Mega Charizard X to zero in on its wallbreaking potential, trading the Speed boost from Dragon Dance to make it even more of a menace to defensive teams. Some examples of its wallbreaking power after a Swords Dance are OHKOing Seismitoad, Chansey after Stealth Rock, and defensive Landorus-T after Intimidate and Stealth Rock. Additionally, it 2HKOes Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and physically defensive Toxapex. The outrageous power of Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz is a huge part of this set, as, despite the recoil perhaps being antithetical to a bulky set, other potential options like Fire Punch are too much of a drop in power. Dragon Claw lets Mega Charizard X slice through Mega Latias and Kommo-o and, most importantly, hit many Fire-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Slowbro neutrally. Dragon Claw is also useful to minimize the amount of recoil damage Charizard has to take, as it can be used instead of Flare Blitz in cases where both are effective. Roost lets Charizard heal the recoil damage from Flare Blitz and entry hazards and set up on the likes of Rotom-W and Assault Vest Magearna. Earthquake could also be used over Dragon Claw to hit Heatran and Toxapex and beat Tapu Fini without Flare Blitz recoil damage, though it hurts Charizard's matchup against opposing Dragon- and Water-types like Mega Latias, Rotom-W, and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is preferred to give Charizard maximum firepower and Speed tie with Mega Medicham, opposing Mega Charizard formes, and Volcarona. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 12 SpD / 172 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to improve Charizard's bulk: the Defense investment allows it to survive Earthquake from offensive Landorus-T and High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham; the Special Defense investment allows it to survive Supersonic Skystrike from offensive Tornadus-T; and the Speed investment allows it to outspeed Timid Heatran. However, this spread reduces Charizard's power and Speed, weakening its matchup against Gliscor and preventing it from revenge killing Hoopa-U, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B. This means the spread should only be used alongside other teammates capable of revenge killing the listed foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X has great bulk, but it's better to save it for trading hits with the likes of Tapu Fini and Slowbro and bring it in safely against passive defensive Pokemon like Jirachi and Clefable, via pivot moves, or when a teammate gets KOed. It's similarly important to keep entry hazards clear from the field, as they severely hinder Charizard's ability to set up, especially since it isn't boosting its Speed, meaning a wider amount of Pokemon can potentially revenge kill it. Charizard can use the Ground immunity its non-Mega forme possesses to set up safely against defensive Landorus-T and Gliscor, so it's better to wait until the power, typing, or extra bulk of its Mega forme is needed to Mega Evolve. Mega Charizard X's good bulk allows it to switch into certain offensive threats like Volcarona, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Choice Band Victini while Stealth Rock isn't up, especially if it's running the secondary defensive EV spread. A good setup opportunity is often good enough to earn a KO against defensive teams, so watch for typical setup fodder like Mega Sableye, defensive Magearna, and Choice-locked Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Mega Charizard X is commonly used on balance teams that appreciate its great matchup against opposing balance teams. Entry hazard removal is a top priority, with Defoggers like Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Kartana clearing the field and allowing Charizard to make the most of its bulk by setting up. Cleric support from the likes of Chansey, Clefable, and Magearna is also something to consider; it takes a lot of the guesswork away from Charizard's matchups against the likes of Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, which can potentially carry Thunder Wave, and allows Charizard to safely KO Serperior, with the paralysis from Glare being removed later. It also helps against Pokemon like Seismitoad and Gliscor that may use Toxic to hinder a non-Mega Charizard's setup, as well as Pokemon Mega Charizard X can't outright OHKO like Slowbro and Toxapex. A Wish user like Chansey or Jirachi can ease Charizard's time getting onto the field, nullifying an attack as it switches in and helping out when hazards are up. When using the aforementioned defensive EV spread, pair Charizard with a solid revenge killer, like Weavile, Kartana, or Ditto, as due to the lower Speed, it can't revenge kill threats like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B. A solid Heatran answer like Seismitoad or Gliscor makes for a good teammate, as without Earthquake, Heatran can wall and threaten Charizard. Toxic Spikes from Toxapex can hinder Tapu Fini and Slowbro and put opposing revenge killers like Garchomp and Ditto on a timer. Fast offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Tapu Koko appreciate Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking ability, which leaves a ruined opposing team for them to clean up.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking's access to a great pool of Sheer Force-boosted coverage options such as Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt allows it to deal heavy damage to defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, and Tangrowth. Its great typing combination grants it immunities to Electric-type attacks, Thunder Wave, and Toxic and lets it absorb Toxic Spikes, something most wallbreakers in the tier cannot do, thus giving it a defensive niche. However, it must compete with stronger or faster wallbreakers in the metagame like Kyurem-B, Hoopa-U, and Mega Charizard Y, and its mediocre bulk and Speed tier make it vulnerable to fast offensive threats like Greninja, Garchomp, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele, which doesn't help much in that regard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In general, Nidoking is better off running a special set than a physical one, since most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Superpower can deal heavy damage to Chansey but unfortunately requires a good amount of EVs invested in Attack. Thunderbolt can be run in the last slot, as it allows Nidoking to OHKO Mantine and Gyarados while also being an alternate way of hitting Celesteela and Tornadus-T for good damage. Stealth Rock is also usable over one of Nidoking's coverage moves to provide hazard support in emergency cases, as Nidoking is able to force out common Defog users like Mega Scizor and Tapu Fini. Sucker Punch with the help of 16 EVs invested into Attack, Nidoking can outspeed and KO Gengar and Mega Alakazam, but other than that, it's not that worthwhile to run the move over Ice Beam or Flamethrower.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Keldeo, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Alakazam can easily revenge kill Nidoking.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Latios can easily check Nidoking; however, none of them can switch into Nidoking for free.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Tornadus-T</strong>: While Tornadus-T cannot switch in safely on Nidoking, it can beat it one-on-one by removing its item with Knock Off and then proceeding to KO with Hurricane after taking damage from Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Specially defensive Celesteela avoids a 2HKO from Flamethrower from Nidoking and can retaliate back with Heavy Slam, annoy it with Leech Seed, and then stall with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Strong Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Greninja and Manaphy are able to outspeed Nidoking and OHKO it with their Water-type STAB moves, while Azumarill is able to deal heavy damage with Aqua Jet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is Nidoking's strongest special Ground-type STAB move, which allows it to check defensive as well as offensive threats such as Toxapex, Jirachi, Alolan Marowak, Magnezone, and Tapu Koko. Sludge Wave lets Nidoking break through defensive threats such as Tangrowth, Tapu Fini, and Clefable as well as slower offensive threats like Tapu Bulu. Ice Beam's coverage enables Nidoking to deal heavy damage to bulkier Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Amoonguss. Substitute provides room for Nidoking and eases predicting switches, making a huge difference when playing against offensive teams. It also prevents Nidoking from getting easily revenge killed, which is a great attribute because it has very few checks, but Flamethrower can also be run to break through defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Fire Blast over Flamethrower is also an alternate option that can 2HKO specially defensive Celesteela in exchange for the accuracy drop.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack maximizes Nidoking's power. Life Orb boosts its power even more and also pairs well with Sheer Force, as it negates the recoil received. Full investment in Speed allows Nidoking to outspeed everything up to Adamant Mimikyu.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use pivots and Volt Switch and U-turn users against offensive teams to switch in Nidoking unscratched, which will allow it to apply immense offensive pressure on its foe. Take advantage of the switches Nidoking can force by going for Substitute. This allows it to apply a lot of offensive pressure while also forcing the opponent to go for certain moves that one can further take advantage of. Nidoking can also be switched into weakened, bulkier Pokemon like Skarmory or a predicted Moonblast from Tapu Fini and proceed to use its two main STAB moves and coverage moves to break through the team, helping faster teammates potentially clean late-game. In order to utilize Nidoking to its fullest, the player is required to predict switches and use its coverage moves accordingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor make for good partners with Nidoking, as they are able to pivot around and switch in Nidoking safely. A faster threat like Mega Alakazam is able to outspeed and check offensive teams that Nidoking usually struggles against. Setup sweepers such as Magearna, Double Dance Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir can sweep late-game after Nidoking has weakened the opposing team. Strong physical attackers like Garchomp, Hoopa-U, Mega Heracross, and Tapu Bulu make great teammates for Nidoking, as they are able to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against. Switch-ins to Psychic-type attacks like Celesteela and Jirachi can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams, while the latter can also provide entry hazard support. Switch-ins to strong Water-type attacks like Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Keldeo are greatly appreciated as well.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable fits perfectly into the tier with its simply superb utility movepool, helpful typing, and incredible ability in Magic Guard, making it a nuisance for any team. It finds countless entry points by absorbing status and weak attacks from defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Toxapex, taking advantage of this to set entry hazards, spread status, clear status, pass Wish—the list really does just go on forever. The way that Clefable can mix and match its moves gives it a very easy time getting onto teams, a perfect example of role compression. The upsides don't just end at its utility; Clefable can quite easily be a threat in its own right, whether it's with a bulky Calm Mind set making use of its status-absorbing capabilities to set up or a Life Orb set using its strong coverage movepool to throw out immediate haymakers. Stall teams can even see Clefable dipping into its other abilities, with Unaware Clefable being an anti-setup mainstay for many of these teams. Even with all these upsides, Clefable can't completely overcome its biggest hurdle: having completely mediocre stats, meaning strong attackers like Mega Mawile and Tapu Lele can carve through it without much issue. Clefable relies on utility to alleviate its passivity, but it finds itself completely stonewalled for the most part by common metagame Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, and Excadrill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sticky Barb can be used alongside Trick to harass the longevity of walls like Toxapex and Chansey, generally putting opposing Pokemon on a strict timer, though this option thuds into Mega Evolutions like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard Y and various Z-Move users like Steelium Z Excadrill and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T; Assault Vest users like Magearna technically fall victim to Trick, though Clefable comes out of that interaction much worse due to being locked out of its utility moveset and healing. Counter can be used to forcefully trade with strong physical attackers like Swords Dance Gliscor, Mega Swampert, and Mega Scizor at full health. Cosmic Power can be used alongside Stored Power, allowing Clefable to become a near invincible behemoth; however, this behemoth hits like a wet noodle and relies solely on not getting hit by a critical hit, so it's less consistent than Calm Mind variants. On the offensive Life Orb set, Ice Beam is an option to OHKO Gliscor and Landorus-T, though Clefable hardly has any coverage slots to spare, so this is rarely worth it. Encore is a method for Clefable to disrupt setup users, both greedy offensive threats like Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile and bulky sweepers like Reuniclus and Cresselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Heatran's 4x resistance to Fairy gives it very easy entry on Clefable, and it threatens to trap and remove Clefable with the combination of Magma Storm + Taunt, though Clefable can annoy it as it switches in with Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Excadrill threatens out Clefable with Iron Head and can negate its Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Jirachi and Mega Scizor are other Steel-types that can batter Clefable with Steel-type moves and pressure it out. However, many Steel-types are nastily surprised by offensive Life Orb variants of Clefable packing Fire Blast. Mega Mawile can set up on and take advantage of Clefable variants lacking Fire-type coverage and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Chansey, Toxapex, and specially defensive Gliscor can handle Life Orb Clefable's attacks and can either set up on it or stall it out; however, Toxapex needs to watch for Electric-type coverage from offensive Life Orb Clefable, Gliscor needs to watch for Ice Beam, and non-Thunder Wave Chansey loses to defensive Calm Mind Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers like Mega Charizard X, Kyurem-B, and Mega Mawile can blow through Clefable with their powerful STAB attacks, though Kyurem-B and to a lesser extent Mega Mawile can't switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Volcarona can use their resistance to Fairy to switch directly into Moonblast and threaten out Clefable with either their incredible immediate power or by setting up. None of the aforementioned Pokemon are happy with taking paralysis from Thunder Wave as they switch in, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Clefable is a great Stealth Rock setter because it can use Magic Guard to get unpunished entry on defensive walls without being threatened by status like Toxic and burn, gifting it plenty of free opportunities. Moonblast is a consistent damage-dealing option, and it can be complemented well by Knock Off to hinder Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Heatran and Celesteela by removing their longevity. Soft-Boiled enables Clefable to keep healthy throughout a game while checking the likes of Mega Lopunny and sitting on the likes of Ferrothorn. Wish only adds to this, making both Clefable and its teammates less susceptible to being worn down. Thunder Wave is an immediately punishing move across the board, irritating everything from defensive staples like Ferrothorn and Toxapex to offensive threats like Mega Mawile and Volcarona. Flamethrower specializes in directly threatening Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Heal Bell is an extra option for Clefable to support its team, reducing the reliance on Clefable as a status absorber and allowing teammates to more freely move against status spreaders. Seismic Toss is another way to complement Moonblast, taking consistent chunks out of a wide range of targets. On Life Orb variants, Ice Beam is a common fixture to massively threaten Gliscor, OHKOing fast variants and catching specially defensive variants after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is preferred to give Clefable a more comfortable time absorbing weak attacks like Toxapex's Scald without being pressured to heal, additionally helping it take on attackers like Mega Lopunny that don't stray too far from a 2HKO on Clefable. Rocky Helmet is a more direct option for punishing attackers, giving them less opportunities to break through with critical hits and secondary effects, as well as irritating U-turn users like Landorus-T. Life Orb comfortably boosts the power of Clefable's attacks, giving Clefable the extra power it needs to KO Gliscor with Ice Beam and put more pressure on neutral targets switching in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable excels at switching right into defensive walls and getting itself many free turns; Scald users like Toxapex and Slowbro can barely splash it, and Toxic from Chansey and Gliscor can't even upset its stomach. Clefable does have the bulk to directly come into Gyro Ball Ferrothorn to block its Leech Seed, as it can heal off the damage, and its feasible to stall out the low PP, though trying this with Celesteela is a doomed endeavor. Clefable really does only specialize against more passive Pokemon, having no business switching into the likes of Mega Charizard X or Tapu Lele, though it can handle certain threats like Mega Lopunny, Kommo-o, and Mega Gyarados with the help of its typing and just good enough bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Clefable finds its home on balance teams, taking one for the team in terms of utility to free up different options for teammates. Spikers like Ferrothorn and Skarmory are great partners for Clefable, as Clefable's immunity to opposing entry hazards and access to Stealth Rock itself makes it a great option for hazard-stacking teams. Pairing Clefable with strong answers to Heatran like Gliscor and Gastrodon is advised due to Clefable's inviting nature. Toxapex checks nasty Fire-type threats like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, with Shed Shell variants even helping against Heatran, and can even set Toxic Spikes on top of that, easing the matchup against offensive teams. Heatran fits nicely on Clefable's preferred teamstyle and provides a very solid answer to Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Celesteela. Clefable can cover the weaknesses of and absorb status for Mega Latias excellently; in return, it can act as a wincon with Calm Mind and also check Swords Dance Gliscor, a huge threat to Clefable. Slowbro is great support against big physical threats like Mega Charizard X, Victini, Mega Swampert, and the aforementioned Swords Dance Gliscor. Magearna appreciates Clefable taking over as a more consistent Dark-type check and holding utility moves like Heal Bell and Thunder Wave for it, enabling it to make full use of Calm Mind. Additionally, it helps against wallbreakers like Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele that can break past Clefable.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind raises Clefable's Special Attack and Special Defense, letting it comfortably take on special attackers like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias. Moonblast blows through Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny. Thunderbolt threatens Water-types, such as Gyarados, Slowbro, and Pelipper, and is a viable option if run alongside Ice Beam, providing a great combination of coverage. Thunder lets Clefable more immediately pressure the likes of Celesteela, Toxapex, and Heatran, while the chance of paralysis helps Clefable win over time, especially against Taunt Heatran. Flamethrower punishes Steel-types that attempt to take Clefable's Moonblast such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Thunder Wave is a more consistent option to paralyze checks such as Heatran and immediately punish the likes of Mega Mawile and Volcarona if they attempt to switch into Clefable's Moonblast. Knock Off removes Leftovers from targets such as Heatran, Reuniclus, Slowbro, and opposing Clefable. Ice Beam easily defeats Swords Dance Gliscor and is beneficial for OHKOing Landorus-T and Garchomp in a pinch. Finally, Soft-Boiled lets Clefable stay healthy throughout the game to continue checking Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Clefable maximize its physical bulk, allowing it to check physical attackers such as Hawlucha and Mega Lopunny. Leftovers is preferred to provide Clefable with extra longevity in conjunction with Soft-Boiled. Life Orb is an option to boost Clefable's special attacks and place more pressure on its targets without being hindered by recoil damage thanks to Magic Guard. Alternatively, Clefable can run an EV spread of 248 HP / 248 Def / 12 Spe if it is paired with Thunder Wave users such as Ferrothorn to outspeed paralyzed Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele. Clefable can also run an EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 SpD with a Calm nature to avoid a 2HKO from Mega Alakazam's Psychic at full HP should Clefable lose its Leftovers. Clefable can also run a Modest nature when utilizing both Thunderbolt and Ice Beam to improve its matchup against Toxapex and Celesteela while still threatening the aforementioned Ground-types. However, not running a Bold nature worsens Clefable's ability to check Mega Medicham.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable functions best as a status absorber and late-game win condition, capable of finishing off weakened teams with attacks boosted by Calm Mind and outlasting them thanks to Magic Guard and entry hazard support provided by its teammates. With Magic Guard, Clefable can come in and set up against status users such as Slowbro and take Toxic and Scald burns, which threaten to wear down its teammates. Thanks to its typing and good bulk, it can defensively check the likes of Mega Lopunny and defensive Landorus-T. It is recommended to keep Clefable healthy to check Pokemon like Hawlucha, Dragon Dance Kommo-o, and Mega Gyarados. If Clefable runs Knock Off, it can use the opportunity to bluff another set before it reveals Calm Mind. With entry hazards up, this also makes it more difficult for checks such as Heatran to come in safely. However, not having Flamethrower means that Clefable needs to be more careful around Steel-types such as Magearna and Mega Scizor. If Clefable uses a Life Orb or loses its Leftovers, it needs to be more intentional with its Soft-Boiled usage, as the lack of Leftovers can force it to burn through its Soft-Boiled PP more quickly to stay healthy. Clefable must avoid trying to set up against Calm Mind Reuniclus and Cresselia since they can threaten Clefable with a boosted Psyshock. Clefable should also generally be wary of its PP usage against opposing balance and stall teams; even though Magic Guard lets it match up well against these teams, they can still win over the course of a longer game by switching around and forcing it to drain PP, eventually leaving it unable to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Clefable set shines best on balance teams, which value its defensive niche, its capability as a win condition with Calm Mind, and its ability to handle passive Pokemon thanks to Magic Guard. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Protean Greninja are fantastic partners for Clefable since they can set up Spikes to wear down checks such as Heatran and Kartana. Ferrothorn is especially notable because it also wears down Heatran with Leech Seed and can provide Knock Off support, while Greninja has the benefit of sniping Toxapex and Magearna with Tectonic Rage. Bulky Ground-types such as Excadrill, defensive Landorus-T, and Gliscor are also solid partners because they can lay Stealth Rock and threaten Heatran, something that Clefable greatly appreciates. Landorus-T can also bring Clefable in safely with U-turn, while Gliscor can take down Heatran and Toxapex and set up with Swords Dance. Gastrodon is also a great partner because its immunity to Water-type moves works well with Clefable's Dark resistance, enabling them to handle Ash-Greninja as a team effort. Toxapex provides a solid answer to the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Mega Scizor and lays down Toxic Spikes to pressure Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele. Shed Shell variants can also scout for potential trappers like Heatran and Tapu Fini and remove their Leftovers with Knock Off. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support and reliably checks Steel-types like Celesteela and Magearna lacking Focus Blast. Bulky Psychic-types like Mega Latias and Slowbro are good partners since Clefable can safely pivot into Dark-type moves aimed at these teammates. In return, they can handle Pokemon that Clefable struggles to deal with such as Toxapex and Swords Dance Gliscor, especially if Clefable lacks Electric-type coverage for the former and Ice Beam for the latter. Mega Latias also handles the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Manaphy if it packs Thunder, and Swords Dance Landorus-T, while Slowbro provides a solid answer to physical Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Victini.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is a solid catch-all neutral attack that will put a sizable dent in most Pokemon. Thunderbolt allows Clefable to dent Toxapex and Celesteela while ensuring it doesn't thud against Heatran. Thunder can be used instead for the extra power and the paralysis chance to force more progress, but the lower accuracy causes plenty of wasted turns that often can't be afforded. Fire Blast hits the aforementioned Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile. Flamethrower can instead be used if accuracy is a concern, but the extra power allows it to turn some damage rolls into solid 2HKOs and OHKOs. Soft-Boiled keeps Clefable healthy in longer games, allowing it to do more throughout the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature allows Clefable to both threaten KOs on offensive Pokemon with super effective moves and put pressure on common defensive mons such as Gastrodon, Toxapex, Mega Latias, Magearna, and opposing Clefable. 180 Speed EVs allow Clefable to get the jump on Adamant Mega Mawile and Azumarill as well as uninvested Mega Scizor. If these Pokemon are accounted for by Clefable's teammates, Clefable can drop some Speed in favor of bulk. Magic Guard allows Clefable to switch in more often and circumvents the Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its reduced bulk investment, Clefable is unable to switch into the likes of Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T, among others, so Life Orb Clefable's defensive duties are often relegated to sitting on defensive walls such as Gastrodon, Mega Latias, Clefable, Toxapex, and Mega Sableye, etc. Notably, it still performs its role as a Toxic and burn absorber very well. Against offensive teams, Clefable has limited opportunities to hit the field safely, so you can get the most use out of it by aggressively trading damage with the likes of Landorus-T and Tapu Koko. This way, Clefable can limit opposing setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X by doing too much damage for them to set up freely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Clefable's aforementioned frailty, it best serves as an offensive threat on balance teams. Checks to specially defensive Heatran, notably Gliscor and Gastrodon, greatly help. In addition to checking Heatran, Gliscor can sit on non-Swords Dance Landorus-T, while Gastrodon can check Ash-Greninja. Spikes are quite important for Life Orb Clefable teams to sharpen Clefable's wallbreaking power and counteract lower-longevity offensive teams. In terms of Spikes setters, Skarmory can deal with Excadrill and Kartana and cover for Clefable's reduced bulk investment by handling Mega Lopunny and certain Hawlucha sets, Ferrothorn can handle Mega Swampert's and Ash-Greninja's Water-type attacks, and Protean Greninja can help take on shared checks like Assault Vest Magearna and Heatran. Heatran can help pivot around dangerous opposing Fire-types like Victini and Mega Charizard Y and threaten to trap walls like Chansey with Magma Storm + Taunt. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can revenge kill fast threats like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko and bring opportunities to Clefable through U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Unaware": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Calm Mind and Unaware allows Clefable to deal with a wide array of Calm Mind users like Reuniclus, Mega Latias, Cresselia, and opposing Magic Guard Clefable as well as other bulky stat boosters like Swords Dance Gliscor and Manaphy. Moonblast blows through Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny. Wish provides reliable recovery, letting Clefable heal both itself and its teammates. Protect ensures that Clefable can safely gain back lost health with Wish, provides extra recovery from Leftovers, and scouts Choice-locked Pokemon like Kartana and Tapu Lele as well as any potential Z-Moves and coverage moves from Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Greninja.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Clefable's physical bulk, letting it handle multiple physical attackers such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny. Unaware lets Clefable reliably answer setup sweepers such as Hawlucha, Dragonite, and Kommo-o. Alternatively, Clefable can run an EV spread of 248 HP / 248 Def / 12 Spe if it is paired with Thunder Wave Chansey to outrun a paralyzed Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable functions best as a defensive stopgap to check many monstrous physical sweepers like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Hawlucha, and Kommo-o. Try to scout for any potential Z-Moves that can threaten major damage to Clefable, such as Subzero Slammer from Kyurem-B and Supersonic Skystrike from Dragonite and Landorus-T. If a teammate is too chipped to find safe entry, Clefable can pass Wish to it so that it can switch in safely and gain back lost health. The recovery from Wish will also allow a teammate to come in more healthily against the likes of Mega Mawile and Heatran that can force Clefable out. Since this Clefable set doesn't run Magic Guard, it needs to be more careful with status users and entry hazards because it's vulnerable to getting worn down by passive damage. Clefable must also be wary of Knock Off, as losing its Leftovers will hinder its longevity, forcing it to burn through its Wish PP faster to stay healthy, which can be exploited by the opponent over the course of a longer game. Clefable should also be careful with its general PP usage against Calm Mind users; while Clefable hard-counters Reuniclus and Magic Guard Clefable, they can still win in the long run by drawing out preemptive moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Clefable set should only be used on stall teams that require a dedicated Unaware Pokemon that can deal with many of the aforementioned physical sweepers. Chansey is an incredible partner for Clefable, as it can take on a wide array of special attackers such as Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. Chansey can also clear status conditions like poison and burn from Clefable with Aromatherapy. In return, Clefable provides a solid answer to Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny and bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Swords Dance Gliscor that prey on Chansey. Because Unaware Clefable is vulnerable to passive damage, entry hazard removal is also crucial, so pairing it with a Defogger such as Skarmory and Gliscor is a good idea. Skarmory also provides Spikes support, limiting threats such as Mega Mawile and Tapu Lele, while Gliscor provides a solid answer to Heatran. Mega Sableye blocks hazards with Magic Bounce and shuts down Mega Medicham. Toxapex can lay down Toxic Spikes to place Pokemon such as Tapu Koko on a ticking timer, absorb Toxic Spikes, and provide a solid check to Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard Y. Shed Shell variants can also scout potential trappers like Heatran and Tapu Fini and remove their Leftovers with Knock Off.</p>"

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>As the only Pokemon with access to both Aurora Veil and Snow Warning, Alolan Ninetales carves itself a niche in OU as the only viable user of the former. Between its good Speed stat and its access to both Hypnosis and Encore, Alolan Ninetales is able to set up Aurora Veil against a large portion of the tier without fearing setup sweepers taking advantage of it as it does so, and it forces out a number of Pokemon in the important base 90 to 108 Speed bracket such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Keldeo. Furthermore, its access to Freeze-Dry allows it to shut down large portions of rain teams when combined with Snow Warning, and Alolan Ninetales's good Special Defense stat allows it to take a decently strong neutral special hit in order to set up Aurora Veil if it absolutely needs to. That said, it is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it very vulnerable to entry hazards, and while Fairy is nice for shutting down Pokemon like Garchomp and Latios locked into their respective Dragon-type STAB moves, its secondary Ice typing does very little in the way of providing defensive synergy with teammates while compounding its weakness to the omnipresent Steel type. Furthermore, Alolan Ninetales's decent Special Defense is contrasted by its abysmal physical bulk, which leaves it very vulnerable to physical attackers before setting up Aurora Veil, and its low Special Attack leaves it unable to pose as a threat to Mega Charizard Y that block its setup attempts by overwriting hail with Drought. It is also an easy target for Volcarona to set up on if something is already put to sleep by Hypnosis.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-type such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn much harder. Hidden Power Ground can be used to 2HKO maximum HP Heatran after Stealth Rock as well as Assault Vest Magnezone after one layer of Spikes. Disable is an option to shut down certain attacks and is useful versus Choice item users by forcing them to either switch or use Struggle, but this leaves Alolan Ninetales vulnerable to setup sweepers. Toxic is an option to alleviate Alolan Ninetales's passiveness and is useful for wearing down bulky Pokemon for teammates, whereas Nasty Plot achieves the same goal by boosting Alolan Ninetales's Special Attack stat sharply, which is useful for reducing its reliance on teammates to break through the opposing team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Charizard Y blocks attempts to set up Aurora Veil by overwriting hail with Drought, takes very little damage from any of Alolan Ninetales's attacks barring the inaccurate Blizzard, which fails to 2HKO it, and returns the favor by dealing heavy damage to Ninetales or one of its teammates with a sun-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor takes very little damage from anything other than the rare Hidden Power Fire and gets close to OHKOing Alolan Ninetales through Aurora Veil with Bullet Punch. Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Jirachi take very little damage from Freeze Dry and can hit it back with their respective Steel-type moves. Any of these can also use Alolan Ninetales as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Alolan Ninetales is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock, making it easy to wear down between Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, its vulnerability to Sticky Web means that it will lose its potent Speed tier when pitted against teams that carry it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Alolan Marowak and Heatran take very little from Alolan Ninetales's STAB moves, and they both threaten it heavily with STAB moves of their own. Volcarona is slower than Alolan Ninetales, takes very little from any of its attacks, and outpaces it after one boost, meaning that it is not threatened by Encore and concequently uses non-Hypnosis Alolan Ninetales for setup fodder. Mega Charizard X is in the same boat, although it needs to be wary of a potential Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Sand Stream Users</strong>: Hippowdon and Tyranitar are capable of acting as a roadblock to Alolan Ninetales's attempts to use Aurora Veil, although Hippowdon needs to watch out for Freeze Dry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Aurora Veil": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aurora Veil lets Alolan Ninetales support its teammates by temporarily halving the damage taken from the opposing team's attacks, which opens up more opportunities to dish out hits and set up. Freeze-Dry allows Alolan Ninetales to have an excellent matchup versus rain—a playstyle that commonly gives offensive teams a headache—by hitting Pelipper, Mega Swampert, and Kingdra 4x super effectively, and it also means Gyarados can't use Alolan Ninetales as setup fodder. Hypnosis shuts down Pokemon that attempt to set up in front of Alolan Ninetales like Volcarona and Mega Tyranitar while also creating free turns for teammates. Hail is used to help improve the matchup versus Mega Charizard Y that attempt to block Aurora Veil with Drought by undoing the weather change to sun on the turn it switches in, as well as Tyranitar. Encore is an option that shuts down slower, non-Speed-boosting setup sweepers without requiring the preservation of Sleep Clause while pressuring defensive Pokemon like Toxapex more consistently than Hypnosis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is important to best take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's good Speed stat, allowing it to use Aurora Veil with as much consistency as possible and outpacing the base 95 to 108 Speed bracket; its HP is also maximized to allow it to set up Aurora Veil as much as possible throughout the match. Snow Warning allows Alolan Ninetales to set up hail on the turn that it is sent out, which is necessary to ensure maximum consistency when setting up Aurora Veil. Light Clay maximizes the duration of said move, which is important to maximize the amount of utility that Alolan Ninetales brings to the table.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Alolan Ninetales into attacks directly if possible and instead aim to bring it in on a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, after a teammate is KOed, or on a well-predicted double switch; similarly, aim to bring Alolan Ninetales in against Pokemon that it forces out to ensure that Aurora Veil can be set up safely. If you see Volcarona or Mega Charizard X on the opposing team, don't put a different foe to sleep in order to prevent them using Alolan Ninetales for setup fodder. If Ninetales carries Encore, use it against Pokemon that are slower than Ninetales after they set up, and don't be afraid to shut down certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Ice Beam Mew if the situation requires you to do so. Avoid taking Knock Off if possible to maximize the duration of Aurora Veil on consecutive uses, but don't be afraid to take one hit with Alolan Ninetales if it is necessary. If Alolan Ninetales is about to faint and Aurora Veil isn't active, use the opportunity to set it up and let Alolan Ninetales faint to grab momentum late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup attackers like Magearna, Mega Tyranitar, Volcarona, Gyarados, Suicune, and Bisharp all massively appreciate Aurora Veil due to its ability to make setting up easier; Bisharp is also nice for discouraging attempts to clear Aurora Veil with Defog, whereas Volcarona takes advantage of Aurora Veil to circumvent Rock-type moves from Choice Scarf users, which are used to revenge kill it after a boost, such as Keldeo's Stone Edge. Breakers such as Mega Mawile appreciate Aurora Veil's ability to give them more breathing room when spamming their absurdly strong attacks, allowing them to deal significantly more damage to the opposing team. Bulky attackers such as Shift Gear Magearna are helpful for reducing the team's reliance on Aurora Veil while becoming extremely hard to break when the effect is on the field. Other strong set up Pokemon such as Waterium Z Tail Glow Manaphy and Landorus-T are effective because they are able to set up on a plethora of attacks as well as being much more difficult to revenge kill.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Alakazam is one of the premier special attackers within the tier, boasting an absurd Speed tier that allows it to outspeed virtually the entire unboosted metagame, a completely unrivalled Special Attack stat, and all the coverage options it would want to make use of it with. Examples include Focus Blast to cut through the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran, Shadow Ball for Psychic-types like Jirachi and Mega Latias, and Energy Ball for Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. It has superb abilities both before and after Mega Evolving; Magic Guard allows it to shrug off any entry hazard or status damage, and Trace has a world of unique applications, such as copying Flash Fire from Heatran to switch into Magma Storm, Toxapex's Regenerator to stay healthy, and Mega Swampert's Swift Swim and Excadrill's Sand Rush to revenge kill them, to name a few. However, Mega Alakazam's pitiful bulk leaves it terrified of any physical attacker and limits the amount of Pokemon it can switch into safely. Additionally, it can be revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana, and specially defensive behemoths like Chansey and Jirachi are solid answers to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore allows Mega Alakazam to beat Calm Mind sweepers like Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Cresselia, as well as making the likes of Chansey and Gastrodon completely free to switch into via locking them into recovery moves. Substitute eases prediction and can foil revenge killing attempts by the likes of Choice Scarf Kartana and Fake Out Mega Lopunny if it manages to keep it up after getting a KO. Hidden Power Ice gives Mega Alakazam a clean OHKO against Landorus-T, utility Gliscor, and Garchomp, as well as OHKOing specially defensive Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Dazzling Gleam threatens Mega Sableye with a 2HKO and it's a high-accuracy option against Weavile, OHKOing it after one layer of Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types like Magearna, Jirachi, and Celesteela can handle Mega Alakazam's Psychic and are aren't weak to Focus Blast, allowing them to defensively check it. Mega Scizor avoids the 2HKO from Focus Blast and can hit back with Bullet Punch or Pursuit trap Mega Alakazam.</p> <p><strong>Other Defensive Answers</strong>: Chansey takes very little from Mega Alakazam's attacks and can either chip it down with Seismic Toss or force it out with status, though it can be irritated by Taunt variants and can't threaten Alakazam with Toxic before it Mega Evolves. Mega Sableye makes use of its immunities to handle Mega Alakazam very well, and there's little Alakazam can do to it. Cresselia is so immensely bulky that it can actually switch into and set up on even Shadow Ball Mega Alakazam, barring bad luck with Special Defense drops. Alolan Muk is a niche dedicated answer to Mega Alakazam that takes very little from its attacks and can Pursuit trap it without much hassle. Other specially defensive sponges like Gastrodon, Calm Clefable, specially defensive Gliscor, and Tapu Bulu avoid the 2HKO from Psychic and can beat Mega Alakazam one-on-one when at high HP.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks like Fake Out from Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny, Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, and Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt can chip Mega Alakazam down and threaten it out at low health, with Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch OHKOing outright. Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can even run Quick Attack and Bullet Punch, respectively, alongside Fake Out to be even better against Mega Alakazam. However, Mega Alakazam is often paired with Psychic Terrain to give it a temporary immunity to all of these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Victini can chase out Mega Alakazam with ease should they get in safely, threatening to OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Mega Alakazam's most reliable Psychic-type STAB move, useful for targets like Mega Lopunny and Toxapex as well as slamming neutral targets like Tapu Fini switching in. Focus Blast is the ultimate complement to Psychic, giving Mega Alakazam a way to threaten various Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill, as well as Dark-types like Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, OHKOing the former and standard variants of the latter, and preventing a safe Pursuit trap. Shadow Ball gives Mega Alakazam a way to hit Psychic-types like Mega Latias, Jirachi, and Cresselia, which would otherwise completely wall it. Recover gives Mega Alakazam longevity to prevent it from succumbing to chip damage from non-lethal attacks like Chansey's Seismic Toss and Heatran's Earth Power or entry hazards. Calm Mind gives Mega Alakazam a useful power boost for cleaning late-game, lets it break through shaky checks like Mega Latias and Cresselia, and makes it fare better against special attacking Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Clefable. Energy Ball gives Mega Alakazam a consistent OHKO against Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, with the first being even more useful due to Mega Alakazam having Trace to copy Swift Swim. Taunt allows Mega Alakazam to shut down recovery attempts from the likes of Chansey, Gastrodon, and Jirachi, entry hazards from the likes of Heatran and Chansey, and Leech Seed from Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Knock Off has very little offensive threat attached to it, but it's incredibly irritating to switch-ins like Chansey, Assault Vest Magearna, and Celesteela, hindering either their bulk or their longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mega Alakazam likes to run maximum Speed in order to Speed tie with itself, with the benefit of outspeeding +1 Gyarados included. Another option is a spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe that outspeeds Mega Lopunny and maximizes bulk, notably surviving U-turn from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and being favored to survive Earthquake, too.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Owing to its immense power, Mega Alakazam has usage both early- and mid-game as a wallbreaker and late-game as a cleaner. It's quite risky to switch Mega Alakazam directly into most Pokemon, but it finds entry against passive walls like Toxapex, which it proceeds to steal Regenerator from, and defensive Kommo-o, as well as specially defensive Heatran, which has its main attacking type made useless by Mega Alakazam copying Flash Fire. For the most part, Mega Alakazam relies on offensive pressure to create opportunities for it to use its utility options. In matchups where Mega Alakazam poses absolutely no threat, such as against a stall team with multiple counters like Mega Sableye and Chansey, it's always better to not Mega Evolve, allowing it to absorb status like Toxapex's Toxic. In terms of offensive abilities that Mega Alakazam can steal with Trace, some notable examples are Beast Boost from Ultra Beasts like Kartana and Celesteela and Soul Heart from Magearna, giving it boosts to its Speed and Special Attack, respectively, Protean from Greninja to give it STAB on all of its coverage moves, Swift Swim and Sand Rush from Mega Swampert and Excadrill, respectively, allowing it to revenge kill them, and Magnet Pull from Magnezone, letting Mega Alakazam countertrap it. On the other hand, Mega Alakazam can bolster its longevity with Regenerator from Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Slowbro, Natural Cure from Chansey, Poison Heal from Gliscor, and Magic Guard from Clefable and Reuniclus. Additionally, it can steal immunity-based abilities like Storm Drain from Gastrodon, which boosts Mega Alakazam into being able to 2HKO Gastrodon if it switches into Scald, Flash Fire from Heatran, and Volt Absorb from Thundurus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Alakazam is mostly seen on specific Psychic-type spam teams thanks to its amazing synergy with Tapu Lele, though it could also be used on certain balance teams due to its proficiency at revenge killing and cleaning. Tapu Lele is the most perfect partner for Mega Alakazam, as it can act as a wallbreaker early-game to put Celesteela and Assault Vest Magearna out of commission as well as the benefits of Psychic Terrain blocking priority and boosting Psychic-type attacks. Other wallbreaking options that help clear a path for Mega Alakazam include Kyurem-B and Swords Dance Kartana. Due to its frailty, Mega Alakazam requires pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T, Magearna, and Rotom-W to get in safely. Ash-Greninja also helps to overwhelm Assault Vest Magearna, and it can set Spikes to hinder the likes of Chansey, Jirachi, and the aforementioned Magearna; Skarmory and Ferrothorn are examples of defensive Spikes setters that can achieve the same effect on balance teams. Choice Scarf Kartana is a great late-game cleaning option that naturally benefits from Steel-types needing to bleed HP to deal with Mega Alakazam. Volcarona takes advantage of the Steel-types that Mega Alakazam hates and Mega Alakazam can do the same with Toxapex and specially defensive Heatran in return. On balance teams, Magnezone is an excellent enabler, as it removes the likes of Celesteela and Mega Scizor and can revenge kill and forcibly remove Mega Mawile and Choice Scarf Kartana. Heatran pressures many of Mega Alakazam's checks, like Magearna, Jirachi, Celesteela, and Cresselia, to name a few, and sets up Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes from Toxapex pressure Gastrodon and Tapu Bulu and help put offensive Pokemon into range for Mega Alakazam to clean up.</p>"

  "Golem-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>At face value, Alolan Golem seems to be completely outclassed by Magnezone in terms of trapping Steel-types, but it finds its niche because it has several distinct advantages over Magnezone. Alolan Golem's access to Earthquake gives it the ability to trap Steel-types Magnezone can't, such as Magearna, Excadrill, other Magnezone, and most notably Heatran. Alolan Golem can also trap nearly everything Magnezone can as well, with the unfortunate exception of Kartana. With Alolan Golem being a physical attacker and having a unique Rock / Electric typing, it can check Pokemon Magnezone can't such as Zapdos. Unfortunately, Alolan Golem is still heavily overshadowed by Magnezone; Magnezone's ability to trap Kartana and check Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Mega Pinsir are generally more useful than Alolan Golem's unique qualities. Alolan Golem is also largely useless after trapping Steel-types unlike Magnezone because it does not bring any other utility to the table. In fact, Alolan Golem can prove to be a liability after it has done its job, as many teams can easily take advantage of it with Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Garchomp due to its poor defensive typing. Alolan Golem's Speed tier is rock bottom; it fails to outspeed anything faster than Jolly Landorus-T. Finally, while Alolan Golem's physical bulk is solid, it crumbles to most powerful special attacks due to its low Special Defense. This prevents it from switching into most of the Steel-types it needs to trap and nearly mandates Eject Button or VoltTurn support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volt Switch seems appealing to gain momentum, but it tends to fall flat in practice due to the fact that most teams have Ground-types and Alolan Golem isn't particularly threatening to many Pokemon. Toxic can be used to cripple Ground-types that try to switch into Alolan Golem.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Due to Alolan Golem's shallow movepool and typing, practically every Ground-type causes it problems in some way. Gastrodon, defensive Landorus-T, Quagsire, Mega Swampert, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mega Garchomp all hard counter Alolan Golem due to their typings and bulk and can all easily OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB attacks. Offensive Landorus-T, Nidoking, Mega Camerupt, and Mamoswine all can take a hit and OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Alolan Golem's poor Speed, Pokemon like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham easily outrun Alolan Golem and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth all can easily switch into Alolan Golem and retaliate with Giga Drain. Kartana easily outspeeds Alolan Golem and OHKOes it with Leaf Blade. Tapu Bulu can also take a hit with ease and OHKO Alolan Golem with Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Clefable, Chansey, Mew, and Mega Sableye wall Alolan Golem with ease and simply stall it out.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wild Charge gives Alolan Golem a powerful STAB move and allows it to trap Celesteela and Skarmory. Earthquake is used to trap Heatran, weakened Assault Vest Magearna, Magnezone, Jirachi, and Excadrill. Fire Punch allows Alolan Golem to trap Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. The last moveslot is mostly filler. Explosion can be used to deal a high amount of damage and gain momentum; losing Alolan Golem isn't a big deal due to its lack of utility after trapping Steel-types. Stealth Rock can be used for role compression and to give Alolan Golem utility after trapping Steel-types. Stone Edge can also be used to allow Alolan Golem to check Zapdos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Alolan Golem's power and gives it enough Speed to outrun Jolly Landorus-T thanks to Alolan Golem's Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf is used to allow Alolan Golem to outspeed Heatran, defensive Jirachi, and non-Choice Scarf Excadrill. Magnet Pull is mandatory to trap Steel-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless it is absolutely needed, do not directly switch Alolan Golem into the Steel-types it needs to trap, as it can not switch into most of them. Try to come in after a sacrifice or from a teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch. The best case scenario is to try to use Eject Button users like Toxapex and Alomomola to bring Alolan Golem in safely. Do not try to trap Magearna until it is sufficiently weakened; the same goes for Excadrill and Ferrothorn. After trapping Steel-types, feel free to sacrifice Alolan Golem, as letting in Ground-types such as Landorus-T can make Alolan Golem a liability to its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order for Alolan Golem to not be outclassed by Magnezone, pair Alolan Golem with Pokemon that appreciate having Magnezone, Jirachi, Heatran, and Magearna removed. Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Kartana, Serperior, and Volcarona are excellent partners for this reason. Defensive Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn appreciate Alolan Golem trapping Magnezone and Heatran. Alolan Golem appreciates VoltTurn support to get in safely against the Steel-types it needs to trap. Tornadus-T, Assault Vest Magearna, and Landorus-T make great choices for this role. Eject Button users like Toxapex and Alomomola can also help to bring Alolan Golem in safely. Due to Alolan Golem's inability to trap Kartana, an answer to Kartana such as Amoonguss, Tornadus-T, or Zapdos is appreciated. Finally, since Alolan Golem invites in practically every Ground-type in the tier for free, make sure to have solid counterplay to them. Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T are all good examples.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Through its unique typing, solid physical bulk, and perfectly-fitting ability in Regenerator, Slowbro brings incredible defensive value to its team, checking premier physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Medicham, Mega Swampert, Mega Lopunny, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hawlucha. Slowbro also has a respectable Special Attack stat and can spread status via Scald, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, preventing it from being overly passive. It has a great variety of moves it can slot on and even a variety of items, often running Leftovers, various Z-Crystals, and Slowbronite. Despite this, Slowbro is threatened by many prominent special attackers, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, Serperior, and Mega Charizard Y, and even physical attackers like Kartana and Tapu Bulu if they can get in safely. Additionally, Slowbro hates status conditions and especially Toxic Spikes, so a lot of players decide that the poison-immune, Toxic Spikes-clearing Toxapex is much less hassle to fit onto a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro can use Zap Cannon in combination with Electrium Z to OHKO Greninja as it switches in as well as hit other Electric-weak Pokemon like Manaphy and Tapu Fini hard; however, outside of these interactions, it is a largely inconsistent move, and Slowbro already has so many moves that it wants to run.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos and Pokemon like Magearna and Life Orb Clefable can threaten Slowbro out with their super effective Electric-type attacks, targeting its weaker Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn can easily beat Slowbro one-on-one; however, they must be wary of being statused as they switch in, as well as of Flamethrower in the case of Ferrothorn and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Slowbro needs to steer clear of poison and, to a lesser extent, burn, as they cut down on its staying power dramatically and can prevent it from checking Pokemon it's tasked with. Slowbro is particularly susceptible to Toxic Spikes, which can entirely prevent it from switching in safely.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Slowbro can be easily threatened out by Dark-types like Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar if they can switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele can easily threaten Slowbro out due to its middling Special Defense stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowbro's most common STAB move, fishing for burn against anything it doesn't outright threaten and preventing physical attackers like Kartana and Tapu Bulu from switching in comfortably. Slack Off, in conjunction with Regenerator, ensures that Slowbro can stay healthy enough to check the physical attackers it's tasked with. Ice Beam threatens out Swords Dance Gliscor and hits Serperior and Hawlucha super effectively, and it can be powered up with Icium Z to OHKO Hawlucha and Swords Dance Gliscor. Future Sight is great support for offensive teammates, threatening Pokemon like Toxapex and preventing double switches into the likes of Mega Medicham. It's also the most powerful Psychic-type attack to use with Psychium Z, with Shattered Psyche threatening weakened Toxapex and hitting hard neutrally. Thunder Wave is the most instantly punishing status option, stopping threats like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Serperior from wanting to switch in. Toxic is similarly good at punishing switches and is especially great at stopping setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Latias, Volcarona, and Cresselia from getting out of control. Protect lets status damage rack up on foes, scout Choice-locked attackers, and lets Slowbro gain additional Leftovers recovery. Flamethrower hits Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor hard, additionally scorching any Kartana brave enough to switch directly in. Counter is a niche option, biting back instantly with an OHKO when Slowbro is hit by strong physical attacks like Thunder Punch from Mega Medicham, +1 Dragon Claw from Mega Charizard X, and most importantly boosted Earthquake from Swords Dance Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowbro generally prefers to run maximum HP and Defense to deal with prominent physical attackers, but the Psychium Z variant can use a spread of 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 SpA to OHKO physically defensive Toxapex with Shattered Psyche.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowbro can be thrown into physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham liberally early-game, as Regenerator makes it easy for it to keep healthy. It's important to note that while Regenerator does a great job, Slowbro does need to be careful about preserving its HP when tasked with handling multiple physical attackers; Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Hawlucha, and Excadrill can break through if Slowbro takes enough prior damage. Although Slowbro is a great switch-in to Mega Medicham, it does need to be careful of the Thunder Punch variant, which can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, especially in Electric Terrain. Make sure Slowbro regularly throws off status-inflicting moves, like Scald, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, to prevent common threats like Greninja and Kartana from switching in unpunished. Future Sight is a great option to not only threaten Psychic-weak Pokemon like Toxapex and Hawlucha but also ease the task of getting teammates in safely if they need to heal in a pinch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro is best suited for balance teams that otherwise struggle to handle physical threats, as it serves as a blanket check to many such threats. It has a superb partnership with Chansey, as it can check Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Mega Charizard X that threaten Chansey, while Chansey invalidates special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y for Slowbro. Gliscor appreciates Slowbro checking Mega Swampert, Hawlucha, and Mega Medicham, and in return, it feasts on Pokemon like Toxapex and Chansey that threaten Slowbro with status, either setting up on them with Swords Dance or clearing their entry hazards with Defog. Toxic Spikes are the bane of Slowbro's existence, so counterplay to them, such as Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Gliscor or Poison-types like Toxapex and Amoonguss, is required. Tornadus-T is an especially good partner, as it can check Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu while forming a Regenerator core with Slowbro. Magnezone can remove the aforementioned Kartana as well as Ferrothorn, which can pester Slowbro variants lacking Flamethrower with Spikes and Leech Seed.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off becomes even more crucial for Mega Slowbro, allowing it to continue to keep healthy after Mega Evolution, as it loses out on Regenerator. The extra base Special Attack after Mega Evolving allows Ice Beam to OHKO Landorus-T, Garchomp, and utility Gliscor, as well as Swords Dance Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Psychic takes a more direct approach against Fighting-types, OHKOing Hawlucha, as well as being Slowbro's best STAB move to hit neutrally. Calm Mind makes great use of Mega Slowbro's ability, Shell Armor, which takes away counterplay via critical hits, improving its consistency as a Calm Mind sweeper. Toxic is a more all encompassing punish that catches the likes of Calm Mind Mega Latias and Cresselia as well as other threats like Kyurem-B and Rotom-W. Future Sight enables offensively minded teammates by compounding damage with their attacks, helping them break through opposing walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Using maximum HP and Defense investment and a Bold nature makes the most out of Mega Slowbro's Defense increase; however, a spread of 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 SpA can be used to 2HKO Mega Charizard X with Psychic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's important not to understate how little Mega Slowbro wants to lose Regenerator, and there are many matchups where it's best to never Mega Evolve at all. The main benefit that Slowbro gets from Mega Evolving is a significantly higher Defense stat, which allows it to survive monstrous physical attacks like +1 Leaf Blade from Kartana and +2 Devastating Drake from Garchomp in a pinch. Mega Evolution also comes in handy when Slowbro has been chipped down, giving it extra consistency against the likes of Excadrill and Hawlucha. Additionally, Mega Evolving improves Slowbro's offensive prowess, letting it OHKO Pokemon that non-Mega Slowbro cannot, like the aforementioned Garchomp, and giving it an ability that better synergizes with Calm Mind. It's best to only Mega Evolve when necessary, keeping Regenerator for as long as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Slowbro is often fit onto balance teams that cannot fit another Mega Evolution, as it can often be hard to justify using Slowbro as your Mega Evolution when it's already so good. Good team support options for Mega Slowbro are incredibly similar or the same as those for its non-Mega variant. Cleric support from the likes of Chansey and Clefable comes in handy, especially after Mega Evolving, as Regenerator no longer soaks up passive damage.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Muk's high HP and Special Defense, along with its great defensive typing, allow it to act as a sturdy, specially defensive pivot that can check powerful special attackers such as Mega Alakazam, Greninja and Tapu Lele. A Poison / Dark typing gives Alolan Muk an immunity to Psychic-type attacks while also taking neutral damage from common Fighting- or Fairy-type coverage that Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele commonly carry. Additionally, Alolan Muk's Poison typing has the added benefit of absorbing Toxic Spikes. Another virtue of its typing is that Alolan Muk has access to a STAB Pursuit, which allows it to trap Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam. Alolan Muk's Poison Touch ability allows it to easily spread poison with its attacks, including Pursuit, which allows it to wear down opposing Pokemon. Unfortunately, Alolan Muk's passivity and poor Defense stat invite in strong physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Landorus-T. It is also notably slow, which, in combination with its lack of recovery, can make it difficult to keep healthy throughout a game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Sneak is a niche option that can be used to give Alolan Muk an extra chance to both attack and make contact when it would otherwise be KOed; however, this move is generally inferior to the standard Fire Punch or Rock Slide, as these moves better improve Alolan Muk's coverage and have more consistent uses. Poison Fang is notable for its 50% chance to badly poison, which combines with Poison Touch for a 65% chance to inflict either poison or bad poison. Poison Fang is a steep drop in power from Poison Jab, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and especially Gliscor have an easy time switching in and instantly threatening out Alolan Muk with Earthquake. However, Landorus-T and Garchomp can potentially be poisoned while switching in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Alolan Muk can be withered down quickly by attacks in conjunction with entry hazards and weather, as it has no recovery.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong physical wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Medicham threaten to OHKO Alolan Muk if they can safely switch in.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur have an incredibly easy time switching in and forcing out Alolan Muk because they cannot be poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Alolan Muk is fearful of being burned by Scald and Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, as the status halves its damage output and puts it on a timer.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Alolan Muk's most spammable attack is Knock Off, which removes items from common switch-ins like Toxapex and Magearna and dissuades Heatran and Celesteela from coming in. Pursuit allows Alolan Muk to trap powerful Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele, with Poison Touch adding a valuable chance to poison the trapped Pokemon. It can even be used against Pokemon that are not heavily damaged by Pursuit but hindered by poison, such as Mega Latias and Tapu Koko. Poison Jab is a strong STAB option to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu with its own 30% poison chance that combines with Poison Touch for a 51% chance to poison. Fire Punch allows Alolan Muk to hit Steel-types that it can't otherwise threaten such as Ferrothorn and Magearna. Rock Slide is a useful option to hit Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y hard and is preferred over Stone Edge for its better accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Defense EVs ensure that Alolan Muk avoids being 2HKOed by Choice Band Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury. 248 HP EVs, alongside 192 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature, allow Alolan Muk to survive two Choice Specs Blacephalon's Fire Blasts after Stealth Rock. Additionally, it allows Alolan Muk to avoid being OHKOed by a +2 Savage Spin-Out from offensive Volcarona. 4 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Chansey. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack. Assault Vest gives Alolan Muk the special bulk needed in order to reliably check powerful special attackers like Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Muk is best used to switch into Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mega Alakazam and Blacephalon to trap and possibly KO them with Pursuit. Alolan Muk can take a variety of strong neutral special hits well, but it should switch into these attacks sparingly, as it has no form of recovery. Alolan Muk is an adept punisher of Choice-locked Pokemon such as Greninja, as it is bulky enough to take a resisted hit and use Pursuit to potentially poison them as they switch out. It is important to keep multiple layers of entry hazards off of the field, as these can very quickly wear down Alolan Muk in conjunction with the attacks it takes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Muk generally fits on bulky offense and balance teams, as they greatly appreciate the removal of the likes of Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele. Pairing Alolan Muk with a Ground-type check, such as Landorus-T or Mega Latias, is a great idea, as Alolan Muk tends to invite Ground-types in. Z-Move Heatran appreciates Alolan Muk's ability to remove Mega Alakazam, which can trace Flash Fire, as well as its ability to potentially poison Mega Latias with Pursuit. Tapu Bulu is a beneficial partner for Alolan Muk because it brings Grassy Terrain to the field, which not only halves the power of Earthquake but also gives Alolan Muk some much-needed recovery. Alolan Muk is a grounded Pokemon with no recovery, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Tornadus-T is quite important to prevent Alolan Muk from being chipped down. Wish support from Pokemon like Clefable is also highly beneficial.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its high Special Attack and Speed stats, Gengar is an exceptional wallbreaker in the OU metagame. It can take advantage of the tier's general lack of Ghost-resistant Pokemon to fire off powerful STAB Shadow Balls while also pressuring the tier's myriad of Fairy-types thanks to its Poison typing. Gengar also has a decent amount of coverage and utility options at its disposal, including useful moves in Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Taunt. Unfortunately, Gengar is horribly frail and thus easily folds to faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and priority, which are all quite common in OU. It also has trouble taking strong neutral hits because of this, and at times it over relies on KOing its foes as a result. Gengar's fragility can also limit its opportunities to switch in, which can prevent it from consistently wallbreaking. Lastly, Gengar is quite weak to Pursuit from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar, which requires that it is played carefully in order to prevent it from being trapped and KOed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect Type is an option on the utility set for allowing Gengar to safely pivot out of Pursuit trappers. However, this is more often than not situational and won't be as consistently useful as Taunt or Focus Blast. Substitute is also an option for taking advantage of the switches Gengar forces and allowing it to more reliably fire off attacks, but it is also less useful than either Taunt or Focus Blast most of the time. A Choice Scarf set allows Gengar to function as a revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner, though the lack of power is quite noticeable and leaves it even more susceptible to bulky offensive threats that can stomach hits and smack it back with powerful moves. A Hex + Will-O-Wisp set heavily damages most foes after burning them, though it requires said foes to be burnt or at least statused in order for Gengar to do any notable damage with its Ghost-type STAB attacks and is usually not as useful as the main sets listed. Gengar has access to plenty of coverage moves that are potentially useful for surprising specific threats, such as Psychic, Dazzling Gleam, and Energy Ball. Unfortunately, it usually doesn't have room for these attacks due to the more valuable coverage or utility provided by moves like Taunt, Focus Blast, and Thunderbolt. Lastly, Gengar can make use of a plethora of different utility moves it has access to, such as Disable, Knock Off, Haze, and Icy Wind. However, all of these moves are generally too hard to find room for and are too situationally useful to justify being placed on sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Gengar's extreme frailty, faster Pokemon in Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja can heavily threaten it with powerful STAB attacks. Choice Scarf users like Excadrill and Tapu Lele are also quite troublesome due to their ability to outrun and KO Gengar by virtue of their held items.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Gengar's pitiful defenses make it fold to strong priority attacks like Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: The likes of Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Scizor can easily take advantage of either outspeeding Gengar or resisting the attacks it's locked into to trap and remove it from play with Pursuit. Alolan Muk, while not particularly common, is especially troublesome, as it can tank any of Gengar's attacks and guarantee its removal as a result.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon That Can Take a Hit</strong>: Offensive Pokemon that can stomach at least one of Gengar's attacks, like Mega Charizard X, Keldeo, and Garchomp, can all heavily threaten it due to their ability to OHKO it with STAB moves after taking a hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is a strong STAB attack that hits the majority of the tier for super effective or neutral damage. When Ghostium Z is activated, Shadow Ball turns into an immensely powerful Never-Ending Nightmare that Gengar can use to deliver a powerful blow to nearly any Pokemon in the tier. It notably OHKOes offensive variants of Landorus-T and Garchomp with just some prior damage. Sludge Wave is a good secondary STAB attack that hits foes neutral to Ghost, like Manaphy and Pelipper, harder than any of Gengar's other moves while also greatly damaging the likes of Tangrowth, Clefable, and Serperior. Taunt denies defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Toxapex of their status moves, which forces them to either switch out or be slowly worn down by Gengar's attacks. Focus Blast catches Tyranitar and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Magnezone, and Heatran on the switch, OHKOing or 2HKOing them all. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the place of either Taunt or Focus Blast to shut down physical attackers slower than Gengar, such as Tyranitar, while also punishing foes that may try using Sucker Punch to KO Gengar, like Mega Mawile and Bisharp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Special Attack puts a considerable amount of power behind Gengar's attacks, while a Life Orb allows it to secure a few OHKOs that it otherwise wouldn't, such as the OHKO on Latios and Mew after Stealth Rock with Shadow Ball. Ghostium Z can be used over Life Orb if none of Gengar's teammates are utilizing Z-Crystals due to its massive damage output against a large portion of the metagame. As Shadow Ball has very few resists and immunities Metronome is an option to steadily boost its power for each consecutive use. Full investment in Speed with a Timid nature makes Gengar as fast as possible and gives it crucial Speed advantages over the likes of Keldeo, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. Cursed Body is Gengar's only possible ability, but it can come in handy against Choice-locked Pokemon that will be forced into either using Struggle or switching out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar should be brought in early-game in order to spam its STAB attacks and wear down the other team. This will often pave the way for a teammate's sweep due to the lack of Pokemon capable of easily stomaching Gengar's hits. In matchups against defensive or balanced teams, Gengar should look to come in on threats like Chansey and Toxapex. From there, it can cripple them with Taunt and proceed to wear them down without taking notable damage from any of their attacks. This set should be wary of staying in on threats that it can't OHKO from full health, such as Volcarona and Gyarados, as Gengar is incredibly frail. Because of said frailty, Gengar should also be wary about coming in on any attacks, which makes being brought in after a teammate has fainted or with support from a pivot optimal. Double switches and coming in on resisted attacks are also options, though these are both notably riskier.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers like Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Landorus-T are appreciative of Gengar's ability to wear down opposing teams for them to clean up. They also enjoy Gengar's ability to prevent phazing and status moves with Taunt, as this allows for easier setup against most defensive Pokemon. Entry hazard support from teammates like Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn can allow Gengar to increase its damage output while also punishing switches. Pivot support from the likes of Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Magnezone is also useful for safely bringing Gengar into play. Dark-type checks like Magearna, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny can take on big threats to Gengar in Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar, and in return, it can wear down opposing teams and adequately pressure Fairy-types for the latter two. Gengar also enjoys having powerful physical attackers like Mamoswine, Kyurem-B, and Mega Pinsir on its team due to their ability to adequately pressure specially defensive Pokemon that it often can't break on its own without using up a lot of PP.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB attack that Gengar can spam quite well due to the tier's general lack of Ghost-resistant Pokemon. Sludge Wave hits Assault Vest Tangrowth, which otherwise walls Gengar, while also heavily damaging Fairy-types like Clefable and hitting Pokemon like Keldeo and Zapdos for more damage than any of Gengar's other moves. Focus Blast offers excellent coverage, nailing Pokemon that otherwise scoff at Gengar's STAB attacks, like Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon that may attempt to come in on Gengar's attacks, such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss. Thunderbolt is Gengar's best way of damaging defensive Celesteela, which can otherwise come in on its attacks, and also damages other potential switch-ins in Toxapex, Mantine, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Hidden Power Ice is an option for the fourth moveslot as well for OHKOing Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Speed with a Timid nature makes Gengar as fast as possible, allowing it to outrun the likes of Keldeo, Kartana, and Garchomp. Maximum investment in Special Attack with Choice Specs maximizes Gengar's damage output, thus turning it into a potent wallbreaker. Cursed Body is Gengar's only ability. However, if it activates, it can be useful in forcing Choice-locked foes to either use Struggle or switch out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions as a wallbreaker that looks to pave the way for a teammate's sweep. However, Gengar can try using its high Speed to clean up late-game if the opposing team is weakened well enough. Because of its frailty, Gengar should be careful about switching in. It can usually get in on predicted double switches and attacks that it either is immune to or 4x resists, though it is often safer to bring Gengar into play with pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. Gengar's frailty should also prevent it from staying in on various threats, such as Garchomp and unboosted Volcarona, unless they've been weakened a bit, since these Pokemon are all capable of taking a hit and OHKOing Gengar or setting up in retaliation. Because Choice Specs locks Gengar into one move, it is important that this set is utilized with careful prediction. For example, if a foe like Tyranitar or Bisharp is predicted to switch in, Gengar should use Focus Blast to prevent them from either trapping it or receiving an opportunity to set up the next turn. Trick is especially important to use with careful prediction, as Gengar only has one opportunity to force a foe to hold Choice Specs. Chansey and Mantine are two examples of Pokemon that are often going to switch into Gengar, so if they are on the opposing team and are predicted to come into play, Trick should be used to cripple them by locking them into one move and, in Chansey's case, removing Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Mega Diancie can punish Gengar's switches and allow it to secure KOs, such as the possible OHKO on Mega Latias with Shadow Ball and the 2HKO on Mantine with Sludge Wave. Spikes support from the likes of Greninja and Ferrothorn can also be useful for punishing typical switch-ins like Assault Vest Magearna. Pivots like Mega Scizor, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone are capable of safely bringing Gengar into play, which is quite useful due to its low defenses. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Celesteela, and Magearna are greatly appreciative of Gengar's wallbreaking capabilities, as it can weaken opposing teams enough for them to sufficiently sweep. Physical attackers can aid Gengar in breaking past the special walls it struggles to deal with on its own. Examples include Tapu Koko, which is particularly useful for breaking past both Mantine and Chansey with its Z-Wild Charge set, and Bisharp, which can use Knock Off to remove Chansey's Eviolite. Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Keldeo can also take on Chansey while pressuring the Dark-types that Gengar often fails to beat, and in return, Gengar can remove opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types for them. Fairy-types like Magearna and Tapu Lele can also check Dark-types for Gengar and enjoy its ability to lure in and remove the Steel-types that they can struggle against, like Heatran and Celesteela.</p>"

  "Marowak-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Marowak's offensive typing in conjunction with Thick Club gives it a strong niche on Trick Room teams as a wallbreaker. It is decently bulky, and its ability Rock Head allows it to fire off an incredibly strong Flare Blitz without repercussion. That said, the fact that Alolan Marowak is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock means that it gets worn down quickly if it repeatedly switches in and out. This issue is further exacerbated by its low Speed, which means that Alolan Marowak usually must take a hit before dishing out damage outside of Trick Room, and its reliance on Thick Club means that it's very vulnerable to Knock Off. Furthermore, its Speed compounds its weaknesses to extremely common and dangerous types in Water, Dark, Ghost, Ground, and Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute eases prediction and allows Alolan Marowak to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Clefable. It also prevents Alolan Marowak from potentially being revenge killed or Pursuit trapped. Low Kick is capable of OHKOing Tyranitar without a boost, is Alolan Marowak's best option to hit Hydreigon, and is also capable of OHKOing Heatran. That being said, it is mostly overshadowed by Bonemerang due to its ability to OHKO Toxapex at +2 (preventing potential unnecessary Scald damage) and Tyranitar unboosted, only really hitting the rare Hydreigon. Knock Off is capable of removing items, which can prove helpful in the long run versus Pokemon like Tapu Fini that are heavily dependent on their items to function. However, the coverage the move provides is completely redundant alongside Shadow Bone and Flare Blitz, restricting it to a utility option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire is not 2HKOed by Shadow Bone, resists Flare Blitz, and has Unaware, leaving Alolan Marowak unable to break through it with Swords Dance boosts. Quagsire threatens Alolan Marowak back with Earthquake or Scald, although Quagsire does need to be wary of switching in on Will-O-Wisp and can't switch into Alolan Marowak directly if even slightly weakened.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T can fall back on Intimidate to soften up Alolan Marowak's attacks, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak in return with Earthquake. Garchomp resists Flare Blitz, outpaces Alolan Marowak outside of Trick Room, and deals heavy damage with Earthquake. Hippowdon escapes the 2HKO from Shadow Bone and KOes Alolan Marowak with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage; however, it must be wary of Flare Blitz, which almost always 2HKOes it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Greninja is faster than Alolan Marowak and OHKOes it with Hydro Pump; in a similar vein, Ash-Greninja can OHKO Alolan Marowak with priority Water Shuriken even if Trick Room is up. Keldeo is also faster, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak with Hydro Pump, Scald, or Surf. Tapu Fini threatens Alolan Marowak with Scald, Gyarados OHKOes it with Waterfall, and Mega Gyarados resists both of its STAB moves. Keep in mind that in Trick Room, Alolan Marowak outspeeds all of these things.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar resists both of Alolan Marowak's STAB moves but must be wary of Bonemerang. It can either trap Alolan Marowak with Pursuit or OHKO it with Crunch or Stone Edge. Weavile also outpaces and can trap Alolan Marowak with Pursuit while also threatening it with STAB Knock Off; that said, it can't switch in on Alolan Marowak. Hoopa-U outpaces and nukes Alolan Marowak or a teammate with Hyperspace Fury or Dark Pulse, although it can't switch in. While extremely niche, Hydreigon resists or is immune to everything Alolan Marowak can throw at it barring the extremely rare Low Kick, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak in return with Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Alolan Marowak is weak to Stealth Rock and is grounded, meaning entry hazards wear it down very quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Bone is the move that Alolan Marowak will use the most, taking good advantage of the lack of bulky Pokemon that resist Ghost in the tier to OHKO or 2HKO the vast majority of the metagame. Flare Blitz 2HKOes nearly everything that doesn't resist it if Stealth Rock is on the field, including physically defensive Landorus-T. This also improves Alolan Marowak's stall matchup in a few ways, allowing it to beat physically defensive Clefable without draining a large amount of Shadow Bone PP in the process, guaranteeing an OHKO versus Mega Sableye after a Swords Dance, and OHKOing Chansey at +2, preventing it from putting Alolan Marowak on a timer with Toxic. Swords Dance makes tearing through bulkier teams a piece of cake, allowing Alolan Marowak to beat Toxapex if Swords Dance is used as Toxapex switches into it. Bonemerang is a solid coverage option for Alolan Marowak, OHKOing Heatran and Tyranitar, and allowing it to beat Toxapex one-on-one. Because Bonemerang hits twice, it has the added bonus of being able to punish Heatran behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack along with a Brave nature allows Alolan Marowak to hit as hard as possible and minimizes its Speed for when it is under Trick Room. Maximum HP investment allows it to take as many hits as possible before going down. Thick Club doubles Alolan Marowak's Attack stat, which allows it to hit 568 Attack before a Swords Dance. Rock Head allows Alolan Marowak to use Flare Blitz without the nasty recoil that it would otherwise entail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ensure that Stealth Rock and Spikes are off of the field whenever possible to avoid wearing Alolan Marowak down and use its resistances to offensively check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Magearna. Avoid switching in directly unless it is absolutely necessary or you know that Alolan Marowak is immune to what its foe is about to use. If you expect a U-turn, don't use Alolan Marowak to absorb it because that is only conducive to wearing it down. Flare Blitz should be used most of the time unless facing a team with solid Fire-type switch-ins, where Shadow Bone should be used instead. Swords Dance should typically be used on predicted switch-ins, but make sure whatever you predict to come in will be OHKOed by Alolan Marowak after a Swords Dance. All in all, just take advantage of any free switch-ins Alolan Marowak is able to get because it will almost invariably result in an opposing Pokemon being severely dented or KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Marowak should rarely be used outside of dedicated Trick Room teams because otherwise it faces heavy competition from other wallbreakers. With Trick Room support, however, Alolan Marowak is able to outspeed most of the metagame and is much harder to revenge kill. Trick Room setters such as Uxie and Cresselia are mandatory; Uxie supports Alolan Marowak with Memento and Stealth Rock, while Cresselia can use Lunar Dance to heal Alolan Marowak back up to full health later on in the match. It also pairs well with other offensive Trick Room Pokemon such as Crawdaunt, Magearna, and Mega Mawile, all of which can break down each other's checks and counters and pave the way for a sweep.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey's unbelievable bulk is metagame-defining, shaping the tier's special attackers around it and carrying the stall archetype on its back. Devastating threats like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y all fall under the same umbrella of being stumped by Chansey. It isn't especially vulnerable on the physical side, either; it has no issue with taking hits from Landorus-T and Diamond Storm Mega Diancie and can heal off Psyshock from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. It can spread consistent damage with Seismic Toss and has the choice of either Toxic or ​Thunder Wave to further punish switch-ins. Additionally, it has support options like Stealth Rock and Aromatherapy, offering even more to teams it's put on. Chansey isn't invincible, though; it has no passive recovery, so it's vulnerable to being chipped down by pivot moves, entry hazards, and other forms of passive damage. Taunt users like Heatran and Tapu Fini can prevent its healing and ensure it stays too low to do its job properly. Lastly, wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Manaphy are able to crack Chansey open.</p>",
    "comments": "<p>Other Options</p> <p>=============</p> <p>Skill Swap allows Chansey to force Natural Cure onto a Gliscor that has had its Toxic Orb removed, putting it on an immediate timer until it switches out and loses its status condition. It additionally allows Chansey to threaten Reuniclus and Clefable with Toxic and remove Huge Power from Mega Mawile as it switches in. Confide allows Chansey to negate progress from problematic Calm Mind users in Pain Split Magearna and Reuniclus, though it only has enough PP to handle one Calm Mind user. Chansey can make use of Wish to support teammates without reliable healing like Mega Mawile and Seismitoad, usually fully healing teammates due to Chansey's titanic HP stat. Counter can be used to surprise the likes of Kyurem-B and Mega Lopunny with an OHKO after surviving Subzero Slammer and High Jump Kick at full health, respectively. Healing Wish is an option on Chansey on offense teams, giving a second wind to the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham by healing damage and clearing status from them.</p> <p>Checks and Counters</p> <p>===================</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Kyurem-B are able to muscle through Chansey using its comparatively weaker physical bulk. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile threaten Chansey with big damage, the latter also being able to remove Eviolite and both having Pursuit to chip away at Chansey while it escapes.</p> <p><strong>Certain Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Under ​rain, Manaphy is completely unbothered by Chansey, with Hydration allowing it to shrug off status attempts and use Rest to heal any chip damage without any drawbacks. It can then proceed to set up to +6 with Tail Glow and blow through Chansey with Surf. Calm Mind + Pain Split Magearna is able to utilize Chansey's absurd HP stat for consistent healing as it boosts all the way to +6 and eventually muscles through. Tapu Lele can 2HKO Chansey with Choice Specs Psyshock. It can also beat Chansey one-on-one with Taunt and Calm Mind sets, though the latter sets give Chansey an opportunity to hit back with status.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Heatran, Tapu Fini, Serperior, and Tornadus-T can prevent any status counterplay from Chansey and ensure that any damage they do to it sticks. Heatran and Tapu Fini are especially notable due to their trapping options in Magma Storm and Whirlpool, respectively, letting them remove Chansey outright.</p> <p><strong>Status Absorbers</strong>: Gliscor is immune to both of Chansey's common status options, and its strong passive recovery means that chipping it down with Seismic Toss is virtually impossible. Clefable and Reuniclus can freely set up on Chansey with Calm Mind thanks to Magic Guard, though the former has a hard time breaking through even after fully setting up without the aid of Knock Off. Although not a real status absorber, Excadrill is immune to both Toxic and Thunder Wave through its typing and can set up on Chansey with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye is not only immune to Chansey's Seismic Toss, but it also has Magic Bounce to reflect any status attempts and Stealth Rock, rendering Chansey utterly incapable of doing anything.</p> <p><strong>Leech Seed and Other HP-Draining Moves</strong>: Leech Seed from Serperior, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela is bad not only because of the chip damage on Chansey but also because of the absurd amount it heals the opposing Pokemon thanks to Chansey's HP stat. Pain Split from Magearna and Rotom-W can put Chansey considerably low while usually healing them fully.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Moves</p> <p>=========</p> <p>Chansey makes for a good Stealth Rock user because of the free opportunities it gets while walling special attackers. The same can be said for Aromatherapy if Stealth Rock can be fit elsewhere on the team, supporting teammates like Unaware Clefable and Rest Seismitoad. Seismic Toss is a consistent method of damage that allows Chansey to beat down the likes of Assault Vest Magearna and Mega Diancie and chip away at switch-ins like Mega Mawile and Kartana. Soft-Boiled lets Chansey keep healthy in the face of entry hazards and wall special wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Ash-Greninja over the course of a game. Toxic puts the likes of Zapdos, Pain Split Rotom-W, and Mega Charizard Y on a strict timer that prevents them from healing off Seismic Toss damage, as well as punishing switch-ins like Kyurem-B and Mega Medicham. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can irritate Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Magearna and Toxapex while still punishing offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Alakazam, and Serperior hard. An alternative spread of 160 HP / 252 Def / 96 Spe allows Chansey to outspeed paralyzed Timid Tapu Lele, which synergizes with Thunder Wave, though this cuts into Chansey's bulk significantly.</p> <p>Set Details</p> <p>========</p> <p>Maximum Defense investment is used because Chansey's special bulk is naturally high enough for the special threats it's tasked with walling and to help against certain physical attackers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Kyurem-B after burning its Z-Move.</p> <p>Usage Tips</p> <p>========</p> <p>Despite Chansey being seemingly invulnerable to special attackers, Volt Switch users like Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Rotom-W can score free damage on Chansey while maintaining momentum. This is especially deadly with entry hazards up to compound the chip damage, so it's important to keep an eye on hazards and avoid having multiple layers on of the field. Sometimes, predictions like doubling in Chansey against the likes of Rotom-W and Tapu Koko are necessary to find a safe opportunity to heal off damage. Chansey needs to be very wary of Knock Off from Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Clefable, which cuts into its bulk massively. Although Chansey can beat non-Taunt Heatran and non-Nature's Madness Tapu Fini, proper scouting is needed, as these two can otherwise completely ruin Chansey.</p> <p>Team Options</p> <p>========</p> <p>Chansey fits best on teams ranging from balance to stall, as they can make up for Chansey's drain on momentum with a strong enough defensive core. Bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro, Cresselia, and Reuniclus can shut down the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny and appreciate Chansey answering Ash-Greninja and Volcarona. Slowbro is notably good because it can also check other physical attackers like Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert for Chansey, and it can rely on Chansey to handle Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko for it. Skarmory provides a solid answer to Kartana and Excadrill and can set Spikes to whittle down the opposing team. Gliscor can handle Heatran and block Volt Switch thanks to its Ground typing and can further support Chansey by clearing entry hazards with Defog or cleaning up weakened teams with Swords Dance late-game. Seismitoad and specially defensive Excadrill are good examples of bulky Ground-type teammates that handle the likes of Tapu Koko and Magearna so that Chansey doesn't need to risk taking Volt Switch damage. Heart Swap Magearna can handle Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B and prevents Calm Mind Magearna and Reuniclus from making any progress. Toxapex can lay down Toxic Spikes to put attackers like Mega Medicham and Tapu Koko on a timer, and Shed Shell variants can scout Heatran and Tapu Fini safely and cripple them with Knock Off. Mega Scizor is a solid stop to Kyurem-B and Weavile, and Chansey can handle some of Mega Scizor's biggest threats in Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y as well as Lava Plume Heatran. Tornadus-T is a good option for revenge killing the likes of Serperior, Kartana, and Mega Medicham, and it can provide hazard removal support. Chansey is a common fixture on Magnezone teams due to its defensive shoddiness, and in return, Magnezone can forcibly revenge kill Kartana and trap Spikes setters like Skarmory and Ferrothorn. For stall teams, Mega Sableye is incredibly synergistic with Chansey, as it shuts down Mega Medicham and prevents hazards. Another good teammate on stall teams is Unaware Clefable, as it puts a firm stop to Hawlucha and Kommo-o and gives Chansey's team a way to stall out Serperior and Manaphy after it uses its Z-Move. Occasionally, Chansey can even be seen on offense teams, with Landorus-T partnering with it as a blanket check to physical attackers and wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Mega Mawile, making up for Chansey's passivity while Chansey answers various special attackers and potentially provides cleric support.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir carves out a niche in OU as a dangerous wallbreaker thanks to its sky-high Attack, access to Swords Dance, and amazing ability in Aerilate. Its Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack lets Mega Pinsir act as an effective revenge killer and pick off faster Pokemon such as Quiver Dance-boosted Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and Serperior. Its Speed tier lets it stand out compared to other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Mega Charizard X. However, Mega Pinsir lacks any form of reliable recovery, and its typing leaves it a liability, as it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, especially after Mega Evolving. It also struggles against common Pokemon such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W, as they can take advantage of Mega Pinsir's typing and threaten it with their STAB moves. Mega Pinsir can't fit all of its coverage moves at once to hit them super effectively. Despite Mega Pinsir's Speed tier, it is outpaced by common Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Ash-Greninja. Thanks to these factors, Mega Pinsir needs a lot of support, especially entry hazard removal, to utilize its full potential and faces competition from other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Mega Charizard X.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge can be used over Close Combat and Earthquake to hit Zapdos. However, being walled by Magearna is not desirable. Feint can be used to outpriortize Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Mega Lopunny's Quick Attack but is weaker than Quick Attack, making Mega Pinsir's role as a revenge killer less effective. Substitute is an interesting option on bulkier teams to avoid status from the likes of Clefable and Toxapex, allowing Mega Pinsir a free opportunity to attack or set up Swords Dance. However, it means Mega Pinsir must drop Quick Attack. Knock Off is a decent option to remove items such as Wiki Berry from Rotom-W and Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Zapdos while still hitting Pokemon like Jirachi for super effective damage. However, the lack of power is very limiting. Mega Pinsir can also use an Adamant nature to maximize its damage output. Unfortunately, this leaves it outpaced by Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B, both of which threaten to OHKO Mega Pinsir with their STAB moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Zapdos can take Mega Pinsir's STAB moves and force it out with their super effective STAB moves. However, Tapu Koko doesn't like taking Earthquake on the switch, while Rotom-W must watch out for Close Combat. Zapdos is especially notable because it hard counters Mega Pinsir; not only can it threaten it with its STAB moves, but it can also paralyze Mega Pinsir with Static and heal off any damage taken. Zapdos must watch out for the rare Stone Edge, however. Mega Pinsir must also be wary of Pokemon that may have Electric-type coverage to threaten an unexpected KO such as Thunder from Clefable and Thunder Punch from Kommo-o.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Magearna, Celesteela, and Skarmory resist both of Mega Pinsir's STAB moves but don't like switching into Close Combat or Earthquake in the case of Magearna. Skarmory can also heal off the damage with Roost and threaten Mega Pinsir with Counter and Whirlwind if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type coverage</strong>: Mega Diancie and the rare Mega Aerodactyl resist both of Mega Pinsir's STAB moves, are faster than Mega Pinsir, and threaten an OHKO with Diamond Storm and Stone Edge, respectively. Tyranitar can also threaten Mega Pinsir if it is wielding a Choice Scarf or if Mega Pinsir is running Earthquake and can potentially punish it with Pursuit. Mega Pinsir must also watch out for Pokemon that carry Rock-type coverage such as Stone Edge from the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type coverage</strong>: Weavile is faster than Mega Pinsir and threatens an immediate OHKO with Icicle Crash or picks it off with Ice Shard. Kyurem-B is bulky enough to live an unboosted Close Combat if Stealth Rock is not on the field and can fire back with Subzero Slammer or Ice Beam. A healthy Mega Latias can survive a +2 Quick Attack and retaliate back with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Ash-Greninja can outpace Mega Pinsir and deal heavy damage to it, with the latter threatening it with Water Shuriken, even when Mega Pinsir uses Quick Attack. Choice Scarf Victini can live a +2 Quick Attack and retaliate back with V-Create. Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can come in repeatedly and use Fake Out to wear down Mega Pinsir throughout the game. Weather sweepers such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Mega Swampert can take +2 Quick Attack and threaten Mega Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pelipper can survive Mega Pinsir's unboosted Frustation and threaten to burn it with Scald or an OHKO with Hurricane. Flyinium Z users such as Dragonite, Gyarados, and Landorus-T deserve a mention because they can also live Mega Pinsir's unboosted STAB moves and OHKO it with Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: If Pinsir hasn't Mega Evolved yet, Toxic Spikes from Toxapex is a major issue, as the damage taken from poison will wear Pinsir down throughout the game. The presence of Stealth Rock is detrimental to Pinsir, especially after Mega Evolving, making it more difficult to switch in and out of battle.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance turns Mega Pinsir into a deadly wallbreaker, letting it pose a threat to defensive teams and clean up weakened targets. Frustration threatens to OHKO Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kommo-o, and Mega Medicham. Quick Attack allows Mega Pinsir to function as a solid revenge killer and pick off faster targets like Mega Lopunny, Serperior, Hawlucha, and Mega Alakazam at +2. Close Combat tears through Steel- and Rock-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Mega Tyranitar as well as dealing major damage to Magearna and Rotom-W. Finally, Earthquake punishes Tapu Koko on the switch as well as hitting Magearna much harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hyper Cutter is Pinsir's preferred ability before Mega Evolution because it lets Pinsir ignore Intimidate in a pinch. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, and Kyurem-B.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir fills the job of breaking holes through defensive teams in the early-game and cleaning up in the late-game. Early-game, it can forgo setting up with Swords Dance and focus on attacking to chip answers like Rotom-W to put them in range of its boosted attacks later in the game. However, once Mega Evolved, it can become much harder to bring Mega Pinsir in due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Mega Pinsir should be mindful of scenarios on when to use Quick Attack, as faster targets that are not within KO range will threaten it in return with heavy damage. Mega Pinsir should also be wary of Psychic Terrain, as its Quick Attack will be nullified against grounded targets such as Mega Alakazam. Mega Pinsir should not try to aim for a sweep if Pokemon that pose an immediate threat such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko are still active. Managing Mega Pinsir's HP is essential, as it needs to be at full HP to beat specific targets such as Mega Latias one-on-one. Mega Pinsir should take advantage of the free turns provided such as Gliscor setting up Stealth Rock by making aggressive switches and forcing an immediate reaction from the opponent. Another good way to safely bring in Mega Pinsir is with support from Volt Switch and U-turn or to sacrifice a weakened Pokemon, which is only valid on offense and hyper offense structures.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir fits best on offense, bulky offense, and hyper offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and can give it proper support. However, it is not strictly limited to these structures. Ground-types such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Landorus-T, and Excadrill are good partners for Mega Pinsir, as they can take on Electric-types that threaten Mega Pinsir such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko, threaten the latter with their STAB moves, cripple them with Toxic, and provide Stealth Rock support. Excadrill also has the benefit of offering Rapid Spin support to remove entry hazards for Mega Pinsir and is a good offensive partner that can pressure checks such as Rotom-W and Mega Latias. Rockium Z Landorus-T can tear through Zapdos, removing Mega Pinsir's biggest counter. Entry hazard removal is a top priority, so pairing it with a Defog user such as Serperior, Tapu Fini, Kartana, Gliscor, or Skarmory is a good idea. Serperior has the benefit of providing paralysis support with Glare, crippling faster threats such as Tornadus-T and Mega Latias, and it can lure in Steel-types and wear them down with Knock Off or threaten them with Hidden Power Fire. Tapu Fini provides Misty Terrain support, allowing Pinsir before Mega Evolution to set up safely without fear of status while checking Grass-types that threaten Tapu Fini. Kartana checks Ground-type Stealth Rock setters that threaten Mega Pinsir such as defensive Landorus-T, and Choice Band and Swords Dance variants put heavy pressure on Flying- and Steel-types such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Magearna. Gliscor can bring Mega Pinsir in safely with U-turn and provide Knock Off support to remove Leftovers from Ferrothorn and Clefable and Black Sludge from Toxapex, allowing Mega Pinsir to break through them more easily. Finally, Skarmory provides Spikes support, putting pressure on physical walls such as Slowbro. Magnezone is a good partner for Mega Pinsir, as it can trap and remove Skarmory and Celesteela, relieving a lot of pressure for Mega Pinsir and allowing it to run Earthquake over Close Combat more easily. Magnezone can also bring it in more safely with Volt Switch. Other Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zapdos check Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, provide Defog support, and safely bring Mega Pinsir in with Volt Switch. Ash-Greninja is another good partner for Mega Pinsir since it provides Spikes support and together, they can pressure certain walls more easily such as Toxapex. Dragonite is another fantastic teammate for Mega Pinsir as they form a powerful Flying-type core that can overwhelm shared checks for the other to clean up. Tornadus-T can soften Mega Pinsir's checks thanks to U-turn, Knock Off, Taunt, or different Z-moves. Kyurem-B is another relevant partner that pressures Flying- and Steel-types so that Mega Pinsir can clean up. Although more niche, Mega Pinsir can be used on more balance teams, which can provide it with cleric support from the likes of Chansey and Clefable, curing any status afflicted with Heal Bell and improving its longevity with Wish. Steel-type pivots such as Magearna and Jirachi are also appreciated, as they can cover Flying-types like Tornadus-T and bring Mega Pinsir in safely with Volt Switch and U-turn. Jirachi also grants Healing Wish support to restore Mega Pinsir back to full health if it has been worn down throughout the game. On hyper offense teams, Mega Pinsir enjoys being paired with dedicated leads such as Taunt Mew and Imprison Landorus-T that prevent opposing hazards on the opening turn and then get up their own entry hazards. Excadrill is also a good lead for Mega Pinsir, as it bypasses Magic Bounce with Mold Breaker and can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>"

Its defensive typing and decent bulk let it find setup opportunities against common Pokemon such as Heatran, defensive Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, Gyarados is held back by its subpar Speed tier, with Pokemon like Kyurem-B outspeeding it before a boost, and it is outpaced by Mega Alakazam and most Choice Scarf users after a boost. Even at +1, Gyarados lacks the power to OHKO relevant walls without committing to using its Z-Move. Gyarados's vulnerability to Stealth Rock is also annoying because it needs to keep as much HP as possible to set up and sweep. Regular and Mega Gyarados struggle against common offensive types such as Electric, Grass, Rock, Fighting, and Fairy without the necessary moves. As a result, Gyarados requires plenty of support, especially entry hazard removal, to bring out its full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moxie Gyarados can run other Z-Crystals like Waterium Z and Groundium Z to hit neutral targets like Celesteela and threaten Toxapex without a boost. However, it must give up the one-turn effect of Bounce powered up by Flyinium Z to do so, and this makes Gyarados less threatening against Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Kartana.</p> <p>As for Mega Gyarados, it can run coverage moves like Stone Edge to hit Zapdos, Iron Head to smash Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu, and Ice Fang to hit Garchomp and Dragonite, as well as hitting Gliscor and Landorus-T much harder. Keep in mind that giving up Substitute or Taunt to run three attacks will make it more vulnerable to status and phazing. Running a bulkier spread with an Adamant nature has the benefit of taking more hits to set up an extra Dragon Dance and dish out more damage. However, this leaves it more liable to being outpaced and revenge killed after a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and coverage moves</strong>: Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W can survive Gyarados's STAB moves from both the Supersonic Skystrike and Mega variants and can threaten it back with their super effective STAB moves. Zapdos is especially notable because it also threatens to paralyze Gyarados with Static. However, Rotom-W despises taking Earthquake from Mega Gyarados thanks to Mold Breaker ignoring Levitate, especially since Mega Gyarados has a favorable roll to OHKO Bold variants at +1 if Stealth Rock is on the field. Tapu Koko sometimes runs a Choice Scarf or a Shuca Berry to outspeed Gyarados after a Dragon Dance or to survive Earthquake in a pinch to retaliate back with its super effective STAB moves. Gyarados must also be wary of unexpected Electric-type coverage such as Thunder from Clefable and Thunder Punch from Kommo-o.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Serperior, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur survive Gyarados's STAB moves and retaliate back with their STAB moves or wear it down with Leech Seed. Tapu Bulu can also use its Grassy Terrain to weaken Earthquake. Choice Scarf Kartana can outspeed Gyarados at +1 and threaten it with Leaf Blade. These Grass-types must be wary of the Supersonic Skystrike set, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Toxapex, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon can take Gyarados's STAB moves and threaten to burn it with Scald. The latter two are also immune to Waterfall from regular Gyarados. Tapu Fini has enough bulk to survive a boosted Earthquake and threatens Mega Gyarados with Moonblast; however, it does not like facing regular Gyarados before it uses Supersonic Skystrike. Toxapex can get rid of Gyarados's Dragon Dance boosts with Haze if Gyarados lacks Taunt; however, it does not like taking Earthquake or Crunch very much. Toxapex is also a flimsy check versus regular and Mega Gyarados without the advantageous position or predictions. Mega Slowbro deserves a mention because it has enough bulk to survive Crunch at +1 and threatens a burn with Scald, paralysis from Thunder Wave, or a KO from Counter.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Mega Alakazam and Choice Scarf users like Kartana, Tapu Lele, Landorus-T, and Victini outspeed Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance boost and threaten it back with heavy damage. Landorus-T also reduces Gyarados's Attack stat thanks to Intimidate and can threaten both forms with either Stone Edge or U-turn. Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can come in multiple times and use Fake Out to wear down Gyarados throughout the game.</p> <p><strong>Physical walls</strong>: Skarmory has enough bulk to survive Gyarados's STAB moves and retaliate back with Counter and heal with Roost. Skarmory can also phaze Gyarados with Whirlwind if it lacks Taunt. However, Skarmory loses to Mega Gyarados and even regular Gyarados if they have Taunt, since they can stall out the Counter PP. Mega Scizor can check Mega Gyarados, but it is setup fodder for the Supersonic Skystrike set.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Bulky Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Bulu, Mega Altaria, and Magearna survive Mega Gyarados's STAB moves and will retaliate back with their STAB moves. However, the former three do not appreciate taking Supersonic Skystrike, while the latter despises Earthquake. Magearna sometimes runs a Shuca Berry to survive a one-time Earthquake or a Custap Berry to outspeed Gyarados in a pinch and fire back with Fleur Cannon or Electric-type coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Kommo-o can deal with Mega Gyarados easily, but is helpless against the Supersonic Skystrike variant, especially if it lacks Thunder Punch or Rock Slide to handle regular Gyarados. Defensive Kommo-o can also threaten to cripple Gyarados with Toxic or phaze it with Roar if Gyarados lacks Taunt. Hawlucha deserves a mention because it threatens Mega Gyarados with High Jump Kick and can either bait regular Gyarados into wasting its Z-Move via Substitute or threaten it with a 2HKO from Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type coverage</strong>: If Gyarados lacks Waterfall, Tyranitar can wall it and threaten it with Stone Edge. Regular Gyarados must also watch out for Pokemon that carry Rock-type coverage such as Stone Edge Landorus-T and Garchomp and the rare Continental Crush Sand Rush Excadrill.</p>",

      "Mega Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance lets Mega Gyarados break through defensive teams for another partner or to clean up late-game. Substitute shields Mega Gyarados against Leech Seed and status from the likes of Celesteela and Toxapex. Taunt stops status, recovery, phazing, Haze, and Leech Seed from the likes of Chansey, Slowbro, Skarmory, Toxapex, and Celesteela. With Mold Breaker, it also bypasses Magic Bounce to shut down Mega Sableye. Crunch threatens bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro, Mew, Mega Latias, and Cresselia. Earthquake tears through Magearna, Toxapex, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Koko, and it hits Levitate users like Rotom-W and Hydreigon thanks to Mold Breaker. Finally, Waterfall threatens Gliscor and Landorus-T. With Mold Breaker, it also ignores the Water immunity from Gastrodon, Volcanion, and Seismitoad. The odds to flinch are useful to break physical walls such as Skarmory more easily. Mega Gyarados's attacks also ignore Unaware from Pokemon like Quagsire and Clefable after a boost and Sturdy from Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is mandatory to outspeed Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny after a Dragon Dance. Intimidate is Gyarados's preferred ability before Mega Evolution to soften physical hits from Pokemon like Weavile in a pinch and allow more setup opportunities. Without the Z-Move, it is difficult to justify fitting Moxie, as it is hard to constantly activate as regular Gyarados.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados functions best as a wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. However, it should not try to sweep if checks such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu are still active. Instead, these checks should be eliminated or weakened before going for the sweep. For example, Choice Scarf Victini can snipe Tapu Fini with Final Gambit or Bolt Strike, potentially removing it from the game for Mega Gyarados. Depending on the matchup, determine if Mega Gyarados should be used to sweep or to wallbreak in order to enable another teammate to clean up and act according to the turn decided. Mega Gyarados should also be careful with its HP, as taking chip damage will reduce its setup opportunities later in the game. When Gyarados should Mega Evolve depends on the current situation; holding off on Mega Evolving can have benefits such as keeping Intimidate to ease setup and its Flying-type to set up on Ground-types. However, keep in mind that Mega Evolving removes its weakness to Stealth Rock and improves Gyarados's bulk. Mega Evolving also reduces its Electric weakness and grants a Prankster immunity, a valuable Psychic immunity, and a Dark resistance, allowing Mega Gyarados to take on Psychic-types like Cresselia and Reuniclus and resist Ash-Greninja's STAB moves, at the cost of gaining a Fairy and Grass weakness, losing its Ground immunity, and turning its Fighting and Bug resistances into weaknesses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados is a solid fit on hyper offense teams thanks to Mold Breaker, which provides it with the ability to handle stall teams and other bulkier builds. It enjoys partnering with a dedicated lead such as Excadrill, Imprison Landorus-T, or Taunt Mew, which are able to prevent entry hazards on the opening turn and can get their own hazards up. Tapu Koko is an interesting partner, being able to set up dual screens to further boost the already high bulk Mega Gyarados has or utilizing a Taunt + Nature's Madness set to chip down Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Ground-types if Mega Gyarados isn't running Waterfall. Fighting-type partners like Hawlucha and Kommo-o have synergy with Mega Gyarados, as they can overwhelm shared checks like Clefable for the other to clean up. Magearna acts as a buffer to Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, while Gyarados can safely switch into Ground- and Fire-type moves aimed at Magearna. Tapu Lele is a fearsome wallbreaker that helps soften the opposing team to enable Mega Gyarados's cleaning ability, and it protects Mega Gyarados from priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny. Protean Greninja sets up Spikes to wear down checks and can lure in and KO Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn with Gunk Shot and Hidden Power Fire. Pivots such as Landorus-T, Victini, and the aforementioned Magearna provide Mega Gyarados a safe switch-in with U-turn and Volt Switch. Serperior provides hazard removal with Defog, Taunt to further deny hazards, and paralysis support with Glare. Paralysis support is especially helpful if Mega Gyarados runs Substitute, as the chance of full paralysis provides it with extra opportunities to set up with Dragon Dance.</p>"

      "Flyinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyarados can use Dragon Dance to take advantage of the likes of defensive Landorus-T, posing a threat as both a wallbreaker and a cleaner. Waterfall is Gyarados's primary STAB attack, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Celesteela. Bounce is powered up by Flyinium Z to give Gyarados an incredibly strong burst of damage, with its regular version still being able to hit the likes of Tapu Bulu and Kommo-o if needed. Taunt shuts down status, recovery, phazing, and Haze from the likes of Chansey, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Toxapex, letting Gyarados more consistently set up and break through teams. Finally, Earthquake can be used to threaten Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Magearna at the cost of leaving Gyarados vulnerable to status, Haze, and Whirlwind.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny after a boost. Moxie lets Gyarados snowball after a KO and synergizes well with Supersonic Skystrike, which allows Gyarados to more easily nab a KO thanks to its high damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gyarados fills the role of an early-game wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Because Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are a terrible matchup for Gyarados, it is advised not to bring it in if they are still healthy, as they are bulky enough to survive a +2 Waterfall and threaten an OHKO back with their super effective STAB moves. Instead, Gyarados should wait until they are removed or weakened before going for the sweep. Gyarados can often find opportunities to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Kartana locked into Smart Strike and Greninja locked into its Water-type STAB moves as well as passive Pokemon such as Celesteela and defensive Landorus-T, especially if Gyarados is running Taunt. If Gyarados lacks Taunt, it must be more careful of what it sets up on, as Pokemon like Chansey and Toxapex can threaten it with status moves, and Celesteela can hinder it with Leech Seed. Gyarados should also be mindful of timing its Z-Move, as it will be wasted if it is used against a Pokemon behind a Substitute or if the opponent sacrifices a weakened Pokemon to entry hazards, leaving Gyarados without a consistent Flying-type STAB move and less of a threat. Gyarados needs to manage its HP carefully, as its typing leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, and it becomes more susceptible to revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Leaf Blade Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flyinium Z Gyarados is a great fit for hyper offense teams that appreciate the snowball effect it provides thanks to Moxie. Entry hazard removal is mandatory, so it appreciates being paired with a Defogger such as Serperior or Thundurus-T. Serperior has the benefit of beating Rotom-W one-on-one and grants paralysis support with Glare, while Thundurus-T blocks Electric-type attacks aimed at Gyarados. A dedicated lead such as Mega Diancie, Excadrill, Taunt Mew, or Imprison Landorus-T is also mandatory, as it prevents hazards from being set up on the opening turn. Magearna helps take on the likes of Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele. In return, Gyarados handles Fire-types that threaten Magearna such as Volcarona and Heatran. Gyarados also appreciates Fire-type partners like Mega Charizard X handling Ferrothorn and Mega Mawile and forcing damage on Pokemon such as Zapdos and Clefable so that Gyarados can clean up. Hawlucha and Gyarados form a powerful Flying-type core that can overwhelm shared checks for the other to clean up.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto's unique ability Imposter causes it to transform into the opposing Pokemon, also copying any stat changes. These stat changes also overwrite whatever was affecting Ditto initially, allowing Ditto to decimate most Sticky Web teams. With a Choice Scarf, Ditto can always outspeed what it transforms into, unless that Pokemon is also holding a Choice Scarf. This allows Ditto to operate as an excellent revenge killer. In addition, Ditto can handle stall teams by copying recovery, hazard removal, and cleric support, and its transformations come with fresh PP. With a reliable Regenerator partner, Ditto can have pseudo-infinite PP and win the long game against stall. Ditto also provides team support by scouting movesets.</p> <p>In OU, Ditto is best suited for bulky teams as an anti-setup, anti-offense, and anti-stall option. However, because Ditto is forced to run Choice Scarf to avoid Speed ties, it has trouble with defensive setup Pokemon like Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus. Ditto can also be difficult to bring in safely against offensive teams due to its low HP stat and the likely low bulk and high offensive stats of the Pokemon it seeks to revenge kill. Additionally, Imposter and Transform are blocked by Substitute, leaving Ditto and its team vulnerable against setup sweepers that utilize said move, such as Serperior and Mega Gyarados.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Ditto's one-dimensional nature, it lacks many viable other options. An IV spread of 31 / 30 / 31 / 30 / 31 / 0 could be used to give Ditto Hidden Power Fire, creating better Tapu Lele and Latios sets when copying those. However, Ditto then loses out on the ability to damage defensive Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute blocks Imposter, so Pokemon that set up behind Substitute, including Serperior and Mega Gyarados, can nullify Ditto and proceed to tear apart its team.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Pokemon that set up with Calm Mind such as Reuniclus and Clefable can take advantage of the fact that Ditto is Choice locked to recover on it, damage it, or use it as further setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: If Ditto transforms into an opposing Choice Scarf user, it will be forced into a Speed tie. In addition, Choice Scarf users that are faster than the Pokemon Ditto is transformed into can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Ditto is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, since it takes entry hazard damage before Imposter triggers.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Ditto</strong>: If an opposing Ditto is already transformed, Ditto cannot transform into it and becomes useless.</p>",

      "Imposter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto learns. It will likely not see use—Imposter will usually transform Ditto immediately upon switch in, and an otherwise untransformed Ditto is extremely frail and can be easily OHKOed—but it is required for a valid set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Imposter lets Ditto immediately transform into its foe upon switch in and is what gives Ditto its viability. Without Imposter, Ditto would be extremely slow and vulnerable while it wastes a turn to use Transform. Choice Scarf is used to avoid Speed ties. Unless the foe is also holding a Choice Scarf, Ditto will outspeed it and be able to act as a revenge killer. Ditto copies all of its foe's stats except for HP; thus, 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Ditto's bulk. Since Ditto copies the majority of its foe's stats, its IVs are only relevant in three cases: determining its HP stat, determining its Hidden Power type, and in the rare mirror matchup. In a mirror matchup between two Ditto, the faster Ditto will Transform first and be left with 5 PP. A Pokemon cannot Transform into an already Transformed Pokemon, so the slower Ditto will retain all of its PP and will Struggle last. 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature aim to create the slowest untransformed Ditto. 252 Defense EVs are used with the Relaxed nature to minimize the amount of damage taken from opposing Struggle, while 4 Attack EVs give a slight boost to the damage output of Struggle. 0 Speed IVs and 31 IVs in every other stat give Ditto Hidden Power Ice, allowing it to significantly damage defensive Landorus-T. 30 Special Attack, 30 Special Defense, and 1 Speed IV can be used for Hidden Power Ground, which allows Ditto to countertrap Magnezone.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Ditto to revenge kill offensive threats. Ditto can apply heavy pressure on opponents by copying their wallbreakers. Copying powerful Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Medicham and Mega Charizard Y, can be especially devastating, as the typical counterplay of revenge killing is made difficult by Ditto's Choice Scarf. Early-game, Ditto can be sent in or lead off with to scout movesets. Against stall teams, attempt to switch Ditto into Knock Off to have its Choice Scarf removed. Without Choice Scarf, Ditto has the freedom to switch moves and has its effective PP increased from 5 to 20, allowing it to PP stall when paired with teammates with Regenerator. Ditto can then proceed to counter Mega Sableye and copy cleric support and entry hazard removal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In OU, Ditto is best suited for bulky teams that need support versus offensive setup, offense, and stall teams. Since Ditto punishes setup, extremely bulky Pokemon like Chansey, which typically require setup to break through, can make very effective partners. Teammates with Regenerator such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss allow Ditto to PP stall defensive Pokemon. Entry hazard removal from Mew, Tapu Fini, Skarmory, or Zapdos keeps Ditto healthy throughout the course of a match. Pivots able to use U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Landorus-T, Magearna, and Rotom-W, are able to bring in Ditto safely. Pokemon able to handle Calm Mind users are appreciated; physical wallbreakers such as Hoopa-U are nice in this regard. Hoopa-U is also able to punish Substitute users with Hyperspace Fury. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Landorus-T can break opposing Focus Sash and potentially put defensive Pokemon in range of Ditto's attacks.</p>"

Two useful abilities in Static and Pressure further increase Zapdos's utility by either crippling contact attackers like Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny or stalling out entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Clefable. In addition, great coverage options in Hidden Power Ice and Heat Wave prevent Zapdos from being fodder for common threats like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, the weakness to Stealth Rock cripples Zapdos's defensive capabilities and forces it to waste a turn on using Roost more often. Also, many common Pokemon have their ways to reliably beat Zapdos, like Garchomp with Continental Crush and Kartana with Swords Dance-boosted Breakneck Blitz.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Electrium Z set with Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ice, and Roost can be used, but it loses out on the defensive utility of Zapdos. Toxic can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon. However, Zapdos struggles to fit this move on its set. Chilan Berry enables Zapdos to beat Normalium Z Kartana but is useless outside of this matchup and is thus inferior to Leftovers and Rocky Helmet. In addition, Kartana's teammates like Tornadus-T can easily shut down this strategy with Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: The likes of Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, Rockium Z Garchomp, and Rockium Z Landorus-T overwhelm Zapdos quickly with their super effective Rock-type moves. Tyranitar and Mega Diancie dislike paralysis, however, and Zapdos can potentially stall out Tyranitar's Stone Edge with Roost and Pressure, while Garchomp and Landorus-T are heavily threatened by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Iсe-types</strong>: Kyurem-B and Weavile are capable of inflicting great damage on Zapdos with their Ice-type STAB options. However, these Pokemon hate being paralyzed, and Weavile also drops to Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Pokémon like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, Mega Charizard X, and Hydreigon take little from Zapdos's attacks and threaten it with super effective moves like Ice Beam or with naturally strong attacks. None of these Pokemon enjoy being paralyzed, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Zapdos's Electric-type STAB moves and thus can switch in on it more freely. Gastrodon and Hippowdon are especially notable counters to Zapdos, since they can ignore any attack Zapdos throws out and cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: Moves like Heatran's Inferno Overdrive and boosted Kartana's Breakneck Blitz heavily dent or even completely eliminate Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey walls Zapdos because of its amazing special bulk and easily stalls it out.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Discharge is preferred to Thunderbolt thanks to the former's higher paralysis chance, which can potentially cripple Zapdos's common checks like Heatran and Tyranitar. Volt Switch is also a plausible option in this slot because it lets Zapdos pivot out from unfavorable matchups; however, it makes Zapdos unable to consistently beat threats like Hawlucha. Heat Wave hits Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Kartana, Magearna, and Mega Scizor that take on Discharge rather comfortably. Defog can be used on more defensive teams alongside Pressure or if you can't fit any other Defog user on the team, but it forces Zapdos to give up its precious coverage. Hidden Power Ice complements Zapdos's other coverage moves, hitting Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, all of which otherwise set up Stealth Rock for free. Roost is mandatory to keep Zapdos healthy throughout the battle so it can consistently check threats like Tornadus-T and Kartana.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>72 Speed EVs ensure that Zapdos always outpaces Modest Heatran. A Timid nature could be used over Bold to outspeed the rare Timid Heatran, though. Leftovers improves Zapdos's survivability by slightly healing all the chip damage it receives. Rocky Helmet, on the other hand, chips down contact attackers like the aforementioned Kartana and Mega Medicham but makes Zapdos easier to wear down. Static threatens Pokemon that use contact moves, like Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Mega Medicham, with a possible paralysis, making them easier to deal with. Pressure, on the other hand, is used mainly on stall teams and helps stall out the opposing team. Pressure also synergizes well with Defog and lets Zapdos stall out entry hazards from Ferrothorn and the likes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zapdos's main task is to switch in on Pokemon it checks like Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Keep Zapdos healthy throughout the game by using Roost frequently so it can consistently check Pokemon Zapdos is supposed to. This is especially important if you run Rocky Helmet instead of Leftovers. Be wary of possible strong attacks and coverage options like Breakneck Blitz from Kartana that can heavily damage Zapdos. Discharge is usually a go-to move thanks to its chance of causing paralysis. Don't be afraid to predict if you're playing against Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T that dislike taking Zapdos's coverage moves, though.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos fits on a lot of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall thanks to its ability to check many notable threats and general lack of passivity. Bulky Water- and Grass-types can form fairly sturdy defensive cores with Zapdos that can cover most prominent threats: Water-types like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon can deal with Heatran and appreciate Zapdos checking Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu, while Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu can act as a secondary checks to Ground-types and enjoy Tornadus-T being checked. Pokemon with a somewhat mediocre Speed tier such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele appreciate foes being paralyzed by Zapdos. Zapdos also can potentially bring these Pokemon on the field via Volt Switch. Bulky Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Scizor can pivot into the likes of Tyranitar and Kyurem-B, which can easily beat Zapdos. Magearna also enjoys Zapdos's immunity to Ground.</p>"

Its typing also lets it tackle a few other threats, namely Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor. Nonetheless, Moltres's bulk is somewhat lackluster, especially since it can't afford to invest enough EVs into its defenses, which means it will often crumble to strong wallbreakers. Furthermore, if a skillful opponent manages to get up Stealth Rock against Moltres's team, its typing gets turned against it, putting huge pressure on Moltres.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Protect may seem tempting, Moltres really can't afford to forfeit any of the four moves on its main set, as all of them are imperative for its success on stall teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: While most Moltres teams have plenty of ways around Stealth Rock, if it goes up, it's extremely damaging for Moltres.

Thunder Wave from Clefable is also a pain for Moltres to deal with. Pokemon that can inflict said status and pressure Heal Bell users on Moltres's team can really cripple it.</p>",

      "Pressure": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flamethrower is Moltres's most reliable attacking move, notably striking Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, and Excadrill. Substitute lets Moltres stall out foes such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Volcanion, and Kyurem-B while letting it dodge status moves like Thunder Wave and Toxic from Clefable and Heatran. Defog enables it to remove entry hazards against several setters that force Mega Sableye out, notably Excadrill, Clefable, and Heatran. Lastly, Roost keeps Moltres healthy, enabling it to consistently check the likes of Heatran and Clefable. Hidden Power Ground over Substitute is a potential option, but more often than not, the utility of Substitute is far preferred over Hidden Power Ground's quicker method of beating down Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature let Moltres outrun Excadrill and Heatran, and the combination of HP and Defense EVs let it take a Thunder Punch from Mega Mawile at full health. Pressure is the optimal ability choice, enabling Moltres to PP stall foes effectively. Finally, Leftovers is key to provide passive healing and enable Moltres to use Substitute with less of a drawback.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always switch Moltres into Stealth Rock setters it walls. Attempt to Defog after scouting for moves that could threaten it like Thunder Wave from Clefable, Toxic from Heatran, and Rock Tomb from Excadrill. If your opponent manages to get up Stealth Rock against Moltres's team, it's advisable to remove said entry hazard via a secondary Defogger before recklessly sending it in. Keep track of the PP of opposing Pokémon to know when Moltres will be able to fully PP stall them. For instance, if Calm Mind Clefable still has all of its Moonblast PP, it can beat Moltres one-on-one. Be careful of status ailments; Toxic Heatran or Thunder Wave Clefable could be annoying if your opponent can put enough pressure on your Heal Bell user. Try to pivot Moltres in when threats to stall such as Mega Mawile and Mega Heracross come in, as it can force them out with Flamethrower; however, scout for Thunder Punch on Mega Mawile, and be careful of the aforementioned move as well as Rock Blast from Mega Heracross. Likewise, pulling double switches not to let these two come in is a risky but also quite rewarding play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Moltres mostly fits on stall due to the nature of its type and utility. Further entry hazard control is imperative alongside Moltres; secondary Defog users such as Zapdos and Gliscor are notable picks. The former also makes a deadly Pressure core that is very effective at PP stalling wallbreakers that can threaten stall otherwise. In a similar manner, Mega Sableye is also an outstanding pick, as it heavily appreciates Moltres taking on Clefable, Heatran, and Excadrill, thus creating a strong backbone of hazard prevention. Pyukumuku is a solid Unaware user that can ignore boosts from most setup sweepers as well as help Moltres out when it comes to PP stalling with Spite. Chansey is a solid pick for any stall team for its ability to blanket check nearly all special attackers in the tier. Lastly, physical walls like Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and Unaware Clefable can also help with physical attackers such as Tyranitar that can overcome Moltres. The aforementioned Clefable and Chansey can also provide Heal Bell support, which is important to rid Moltres of status aliments commonly run by Pokemon it’s supposed to check.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite fills a niche in OU as a dangerous sweeper thanks to its Multiscale ability allowing for easy opportunities to set up with Dragon Dance and sweep through opposing teams. Its typing and good bulk allow it to find setup opportunities against common threats for offense such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Ash-Greninja, as well as balance staples like Gliscor and Heatran. Extreme Speed provides it with a solid priority move and revenge killing tool, letting it stand out compared to other Dragon Dance users such as Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and Kommo-o. It can also select between Flyinium Z and Dragonium Z, providing it with strong Z-Moves to blow past targets such as Clefable and Rotom-W, respectively. Unfortunately, Dragonite is held back by its subpar Speed tier, with Pokemon like Kyurem-B outspeeding it before a boost and Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and most Choice Scarf users outspeeding it after a boost. Its typing also leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, which both removes Multiscale's effect and takes away a chunk of Dragonite's HP. As a result, Dragonite needs a lot of support, especially entry hazard removal, to utilize its full potential, and it faces competition from other Dragon Dance users such as Mega Charizard X and Gyarados.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite can run Lum Berry to shrug off status from the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, and Chansey as it sets up, as well as burns from Scald and Will-O-Wisp. However, the lack of immediate power severely reduces Dragonite's ability to wallbreak. These sets typically make use of Ice Punch, Earthquake, and Superpower to hit a wide spread of Pokemon. Fire Punch can be used to threaten Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Celesteela without using Supersonic Skystrike. A defensive Dragon Dance + Roost set with Ice Punch and Earthquake can be used on stall teams to act as a backup check to Heatran, Serperior, and Kartana and an alternative win condition. In return, Dragonite appreciates the support from stall staples, such as Mega Sableye keeping entry hazards off the field with Magic Bounce, Chansey healing status with Aromatherapy, and Skarmory setting up Spikes to wear down Dragonite's checks. Thanks to its great synergy with Multiscale, Weakness Policy is also an option to potentially raise Dragonite's Attack even further. However, Dragonite misses out on OHKOing Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Clefable if it lacks Supersonic Skystrike. Stone Edge on Flyinium Z variants allows them to hit Zapdos while threatening an OHKO on Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock without the need of using Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory walls Dragonite and threatens it back with Counter and Whirlwind, with Whirlwind being even more irritating if Stealth Rock is on the field. Celesteela also checks Dragonite and can slowly beat it with Leech Seed, Protect, and Heavy Slam. If Dragonite lacks or has already used Supersonic Skystrike, Mega Scizor can eat two Earthquakes from +1 Dragonite and force it out with Swords Dance and Bullet Punch. If lacking Earthquake, Magearna and Jirachi obstruct Dragonite, with Magearna able to knock it out with Fleur Cannon and Ice Beam and Jirachi able to seal it with its infamous paraflinching coming from the combination of Body Slam and Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Mega Tyranitar is not only able to take both Devastating Drake and Earthquake from +1 Dragonite but will also break Dragonite's Multiscale thanks to its ability Sand Stream, meaning it OHKOes Dragonite with Stone Edge. Mega Diancie outspeeds Dragonite and threatens it with both Diamond Storm and Moonblast. Dragonite should also watch out for Pokemon running Stone Edge as coverage, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Without Supersonic Skystrike, Clefable can confidently stay in on Dragonite and force it out with Moonblast and Thunder Wave. Similarly, Tapu Fini has enough bulk to take Dragonite's attacks and pressure it with Moonblast and a potential burn from Scald. Finally, Tapu Koko outspeeds Dragonite and threatens it with Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile outspeeds Dragonite and OHKOes it even through Multiscale with Icicle Crash. Kyurem-B also outspeeds it and, thanks to Teravolt, ignores Multiscale, threatening an OHKO with both Subzero Slammer and Ice Beam. Moves such as Ice Beam and Hidden Power Ice are common coverage moves used by many Pokemon such as Protean Greninja, Mega Latias, and Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Without Devastating Drake, Zapdos and Rotom-W wall Dragonite, with Zapdos threatening it back with a potential paralysis from Discharge and Hidden Power Ice and Rotom-W being able to cripple Dragonite with Will-O-Wisp. Pivot variants of Thundurus-T are noteworthy with their faster Speed and access to Taunt to deny Dragonite's Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: While none of them are able to switch in on Dragonite, especially after a Dragon Dance, Dragonite should keep an eye on faster offensive threats such as Kommo-o, which forces it out with Clangorous Soulblaze. Garchomp is even more threatening, since it can cleanly OHKO Dragonite even through Multiscale with Devastating Drake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Even after a Dragon Dance, Mega Alakazam is still faster, copies Multiscale thanks to Trace, and pressures Dragonite with Psychic and Hidden Power Ice. Choice Scarf users such as Protean Greninja and Landorus-T also outspeed and force it out with Ice Beam and Stone Edge, respectively. Moreover, Landorus-T is even more troublesome due to having Intimidate to reduce Dragon Dance's Attack boosts. Weather attackers such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill outspeed Dragonite and threaten it with Ice Punch and Corkscrew Crash, respectively. Priority moves such as Fake Out, Quick Attack, and Bullet Punch—run by the likes of Mega Lopunny, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Medicham—are able to slowly knock Dragonite out. Ice Shard, being a staple on Choice Band Weavile, is by far the most dangerous priority move Dragonite can face.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: The presence of Stealth Rock is a major issue for Dragonite, as the chip damage taken will deactivate Multiscale and reduce its setup opportunities later in the game.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance lets Dragonite take advantage of the setup opportunities provided thanks to Multiscale. Supersonic Skystrike blows through neutral targets like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. Devastating Drake lures in and tears through Flying-resistant neutral targets like Zapdos and Rotom-W at the cost of having to tread carefully against Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele. Earthquake OHKOes Heatran and Tapu Koko and 2HKOes Toxapex, Mega Mawile, and Magearna. Extreme Speed picks off weakened revenge killers like Weavile and Mega Alakazam. Substitute protects Dragonite against status users like Thunder Wave Ferrothorn and Toxic Slowbro and lets it freely setup against Pokemon that cannot easily break its Substitute such as Heatran and defensive Landorus-T. Superpower gives Dragonite an option to better pressure Rotom-W and Celesteela while hitting Mega Tyranitar harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is useful for maximizing Dragonite's damage output, guaranteeing an OHKO on Clefable with +1 Supersonic Skystrike and on Slowbro with +1 Devastating Drake after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature is also possible to outspeed Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny at +1, Choice Scarf Kartana at +2, and Timid Heatran before a boost. Alternatively, Adamant variants can run 152 Speed EVs to outspeed Kartana and Mega Latias at +1, allowing them to invest more EVs into bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A fundamental part of using Dragonite is deciding right at the beginning what its optimal role for the match is. Dragonite can be a wallbreaker able to punch holes in the opposing team to help its teammates to clean, or it can be a threatening sweeper that benefits from its teammates' previous offensive efforts to clean up late-game, but it will likely be unable to perform both jobs. Once its role is decided, you should be aware of some major aspects that heavily influence its impact. Since Dragonite particularly wants to be at full health for Multiscale, managing entry hazards is important and, ideally, the field must be free of them to allow Dragonite to do its job. The best way to achieve this is to make good use of removal options like Defog and Rapid Spin and disruption like Taunt and Magic Bounce, pressure entry hazard setters, and play aggressively enough to force a fast-paced game where the opposing hazard setter doesn't get a safe opportunity. Another aspect to understand is that Dragonite is also quite dependent on its single usage of Supersonic Strike or Devastating Drake to beat its initial checks. Thus, the opponent will try to waste the Z-Move, allowing one of their defensive Pokemon to now beat Dragonite. However, this dynamic also creates opportunities to further the aggression with correct reads; setting up an additional Dragon Dance while predicting a sacrifice can put the opponent in an even more dire position, opening up Dragonite to spiral out of control. Finally, before setting up a Dragon Dance, Dragonite lacks immediate impact, and its turn of setup could be enough for the opponent to deal with it. Therefore, weakening foes beforehand, with entry hazards and offensive partners, is required to provide those essential turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite is best suited for hyper offense and offense teams thanks to the fast-paced games they set the tone for and their capability to break through opposing checks to allow Dragonite to clean up late-game. Entry hazard removal is a top priority, so it enjoys being paired with a Defogger such as Serperior or Tapu Fini. Serperior has the benefit of providing paralysis support with Glare, crippling faster threats such as Tornadus-T and Mega Latias, while Tapu Fini provides a solid answer to Dragonite's offensive checks such as Weavile and Mega Charizard X. A dedicated lead such as Excadrill, Taunt Mew, or Imprison Landorus-T is appreciated on hyper offense teams, as they can prevent opposing entry hazards and can follow up by setting their own. Finally, Dragonite loves the support of Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce. When it comes to offensive partners, Fire-type threats such as Victini and Volcarona offer additional offensive pressure on Steel- and Fairy-types, greatly helping Dragonite to wallbreak and clean. Mega Pinsir can form a Flying-type spam core alongside Dragonite that's able to overwhelm shared checks like Zapdos and Celesteela. Magearna has great synergy with Dragonite, since it provides a good check to the likes of Weavile and Mega Alakazam, and Magearna and Dragonite are able to pressure shared Steel-types checks. Certain defensive Pokemon also fit with Dragonite. Cresselia, thanks to Lunar Dance, can bring Dragonite's HP back to full, allowing it to reactivate Multiscale and have a second chance to sweep. Ferrothorn likes Dragonite's ability to check Fire-types. In return, Ferrothorn covers Dragonite's weakness to Fairy-types and supports it with Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mew's niche comes from its typing, stats, and movepool, which allow it to defensively check a few top-tier Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Gliscor and provide Stealth Rock or Defog support. It's also a terrifying sweeper, as it can easily find setup opportunities thanks to its good bulk and typing, and its wide movepool enables it to pick its own checks and counters. However, status ailments are prominent in the metagame, and Mew wants to stay away from them, as they compromise its ability to check threats such as Mega Medicham reliably if hazards are up, which may very well be possible if Mew is used as a Defogger. Furthermore, defensive Mew's rather passive nature can allow Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Alakazam to switch in freely, depending on the moves it is running.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mew can run a specially defensive set on stall teams to handle the likes of Tapu Lele and Heatran while being capable of removing Stealth Rock from Heatran and Mega Diancie. The preferred set is 80 HP / 244 SpD / 184 Spe alongside a Careful nature, as it maximizes Mew's special bulk while packing enough Speed to outrun Timid Heatran and Adamant Landorus-T.</p> <p>Knock Off is an option on Mew's defensive set to remove items such as Eviolite from Chansey and Leftovers from Heatran, but the set usually doesn't have room for it. Volt Switch and U-turn are viable options on Mew's defensive set to gain momentum on Pokemon that commonly try to switch into Mew, such as Ash-Greninja and Heatran, but they're generally hard to fit into any of its sets. A spread consisting of 240 HP / 120 Def / 148 Spe with a Timid nature can be used on Mew's defensive set to still outspeed Adamant Mega Medicham.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Ash-Greninja, Hoopa-U, and Weavile can pressure Mew with their respective Dark-type STAB attacks. Ash-Greninja and special Hoopa-U are also not bothered by Will-O-Wisp but have to be wary of the uncommon Volt Switch or U-turn. Mega Sableye counters defensive Mew by virtue of its typing and ability, Magic Bounce, which blocks Stealth Rock. Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados don't like being burned but can wall Nasty Plot Mew sets that lack Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Though rare, Ghost-types like Gengar, Blacephalon, and Mimikyu can threaten Mew with their respective STAB moves, but they still have to be wary of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Victini, Heatran, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Volcarona can easily switch into Will-O-Wisp and Ice Beam, but except the former, they do have to be wary of Nasty Plot sets, as these can easily OHKO them. Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Z-Celebrate Victini can even attempt to set up on defensive Mew.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Defensive Mew's passive nature makes it setup bait for a number of Pokemon, such as Mega Latias, Manaphy, and Reuniclus.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mew is a proficient Stealth Rock lead, due to its great bulk and movepool allowing it to consistently complete the task of setting Stealth Rock and preventing opposing entry hazards from being set by the likes of Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran with Taunt. Ice Beam is used to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, further dissuading opposing Stealth Rock and punishing the faster Garchomp. Thunder Wave is used to spread status and punish faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Greninja. It can also be used against Mega Diancie, utilizing Mew's Synchronize ability to bypass Magic Bounce, even through Substitute. Thunder Wave and Taunt synergize well with Mental Herb, allowing Mew to bypass opposing faster Taunt to paralyze the opposing lead and use Taunt on the next turn to be completely in control of the lead matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Mew to outspeed Pokemon with a base 95 Speed stat and a positive nature, such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B. The rest of the EVs are pooled into bulk, allowing Mew to survive attacks such as Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse. Mental Herb allows Mew to get a jump on opposing Taunt leads, such as Serperior and Tornadus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mew should almost always be led off with, except against Mega Sableye teams or in the uncommon scenario where the opposing lead, namely Choice Banded Weavile or Kartana, can outspeed and OHKO it. Mew's specialized moveset gives it the tools to set entry hazards, prevent opposing entry hazards, or do both against the vast majority of Pokemon. Despite the main priority of this set being to set up Stealth Rock, it can be more beneficial to use Thunder Wave against Pokemon that are especially ruined by paralysis, like Tornadus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja, the latter of which Mew survives a Choice Specs Dark Pulse from. It isn't possible for Mew to prevent Stealth Rock from faster Stealth Rock users such as Mega Diancie via Taunt, so it should opt to punish them with Thunder Wave or Ice Beam in the case of Garchomp. Slower Stealth Rock users, like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Seismitoad, can be stopped by Taunt, allowing Mew to prevent opposing entry hazards before setting its own.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set should exclusively be used on a hyper offensive team due to its lack of utility outside of the lead matchup. Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X are ideal beneficiaries of Mew's support, as they require the prevention of entry hazards due to their 4x weaknesses to Stealth Rock. A backup hazard removal option, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T or Serperior, can help in lead matchups where Mew is unable to prevent entry hazards, such as against Garchomp or Mega Diancie. Kommonium Z Kommo-o appreciates Mew's ability to spread paralysis to faster threats such as Tornadus-T and Mega Alakazam, allowing it to outspeed them and threaten them with Clangorous Soulblaze.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake can be used in this slot if hitting Heatran for a lot of damage and reliably checking BoltBeam Magearna is more desirable. Ice Beam can be used to hit Ground-types that are 4x weak to it, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor. It can also be used in Will-O-Wisp's or even Defog and Stealth Rock's moveslot if Mew's team really needs a way to deal sufficient damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, especially if Mew's team already has a Stealth Rock setter and Defogger. Psychic can also be used if Mew's team doesn't need it to check the aforementioned Pokemon and would instead like it to be able to efficiently check Hawlucha. Will-O-Wisp allows Mew to cripple physical attackers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Kyurem-B and is useful to chip down Magearna, as it lacks reliable recovery. Soft-Boiled allows Mew to stay healthy and lets it switch into physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny multiple times throughout the match. Stealth Rock is used if the team already has a Defogger and instead lacks a Stealth Rock setter. Defog is also a decent option on Mew, as Mew's sustainability lets it reliably remove hazards throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs and nature let Mew outspeed Pokemon up to base 95 Speed with a positive nature such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Landorus-T. 240 HP EVs are run instead of 252 HP EVs to maximize Leftovers recovery and physical bulk. If opting to run Ice Beam over Earthquake, a Timid nature should be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Mew to switch into physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny, and try to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Consistently use Soft-Boiled to keep Mew healthy, as it will fail to switch into the Pokemon it is supposed to check if it's not near full health. For similar reasons, you should try to avoid getting Mew afflicted with burn or poison, as this will cripple its longevity and ability to check Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny. Look for opportunities to remove or set entry hazards on passive Pokemon that Mew can force out, such as Zapdos and Hippowdon. Try to be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as they can easily trap Mew and sufficiently weaken it, which makes it significantly harder to get Mew back on the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew tends to give free switches to Dark- and Ghost-types such as Ash-Greninja and Blacephalon so having switch-ins to these Pokemon, such as Tapu Bulu, Tyranitar, and Toxapex, is mandatory. Heatran switch-ins such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Gastrodon are also very good to run with Mew, especially if it is not running Earthquake. A Defogger such as Tapu Koko or Tornadus-T is very useful if Mew is not running Defog, as you don't want to frequently switch Mew into Spikes or Toxic Spikes, as this deters its ability to check Mega Medicham and Garchomp. Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Celesteela are also useful teammates, as they can switch into Tapu Lele. They also appreciate Mew's ability to switch into Mega Medicham and Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot lets Mew efficiently wallbreak and potentially sweep. Psychic coupled with Mewnium Z turns into Genesis Supernova, which can OHKO offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock damage if Mew has set up a Nasty Plot and is running a Modest nature. Genesis Supernova also sets up Psychic Terrain, which is especially useful for boosting the power of Mew's Psychic and protects it from priority attacks like Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch. Fire Blast hits bulky Steel-types such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela for a good amount of damage; it can OHKO the latter two Pokemon after a Nasty Plot. Aura Sphere can also be used in this slot if hitting Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Greninja, and Mega Gyarados is preferred. It also maintains the ability to hit Steel-types but only actually hits Heatran and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, and the drop in power against them is also noticeable. Earth Power can be used to hit Tyranitar and Steel-types for super effective damage, but it should be noted that once again most Steel-types only take neutral damage from it due to their secondary typing and it's too weak to OHKO Tyranitar even after a Nasty Plot. Rock Polish effectively lets Mew sweep late-game; however, this option is generally preferred with a Modest nature and is best used on hyper offensive archetypes. Soft-Boiled can be used instead to secure more setup opportunities, but this option is generally preferred with a Timid nature and generally fits better on other archetypes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is preferred with Rock Polish, as Mew will not need the Speed from a Timid nature if it's already set up a boost. A Timid nature is generally better with Soft-Boiled, as it is important to be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Jolly Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When facing offensive teams, Mew will often want to use Rock Polish to outspeed faster Pokemon, and when facing defensively oriented teams, it will want to set up a Nasty Plot to break through walls. Try to weaken the opposing team with other Pokemon such as Magearna and Mega Charizard X first before attempting to sweep with Mew; however, Mew can also be used to weaken the opposing team for the aforementioned Pokemon to sweep. Use Genesis Supernova after a Nasty Plot to heavily damage or KO Pokemon such as Heatran. Use Soft-Boiled against Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Landorus-T to stay healthy and have multiple shots at sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew fits the best on typical dual screens hyper offense teams if it is running Rock Polish, where it appreciates the presence of leads such as Landorus-T and Greninja that can guarantee entry hazards being set up so Mew can nab KOs. Other sweepers that can pave the way for Mew to sweep such as Magearna and Mega Charizard X are also appreciated, as they can heavily dent the opposing team. Mega Gyarados is also notable for its ability to deal with Mega Latias, a Pokemon that uses Mew as setup bait. Mew can also fit on bulky offensive builds if it is running Soft-Boiled. Here, too, it appreciates hazards on the opposing field, specifically Spikes and Stealth Rock, as they can wear down whatever is going to switch into Mew; Ferrothorn, Greninja, Clefable, and Heatran can reliably set them up. Tyranitar can trap and remove Mega Latias, which may use Mew as setup bait. It also discourages Choice-locked Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja from using their Dark-type STAB move.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is a niche option on hyper offense and rain teams due to the combined potency of Belly Drum and Huge Power, granting it a monstrous Attack stat after it boosts up. At +6, Azumarill obliterates Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Toxapex with its coverage moves, which can be essential on rain teams due to these three walls specifically being annoying to break. Azumarill's typing also makes it a usable offensive check against Ash-Greninja, which is also appreciated by offensive teams that often contain a lack of reliable defensive answers to top wallbreakers. However, Azumarill's major lack of Speed forces it to rely on priority Aqua Jet. This leaves it shut down by Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain and by various faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Rotom-W that can take a hit and retaliate. Additionally, Azumarill usually only gets one opportunity to set up Belly Drum, which forces it to be preserved for late-game to sweep once its checks have been chipped down enough or removed. However, Z-Belly Drum can offer Azumarill a second opportunity of setting up in some rare instances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sitrus Berry can be used over Normalium Z if there is already another Pokemon wielding a Z-Move. However, this item is a massive downgrade from Normalium Z and prevents Azumarill from checking Ash-Greninja and Heatran, as it cannot freely check the opposing team as much without the Z-Move to heal itself up afterwards. A trapping set consisting of Whirlpool, Perish Song, Protect, and Toxic with Sap Sipper as the ability allows Azumarill to defensively check Kartana while also trapping and removing Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex, but this set mainly relies on surprise factor to catch the opponent off guard and is terribly easy to play around once the opponent knows what the set is. A Choice Band grants Azumarill immediate power, but Azumarill would be widely outclassed by other offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert. Its STAB moves are also pretty ineffective once it's locked into a move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain prevents Azumarill from outprioritizing anything that outspeeds it with Aqua Jet. This leaves it massively vulnerable under the effects of the terrain, and Tapu Lele can revenge kill it smoothly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Azumarill's pitiful Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the metagame. Magearna, Rotom-W, and Kyurem-B all outpace Azumarill and can finish it off with their coverage. The latter two also resist Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur all outspeed Azumarill and knock it out with their main attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aqua Jet gives Azumarill priority and allows it to bypass Pokemon that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it before boosts, such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Mega Medicham. Play Rough is Azumarill's main attack to remove Tapu Fini, Clefable, Mega Heracross, Mega Sableye, and physically defensive Tangrowth with little effort. Knock Off breaks straight through and OHKOes Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Tangrowth smoothly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z gives Azumarill access to Z-Belly Drum, which restores its health back up to full before it cuts its health in half and gives it easier setup opportunities. This is the preferred item, as it allows Azumarill to use its decent defensive typing to check Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Realistically, Belly Drum can only be set up once in a match, so Azumarill should only set up late-game once its checks have been chipped or removed. Azumarill should not accumulate too much chip damage, as it lessens its opportunities to set up Belly Drum because its low Speed stat usually makes Azumarill take damage before it can set up. Azumarill should be brought in through a pivot or revenge kill before sweeping to prevent it from taking any major damage. Azumarill can also revenge kill Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Excadrill itself, and it can check Ash-Greninja before sweeping due to Z-Belly Drum restoring its health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pelipper provides rain, which allows a +6 Aqua Jet to hit even harder. Ash-Greninja can use Azumarill to remove its biggest annoyances in Toxapex and Tangrowth to let it freely rain terror on the opponent's team. Mega Swampert also has issues with Grass-type walls like Ferrothorn and physically defensive Tangrowth, and Azumarill can break through these Pokemon for it. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Greninja set down Stealth Rock or Spikes for Azumarill to score chip damage on Azumarill's checks. Excadrill can also break through Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker. Magearna and Tornadus-T are able to bring Azumarill onto the field while protecting it from any possible damage from the opponent. Tapu Koko provides dual screens for Azumarill to let it set up Belly Drum a lot safer and can pivot Azumarill in safely.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>With its decent physical bulk when invested, an amazing ability in Unaware, and access to reliable recovery, Quagsire can help stop some of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier that could otherwise threaten stall. Its physical bulk also allows it to naturally handle even more threats such as Tyranitar, Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T. Furthermore, it has a useful defensive typing that can help it take on threats, namely most Electric-types lacking Grass-type coverage such as Mega Manectric and non-Grass Knot Tapu Koko. However, Quagsire has very poor special bulk and is therefore left completely vulnerable to almost every somewhat threatening special attacker in the tier such as Tapu Lele, both Greninja formes, and Keldeo. Also, its general passivity and predictability force it to rely on equally passive teammates that can support and benefit from it. While it boasts good physical bulk, relatively powerful physical attackers can simply break through Quagsire. Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hoopa-U all possess the immediate power to 2HKO Quagsire though its defenses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Waterfall alongside Curse sounds like a good idea at first, but lacking any means of statusing Pokemon that can easily come in on Quagsire makes them more difficult to beat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Moves</strong>: Because Quagsire has a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves, it is easily OHKOed by basically any Pokemon with the appropriate move. Tangrowth and Amoonguss both completely wall and threaten to OHKO Quagsire and, even if statused, are hard to wear down due to their Regenerator abilities. The opponent often loses nothing by simply threatening Quagsire and double switching out, putting your team behind in momentum. Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu all greatly threaten Quagsire, though it can wear all of them down with burns or poison should they choose to switch in. Serperior and Tapu Bulu in particular pose as potentially dangerous stallbreakers if left unchecked and free to set up. Lures such as Bloom Doom Heatran and Grass Knot Tapu Koko can also catch Quagsire off guard and OHKO it; scouting for such moves is key to not letting Quagsire be unnecessarily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Almost every special attacker in the tier threatens to 2HKO Quagsire due to its poor special bulk. Most non-Electric-types such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, Keldeo, and Hoopa-U are able to do huge amounts of damage to Quagsire despite not necessarily having super effective coverage moves to hit it with. Quagsire is also unable to status or damage these threats in a one-on-one situation due to its very low Speed tier and is nearly always forced out by them.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Very strong physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Pinsir, Mega Mawile, and Hoopa-U can easily 2HKO Quagsire despite its physical bulk and is thus not able to check these threats.</p>",

      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While weak, Scald has a useful 30% burn chance, which helps to wear down checks and further wall physical attackers. Earthquake is used for a decently powerful and consistent STAB move. Toxic lets Quagsire outlast both Pokemon it is supposed to be checking and Pokemon that check it. Toxic is particularly important for beating Roost Mega Charizard X and is helpful for beating and wearing down Landorus-T. Other Pokemon that threaten Quagsire such as Tangrowth can be poisoned upon switching in, which helps beat them in the long term. Recover is crucial and is what allows Quagsire to stay healthy and consistently wall and check what it needs to. Curse can be used over Toxic, as it helps Quagsire take on a select few physical attackers that it could potentially struggle with such as Alolan Marowak and Earth Plate Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A straightforward EV spread of maximum HP and Defense investment with a Relaxed nature allows Quagsire to properly wall the physical attackers it needs to while retaining what power Scald has, as Quagsire's Speed is negligible anyways. Unaware is the only viable ability on Quagsire, as it is what allows Quagsire to wall most physical setup sweepers. Leftovers further helps with longevity and allows Quagsire to avoid important 2HKOs from Pokemon such as Adamant Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keeping Quagsire healthy with Recover or Wish passing is the most important aspect of using Quagsire. Allowing it to get weakened, get statused, have its item removed, or switch into more than one layer of entry hazards will severely hinder its ability to check threats such as Adamant Landorus-T. Generally, bring Quagsire in on something it walls and use Scald or Toxic to cripple or weaken the foe or potential switch-ins. Be cautious of double switches, as Quagsire alone cannot retaliate against powerful wallbreakers if caught off guard. Quagsire's passivity and predictability make it relatively easy to play around, so pay attention to how your opponent reacts to Quagsire and the rest of the team early-game. Be cautious of Z-Moves, which can either take Quagsire out or weaken it enough for other sweepers on the opponent's team. Proactively using Recover on common Z-Move users potentially wastes the opponent's Z-Move early. Use Curse to more reliably beat Pokemon such as offensive Z-Move Landorus-T and check Magic Guard Clefable and Swords Dance Alolan Marowak, which are very large nuisances to the passive teams on which Quagsire is found. Simply use Curse when Quagsire is healthy enough to take a subsequent attack after it has boosted, then recover off any damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey is a very good teammate for Quagsire, as it walls every special attacker in the tier bar some Tapu Lele variants, Choice Specs Hoopa-U, and other special setup sweepers with access to Psyshock. Additionally, with access to Natural Cure and Heal Bell, Chansey can act as a status absorber for Quagsire. Skarmory keeps entry hazards off the field for Quagsire, can take Grass-type attacks directed at Quagsire, and further walls physical attackers in general. It notably takes on Mega Pinsir and Tapu Bulu, which Quagsire alone cannot handle. Mega Sableye bounces back hazards and generally annoys the opposing team by crippling it with Will-O-Wisp and removing items. Tangrowth holding an Assault Vest can stomach many attacks in general and checks potential stallbreakers such as Serperior and certain Tapu Bulu sets. Tangrowth also serves as a countermeasure to situational lures such as Grass Knot Tapu Koko and shrugs off damage it takes with Regenerator.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor possesses an outstanding defensive typing in Bug / Steel, great defensive stats, and Roost to keep itself healthy, which let it handle titans like Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Weavile, and Mega Alakazam. Mega Scizor holds excellent utility thanks to its access to moves like Bullet Punch and Knock Off. Access to a STAB priority move in Bullet Punch, which is also boosted by Technician, lets Mega Scizor threaten a variety of Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie. Mega Scizor also has access to Swords Dance, which can let it sweep or clean up late-game. Although Mega Scizor may be capable of beating Kartana and Tapu Bulu on their own, they're often paired with Magnezone, which can trap and remove Mega Scizor from the match if not played around cautiously. While Mega Scizor's typing is very strong defensively, it also comes with a downside: it is very susceptible to the decently common Fire-types, and Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie, often run Fire-type coverage to beat it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse boosts Mega Scizor's Defense alongside its Attack, which can be useful against certain Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Gliscor. Pursuit can let Mega Scizor trap Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios, as well as Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Hoopa-U, but there's very little reason to use Pursuit outside of that. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for 4x super effective damage because this Mega Scizor set is very weak. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can be used against Kartana and opposing Mega Scizor. You can try to outspeed opposing Mega Scizor with this set to potentially 2HKO it before it can recover back its health with Roost. Toxic may be used on Mega Scizor's utility set to cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Landorus-T, but Mega Scizor usually lacks the moveslot to fit it in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex is by far the best switch-in to Mega Scizor due to its typing, bulk, and access to Haze. Rotom-W can switch into Mega Scizor, as it fears very little from it and can burn it, however it is prone to getting worn down overtime. Other Water-types such as Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados can put Mega Scizor in unfavorable positions. Gyarados can easily take any of Mega Scizor's attacks and use it as bait to set up with Dragon Dance, though Mega Gyarados has to be wary of Curse and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can easily trap and eliminate non-U-turn Mega Scizor thanks to Magnet Pull. Thanks to Magnezone's typing, Bullet Punch also won't do much damage to it. Non-Choice Scarf variants should, however, be wary of faster Mega Scizor with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Coverage</strong>: Using Heatran is one of the best ways to beat Mega Scizor, courtesy of its typing and bulk, but it should watch out for Superpower. Volcarona and both Mega Charizard are also good switch-ins, as they can OHKO Mega Scizor with their respective STAB moves. Mega Charizard X and Volcarona can also use Mega Scizor as setup bait. Magearna, Mega Latias, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie—Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check—often run Fire-type coverage moves to defeat it. Tapu Lele deserves a special mention, as it not only occasionally runs Fire-type coverage but also cancels out Bullet Punch by setting up Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela and Skarmory fear very little from Mega Scizor, except for Knock Off. Celesteela can easily beat Mega Scizor with Flamethrower, while Skarmory takes very little damage from anything Mega Scizor might want to attack it with and can phaze it with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Thundurus-T resist Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and can retaliate with Heat Wave or a boosted All-Out Pummeling. However, Thundurus-T is prone to being worn down and Zapdos does not want to get hit by Knock Off, making them inconsistent switch-ins</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T can pressure Mega Scizor due to its rather lacking Special Defense stat. Tapu Koko can deal heavy damage to Mega Scizor with STAB Thunderbolt and can even OHKO it with a special Gigavolt Havoc. Tornadus-T can deal heavy amounts of damage with Supersonic Skystrike to Mega Scizor, and even Hurricane 2HKOes it after Stealth Rock damage. It should, however, be noted that they are prone to getting overwhelmed by Swords Dance Mega Scizor due to their lack of bulk and resistance.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's main STAB move and lets it hit Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie for super effective damage. It's also boosted by Technician and is a priority move, which makes up for Mega Scizor's lack of Speed. Roost lets Mega Scizor stay healthy throughout the match, allowing it to switch in multiple times. Knock Off lets Mega Scizor remove items from, and potentially break past, defensive stops to it such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Superpower, on the other hand, throttles would-be-checks such as Magnezone and Heatran. Lastly, U-turn may be used to generate momentum for Mega Scizor's team but doesn't hit many notable foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP, 16 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature allows Mega Scizor to avoid getting 2HKOed by Sacred Sword from Choice Band Kartana after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to more comfortable take on Magearna, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. Do note that Superpower variants should run 136 Speed EVs to outrun Modest Magnezone, though the lack of Special Defense investment will make it harder for Mega Scizor to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Scizor should immediately Mega Evolve, so forgoing Technician is completely fine because Light Metal has its situational use against Trace users like Mega Alakazam and the rare Low Kick Weavile and Greninja.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Scizor should aim to weaken the opposing team before sweeping by forcing switches and using Knock Off or U-turn. It should be used to pivot into threats like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu. Don't use Swords Dance purely to sweep, as Mega Scizor can also be used to defeat Pokemon like Magearna and Ferrothorn. Mega Scizor can lay pressure on the opponent's team by using Swords Dance to force a switch so that it can freely use Knock Off or U-turn to weaken the team. Always scout for Fire-type coverage on Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie. If the opponent has Magnezone, Mega Scizor should be wary of using Swords Dance and should instead always use U-turn or double switch out. You should also be cautious when knocking out Pokemon, as this can give Magnezone a free switch in and will result in a knocked out Mega Scizor. Superpower variants should, instead, scout the Magnezone set and be careful around Choice Scarf variants. The team's matchup against Kartana can usually help telling the Magnezone set, though, because teams that are weak to Kartana are inclined to run Choice Scarf Magnezone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp can pressure Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-types like Heatran, Celesteela, and Zapdos, all of which Mega Scizor tends to struggle against. Mega Scizor can heavily pressure Fairy-, Ice-, and Grass-types for Garchomp in return. It's also capable of getting Garchomp a free switch in with U-turn. Toxapex and Gastrodon can take on Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types for Mega Scizor. Gastrodon also takes on a majority of Electric-types very well. In return, Mega Scizor lays pressure on Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Kartana, which can try to take advantage of Toxapex and Gastrodon. Heatran is an excellent teammate because it has an immunity to Fire and appreciates Mega Scizor's ability to take on Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T. Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos are great because Mega Scizor may experience trouble checking Landorus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu if entry hazards are on the field. In contrast, Mega Scizor appreciates entry hazards on the opposing side of the field to consistently wear down switch-ins such as Toxapex and Heatran, allowing it to sweep more easily. Entry hazard setters such as Clefable, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Greninja are notable partners.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Heracross is one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier, being able to dismantle defensive teams with Swords Dance along with its high Attack stat. Having a unique defensive typing along with respectable bulk allows Mega Heracross to check many top-tier offensive threats such as Swords Dance Tapu Bulu and Gliscor as well as act as a solid Dark-type resist to pivot in against the likes of Choice-locked Weavile and Tyranitar. On the other hand, Mega Heracross's typing also leaves it weak to common types in Fairy, Flying, and Fire, and both of its STAB moves share common resistances, oftentimes being redundant in terms of coverage. In addition to its common weaknesses, Mega Heracross's poor Speed tier makes it easy to revenge kill for Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T. Due to its tendency to fall against faster offensive threats, Mega Heracross tends to struggle against highly offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Heracross can also utilize an all-out attacking set with Earthquake over Swords Dance to threaten bulkier teams without having to set up, but it fails to break through many of its normal checks, mainly Clefable, and it's very reliant on prediction to be successful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Hawlucha resist Mega Heracross's STAB moves and threaten to OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks, but they have to be wary of switching into a potential Rock Blast. Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T is especially troublesome due to its neutrality to Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Attacks</strong>: Offensive Psychic-types such as Mega Latios, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam all switch into Mega Heracross's Close Combat with varying degrees of ease and threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks, but they all have to be careful switching into Mega Heracross, as they must avoid Pin Missile. Additionally, Pokemon that carry Psychic-type attacks, such as Psychium Z Greninja, can catch Mega Heracross off guard and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Volcarona threaten to OHKO Mega Heracross with their STAB attacks as well, but they oftentimes cannot pivot directly into Mega Heracross due to being OHKOed by Close Combat or Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Offensive Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele can threaten to OHKO Mega Heracross. However, Unaware Clefable is arguably the best Mega Heracross counter in the tier, being able to switch into it and avoid being 2HKOed by any attack, though it has to be wary of being whittled down by entry hazards and the rare Grassy Terrain-boosted Bullet Seed. Magic Guard Clefable is similarly annoying, being difficult to whittle down and taking any attack from full at +2 besides Bullet Seed in Grassy Terrain.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Blast is an excellent coverage move that becomes an effective 125-Base Power Rock-type attack with Skill Link that allows Mega Heracross to take on Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Toxapex, Clefable, and Tornadus-T. The last slot is a toss-up based on a combination of team structure and personal preference. The most common option is Pin Missile for its ability to pressure bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to allow Mega Heracross to more freely set up against Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss as well as easing prediction against more offensive teams. Mega Heracross can also opt to go for Bullet Seed when paired with Tapu Bulu to have a pseudo-STAB move that can 2HKO many would-be checks, such as Clefable and defensive Flyinium Z Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred, because regular Heracross still outspeeds Modest Heatran with it, and the added power is extremely important against the likes of Toxapex and Unaware Clefable. Moxie allows Mega Heracross to gain boosts upon KOing Pokemon such as Heatran and Tyranitar prior to Mega Evolution so that it can garner some boosts early on without having to set up. On the other hand, Guts can be used over Moxie to allow Heracross to fare better against bulkier teams that rely on status conditions, such as burn, to cripple wallbreakers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Mega Heracross into Pokemon that don't pose a threat to it, such as Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and Chansey, early-game so that it can break the opposing team. If running Jolly Heracross, consider not Mega Evolving it prior to KOing Pokemon base-forme Heracross outspeeds that Mega Heracross cannot such as Heatran. Attempt to chip checks such as Clefable and Toxapex into range of Rock Blast by pressuring them with Pokemon that share them as mutual checks such as Garchomp and Greninja respectively. Avoid using Swords Dance against slower Pokemon that threaten to KO Mega Heracross, such as Z-Move Reuniclus and Magearna, early on, seeing as Mega Heracross's absurd Attack stat means that it will likely put a dent into whatever switches into it anyway.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seeing that Mega Heracross is a wallbreaker, it appreciates pivots such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna that can bring it in and allow it to break down the opposing team without taking unnecessary damage. Additionally, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Greninja and Ferrothorn is very useful due to the sheer number of switches that Mega Heracross forces, resulting in damage building up on opposing teams if entry hazards are up. Clefable in particular is a useful teammate because it can provide Wish support to Mega Heracross, allowing it to consistently check Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Gliscor while also functioning as a durable wallbreaker that can rip through an opposing team on top of being able to wear down the opposing team with Stealth Rock. Late-game cleaners such as Shift Gear Magearna appreciate Mega Heracross's ability to punch holes in teams and make it much easier to set up and sweep late-game. If Mega Heracross is using Bullet Seed, Tapu Bulu is an important teammate due to Grassy Terrain giving Bullet Seed a sizable boost, allowing it to 2HKO Clefable and hit a slew of other targets. Should Mega Heracross choose to forego Pin Missile in favor of other coverage or Substitute, Pursuit trapping from the likes of Weavile or Tyranitar is appreciated, as they can KO threats such as Mega Latios that would otherwise wall it. Mega Heracross's inability to check Heatran from the Mega Slot position oftentimes leaves its teams liable to Heatran, so teammates such as Gliscor that can check Heatran are invaluable assets when constructing a Mega Heracross team. Finally, Pokemon that resist Flying such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos function well alongside Mega Heracross to cover up for its defensive weaknesses. Tapu Koko in particular is an effective teammate because it also functions as a pivot that allows Mega Heracross to break opposing teams.</p>"

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine is a great special wall in OU and is capable of walling a significant portion of the metagame. Because of its typing, it's able to be one of the best answers to Volcarona in the tier while also being able to switch into threats such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. Mantine is also a good Defogger, being able to deter Pokemon such as Bisharp and Landorus-T from switching in to take advantage of it with a Scald burn. However, Mantine is very passive and can drain momentum from your team, and its weakness to Stealth Rock is suboptimal for a defensive Pokemon. The prevalence of Electric-types such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko also hinders Mantine, as it can't do much against them. Finally, it has relatively low Defense, even when invested, so Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Landorus-T can easily do massive damage to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mantine has no other viable options in the OU tier, as it cannot properly perform its role without the moves or defensive investment on the listed set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko and Magnezone can all easily take a Scald and threaten Mantine out with a STAB Thunderbolt. Magearna and Rotom-W can also do massive damage to Mantine with Volt Switch. Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile can both OHKO Mantine with Thunder Punch; however, they must be wary of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock chips a quarter of Mantine's health away each time it switches in, making it more difficult for Mantine to switch into attacks. Similarly, Toxic from Pokemon such as Heatran can wear Mantine down quickly, making it less effective as a wall.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Heatran and Tornadus-T prevent Mantine from healing, removing entry hazards, or spreading poison.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Although none of them want to take a Scald, Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T can all OHKO Mantine with their respective Rock-type move.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard X can easily 2HKO Mantine with their strong STAB attacks. Z-Moves such as Supersonic Skystrike from Landorus-T and Gyarados can also do massive damage to Mantine.</p>",

      "Mixed Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is mandatory, as it allows Mantine to repeatedly come in on Pokemon it is supposed to counter such as Greninja and Volcarona. Scald gives Mantine a little offensive presence and prevents it from being Taunt bait while also having a 30% chance to burn. Defog is a great option on Mantine as it clears hazards for Mantine's teammates while also removing Stealth Rock to help Mantine switch in. Toxic allows Mantine to cripple Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Latios, and Tangrowth on the switch and deal damage to Pokemon such as Keldeo. Finally, Haze gets rid of boosts from setup sweepers such as non-Thunderbolt Magearna, Volcarona, and Manaphy and prevents them from taking advantage of Mantine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Mantine's overall bulk. The given Special Defense investment allows Mantine to take two Dark Pulses from Ash-Greninja if Stealth Rock is up, survive two Shadow Balls from Choice Specs Blacephalon, and avoid the 2HKO from Pelipper's Choice Specs Hurricane. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense to take on physical threats such as Mega Scizor more efficiently. Leftovers gives Mantine passive recovery, allowing it to sponge hits better. Water Absorb is the best ability, as it gives Mantine an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to pivot into Scalds without fearing a burn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mantine should be used as a defensive pivot to switch into Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Scizor. Prioritize keeping Mantine healthy with Roost, as it tends to get worn down a lot between Stealth Rock damage and taking hits. Be careful of Hidden Power Electric from Pokemon that might carry it such as Greninja and Keldeo. Use Haze on Pokemon that are able to set up on Mantine such as Manaphy and Volcarona. If Defog is being run, try to use it on Pokemon Mantine can force out such as Keldeo. Try not to let Mantine get badly poisoned by Toxic, as it severely limits its ability to take hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mantine fits best on bulkier teams that need a switch-in for threats such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Mega Latios. Thus, other bulky Pokemon make good teammates. Ferrothorn is a very good defensive partner for Mantine, as it can switch into Electric- and Rock-type moves aimed at Mantine, while Mantine can switch into Fighting- and Fire-type moves for Ferrothorn. Other Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also good for switching into Electric-types such as Tapu Koko. Heatran is also a good defensive partner for Mantine, as it appreciates Mantine's ability to switch into Ground-types, while Heatran can force out bulky Grass-types that Mantine can't touch. If Defog isn't being run on Mantine, another entry hazard remover such as Landorus-T or Tornadus-T is recommended, as Stealth Rock severely hampers Mantine's longevity.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a high Defense stat and great defensive typing, Skarmory is a good check to several physical attackers including Garchomp, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor due to its access to Whirlwind and Toxic. Skarmory also has access to Spikes, which it can set up mutiple times throughout a battle. For these reasons, Skarmory is a decent pick on stall and balance teams. However, Skarmory's low HP and Special Defense stats mean it struggles to take even resisted hits from special attackers like Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam, leaving it outclassed by Celesteela in this regard. Skarmory is also very passive, relying on Toxic to deal damage unless it is running Counter or Brave Bird. This leaves it completely useless against Taunt users like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Despite its high Defense stat, physical attackers such as Swords Dance Kartana and Garchomp can potentially overwhelm Skarmory with Z-Moves if they have already set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Defog can be used if Skarmory's team needs a form of hazard removal.

Poor matchups against other hazard setters like Heatran and Greninja also make it an unreliable Defogger. Iron Defense can be used alongside 96 Speed EVs in order to outspeed and beat Swords Dance Mega Mawile one-on-one while also easing prediction against the likes of Swords Dance Garchomp. However, it has no other use and is hard to fit onto Skarmory's set. Stealth Rock is an alternative if Skarmory's team is lacking it. However, one of the main reasons for using Skarmory is for its access to Spikes, and there are also better Stealth Rock setters that can fit on stall and balance teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zapdos all force out Skarmory with their super effective STAB attacks. They can also use Defog to remove Spikes that Skarmory sets. Magnezone is especially problematic, as it can trap Skarmory if it isn't holding a Shed Shell.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X can all take advantage of Skarmory. The former can set up Stealth Rock or throw out a powerful Magma Storm, while the latter two can use it as setup fodder. However, Volcarona must be wary when setting up against variants with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Greninja, Magearna, Kyurem, and Hydreigon have little trouble getting past Skarmory due to its low special bulk. Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele also overwhelm Skarmory with very strong STAB attacks or neutral coverage moves like Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini can shut down Skarmory with Taunt, leaving it unable to set up Spikes, use Roost to stay healthy, or use Whirlwind to phaze them.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is used to wear down the opposing team, especially in combination with Whirlwind. This is useful on the stall and balance teams that Skarmory is found on. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze setup sweepers like Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor. Similarly, this move can prevent Substitute users like Serperior and Kyurem or bulky Calm Mind users like Mega Latias and Reuniclus from using Skarmory as setup fodder. Toxic is used to cripple Pokemon, especially setup sweepers like Tapu Bulu and Garchomp, wearing them down and easing Skarmory's matchup against them. It also punishes Defog users such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Zapdos that switch in to remove Skarmory's Spikes. Counter can be used to handle physical attackers that Skarmory checks such as Kartana and Mega Tyranitar. However, it's somewhat unreliable, especially against Pokemon with setup moves, so it struggles to fit onto Skarmory's moveset. Brave Bird deals immediate damage to foes without having to rely on Toxic or Counter, although it's hard to justify over Skarmory's other moves. It hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth for decent damage, and OHKOes Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Mega Heracross that are usually troublesome for defensive teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skarmory's HP and Defense stats are maximized, as it has little hope of dealing with special attackers regardless. The investment is needed to take boosted Z-Moves like Continental Crush from Garchomp and All-Out Pummeling from Kartana. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves from Pokemon such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor, as well as U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Jirachi. Shed Shell can be used to prevent Magnezone from trapping Skarmory. Sturdy allows Skarmory to take one hit from full HP in order to use Whirlwind or Counter against a foe in a pinch. An Impish nature should be used alongside Brave Bird to avoid weakening it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory can be switched into physical attackers that it checks, and its health should be maintained by using Roost often so that it can take attacks like Sacred Sword from Choice Band Kartana and +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp. However, Skarmory must be wary of very powerful attacks, as well as super effective coverage moves. A +2 All-Out Pummeling from Kartana and Fire Punch from Mega Tyranitar will OHKO and 2HKO Skarmory, respectively, unless Skarmory is kept near full health. Skarmory must also be careful when switching into Garchomp before its set is revealed, as it could turn out to be a Mega Garchomp with Fire Blast. Avoid switching Skarmory into special attackers, as even resisted attacks like Psychic from Tapu Lele as well as neutral attacks like Ice Beam from Mega Latias will overwhelm it. Spikes is best used against Pokemon that can't deal much damage to Skarmory such as Mega Scizor and Gliscor, as well as Choice-locked Kartana and Landorus-T. If Skarmory is lacking a Shed Shell, it should be wary of using Spikes or Toxic if the opponent has a Magnezone and should instead double switch or use Whirlwind. If Stealth Rock is off the field and Skarmory is at full HP, it can utilize Sturdy along with Whirlwind or Counter to act as an emergency check to Pokemon such as +2 Mega Mawile or Mega Heracross, which could otherwise OHKO it with Thunder Punch and Close Combat, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory fits best on stall and balance teams that appreciate a blanket check to physical attackers and Spikes support. Chansey is one of the best partners that fits on stall; it acts as a blanket check to special attackers that Skarmory can't deal with such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Alakazam. It can also set up Stealth Rock, forming an entry hazard stacking core with Skarmory to wear down the opposing team. Pokemon with Unaware like Clefable and Quagsire help against setup sweepers that Skarmory can't deal with. The former takes on Mega Heracross and Serperior, while the latter can deal with Mega Charizard X and stop Electric-types. Gliscor and Hippowdon are Stealth Rock setters that pair well with Skarmory. The former checks Heatran, while the latter deals with physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Mega Charizard X that Skarmory fails to check. Both of these also prevent Electric-types from spamming Volt Switch. Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types, such as Mega Latias, Gliscor, and Toxapex, help against Heatran and Volcarona, which switch into Skarmory for free. Bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can reliably check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Rotom-W. Gastrodon is an interesting partner that completely stops these Electric-types while also dealing with other special attackers like Heatran and Ash-Greninja.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's decent Speed stat in combination with Swift Swim allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as most Choice Scarf users, when in the rain. This combined with a decent Special Attack stat makes it a top Swift Swim user in the metagame. Kingdra's access to a powerful secondary STAB move in Draco Meteor is a blessing, giving it the means to pressure or KO Pokemon that annoy rain teams such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Latias. Kingdra's Dragon / Water typing is also useful for checking Ash-Greninja as it is a rain attacker that isn't prone to Water Shuriken. Unfortunately, bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Tangrowth are some of the most common defensive Pokemon in OU, meaning that Kingdra will have trouble sweeping most teams. Kingdra is also heavily dependent on rain in order to be effective, as it is relatively weak and slow for an offensive Pokemon outside of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple common switch-ins to Kingdra such as Tangrowth, Mantine, Gastrodon, and Alomomola. Kingdra can opt to run Hidden Power Electric to hit Mantine.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth all resist Kingdra's main STAB move, avoiding the 2HKO from rain-boosted Hydro Pump. However, Ferrothorn lacks reliable recovery, and Amoonguss and Tangrowth must be wary of switching in to Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Toxapex, Mantine, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon are tough Pokemon for Kingdra to take down. Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Mantine boast good special bulk and reliable recovery, while Tapu Fini resists Water and is immune to Kingdra's Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's incredible special bulk in combination with reliable recovery allows it to consistently deal with Kingdra, easily avoiding the 2HKO from even rain-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Priority users such as Mega Mawile and Mega Pinsir can all pick off Kingdra if it has been weakened a bit. Choice Scarf Tapu Koko and Greninja are so fast that they can outspeed Kingdra even under the rain. Mega Alakazam can trace Kingdra's Swift Swim ability to outspeed it and deal heavy damage with Psychic or Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Alternative Weather Setters</strong>: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Mega Charizard Y, and Alolan Ninetales are able to hamper Kingdra by changing the weather condition. Tyranitar will summon sand, boosting its Special Defense and allowing it to tank Hydro Pump. Mega Charizard Y will summon sun, forcing Kingdra out. Lastly, Alolan-Ninetales will summon hail, which will allow it to outspeed Kingdra, threatening to OHKO it with Freeze-Dry.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Kingdra's main STAB move of choice. Boosted by rain and boasting high power, Hydro Pump is a powerful move that will 2HKO, if not OHKO, most of the metagame, bar Chansey and specially defensive resists. Surf is slightly weaker, trading that power for 100% accuracy, making it a reliable option when trying to clean late-game. Draco Meteor is a powerful secondary STAB move that can deal heavy damage to common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Ice Beam is used to nail Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth. Hidden Power Grass may also be used to remove Gastrodon, but has little use otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim is what enables Kingdra to be a threatening sweeper, doubling its Speed when in the rain. Maximum Special Attack investment combined with a Modest nature and Choice Specs enables Kingdra to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment allows Kingdra to outspeed everything up to and including base 110 Choice Scarf users such as Gengar and Latios when factoring in Swift Swim.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One of the biggest things to keep in mind when using Kingdra is that one cannot afford to play passively. Taking full advantage of the 8 turns of rain provided by Pelipper is one of the first things that one should aim to do. Once the rain is set, aim to bring Kingdra onto the field as quickly as possible and start firing off attacks. Kingdra's decent defensive typing and serviceable bulk can help in instances such as switching into Pokemon such as Heatran or Greninja. It is also worth noting that if the opponent has a full on counter measure, such as Toxapex, Chansey, or Gastrodon, it is a smart idea to double switch out of Kingdra into another Pokemon that can pressure it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pelipper is the obvious first choice and a mandatory partner when you consider that Kingdra requires rain support in order to take advantage of its Swift Swim ability. Pelipper also happens to provide momentum via U-turn, which can be useful to bring Kingdra in safely. Pelipper can even utilize its Choice Specs set to pressure Kingdra's counters such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and even Knock Off Chansey's Eviolite.  Tapu Koko is a good partner for its ability to pressure Toxapex, wearing down defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, and boost Kingdra's Hidden Power Electric. Defensively, Ferrothorn is a great teammate because of how its Fire-type weakness is reduced under rain, and it can support Kingdra with moves such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off. Mega Scizor is an option too because it can provide momentum with U-turn and Defog away Toxic Spikes for Kingdra and its teammates. Lastly, Tapu Lele can be a nice partner with its Psychic Surge ability, preventing Pokemon from revenge killing Kingdra with priority moves. Tapu Lele takes advantage of many Pokemon Kingdra loses to such as Toxapex and Amoonguss and it can utilize items such as Fightinium Z to lure in Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>A great defensive Water typing and phenomenal natural bulk allow Suicune to perform as a frightening Calm Mind sweeper. With its great ability Pressure, Suicune can threaten offensive and defensive builds alike that have difficulty breaking through it. Despite common threats on defensive builds such as Toxapex not being scared of Suicune, it can still manage to PP stall a majority of defensive threats that would normally do a great job of checking Water-types, such as Ferrothorn, with Substitute and Pressure. However, commonly seen faster offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Timid Tapu Lele with Psyshock pressure Suicune out of setting up and breaking through numerous offensive teams in the metagame, although they must watch out for Scald burns. In addition, Suicune requires extensive support to get it to function well against teams which utilize defensive stops to it such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A RestTalk Calm Mind set can be used to give Suicune more consistent longevity and to make it less reliant on hazard removal for Toxic Spikes. Roar can also be used on the RestTalk set to deter opposing setup sweepers from taking advantage of Suicune and works well in combination with entry hazard support, although this means Suicune has to forgo Sleep Talk and become more passive or Calm Mind and forfeit its use as a setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Keldeo, and even Mantine serve as strong answers to Suicune. Toxapex takes very little damage from Scald while Mantine is immune to it, and they can both use Haze to rid Suicune of its Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo breaks past Suicune due to Secret Sword hitting Suicune's weaker Defense, while Tapu Fini can put a stop to Suicune with a combination of Taunt + Nature's Madness.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While they have difficulty breaking past Suicune if it has accumulated enough Calm Mind boosts, Amoonguss and Tangrowth both have Regenerator to outstall Suicune and prevent it from sweeping the rest of their team. Mega Venusaur is also a strong answer if it can pressure Suicune enough, but must watch out, as it only has 8 Synthesis PP to keep it healthy and Suicune can thus outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko and other threats with Electric-type coverage, such as Mega Mawile, can break Suicune's Substitute and prevent it from accumulating Calm Mind boosts, thus forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Tapu Fini, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko can prevent Suicune from using Substitute, Calm Mind, Rest, and Protect, leaving it only able to Scald, meaning it loses Scald PP more quickly and can no longer do its job.</p> <p><strong>Status and Knock Off</strong>: Status conditions such as burn and poison as well as the move Knock Off stop Suicune completely from setting up and sweeping due to cutting off Suicune's recovery, which it needs to PP stall its foes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Suicune's main STAB move and can wear down threats due to its burn chance, although this must be used wisely against defensive teams with threats such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, as they can engage in stalemates with Suicune and stall out all Scald's PP, thus preventing Suicune from sweeping. Thanks to its decent Speed stat, Substitute allows Suicune to avoid status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic from the likes of Rotom-W and Heatran while aiding it in PP stalling threats such as Ferrothorn, which can only hit Suicune with 4 Power Whips due to Pressure. Calm Mind allows Suicune to perform as a sweeper, as it is capable of taking advantage of special attackers even with super effective coverage such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W, which can fail to break Suicune's Substitute once it has accumulated enough boosts. Protect allows Suicune to scout for coverage and status moves which can harm it, though it is mainly used to PP stall threats trying to break Suicune's Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Suicune to take advantage of its phenomenal natural bulk while also giving it the opportunity to make 101 HP Substitutes, which don't break to one Seismic Toss. The 40 Special Defense EVs notably allow Suicune's Substitute after a Calm Mind to take Amoonguss's Giga Drain while also lowering the chance of Rotom-W breaking it with Volt Switch. 216 Speed EVs allow Suicune to outspeed base 80s. Pressure is Suicune's only available ability and is the main reason for the success of this set; it allows Suicune to take 2 PP off of any offensive move that is used against Suicune, leaving them with very few opportunities to break Suicune in combination with Substitute and Protect. Leftovers is necessary in order for Suicune to take advantage of the turns where it uses Substitute and Protect to stay as healthy as possible throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not send out Suicune until all of its counters, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and the rare Mantine, are eliminated, as they will prevent Suicune from setting up Calm Mind boosts, thus leaving it only able to PP stall and throw out Scalds. Also do not come in when there are Toxic Spikes on the field from threats like Toxapex, as these reduce Suicune's longevity, meaning it has no chance to sweep properly. Calm Mind should be used when Suicune safely has a Substitute up when it needs to handle special attackers like Amoonguss better. However, be careful with using Suicune's Scald PP against threats that are not easily worn down, such as Amoonguss; while Suicune can PP stall it out, it needs its Scald PP in order to sweep after its checks and counters are weakened.</p> <p>If a fast offensive threat such as Tapu Koko or Serperior comes in on Suicune while it sets up a Substitute, do not try to set up against them; Suicune can Protect to gain Leftovers recovery while draining some PP from these foes and then Scald the next turn for a potential burn chance while they break Suicune's Substitute. After this, Suicune should switch out to avoid getting worn down. If the foe has Knock Off, never send Suicune directly in, as if Suicune loses its Leftovers, it loses the ability to last throughout the match, meaning it will have a hard time sweeping. Against slower defensive threats such as Ferrothorn, Suicune can set up Substitute and use Protect to gain back recovery while also PP stalling them.</p> <p>Avoid letting Suicune get poisoned or burned under all circumstances, as these two statuses prevent Suicune from sweeping by cutting off its much-needed recovery. Be careful when up against status users with no Substitute, as predicting incorrectly can be costly. For example, do not use Scald on a Rotom-W predicting it to Pain Split against Suicune, or it might burn Suicune with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune requires a lot of support in order for it to sweep, the first of which are teammates that allow Suicune to bypass Haze users like Toxapex, which are hard stops to Suicune. Heatran with Magma Storm can take out both Toxapex and Tapu Fini for Suicune by use of Tectonic Rage for Toxapex and Bloom Doom for Tapu Fini while also breaking down passive threats to Suicune such as Chansey, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Tapu Koko can take care of these threats as well while also providing pivot support with Volt Switch or U-turn in order to get Suicune in safely. Other strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele work to pressure Toxapex and Chansey.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is very useful for Suicune to more easily break past defensive threats, so Stealth Rock support from the likes of Garchomp or Landorus-T assists Suicune in performing its role well; Garchomp and Landorus-T can also use Continental Crush to take out Grass-type threats such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, which Suicune struggles to break past. Spikes from the likes of Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja allow Suicune to take out weakened grounded threats, and Greninja can also use Extrasensory to weaken Toxapex or Gunk Shot to take out Tapu Fini for Suicune. Assault Vest Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur pair well with this set, as they aid Suicune by taking on the Water-types that Suicune does not want to deal with such as Tapu Fini, Greninja, and Keldeo, the latter of which can break Suicune's Substitute repeatedly with Secret Sword. Mega Scizor and Celesteela are useful Steel-type partners, as they can deal with Psychic-types such as Latios and Timid Tapu Lele with Psyshock, which can threaten this set; Mega Scizor can also use Defog to remove entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes for Suicune. Finally, Toxic Spikes setters like Greninja provide great support for Suicune, allowing it to weaken Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu faster than with a burn from Scald.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's high Attack stat coupled with powerful, spammable STAB moves in Stone Edge and Crunch makes it a fearsome wallbreaker. Powerful STAB Pursuit lets Tyranitar also serve as one of OU's most threatening trappers. Tyranitar can use its solid bulk and unique typing to check Pokemon such as Mega Latios, Choice-locked Tapu Lele, and Volcarona. Sand Stream is also noteworthy because it allows Tyranitar to support sand sweepers like Excadrill and Mega Garchomp. Finally, Mega Tyranitar can make use of its added titanic bulk and Speed to set up and sweep with Dragon Dance, as well as check dangerous threats such as BoltBeam Magearna, Kyurem-B, and Heatran. Unfortunately, Tyranitar is let down by its Rock / Dark typing, which leaves it vulnerable to many of OU's common types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. Its STAB attacks are also not as spammable against Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Landorus-T. Another downfall is that Tyranitar's low Speed causes it to be forced out frequently by faster threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Tyranitar can run special moves to threaten physical walls much harder, with Ice Beam for Landorus-T and Fire Blast for Skarmory; however, it has no use otherwise, with Landorus-T getting pressured enough by Ice Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and other Fighting-types can outspeed Tyranitar and KO it with their STAB attacks, with the former two also resisting both of Tyranitar's STAB moves. Focus Blast from the likes of Mega Alakazam, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T punish Tyranitar's massive Fighting weakness.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Defensive Landorus-T tanks even Choice Band-boosted attacks somewhat well while hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage with U-turn or STAB Earthquake. It can also set up Stealth Rock as Tyranitar is scared out. Offensive Landorus-T simply outspeeds Tyranitar and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Hippowdon easily tanks hits from Tyranitar and can set Stealth Rock or threaten Tyranitar with Earthquake. Pokemon like Heatran and Mega Latios commonly runs Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively, which can sting Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, Magearna, Mega Diancie, Mega Mawile, and other Fairy-types cannot switch in safely against more offensive Tyranitar sets for fear of being hit hard by Stone Edge, but they can outspeed and obliterate Tyranitar with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Some Steel-types resist both of Tyranitar's STAB moves, while others are simply very bulky or resist Stone Edge. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi can all effectively check Tyranitar; however, Jirachi must flinch Tyranitar with Iron Head or it will fall to Crunch. In addition, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch can revenge kill a boosted Mega Tyranitar. Corkscrew Crash Heatran can lure in and significantly damage Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, Manaphy, and other offensive Water-types can crush Tyranitar with their STAB attacks. Bulkier Water-types, such as Toxapex and Rotom-W, can tank a hit from Tyranitar and either pivot out or threaten it with a burn. Even though Pelipper hates taking a Stone Edge, it can replace Tyranitar's sand with rain, negating Tyranitar's Special Defense boost and limiting its teammates like Sand Rush Excadrill from doing work.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is important in order to pressure Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Mega Tyranitar is a good Pursuit user, as it is capable of forcing out many prevalent Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias. Fire Punch is the preferred option in the final moveslot to hit Steel-types that are 4x weak to Fire such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor while still hitting Magearna and Mega Mawile hard. Earthquake can be run instead if doing more damage to Heatran, Magearna, and Mega Mawile is desired, but it does make it significantly harder for Mega Tyranitar to deal with the aforementioned foes. Another option that can be run over Fire Punch or Earthquake is Crunch, which makes it much easier for Mega Tyranitar to pressure bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias but leaves it walled by Magearna and Mega Mawile. Ice Punch is also an option to punish Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Lastly, Superpower can be run to hit Heatran, Kartana, and Ferrothorn super effectively while still hitting Mega Mawile and Magearna for decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>124 Speed EVs let Mega Tyranitar outspeed uninvested Rotom-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur. 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to do as much damage as possible to Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mega Latias with Pursuit while also giving it the best chance to 2HKO Leftovers Magearna with Fire Punch. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP to minimize the chance of being 2HKOed by Earthquake from Mega Latios after Stealth Rock damage before Tyranitar has Mega Evolved.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Mega Tyranitar, you should switch it into play proactively, especially early-game in order to set Stealth Rock and Mega Evolve. From there, you should primarily focus on pressuring common Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. It should also be switched in aggressively against Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias in order to Pursuit trap them, which can land very key chip damage for teammates such as Kartana, Gliscor, and Tapu Lele. However, due to its lack of recovery options, Mega Tyranitar can be worn down quite easily by these Pokemon over the course of the match if they manage to switch into play often, especially if entry hazards are on the field. When switching Mega Tyranitar into Pokemon such as Heatran, you should also be wary of Lava Plume and Toxic, which can significantly cripple Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar fits best on bulky offensive and balanced teams that appreciate its utility as a Stealth Rock setter, Pursuit trapper, and check to Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias. Pokemon such as Kartana, Gliscor, and Tapu Bulu can take advantage of Mega Tyranitar's ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Latias. Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain, which gives Mega Tyranitar much needed recovery and weakens Earthquake from the likes of Landorus-T. Because of how easily Mega Tyranitar can be worn down over the course of the match, it's important to have entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Sand Rush Excadrill benefits greatly from Mega Tyranitar's ability to set sand, enabling it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, while also acting as an entry hazard remover. Moreover, Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Zapdos, which potentially puts it into range of +2 Excadrill's Corkscrew Crash. Mega Tyranitar is relatively susceptible to Fairy-types such as Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Clefable, so checks to them such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Celesteela are very important. It also struggles against Ash-Greninja in particular, so checks like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini make for good partners.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide is used over Stone Edge as a Rock-type STAB option because it's much more reliable while still retaining necessary damage on key threats such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T. While Crunch is the main Dark-type STAB move used on this set to deal consistent damage, Pursuit is necessary to prevent threats such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios from switching out. Earthquake is a solid coverage option that allows Tyranitar to threaten to OHKO Heatran and Magnezone while doing decent damage to threats such as Toxapex, Magearna, and opposing Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest allows Tyranitar to become an effective check for many of the tier's most threatening special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Alakazam, and Heatran. 224 HP EVs allow Tyranitar to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Latios's Earthquake—this investment in combination with maximum Special Defense investment allows Tyranitar to tank even some of the strongest special attacks in the tier such as +1 Savage Spin-Out from Volcarona with Assault Vest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid unnecessarily switching Tyranitar into Pokemon aside from the ones that it's needed to check, as it lacks reliable recovery and is prone to getting worn down into range of moves such as Corkscrew Crash from Heatran and Focus Blast from Mega Alakazam. In a similar vein, try to keep entry hazards off the field when switching in Tyranitar so that it doesn't get worn down as quickly and can do its job well. Try to wear down Pokemon such as Mega Latios and Mega Alakazam with your teammates so that you don't have to win a mind game in order to Pursuit trap them. If possible, try to sacrifice an expendable teammate when attempting to trap Mega Alakazam because Focus Blast can 2HKO Tyranitar as it switches in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Tyranitar tends to find itself on teams that appreciate the role compression and teambuilding flexibility that the set provides. Teammates that can help Tyranitar heal throughout the match, such as Tapu Bulu and Wish Clefable, are very helpful because they allow you to play Tyranitar more aggressively throughout the match. Pokemon that can break through the opposing team when the likes of Mega Latios and Mega Alakazam have been removed, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, make excellent teammates for Assault Vest Tyranitar. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos is very useful, as entry hazards being off the field allows Tyranitar to switch around more freely throughout the game.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is the most spammable move on the set, hitting even Pokemon that resist Rock for massive damage. The metagame's lack of switch-ins to powerful Rock-type moves increases its potency. Crunch is Tyranitar's secondary STAB move and hits many threats neutrally, making Tyranitar even harder to switch into safely. Pursuit makes Tyranitar a fearsome trapper, as any targets weak to Dark or less bulky and neutral are heavily damaged if not OHKOed upon switching out. Notable targets include Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Choice-locked Tapu Lele. The final moveslot is fairly flexible. Earthquake allows Tyranitar to defeat certain Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Mega Mawile and Magearna, while Superpower can be used to hit Steel-types extremely hard and has a high chance of OHKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Punch destroys common switch-ins to Tyranitar such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Fire Punch hits Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn harder than any other coverage option and retains the ability to hit Mega Mawile and Magearna for super effective damage, but bear in mind that a neutral Stone Edge hits as hard as a 2x super effective Fire Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The bulk investment allows Tyranitar to always avoid being OHKOed by Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Moonblast from full HP. It also guarantees that a +1 Bug Buzz from Volcarona will never OHKO Tyranitar. Maximum EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature to give Tyranitar the most potential to break through the opponent's team. The Speed investment allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Mega Mawile. However, Tyranitar can opt for less Speed investment to hit certain benchmarks, such as 76 Speed EVs to outrun Specially Defensive Tapu Bulu. Tyranitar can alternatively run a Jolly nature with maximum EVs in Attack and Speed to outrun the likes of Rotom-W, Specially Defensive Heatran, unboosted Mega Swampert, and  uninvested Zapdos, however the lack of power can be unappealing. Choice Band makes Tyranitar extremely powerful, as its STAB combination is very difficult to switch into for offensive and defensive builds alike. It comes at the cost of locking Tyranitar into one move, however. Sand Stream buffs Tyranitar's Special Defense and thereby helps it switch into special attackers more easily. Partners that can sweep under sand appreciate it as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar should primarily be used as a wallbreaker due to the incredible damage it can inflict with Stone Edge and Crunch. Pursuit should not be used as frequently because it is situational. As opponents will often be reluctant to switch Pursuit's targets in for fear of getting them trapped, Tyranitar's presence can be used to pressure opponents and keep momentum in your favor. Tyranitar's naturally high special bulk helps it check strong special attackers such as Mega Latios, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona; however, Tyranitar must be kept healthy to avoid the KO from a boosted Giga Drain from Volcarona so it can KO with Stone Edge in return. In a pinch, Tyranitar is capable of surviving a +1 Giga Drain from Volcarona from full HP even without sand active.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar's best partners appreciate its ability to Pursuit trap their checks and counters. Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and other special attackers pressure opponents heavily in tandem with Choice Band Tyranitar, as common checks to special attackers such as Chansey and Assault Vest Tornadus-T are either obliterated by Tyranitar's STAB moves or weakened by Pursuit. By pressuring bulky foes such as Landorus-T, Tyranitar can give teammates like Mega Mawile opportunities to set up. Tyranitar itself is troubled by Fighting-types and fast offensive threats such as Mega Lopunny and Garchomp; pairing it with strong Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types can pressure them. Good options include Tapu Fini, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele. Earthquake switch-ins such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Tangrowth are very important because they account for Tyranitar's Ground-type weakness. Excadrill appreciates Tyranitar's sand, which enables it to sweep with Sand Rush. Mega Garchomp, which also appreciates sand, can form a powerful breaking core with Tyranitar. Notably, they both pressure Landorus-T heavily.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar's power, impressive bulk, and difficulty to revenge kill make it an effective user of Dragon Dance, outperforming non-Mega Tyranitar due to its increased Speed and defenses. Stone Edge is Mega Tyranitar's most powerful STAB move and hits much of the OU metagame for neutral or super effective damage. Ice Punch is run to smash would-be checks such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. The last moveslot can hold Fire Punch or Earthquake. Fire Punch punishes Ferrothorn and Scizor while preventing the need to risk a Stone Edge miss against other Steel-types. Alternatively, Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar beat Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Heatran more easily. In addition, it can 2HKO Toxapex without a boost and hits Keldeo for neutral damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar runs maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature to make the most of its impressive Attack while outspeeding neutral- and positive-Speed natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Magearna and defensive Garchomp. Sand Stream is the preferred ability because it buffs Tyranitar's Special Defense before it Mega Evolves, enabling it to take special hits more easily while setting up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar is best used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, as its longevity can be cut short by damage taken while setting up and sweeping. Prior to setting up, it is important to ensure that certain checks to Mega Tyranitar, such as revenge killers and Pokemon that resist its coverage, are removed and that necessary chip damage has been dealt so Mega Tyranitar can achieve OHKOs more easily. Setting up against offensive teams can be challenging, so it is best to bring Tyranitar in against something it would normally threaten out, such as Mega Latios, Heatran, or Choice-locked Tapu Lele, and proceed to Mega Evolve and boost with Dragon Dance. Bluffing a different item, such as a Choice Band, can make this simpler. Bulkier teams can fall to Mega Tyranitar once its defensive checks have been weakened sufficiently. When facing weather-based teams, it is best to hold off on Mega Evolving Tyranitar as opposed to losing it by setting up early in the game, as it can set sand repeatedly to prevent opposing weather sweepers from becoming dangerous.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar's presence prior to Mega Evolving can pressure opponents to be wary of sending in Pursuit-weak Pokemon, enabling you to play more aggressively. However, its multitude of weaknesses and need for prior damage to successfully sweep means that it struggles as a stand-alone attacker and requires plenty of support from its teammates. Tapu Fini provides Water- and Fighting-type resistances while keeping bulkier teams pressured with the combination of Taunt and Nature's Madness. It also keeps Mega Tyranitar safe from status with Misty Terrain. Ferrothorn can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to help chip away at foes while checking Water- and Fairy-types for Tyranitar, but it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Tyranitar. Landorus-T is an excellent partner, as it resists Fighting-type attacks, is immune to Ground-type moves, inflicts chip damage with Rocky Helmet, and can pivot Tyranitar into battle via U-turn. Dual screens support boosts Mega Tyranitar's natural bulk to incredible levels and enables it to set up in front of OU's most powerful attackers such as offensive Landorus-T. Tapu Koko is a capable screen setter in OU.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide synergizes well with Choice Scarf, as it allows Tyranitar to surprise Rock-weak Pokemon that are usually faster than it, like Kyurem-B, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, with huge damage, if not an OHKO. Stone Edge can be used instead for significantly higher power that allows it to accomplish feats such as OHKOing Mega Charizard X, Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock, and Zapdos after Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage, at the cost of lower accuracy. Ice Punch could be used to OHKO Garchomp after Stealth Rock and heavily damage Landorus-T and Gliscor after outspeeding them, but it misses out on the aforementioned benefits of a Rock-type STAB move and makes Tyranitar less effective against the metagame. Pursuit is made even better by Choice Scarf, specializing in picking off weakened foes like Mega Latias, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham more consistently, as the extra Speed removes Recover mind games from the Mega Latias interaction and discourages Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham from staying in to attack. Foul Play allows Tyranitar to turn the tables on Swords Dance Garchomp, non-Choice Scarf Kartana, and Swords Dance Landorus-T in one slot; it OHKOes +1 Kartana after minimal chip damage and cleanly OHKOes +2 Landorus-T and Garchomp. It can also work as an emergency answer to +6 Swords Dance Gliscor. Crunch is more effective against special attacking Pokemon like Reuniclus, Mega Latias, and Slowbro, cleanly 2HKOing Reuniclus, and 2HKOing the last two after Stealth Rock. Earthquake rounds out Tyranitar's coverage, letting it OHKO Heatran and 2HKO Assault Vest Magearna and hit Mega Mawile hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given physical bulk investment allows Tyranitar to always survive a +1 Earthquake from Mega Charizard X, with the rest pooled into Attack and Speed to maximize Tyranitar's offensive capabilities. Alternatively, a spread of 72 HP / 56 Atk / 128 SpD / 252 Spe can be used to survive a +1 Bug Buzz from Quiver Dance Volcarona at the expense of a drop in power. Variants running this spread should always run Foul Play, as it is unaffected by the reduced Attack investment in comparison to the main spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One of the best attributes of Choice Scarf Tyranitar is the surprise factor it brings, allowing it to remove Pokemon like Swords Dance Kartana and Kyurem-B with its boosted Speed, so you should delay revealing Tyranitar's item until necessary. It works well as a revenge killer against Pokemon like Swords Dance Landorus-T and Garchomp, especially when paired with Excadrill, as your opponent could misconstrue that you switched in Tyranitar to set sandstorm rather than to revenge kill. Aside from its excellence as a revenge killer, Tyranitar can be safely thrown directly into Mega Latias to Pursuit trap it and use its Fire resistance and high Special Defense in sandstorm to check Heatran. It can utilize the sandstorm it sets to mess with opposing rain and weather-reliant recovery such as Kartana's Synthesis and Cresselia's Moonlight, as well as pester Pokemon like Chansey and Zapdos with passive damage they need to manually heal off. Once Tyranitar has served its purpose, or in matchups where it is not useful, it can sacrifice itself for chip damage against the likes of Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele, if they are not already weakened enough for Tyranitar to pick off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar primarily fits on balance teams that appreciate its ability to Pursuit trap Psychic-types like Mega Latias and heavily weakened Pokemon like Mega Medicham and revenge kill physical attackers like Swords Dance Kartana and Mega Charizard X. Excadrill continues to be the perfect Tyranitar teammate even with Tyranitar's change of role, appreciating its sandstorm and the surprise damage it can inflict on Zapdos. Spikes from the likes of Skarmory and Ferrothorn can work to chip down targets like Mega Medicham and Kartana into range of Tyranitar's attacks, and Rocky Helmet users like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and the aforementioned Skarmory can work towards the same thing as well as check Kartana. Although Sand Stream is useful at disrupting rain teams, Tyranitar still requires Water-resistant teammates such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn to cover its weakness to Water-type attacks. Psychic-types like Reuniclus can help handle Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny that cause trouble for Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Swampert is one of the premier physical threats in the tier and a perfect addition to rain teams, boasting an incredible Attack stat to wield its lethal STAB combination of rain-boosted Waterfall and Earthquake with. Handling Mega Swampert defensively is a nightmare, with many believing the most brutal part of Mega Swampert is the secondary effects; Waterfall's flinch chance, coupling with critical hits and Ice Punch's freeze chance, means that answers like Skarmory and Mega Latias can regularly be overcome given how many attempts Mega Swampert has to break them during a game. It's no slouch when it comes to defensive utility, either; its impressive bulk and wonderful typing allow it to switch in and trade blows against many Pokemon like Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Koko. It can also overcome traditional answers to itself with Toxic and remove the chance for foes to switch around its attacks with Substitute. The most fatal blow to Swampert's viability is Rotom-W, a very common Pokemon that happens to handle both of its STAB moves and Ice Punch while threatening it back with Will-O-Wisp and rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass can be exploited by the likes of Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Alakazam, and it despises Toxic Spikes from Toxapex putting it on a timer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature can be used to maximize the threat Mega Swampert poses; however, it makes Mega Swampert vulnerable to being outsped by Shift Gear Magearna, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Choice Scarf Victini, even in rain. A defensive set making use of Scald and Rest can be used, with a defensive profile similar to Seismitoad and Gastrodon and vastly increased base stats. However, it trades off an immunity to Water, and it is a wasteful way to use a Mega slot unless there is no other way to fit one.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types like Rotom-W, Slowbro, Pelipper, and the occasional Mantine can all check Mega Swampert incredibly well, as well as threaten it with burn from Will-O-Wisp or Scald. None of these Pokemon appreciate being hit with Toxic, however. As rain will be usually be present when Mega Swampert is in use, it can also have trouble against offensive Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Crawdaunt, which use priority, as well as Manaphy and Gyarados, which can survive a hit from Mega Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and the rare Tangrowth are excellent at switching into Mega Swampert, resisting both of its STAB moves; however, they must be careful about switching into Ice Punch when already chipped down, especially if entry hazards are present. Other Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Serperior can also threaten Swampert but don't want to switch into Superpower in the case of the first two and Ice Punch in the case of Serperior. Mega Alakazam can run Energy Ball to revenge kill Mega Swampert, utilizing Trace to copy Swift Swim and outspeed it, and although rare, Tapu Koko and Magearna can punish Mega Swampert's sense of security to switch in with Grass Knot and Energy Ball, respectively. Mega Charizard Y is a severe example of a user of Grass-type coverage, ruining Mega Swampert's Swift Swim and OHKOing it with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rain Interruption</strong>: Sun from Mega Charizard Y and Torkoal, sand from Tyranitar and Hippowdon, and even the rare hail from Alolan Ninetales can all mess with rain, hindering Mega Swampert's Speed, stripping it of the power boost to Waterfall, and even weakening it in the case of sun.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Rotom-W and the other aforementioned Water-types can threaten to burn Mega Swampert, and various Toxic users and especially Toxic Spikes from Toxapex can put it on a timer. Mega Swampert should also be aware of contact abilities like Zapdos's Static and Volcarona's Flame Body, although the second case is generally only relevant when Volcarona is being sacrificed.</p> <p><strong>Other Walls</strong>: Buzzwole and Rocky Helmet Skarmory avoid the 2HKO from rain-boosted Waterfall and heal off damage, though Mega Swampert can beat them with flinches. Shedinja deserves a mention, as it completely walls multiple Mega Swampert sets, although it's instantly ruined by Toxic.</p>",

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Mega Swampert's most spammable STAB move thanks to the boost provided by the rain, its perfect accuracy, and its odds to flinch. Earthquake smashes the likes of Toxapex, Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Mega Mawile to smithereens. Ice Punch threatens Dragon- and Grass-types like Mega Latias and Serperior. If Mega Swampert's teammates have these targets accounted for, it can use Toxic to cripple the likes of Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Tapu Bulu, all of which can reliably take its STAB moves. Mega Swampert can take advantage of Pokemon that it scares out, such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, to set up Stealth Rock. Substitute eases prediction and works well alongside Toxic to punish the aforementioned switch-ins. Finally, Superpower allows Mega Swampert to chip Ferrothorn and finish off Kartana and Kyurem-B after entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is mandatory to outspeed Choice Scarf Kartana, +1 Mega Charizard X, and +2 Magearna under the rain. If Mega Swampert runs Substitute, it can run 40 Special Defense EVs to guarantee that Toxapex's rain-boosted Scald doesn't break its Substitute. Damp is Swampert's preferred pre-Mega ability to let it switch in to block Explosion from Landorus-T and Mew.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Swampert has great natural bulk and a helpful typing, so it can often come right in on the likes of defensive Landorus-T and Tapu Koko early-game without much issue, as well as naturally benefitting from pivoting support. In most cases, it's wise to get your rain up from turn one so that Mega Swampert can make a splash immediately. Once Mega Swampert is in, it can focus on weakening shared checks for common teammates like Ash-Greninja and Manaphy to help them clean up later in the game and vice versa. Mega Swampert can make good use of its Electric immunity to force entry on Volt Switch users like Magearna and Tapu Koko, but be aware of coverage like Fleur Cannon and Dazzling Gleam and consider mixing things up with a switch to a more traditional answer like Ferrothorn instead. Mega Swampert must tread carefully against Pokemon that can inflict chip damage or have abilities that can afflict it with status such as Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Rocky Helmet users like Landorus-T and Zapdos because it will be easier to deal with if it has been weakened throughout the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Swampert should mainly only be used on dedicated rain teams, which value its Electric immunity and its capabilities as a physical rain sweeper. Therefore, Pelipper is a mandatory partner for Mega Swampert, summoning rain thanks to Drizzle, providing a safe switch-in with a slow U-turn, and removing entry hazards with Defog. In return, Mega Swampert can take Electric-type attacks aimed at Pelipper. Mega Swampert also pairs well with fellow rain attackers such as Manaphy and Ash-Greninja, as they can overwhelm shared checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn for the others to clean up. Manaphy is a fantastic stallbreaker thanks to Tail Glow and Hydration; using the rain provided by Pelipper, it can blow past targets such as Tapu Fini and Chansey with a Tail Glow-boosted Hydro Vortex and shrug off status attempts aimed at Mega Swampert. Ash-Greninja breaks past the likes of Slowbro, has a solid priority move in Water Shuriken, and provides Spikes support, wearing down checks like Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Steel-type partners like Ferrothorn and Magearna are also greatly appreciated, as they provide a crucial Grass and Psychic resistance and enjoy having their Fire weakness reduced under the rain. Ferrothorn offers plenty of utility with Spikes and has access to Knock Off to remove items such as Leftovers from Celesteela and status like Thunder Wave to cripple faster targets such as Mega Alakazam. Magearna brings Mega Swampert in safely with Volt Switch and possesses valuable Flying and Dark resistances, which most rain teams otherwise lack. If Mega Swampert has either Superpower or Substitute + Toxic, it will give Ferrothorn room to run Stealth Rock. Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko can grant Mega Swampert safe entry via U-turn and Volt Switch and remove entry hazards with Defog. Tornadus-T also has the benefit of taking on Grass-types like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior, and it can actually keep off Toxic Spikes with the combination of Taunt + Defog, while Tapu Koko threatens physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W with its powerful Thunder.</p>"

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>Pelipper shines as the best rain setter in OU thanks to its ability Drizzle, useful defensive typing, and great movepool, with access to Roost, U-turn, and other utility moves such as Knock Off and Defog. Its rain lets it support a multitude of teammates ranging from Ferrothorn and Magearna having their Fire weakness decreased to enabling dangerous threats such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy. Rain boosts the power of Pelipper's Scald and boosts the accuracy of Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Thunder from Tapu Koko, letting them use these moves without worrying about missing. Drizzle is also useful against opposing weather teams, letting it hinder Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Excadrill. However, its Water / Flying typing leaves a lot to be desired; Stealth Rock cuts into its HP, reducing its ability to take physical attacks such as Mega Lopunny's Frustration, and it is vulnerable to common offensive types such as Electric and Rock. Additionally, its base stats aside from its Defense are below average at best, making it easy for special attackers such as Ash-Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele to pressure and force it out. Pelipper also loses to Mega Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y one-on-one, should they come in and replace the rain with their respective weathers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple the likes of Slowbro and Gastrodon. Pursuit is another option to trap the rare Shedinja, which is otherwise very troublesome to teammates such as Mega Swampert, Manaphy, and Tapu Koko. However, the use of these moves for these matchups is very specific, and Pelipper must give up more consistent options like Knock Off, Defog, and Hurricane to use them. A Choice Specs set with a Modest nature can catch opponents by surprise, drastically powering up Pelipper's Water-type STAB moves and ensuring that Hurricane has a favorable roll to 2HKO Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage. However, Pelipper needs to drop Damp Rock, leading to rain teams having fewer turns to threaten the opposing team and reducing the consistency of teammates like Mega Swampert and Manaphy that rely on rain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Zapdos pose a major threat to Pelipper with their super effective STAB moves. They can also force out Pelipper with Volt Switch to generate momentum. Pelipper must also watch out for unexpected Electric-type coverage such as Thunder from Clefable and Thunder Punch from Kommo-o.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and the rare Mega Aerodactyl are faster than Pelipper and threaten it with their Rock-type STAB moves. Tyranitar can replace the rain and potentially punish Pelipper with Pursuit. Pelipper must be wary of Pokemon that may have Rock-type coverage moves such as Stone Edge from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Rain Sweepers</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Volcanion can turn Pelipper's rain against it by powering up their Water-type STAB moves to use against it and its teammates. Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Latias can also use the rain to fire off Hurricane and Thunder without the risk of missing.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y can replace Pelipper's rain with sand and sun, respectively, making it more difficult for Pelipper to maintain the rain turns for its team. Tyranitar can also potentially punish Pelipper with Pursuit, which leaves Pelipper with fewer opportunities to come back in and reset the rain.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: The presence of Stealth Rock is very troublesome for Pelipper, as it limits its ability to come in and reset the rain. If Pelipper is below 25% of its health, it will be KOed before it can activate the rain. Status conditions like Toxic and even burn compound with entry hazard damage and give Pelipper a much harder time sticking around.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: The loss of Damp Rock is detrimental for Pelipper because it limits the number of rain turns that it can provide for its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Pelipper's below average Special Defense, powerful special attackers such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Mega Alakazam can threaten it with heavy damage.</p>",

      "Defensive Rain Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Pelipper's preferred STAB option due to having the chance to cause a burn. U-turn allows Pelipper to pivot out safely and provide a free switch for its rain sweeper teammates such as Mega Swampert and Ash-Greninja. Roost ensures that Pelipper stays healthy throughout the battle, allowing it to switch in and re-set the rain. Defog is useful for getting rid of entry hazards, which are very annoying for rain teams. Alternatively, Hurricane can be used to hit Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Mega Lopunny super effectively and almost always OHKOes Hawlucha from full health. Finally, Knock Off is useful for removing items like Ferrothorn's Leftovers, Toxapex's Black Sludge, Magearna's Assault Vest, and Chansey's Eviolite for its teammates to break more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Pelipper's physical bulk, allowing it to better take hits such as Mega Lopunny's Frustration and Mega Swampert's rain-boosted Waterfall. 0 Speed IVs are preferred so that Pelipper can be as slow as possible to bring its teammates in much more safely. 0 Speed IVs also let Pelipper underspeed Tyranitar and the rare Hippowdon so that rain can override the sand in the lead matchup.  Alternatively, an EV spread of 248 HP / 36 Def / 224 SpD can be used to allow Pelipper to survive a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha and better take on the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pelipper should almost exclusively be used as a lead so that it can set up rain as early as possible and enable its teammates immediately. It is recommended to keep Pelipper healthy for rain teams to function because of its teammates being very dependent on rain to pose a threat. Pelipper should scout for any Electric-type coverage and unexpected Z-Moves that could potentially eliminate it, such as Thunder Punch from Kommo-o and Continental Crush from Landorus-T. Avoid sacrificing Pelipper until it's late enough that the remaining rain turns will enable its teammates to win the game. Pelipper should also be wary of Knock Off, as losing its Damp Rock will heavily limit its rain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pelipper should only ever be seen on dedicated rain teams, with multiple teammates dedicated to taking advantage of its rain. Mega Swampert is Pelipper's best partner, utilizing rain to fire off boosted Waterfall and outspeed most other Pokemon thanks to Swift Swim. It's also a good Stealth Rock setter and has an Electric immunity, which allows it to take Electric-type attacks aimed at Pelipper. Ash-Greninja's Water-type STAB moves are much more threatening in the rain, allowing it to more efficiently force KOs and activate Battle Bond faster. Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko love the support from rain, as it gives them a 100% accurate Hurricane and Thunder, respectively. They can also provide additional momentum with U-turn and Volt Switch and pressure bulky teams with Taunt. Additionally, Tornadus-T can check Grass-types like Serperior, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana while also providing Defog support to free up a moveslot for Pelipper. Manaphy is a great stallbreaker for rain teams thanks to Tail Glow and Hydration; under the rain, it is immune to status, can heal back up to full health in a single turn with Rest, and blows through even Water-resistant Pokemon such as Tapu Fini with its Tail Glow-boosted Hydro Vortex, allowing Mega Swampert and Ash-Greninja to clean up. Ferrothorn provides a much-needed Psychic-resistant teammate; benefits from its reduced weakness to Fire under the rain; and provides crucial support in the form of entry hazards, status like Thunder Wave, and Knock Off. Alternatively, Kingdra and Crawdaunt can be used to provide additional Swift Swim support and break with Adaptability Knock Off and rain-boosted Crabhammer, respectively, despite being niche options. Magearna is an option for a Steel-type that can bring its teammates in safely with Volt Switch and possesses a valuable resistance to Flying and Dark that most rain teams don't have.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom's useful offensive toolkit, which includes Technician-boosted STAB Mach Punch and the ever-infuriating Spore gives it a small niche on hyper offensive teams, being able to offensively check threats like Greninja and threaten to put foes to sleep with its perfectly accurate Spore. It's able to threaten defensive Water-types with its similarly Technician-boosted Bullet Seed and punish the likes of Volcarona and the Mega Charizard formes that switch in with Rock Tomb. However, Breloom struggles to find consistent use due to its very limited and linear nature, often becoming death fodder after spreading the unreliable sleep to an opposing Pokemon. It's outclassed as a Fighting-type and a priority user by the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, and once its Focus Sash is broken by entry hazards, it's outsped and threatened out by countless Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used to significantly increase Breloom's late-game cleaning capabilities, especially after a Swords Dance boost, but it loses out on the consistency with which it can get off an attack or Spore that Focus Sash brings. Breloom can make use of its other great ability in Poison Heal, combining its impressive recovery with Substitute + Leech Seed, making it impossible to pressure with passive damage. It can even slot on Focus Punch to shatter the likes of Kartana and Ferrothorn when behind a Substitute. Another avenue to go down while using Poison Heal Breloom is a bulky Swords Dance set, using Toxic Orb to block Scald burn from the likes of Toxapex and taking full advantage of Spore to gain free turns to set up. This set pairs Spore and Facade to break through defensive teams that struggle to hit it back meaningfully. However, Poison Heal sets do suffer from a drop in power compared to Technician sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Other Sleep Blockers</strong>: Tangrowth is able to easily switch directly into Breloom, blocking Spore and walling any attacks it wants to throw out. Serperior can get in on a predicted Spore and beat Breloom one-on-one, though it doesn't want to switch directly into Breloom's attacks due to its middling bulk. Gliscor makes use of Toxic Orb to become immune to Spore attempts from Breloom, though many Gliscor sets will still lose to Swords Dance Breloom one-on-one by virtue of not being able to hit it back. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain and Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain foil Spore from disrupting grounded targets; however, neither of these foes can handle switching into Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Victini, Volcarona, and the Mega Charizard formes can threaten to OHKO Breloom with ease and are unbothered by its STAB moves, but they can't safely switch directly in due to the double threat of Spore and Rock Tomb. While its Focus Sash is intact, Breloom can functionally trade itself for these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Zapdos resist both of Breloom's STAB moves, and the former two can threaten it with 4x super effective Flying-type attacks. Flyinium Z Landorus-T and Gyarados can OHKO Breloom if their Z-Move is unused, though they don't resist Bullet Seed and, like the other Pokemon mentioned, do not want to switch directly in out of fear of Spore.</p> <p><strong>Faster Psychic and Fairy-types</strong>: Tapu Lele is an incredibly bothersome Pokemon for Breloom to face due to its Psychic Terrain disabling Breloom's key Mach Punch and because it can outspeed and OHKO Breloom with either of its STAB moves. Other fast threats like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko resist Mach Punch and threaten Breloom with Psychic and Dazzling Gleam, respectively. Although Mega Diancie doesn't have a resistance to Fighting, it's still able to take a Mach Punch and threaten out Breloom with Moonblast. All of these Pokemon need to be mindful of Breloom's Focus Sash, allowing it to turn the tables on them with Bullet Seed or Spore.</p>",

      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore gives Breloom an edge over similar offensive threats with its ability to put defensive checks like Tornadus-T and Zapdos out of commission. Mach Punch is incredibly likely to hit Greninja for an OHKO, and it deals massive damage to the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Tyranitar, putting a stop to the latter's Dragon Dance variant after some minor chip. Bullet Seed strikes fear into Water-types like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W and allows Breloom to threaten the likes of Clefable and Landorus-T after putting them to sleep. Swords Dance lets Breloom take advantage of the free turns given by Spore, though Rock Tomb could be used instead to punish Fire- and Flying-type switch-ins like Victini, Volcarona, the Mega Charizard formes, and Tornadus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Modest Heatran and the many other Pokemon that commonly outspeed it like Tapu Fini and Landorus-T, though Adamant can be used to give Breloom better odds to OHKO the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Lopunny with Mach Punch as well as giving it a general power boost. Focus Sash allows Breloom to guarantee sleep against offensive threats like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y and various setup sweepers like Volcarona and Gyarados.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Breloom's function on the hyper offense teams it finds itself on is to break holes in teams that don't have a solid counter to it by utilizing the dual threat of Spore and its Technician-boosted STAB moves. Its Focus Sash plays a big part in enabling Breloom against fast offensive teams by ensuring it can favorably trade damage with fast threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam without risking getting OHKOed itself and letting it put a stop to sweepers like Volcarona with Spore in a pinch. With Swords Dance, Breloom can make use of Mach Punch to clean up after its offensively minded teammates have weakened the opposing team sufficiently.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Breloom finds its niche on hyper offense teams, which appreciate the free setup opportunities that Breloom's Spore affords them and its strong priority that can help in a pinch. To preserve its Focus Sash, good entry hazard control methods are beneficial; a dedicated hazard lead like Mew or Mega Diancie and an offensive Defogger like Serperior, Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are good examples that fit the hyper offense archetype. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, Dragonite, and Gyarados are incredibly appreciative of the free turns provided by Spore, especially against the likes of Unaware Clefable and Toxapex, which can either ignore or clear boosts. The first two can use Breloom's Grass-type defensive checks like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu as setup fodder, also appreciating Breloom handling Greninja.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>There is no Pokemon that is more polarizing, matchup-based, or irritating than Shedinja, as its very existence invalidates multiple common threats like Mega Medicham, Calm Mind Magearna, and Tapu Koko, as well as common variants of Manaphy and Mega Swampert. It has the unique quality of blocking both Volt Switch and U-turn, killing momentum from the likes of Magearna, Tapu Koko, and Mega Scizor. Its immunities can also be put to use against Choice-locked attackers like Tapu Lele and Ash-Greninja, taking advantage of these foes by spreading status. Due to how Shedinja can singlehandedly remove offensive counterplay and generally bug common offense teams, it finds a strong niche on certain stall teams. However, in the same dramatic fashion that it voids these Pokemon, Shedinja is rendered useless when facing sand teams or when Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes are on the field. Additionally, Shedinja is more Pursuit-weak than most, with only one escape afforded to it by its Focus Sash. The biggest nail in the coffin is how prevalent Toxic and Leech Seed are on balanced and defensive teams, meaning that Shedinja is generally only useful against certain Pokemon on those teams, like Mega Latias and Swords Dance Gliscor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spite can be used to efficiently stall out Pokemon Shedinja finds itself in a stalemate with; however, the amount of cases where Swords Dance wouldn't accomplish the same thing along with extra utility is very small. Safety Goggles can replace Focus Sash as an anti-sand alternative, allowing Shedinja to wall Excadrill and Alolan Ninetales and preventing it from being dead weight against sand and hail teams; however, Shedinja misses out on the scouting benefits and ability to force status from Focus Sash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Most entry hazards instantly OHKO Shedinja, meaning they render it useless and embolden wallbreakers like Mega Medicham while they are up.</p> <p><strong>Sand and Hail</strong>: Sand from the likes of Tyranitar and Hippowdon and hail from the rare Alolan Ninetales prevent Shedinja from being used safely, as weather setters are able to KO it by simply switching in as well as prevent its usage for a number of turns.</p> <p><strong>Status and Leech Seed</strong>: Pokemon that Shedinja would otherwise wall, like Chansey, Rotom-W, and Toxapex, can utilize status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp to OHKO it. Manaphy and Mega Swampert sometimes make use of Toxic on their movesets too, surprising Shedinja with its prompt removal. Additionally, Leech Seed users like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and the niche Mega Venusaur pose a similar threat.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, both Mega Charizard formes, and Victini are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can hit Shedinja super effectively. Heatran is especially egregious, as unlike other common Fire-types, it is also immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit from Weavile can force Shedinja's removal, with the prospect of opening up teammates like Mega Medicham making it worth the burn Shedinja can potentially inflict on it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon that Shedinja is accustomed to walling, like Magearna, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele, are no strangers to running Hidden Power Fire, preventing Shedinja from being a safe answer to them.</p> <p><strong>Adverse Contact Effects</strong>: Pokemon with contact-punishing abilities like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and Flame Body, as well as Rocky Helmet users, can severely punish Shedinja's physical attacks with a potential OHKO upon switching in. However, Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Garchomp don't appreciate being burned as they switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is the crown jewel of Shedinja's irritation of the tier; it allows Shedinja to instantly threaten out the physical attackers it doesn't wall, like Kartana and Kyurem-B, synergizing with its Focus Sash as well as punishing switch-ins like Ferrothorn. Toxic can be even more threatening than Will-O-Wisp against special attackers like Tapu Lele and Greninja and Fire-types like Mega Charizard X. However, the trade-off is not crippling physical attackers as hard and being blanked by Steel-types, meaning it should only ever be used as a secondary status move alongside Will-O-Wisp. Protect allows Shedinja to scout super effective coverage like Hidden Power Fire from Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Magearna while also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Kartana and Ash-Greninja and synergizing with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, racking up extra damage from status. X-Scissor and Shadow Sneak let Shedinja strike back at offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Weavile, and Greninja and can even be used alongside Swords Dance to prevent bulky Pokemon like Clefable and Swords Dance Gliscor from sitting on it. The downside to these moves is that they make contact with opposing Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, and Flame Body users, so Shedinja can use Shadow Ball, despite its dramatically lower threat level, to consistently chip away at Pokemon like Ferrothorn as they switch in, compounding with burn to very slowly wear them away.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Lonely nature lets Shedinja 2HKO Tapu Lele with X-Scissor. However, if Shedinja uses Shadow Ball, a Timid nature is better because it lets Shedinja outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor, which is more valuable than boosting the power of Shadow Ball, as Shadow Ball is already weak. Shedinja uses 0 IVs in both of its defensive stats, as it doesn't use them, and this minimizes opposing Ditto's bulk after transforming into Shedinja.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although there are certain Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny that don't run coverage that can hit Shedinja, a lot of other Pokemon that Shedinja is good against, like Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Tapu Lele, do, meaning that scouting out movesets increases Shedinja's effectiveness and your confidence when switching it into the aforementioned Pokemon. Keeping entry hazards away is usually the most important task when using Shedinja, especially when faced with offensive hazard setters like Greninja and Mega Diancie that can threaten common hazard control options on stall, such as Mega Sableye and Defog Gliscor. Make sure to get the most out of Shedinja's status moves, using them liberally and allowing it to make progress against the opposing team rather than act as a passive wall. Swords Dance Shedinja can beat Swords Dance Gliscor one-on-one, OHKOing it with +6 X-Scissor after forcing it to use Roost. If using a variant with Swords Dance, do not waste time setting up if there is an opposing Pokemon with Rocky Helmet or other adverse contact effects; instead, avoid using any attacks at all costs, and aim to status the foe and wear it down. If needed, Shedinja can sacrifice its Focus Sash to spread status to setup threats like Mega Charizard X and Calm Mind Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shedinja is typically only seen on stall teams, as they appreciate Shedinja walling certain stallbreakers like Calm Mind Magearna and Manaphy lacking Toxic. In return, common stall teammates like Toxapex can handle threats like Greninja and both Mega Charizard formes for Shedinja. Having very strong entry hazard removal is instrumental, with at least two methods of hazard control being optimal, such as Magic Bounce from Mega Sableye and Defog from the likes of Gliscor and Skarmory. Chansey and Gliscor can absorb Toxic and Will-O-Wisp aimed at Shedinja, and Mega Sableye can reflect them as well as Leech Seed. Chansey can additionally take on a wide range of special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Mega Alakazam. Toxapex is a great teammate, as it checks Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja and absorbs Toxic Spikes for Shedinja, and it appreciates Shedinja blanking Mega Medicham and Tapu Koko and discouraging Choice Specs Tapu Lele from locking into a Psychic-type move.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>In conjunction with its Dark / Ghost typing, Mega Sableye's solid defensive stats allow it to act as one of the only switch-ins to Mega Medicham in the OU metagame. Mega Sableye's ability Magic Bounce further bolsters its defensive capabilities by reflecting troublesome entry hazards and status moves. Mega Sableye essentially invalidates any passive entry hazard setter aside from Clefable, making it very disruptive versus bulkier teams that rely on stacking entry hazards to do consistent damage. Moreover, Mega Sableye has access to instant recovery, greatly extending its longevity throughout a battle. Unfortunately, Mega Sableye is rather passive due to its atrocious offensive stats, so it is limited to being used on stall teams, where losing momentum is less detrimental. It also cannot take advantage of Prankster Will-O-Wisp or Recover and Mega Evolve on the same turn. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Magearna, and Clefable are all very threatening to Mega Sableye, as they can do huge damage with their super effective Fairy-type STAB attacks while also resisting Knock Off and not being greatly hindered by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out is an alternative option to Protect that is capable of doing damage; however, it is usually the inferior option, as Sableye cannot use it to safely Mega Evolve versus grounded foes while Psychic Terrain is up. Imprison can be run to prevent Reuniclus, a massive threat to most stall teams, from using Recover, effectively neutering it. However, Mega Sableye usually can't forego any of its moves. Mega Sableye can also effectively run a Calm Mind set utilizing either of its STAB moves and Will-O-Wisp, but due to its awful Speed stat and the omnipresence of Fairy-type Pokemon, this set struggles to sweep most teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Magearna, Mega Mawile, Mega Diancie, Clefable, and Tapu Lele can all do massive damage to Mega Sableye with their Fairy-type attacks. These Pokemon can all use Mega Sableye as setup fodder as well, making them particularly dangerous. Mega Mawile has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can deal large amounts of damage to Mega Sableye with their powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Although Will-O-Wisp can deter many setup sweepers from attempting to boost versus Mega Sableye, Pokemon such as  Swords Dance Garchomp, Hone Claws Kyurem-B, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona can circumvent this with Substitute or an outright immunity to the move in the latter two's case.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Kartana, Hoopa-U, Victini, and Ash-Greninja are all very threatening to Mega Sableye, as they are powerful enough to 2HKO it with their respective STAB attacks. However, they can't risk taking a Knock Off, and in the former two's case, Will-O-Wisp as well.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is useful for removing a foe's item and allows Mega Sableye to do direct damage. Foul Play can also be used in this slot in order to do more damage to physically offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Substitute Kyurem-B, but Knock Off's utility is usually more important. Will-O-Wisp deters physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, and Kartana from switching into Mega Sableye, as well as preventing these Pokemon from using it as setup fodder. Recover allows Mega Sableye to consistently check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Mega Alakazam throughout a battle. Lastly, Protect ensures Mega Sableye can Mega Evolve safely at any point during a battle and is also useful when scouting for moves versus Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Specs Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment and a Careful nature allow Mega Sableye to avoid being 2HKOed by uninvested Magma Storm from Heatran while also being able to protect Mega Sableye from various special attackers such as Protean Greninja and Mega Alakazam. An alternate EV spread of maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature can be used in order for Mega Sableye to check powerful physical attackers such as Mega Medicham better, especially if it's running Thunder Punch alongside Tapu Koko. Prankster allows Sableye to burn a threatening foe with priority Will-O-Wisp before Mega Evolving, most notably Mega Mawile and Hone Claws Kyurem-B prior to using Substitute, which would obliterate the stall team Mega Sableye fits in. Sablenite is necessary in order for Sableye to evolve into Mega Sableye.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Mega Sableye into passive entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Toxapex to reflect any entry hazards they attempt to set with Magic Bounce. Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp are very spammable moves and should be used frequently when Mega Sableye does not need to recover its HP. Although Mega Sableye has immense bulk and a reliable recovery move, its inability to passively recover HP with Leftovers means it can be whittled down quickly. It is important to Mega Evolve Sableye in the early stages of a battle so it can properly prevent the opponent from setting up hazards later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Sableye fits best on stall teams that can afford to lose momentum. Therefore, Pokemon such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Clefable make for solid teammates. Clefable is an excellent partner in particular, as with Unaware it can wall sweepers such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Volcarona that attempt to use Mega Sableye as setup fodder. Mega Sableye can reliably prevent an opponent from setting up their own hazards, so Pokemon that despise them such as bulky Volcarona can be good teammates. Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela also have natural synergy with Mega Sableye, as they can combat the Fairy-types that threaten it.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Mawile is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the OU metagame. Solid coverage options like Knock Off, Ice Punch, Fire Fang, and Thunder Punch alongside a setup move in Swords Dance make Mega Mawile impossible to deal with defensively, while its access to Sucker Punch gives it the ability to threaten offensive teams. Its typing, combined with Intimidate, grants it many opportunities to either set up or just attack against common Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T, allowing it to punch holes in teams relatively consistently. However, because of its very poor Speed, Mega Mawile heavily relies on Sucker Punch to deal with faster threats, which allows Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Ash-Greninja to revenge kill it relatively consistently; hence, it struggles more against offensive teams that can overwhelm it before it can get a strong hit off. While Mega Mawile's typing is great, it does give Mega Mawile two weaknesses to extremely common types, namely Ground and Fire, making it vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, which are also bulky enough to take a +2 Sucker Punch. Finally, Mega Mawile has slight issues with picking correct coverage, as it can't always run what it wants.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a niche move choice that's generally a pretty bad move to run on a Pokemon like Mega Mawile because it needs all the coverage it can get, but it can work if you absolutely need to run it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Choice Band Tyranitar, Tapu Koko, and Ash-Greninja can take a +2 Sucker Punch and retaliate for an OHKO with their respective STAB or coverage moves, but none of them can really switch into Mega Mawile. Tapu Lele gets a special mention for Psychic Terrain, which prevents Mega Mawile from using Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Heatran, Mew, and Rotom-W outspeed and cripple Mega Mawile by halving its Attack, meaning Mega Mawile must watch out for them. Mega Sableye deserves a special mention as it can hold off from Mega Evolving just to neuter Mega Mawile with its Prankster-boosted Will-O-Wisp, thus preventing the stall teams it fit in from being obliterated by Mega Mawile, one of their biggest nightmares.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Skarmory can wall Mega Mawile depending on its coverage, but they aren't guaranteed counters by any means. Physically defensive Volcarona can also be quite annoying without entry hazards up, as it isn't weak to any of Mega Mawile's coverage moves, consistently switching into it and threatening it out with a Fire-type STAB move, has reliable recovery, and can punish it with a Flame Body burn.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch gives Mega Mawile the means to hit faster Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Kartana. Knock Off allows Mega Mawile to net neutral coverage on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex, usually OHKOing both after a layer of Spikes at +2. It also has nearly perfect neutral coverage with Play Rough. Thunder Punch can be used over Knock Off for its immediate damage on Pokemon such as Celesteela and Skarmory and it also slightly eases the Toxapex matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Mega Mawile to outspeed Sassy Mega Venusaur and everything below it. Intimidate softens up physical blows and gives Mega Mawile more setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Mawile is best used to soften up defensive teams early- to mid-game so that the rest of its team has an easier time dealing with the remaining Pokemon. Against offensive teams, it's advised to attempt to play aggressively, such as bringing it in on a predicted double switch, so that you can get value out of Mega Mawile in this matchup. Additionally, it's advised to only set up late-game, as early-game, Mega Mawile's checks will be too healthy for it to sweep through them. Mega Mawile is also good at wearing down Pokemon such as Heatran and Landorus-T so that the rest of its team can more easily deal with them. This is especially true with entry hazards on the field. Before Mega Evolving, Mawile can be useful with Intimidate pivoting to help soften blows from physical attackers like Hawlucha, Weavile, Mega Heracross, and Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and both Greninja formes are good partners, as they can grant Mega Mawile an easier time breaking through defensive cores and wearing down Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex. Additionally, Spikes and Stealth Rock can significantly aid Mega Mawile in sweeping late-game, as they can potentially put Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Ash-Greninja in range of +2 Sucker Punch. Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth pair well with Mega Mawile, as they resist Ground and therefore can check Pokemon such as Garchomp and defensive Landorus-T. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W pair well with Mega Mawile, as they can bring it safely so that it does not have to take any unnecessary damage, thereby increasing its longevity and ability to wallbreak. Rotom-W is an especially notable teammate, as it resists Fire and is immune to Ground, which allows it to check Pokemon that Mega Mawile struggles against, such as Landorus-T and Heatran; Rotom-W also has a tendency to bait in Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, allowing it to pivot out with Volt Switch and give Mega Mawile an opportunity to wallbreak. Choice Specs Magnezone can be a pretty good partner for Swords Dance Mega Mawile; Mega Scizor can be a nuisance to it, as can Ferrothorn if Mega Mawile chooses to run Thunder Punch, and Choice Specs Magnezone is pretty reliable at trapping both of these threats. Serperior is also a good teammate because Serperior can help wear down Heatran for Mega Mawile, and vice versa. Serperior is also great at spreading paralysis with Glare, which helps Mega Mawile secure setup opportunities and outspeed the opposing team. Dual screens Tapu Koko can provide momentum for Mega Mawile, help grant it more setup opportunities to potentially sweep against any team archetype, and amplify its Thunder Punch with Electric Terrain. Finally, Mega Mawile is a must-have on Trick Room teams, as it's nearly impossible to stop if it can manage to get a Swords Dance off under Trick Room.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Mega Mawile's strongest move with good neutral coverage. Thunder Punch hits Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Skarmory extremely hard. Sucker Punch allows Mega Mawile to hit faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Kartana. Ice Punch is an option that OHKOes Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and has a minimum damage of 83% to defensive variants, alongside hitting other threats like Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon hard. Brick Break can OHKO offensive Heatran variants and deal significant damage to more defensive ones. Furthermore, it also hits Ferrothorn. Fire Fang's main use is in its ability to OHKO Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and, after entry hazards, Magnezone. Iron Head is a 100% accurate alternative to Play Rough that nets super effective coverage on Clefable and also hits Mega Venusaur neutrally, but it is slightly weaker and generally covers less.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Mega Mawile to outspeed Skarmory and every Pokemon below it. If running Play Rough, 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe is an option to get the jump on Celesteela while making Mega Mawile more bulky. Intimidate is the pre-Mega ability of choice, as it gives Mega Mawile additional chances to attack against foes such as Weavile and Hawlucha. Hyper Cutter can also be used to ignore Intimidate from Landorus-T, but it has limited use otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against defensive teams, attempt to get Mega Mawile in as much as possible so it can punch holes with its great power and coverage. You must play aggressively against offensive teams in order to maximize Mega Mawile's potential, since it would normally be too pressured to get any damage off. Good ways to get Mega Mawile in against an offense team would be by double switching or bringing it in via U-turn or Volt Switch. Make sure to predict whenever the opponent tries to maneuver around Mega Mawile's coverage so that you can get the most value out of it. This set is capable of hitting a large part of the metagame super effectively; thus, it is advised to be very aggressive with this set, as it's quite prediction reliant and can be extremely deadly if played correctly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clefable, Ash-Greninja, and Landorus-T are great partners because they can soften up the opposing team for Mega Mawile to wallbreak more easily. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-W, Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Tornadus-T are excellent partners because they can bring Mega Mawile in safely for it to punch holes, preventing any unnecessary damage to Mega Mawile. Magnezone can even trap Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela so that Mega Mawile does not have to take residual damage when KOing them. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu make for excellent partners because of their ability to switch into Pokemon such as defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp, which are normally offensive checks to Mega Mawile. Since this Mega Mawile set lacks Sucker Punch, fast offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T,  Ash-Greninja, and Weavile are good teammates for their ability to pressure offensive builds. Pokemon such as Shed Shell Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W can help Mega Mawile out against Heatran, which Mega Mawile lacking Fighting-type coverage cannot deal with. Toxapex and Gastrodon can also switch into and deal with bulky Volcarona, which is one of Mega Mawile's roadblocks. Mega Mawile can also be used as a deadly attacker on Trick Room teams, OHKOing a surprising amount of the metagame and 2HKOing almost everything else.</p>"

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute significantly eases prediction with Mega Mawile, protects it from Clefable's and Chansey's Thunder Wave, and enables it to run Focus Punch to deal with Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone without any drawbacks. Thunder Punch is run to deal with Toxapex and Celesteela. Ice Punch is really important to hit Ground-, Grass-, and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, Mega Latias, and Mega Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 HP EVs prevent Mega Mawile's Substitute from being KOed by Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball after Intimidate. 112 Speed EVs are run to outspeed Celesteela. Outspeeding Skarmory is not important because Mega Mawile can simply use Focus Punch to force it into using Roost. Intimidate is preferred over Hyper Cutter so that Mega Mawile has a better chance at taking a hit from physical attackers such as Kartana and Hawlucha.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Mawile is best used to smash through classic defensive cores such as Gliscor + Ferrothorn and Toxapex + Celesteela. You should switch Mega Mawile in on predicted switches from Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T, which it can easily pressure out. From there, Mega Mawile can often afford to set up a Substitute for safety. There's often not much need to predict offensively with Mega Mawile, as using Substitute on a switch gives it a lot of freedom to attack what's in front of it. You should be wary of chip damage, however, because between damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and setting up a Substitute, Mega Mawile can be worn down quite quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Tapu Lele really appreciate Mega Mawile's ability to beat Heatran. Clefable especially makes for a great teammate, as it can support Mega Mawile with Wish, and its Calm Mind sets become much more threatening with Heatran out of the way. Despite Mega Mawile's ability to beat Heatran with a Substitute up, it's still important to pack checks like Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W for it because it is still able to pressure Mega Mawile through aggressive switches. Mega Mawile benefits greatly from Spikes setters such as Ash-Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Greninja, as it can force many switches. Tapu Bulu and Mega Mawile also synergize well together; Tapu Bulu is able to set Grassy Terrain for Mega Mawile, granting it passive recovery while weakening Earthquake, while Mega Mawile can take advantage of Tornadus-T. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko can generate momentum, which Mega Mawile can use to switch into play.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Aggron carves its niche in the OU metagame as a reliable answer to non-Focus Punch Mega Mawile and Icium Z Kyurem-B on stall teams while being a good entry hazard setter on its own. Its pure Steel typing, gigantic Defense stat, and ability Filter also allow it to deal with some other of the metagame's most common and dangerous physical attackers such as Choice-locked Kartana, both Tyranitar formes, and Mega Pinsir. With a high base Attack stat, Mega Aggron is also able to pressure some other threats to stall teams, such as Clefable and Mega Diancie, unlike stall's other Mega Evolution option in Mega Sableye. Furthermore, its superb movepool makes Mega Aggron capable of using various practical moves in the last moveslot, letting it check different threats depending on the needs of the team it is on. Unfortunately, Mega Aggron needs hard support in form of Wish from its teammates to keep healthy due to its lack of reliable recovery, which distinguishes it from Mega Sableye and even Mega Slowbro. Even with a damage-reducing ability, Mega Aggron's Special Defense is not always sufficient, making it struggle against stronger special attackers such as Firium Z Heatran, Focus Blast Magearna, and Fightinium Z Tapu Lele.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is an option to make Mega Aggron less dependent on Wish support, allowing it to keep its health high during the match, but the drawback of being asleep for two turns can render the move worthless, as it lets setup sweepers use Mega Aggron as setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Alomomola, are easily capable of crippling Mega Aggron with chip damage or a Scald burn, while only fearing the rare Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Despite not being able to switch in safely, Heatran can pose a big threat to Mega Aggron, OHKOing it easily with Inferno Overdrive. Volcarona, especially its bulky set, can use Mega Aggron as setup fodder, and while it isn't the biggest problem to stall teams, Mega Charizard Y is capable of OHKOing Mega Aggron with Flamethrower with ease.</p> <p><strong>Special Attacking Wallbreakers</strong>: Hydreigon can easily 2HKO Mega Aggron with Black Hole Eclipse followed by Earth Power, and pre-transformed Ash-Greninja can 2HKO even the bulkiest variant of Mega Aggron with a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, not being OHKOed by anything Mega Aggron normally carries.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If burned, Mega Aggron struggles to pressure its targets, such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Mawile, leaving it unable to function well for the rest of the game. Paralysis, while not as detrimental as a burn, can make Mega Aggron lose versus Heatran and Serperior one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Mega Aggron lacks Ice Punch, Garchomp and Gliscor can use it as setup fodder, as Heavy Slam doesn't do enough damage to prevent them getting boosts. At +2, Garchomp can OHKO a Rough Skin-weakened Mega Aggron with Earthquake. If Mega Aggron lacks Fire Punch, it falls victim to Mega Scizor and Kartana instead. Taunt Gyarados and Mega Gyarados can both use Mega Aggron as a setup fodder as well. Manaphy, Keldeo, and Double Dance Reuniclus also find almost-free opportunities to set up against Mega Aggron, as most of its moves don't bother them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mega Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heavy Slam gives Mega Aggron the ability to OHKO three huge threats to stall teams in Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie, as well as OHKO Clefable with little chip damage and 2HKO Tornadus-T and Mega Latios. Earthquake aims to hit Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Toxapex, relieving the pressure that all of them put on the rest of the team. It also can be used to hit Magnezone, in the case that Mega Aggron gets trapped by it. Ice Punch 2HKOes offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, which all take minimal damage from Mega Aggron's Heavy Slam, threaten Mega Aggron with super effective Ground-type STAB moves, and can pose a threat to stall teams depending on the set. Fire Punch has the same objective but instead targets Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, achieving a 2HKO on all of them while having a favorable chance to OHKO the former. Protect helps Mega Aggron scout moves and waste either PP from the opposing team or turns from weather or screens. It can also serve as a way to make Mega Medicham lose half of its health by missing High Jump Kick, making it much easier to deal with. Toxic puts Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Rotom-W on a timer, since they aren't bothered by Mega Aggron's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs, 200 Special Defense EVs, and a Careful nature allow Mega Aggron to endure two Psychics from Choice Specs Tapu Lele under Psychic Terrain without Stealth Rock damage, while 56 Attack EVs let it OHKO maximum HP Heatran with Earthquake almost every time. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to let Mega Aggron outspeed uninvested base 50s, such as Chansey and Alolan Muk. An offensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD and an Adamant nature can be used in order to OHKO Garchomp and Gliscor with Ice Punch after Stealth Rock damage and deal more damage with Heavy Slam against the likes of Tornadus-T and Reuniclus, but the lack of special bulk investment can be detrimental in some situations.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to lead with Aggron, especially if the last move that you are using is Protect, and Mega Evolve as soon as possible in order to get rid of its poor defensive typing. If it is not possible to Mega Evolve Aggron on the first turn, try to bring Aggron in with a free switch, as even a resisted special move can make Aggron lose a lot of its health and consequently make it more dependent on Wish to heal. Avoid letting Mega Aggron's HP get too low; if that occurs, Mega Aggron can become unable to pivot into the Pokemon that it normally could. When pivoting, try to bring it in against special attackers that fear and can't do much against it such as Tornadus-T without Focus Blast and Mega Latios or against physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir and Weavile. Entry hazards, specially Spikes, can be somewhat detrimental to Mega Aggon, as it turns some 3HKOs against it turn into 2HKOs, such as Offensive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic, leaving it unable to pivot into those threats. Therefore, try to keep them off your side of the field in order to preserve Mega Aggron's ability to consistently swallow hits. Mega Aggron's ability to pressure opposing hazard setters, such as Clefable and Mega Diancie, must be used as much as possible, so try to predict the opponent switching one of them in and double switch into them; since Mega Aggron can OHKO the former with little chip damage and outright eliminate the latter with ease, they will be discouraged from attempting to set up hazards. However, beware of Mega Diancie's Earth Power, as it can weaken Mega Aggron to a point where it can no longer switch in on threats without the risk of being KOed. Also, be wary of switching in on coverage moves from Mega Mawile and Tapu Lele; for example, pivoting in on Focus Punch Mawile will make Mega Aggron lose more than half of its health, while pivoting in on Focus Blast Tapu Lele will result in Mega Aggron getting 2HKOed, and in both cases Mega Aggron will be unable to check the threats it used to. With this, scouting for those moves is fundamental.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Mega Aggron lacks a reliable form of recovery, Wish support is almost mandatory on teams with it. Chansey, Clefable, and Jirachi are all available and able to fit well on stall teams, with Chansey being the most effective, since its Wish heals all of Mega Aggron's HP, while Clefable forms a good Steel / Fairy core with it. Also, Chansey is a formidable counter to most special wallbreakers and sweepers, including Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, beating them with ease for Mega Aggron. Entry hazard removers, specifically Zapdos and Mew, are good partners, as both check or counter some of Mega Aggron's checks, such as Celesteela in the case of Zapdos and Mega Medicham in Mew's situation, while keeping the field clear, making Mega Aggron's job of checking Pokemon easier. Since you're forgoing using Mega Sableye in the team's Mega slot, this kind of support is more indispensable than normal. Cleric support, or even a status absorber, is crucial to Mega Aggron teams. Chansey and Clefable can provide Heal Bell support to heal status, while Gliscor can pivot into status inducers, preventing other targets. Lastly, Buzzwole is an excellent partner to Mega Aggron, since it can pivot into the physical attackers that still can pose a threat to Mega Aggron, such as Tapu Bulu, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mega Heracross.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack stat, making it one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the OU tier. Powerful STAB attacks in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt in conjunction with solid coverage moves such as Thunder Punch and Ice Punch make Mega Medicham even more challenging to switch into. Mega Medicham's base 100 Speed stat allows it to outpace Heatran, Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T, among other threatening Pokemon. Mega Medicham also has access to priority moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch, which help patch up its only decent Speed stat and allow it to pick off faster offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam. Mega Medicham's relatively low Speed stat alongside very poor bulk makes it rather easy to revenge kill. Despite Mega Medicham's power, it has issues breaking through bulky Psychic-types such as Mew, Reuniclus, and Slowbro.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psycho Cut can be used over Zen Headbutt for improved accuracy and a lack of contact; however, it is slightly weaker and misses out on the flinch chance of Zen Headbutt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Reuniclus resist Mega Medicham's dual STAB combination and can threaten it with crippling status or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, Ash-Greninja, and Tornadus-T all outspeed Mega Medicham and can target it for huge damage with their powerful STAB attacks. However, they have to be wary of Mega Medicham's priority attacks, especially if they are at low health.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Mega Medicham is completely ruined by burn from the likes of Toxapex's Scald and Volcarona's Flame Body and paralysis from Chansey's Thunder Wave and Zapdos's Static, meaning it has to be careful of switching into status-spreading defensive Pokemon. Neither Volcarona or Zapdos are sturdy switch-ins, however, and must rely on chance to status Mega Medicham.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Blacephalon are immune to Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick, and can also hit it for super effective damage with their Ghost-type STAB moves. Mega Sableye is particularly bothersome for Mega Medicham, as it is immune to both of its STAB moves and can burn Mega Medicham with Will-O-Wisp. Similarly, although slower than Mega Medicham, the rare Mimikyu has access to STAB super effective priority Shadow Sneak which can heavily damage Mega Medicham.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out deals chip damage and allows Mega Medicham to revenge kill weakened offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam. High Jump Kick is an incredibly hard-hitting Fighting-type STAB move, dealing immense damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it and even some that do. Ice Punch provides solid coverage alongside High Jump Kick, nailing Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Mega Latias. Zen Headbutt completes Mega Medicham's dual STAB and allows it to break through Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur and hit neutral targets hard without the riskiness of High Jump Kick. Thunder Punch can also be used in this slot in order to hit bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro for super effective damage while still nailing Toxapex. Thunder Punch is best used in tandem with Tapu Koko, as Electric Terrain boosts its power, allowing Mega Medicham to do huge damage to traditional counters such as Mega Sableye. Lastly, Bullet Punch is an alternative option to further alleviate Mega Medicham's rather poor Speed stat, and it works particularly well with Fake Out for revenge killing weakened faster threats like Weavile and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar. It's also very useful for OHKOing Mega Diancie, which otherwise forces Mega Medicham out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allow Mega Medicham to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Landorus-T, and Kyurem-B. An Adamant nature can be used for more power and if the aforementioned Pokemon are not particularly threatening to Mega Medicham's teammates. An Adamant nature also allows Mega Medicham to usually OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Punch as well as 2HKO defensive variants of Tapu Fini with Zen Headbutt. Telepathy is the best ability pre-Mega Evolution because it prevents ability thieves such as Ditto from abusing Pure Power before Medicham Mega Evolves. Although this is a very rare scenario, Medicham will never need to make use of Pure Power before it Mega Evolves. Once it has Mega Evolved, Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack stat and allows it to properly wallbreak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beware of using High Jump Kick when the opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon, as they are immune to the move. Similarly, Mega Medicham should watch out for Protect users such as Celesteela and Heatran. Mega Medicham has very poor defensive stats, and as such, should not be switched into attacks, since even powerful resisted attacks will do significant damage. Use Mega Medicham's teammates to generate as much momentum as possible for it. Slow U-turns and Volt Switches as well as aggressive double switches can be very beneficial in order to get Mega Medicham as many free switch ins as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W are excellent partners alongside Mega Medicham, as they generate momentum and provide Mega Medicham with free switch ins to wreak havoc. Entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Heatran also work well with Mega Medicham, as it forces a large number of switches, so entry hazard damage racks up quickly. Pursuit users such as Weavile and Tyranitar can trap opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Blacephalon that are immune to Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick, as well as Psychic-types such as Mega Latias and Slowbro that resist Mega Medicham's dual STAB combination. Mega Medicham is an incredible early- and mid-game wallbreaker, so naturally late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Kartana make for solid partners, as they appreciate Mega Medicham's ability to break through even the bulkiest of walls. Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele work well alongside Mega Medicham, as they set up Electric and Psychic Terrain respectively, boosting the power of Thunder Punch and Zen Headbutt. When pairing Mega Medicham with Tapu Lele, however, it is important to note that it cannot use Fake Out and Bullet Punch versus grounded opponents while Psychic Terrain is active.</p>"

Mega Camerupt's offensive STAB combination gives very little in the way of defensive switch-ins, mainly limited to Chansey and Ground-immune Fire-resistant Pokemon like Mega Latias and Rotom-W. Mega Camerupt's typing is a double-edged sword with a weakness to Ground and a 4x weakness to Water-type moves. Even weak Water-type attacks from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Tapu Fini can threaten to dispatch Mega Camerupt, as well as hard hitters like Mega Swampert, Crawdaunt, and Ash Greninja; the latter two can even remove Mega Camerupt while Trick Room is up through priority attacks. Despite Mega Camerupt's positive matchups against many Fire-, Fairy-, and Electric-types, its bulk is nowhere near infallible, and it lacks recovery, meaning it can find it difficult to get in safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When in the sun, Mega Camerupt can make use of Growth to double its Special Attack and even use Solar Beam for bulky Water-types.

Offensive Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Keldeo don't want to always switch into Mega Camerupt, but they can still easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Dragonite resist both of Mega Camerupt's STAB moves and can hit back hard with their own STAB attacks, threatening it out. Other Dragon-types like Garchomp and Mega Altaria can threaten Mega Camerupt Earthquake or Toxic and can pivot into Mega Camerupt's Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Although Mega Camerupt's raw strength is difficult to rival, its mediocre bulk and terrible Speed mean it is often outsped and KOed by other wallbreakers like Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham.

Toxic lets Mega Camerupt punish common switch-ins like Mega Latias and Rotom-W. Substitute eases Mega Camerupt's need for prediction on the many switches it can force. Rock Slide lets Mega Camerupt OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, letting it check them in a pinch. Nature Power opens up a new world of coverage for Mega Camerupt, with Grassy Terrain granting a Sheer Force- and Terrain-boosted Energy Ball to dispatch Rotom-W, Electric Terrain giving Mega Camerupt access to a Thunderbolt for Pelipper and Gyarados, and Misty Terrain gifting Moonblast to 2HKO Mega Latias and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs let Mega Camerupt outspeed uninvested base 35 Speed Pokemon, mainly Toxapex. This also outspeeds other slower Pokemon like Quagsire, Mega Sableye, and Slowbro. Mega Camerupt is given maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature to maximize its damage output, with the remaining EVs put into its HP for better bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Camerupt makes use of its typing to gain safe entry against Volt Switch users like Tapu Koko and Magearna to unleash its powerful attacks. Because Mega Camerupt isn't very bulky and is very slow, positioning is key for using it, so VoltTurn cores help it hit the field safely. Mega Camerupt is generally only sent out in situations where it completely walls the opposing Pokemon, such as against Tapu Koko, Magearna, Zapdos, and Magnezone, as making trades is often unfavorable for it due to its terrible Speed. However, in a pinch, Mega Camerupt can make trades against Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Camerupt appreciates pivots like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T to position it to punch holes in the opposition. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja can clean up teams weakened by Mega Camerupt's onslaught. Tapu Bulu is a great partner for Mega Camerupt, taking on Water-types while Mega Camerupt takes on Steel- and Fire-types like Magearna and Heatran. Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain reduces the power of any Earthquake aimed at Mega Camerupt and grants it access to Energy Ball through Nature Power. Mega Camerupt can be found on semi-dedicated Trick Room teams with Trick Room setters like Magearna, though it can also be used on full Trick Room teams with extra Trick Room setters like Uxie and Cresselia alongside other Trick Room attackers like Alolan Marowak.</p>"

Its Dragon / Fairy typing lets it match up well against Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and both of the Mega Charizard formes. In addition to this, it has great support options that include the coveted Heal Bell as well as Defog, and it has the option to stay in its pre-Mega Evolved forme in the early- to mid-game to make use of Natural Cure despite the Stealth Rock weakness and different typing. It isn't weak, either; its Pixilate-boosted Fairy-type STAB moves hit neutral targets for consistent damage and dissuade the likes of Kyurem-B from switching in. However, despite the coverage options it has, Mega Altaria can be prone to passivity considering the many different defensive answers to it that Mega Altaria requires different coverage to threaten. Secondly, the tier is crammed with Pokemon that outspeed and threaten out Mega Altaria, with Mega Mawile, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie all being able to OHKO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Voice is better for physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T and Rotom-W and Substitute users like Hawlucha and Serperior, OHKOing the former, but it misses out on the paralysis chance of Body Slam. On this set, Toxic is preferred over Roar, as Body Slam's paralysis won't get in the way of it, and Mega Altaria should run a Bold nature and 32 SpA EVs taken out of Defense to allow it to 2HKO Mega Charizard X with Hyper Voice. Flamethrower allows Mega Altaria to 2HKO Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, and Mega Scizor and OHKO Kartana and pressure other Steel-types barring Heatran. Ice Beam poses a major threat to Gliscor and Landorus-T, 2HKOing even fully specially defensive Gliscor. Mega Altaria can be used as a Defogger, but using it as the sole entry hazard removal of your team is less than preferable considering that before Mega Evolution, it's weak to Stealth Rock, after Mega Evolving, it's vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it has no passive recovery in either forme. Dragon Dance can be used to make Mega Altaria a late-game wincon; however, it requires extensive support and has lots of poor matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Excadrill find free entry and opportunities to set up with Swords Dance against Mega Altaria. Ferrothorn and Heatran also wall it and can use the opportunity to set entry hazards. Celesteela and Jirachi completely wall Mega Altaria and threaten it out with their Steel-type STAB moves. However, Mega Altaria can tack on Flamethrower to hit many of the listed Pokemon hard, notably 2HKOing Ferrothorn and Mega Mawile and OHKOing Kartana, as well as Earthquake to OHKO offensive Heatran and 2HKO its maximum HP sets.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type coverage</strong>: Weavile and Kyurem-B can threaten out Mega Altaria, with Weavile OHKOing with Icicle Crash after minimal chip and Kyurem-B vaporizing Mega Altaria with its Z-Move. However, these two don't want to switch in directly due to their weakness to Fairy. Ice Beam users like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Protean Greninja and Ice Punch users like Mega Swampert and Mega Medicham are significantly threatening to Mega Altaria, even more so before its Mega Evolution.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Magearna resists Mega Altaria's STAB attacks and can bowl it over with Fleur Cannon in response. Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele outspeed Mega Altaria and threaten to OHKO it outright, with Tapu Koko only needing minimal chip to KO it with Choice Specs Dazzling Gleam and consistently removing Mega Altaria from full health with Twinkle Tackle. Clefable avoids the 2HKO from Body Slam, so it can set up on Mega Altaria with Calm Mind or otherwise waste its Roost PP with repeated Moonblasts.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers and Hazard Setters</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, Clefable, and Swords Dance Gliscor aren't immediately threatened by Altaria and can set up on variants lacking Roar, though Gliscor must first activate its Toxic Orb lest it risk paralysis from Body Slam. Toxapex, Clefable, and the aforementioned Gliscor all find easy entry against Mega Altaria and can set entry hazards without much consequence.</p>",

Roost is a necessity to keep healthy in the face of attackers like Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard Y that it may switch into handle multiple times throughout a game, as well as healing off entry hazard damage.

Earthquake could be used instead to threaten Heatran and chip down Magearna and Mega Mawile at the expense of its matchup against Fire-types. Heal Bell provides Altaria's whole team with extra longevity. Additionally, non-Mega Altaria's Natural Cure takes the pressure off of Heal Bell's PP, meaning Altaria doesn't have to spend it on itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Altaria outspeeds Crawdaunt. The Special Defense investment ensures that non-Mega Altaria always avoids the 2HKO from Greninja's Dark Pulse. The rest of the EVs are pooled into Defense to better take on the likes of Mega Charizard X and Hawlucha, notably avoiding the 2HKO from Mega Heracross's Rock Blast while Mega Evolved.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early in the game, Altaria often prefers to hold off on its Mega Evolution to retain Natural Cure to absorb status from the likes of Toxapex, Lava Plume Heatran, and Serperior. Mega Altaria prefers to be a secondary measure against the likes of Mega Charizard X and Ash-Greninja, though these matchups are prime examples of when Altaria should Mega Evolve should your primary answer to them get overwhelmed or needs to be saved for something else. Otherwise, usage of Altaria is somewhat straightforward in that it uses its defensive typing to check the aforementioned threats when needed, and it can find plenty of Heal Bell opportunities against these Pokemon or against status-reliant Pokemon like Serperior, Toxapex, and Gliscor before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Altaria is used on balance and semi-stall teams as cleric support along with its defensive profile of checking Fire-types and Ash-Greninja as well as having the Fairy typing to block Kommo-o's Clangorous Soulblaze. Steel-types like Heatran, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are directly beneficial to Altaria, handling Fairy-types like Clefable, Magearna, and Mega Mawile, with Mega Altaria providing an answer to offensive Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona in response. The cleric support that Altaria brings is great for clearing Toxic for teammates like Gastrodon and Slowbro and paralysis for Reuniclus. To alleviate Mega Altaria's passivity, entry hazards like Spikes from Ferrothorn and Skarmory, Toxic Spikes from Toxapex, and Stealth Rock from Seismitoad and Heatran are helpful. Toxapex and Seismitoad provide a solid answer to Water- and Fire-types alongside setting hazards, taking pressure off of Mega Altaria defensively, with Toxapex additionally absorbing Toxic Spikes. Bulky Ground-types like the aforementioned Seismitoad and Gastrodon are great at handling Volt Switch users like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko, preventing them from using Mega Altaria for momentum, as well as beating Heatran and Magearna. Entry hazard removal is important due to pre-Mega Altaria's weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of passive recovery, so Defoggers like Tornadus-T, Skarmory, and Zapdos or other removal like Rapid Spin Excadrill is necessary support.</p>"

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt is a niche pick on offensive teams thanks to its extremely powerful Choice Band- and Adaptability-boosted Water- and Dark-type STAB attacks, which hit virtually the entire tier for neutral damage. Useful utility in Knock Off allows Crawdaunt to offer fantastic support to offensive teams by removing items such as Tangrowth's Assault Vest, Tapu Bulu's Leftovers, and Tapu Fini's Leftovers to give teammates an easier chance at sweeping late-game. Unlike Weavile and Tyranitar, Crawdaunt can easily 2HKO Reuniclus after an Acid Armor boost thanks to Adaptability and prevent it from overwhelming offensive teams. Moreover, Aqua Jet is a helpful priority move that allows Crawdaunt to patch up its poor Speed and revenge kill Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Diancie, which can be hard to switch into for offensive teams. Despite its strong attacks and priority, Crawdaunt's poor Speed stat means that it struggles to excel in a metagame filled with faster offensive threats that can easily revenge kill it like Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu. Crawdaunt's lackluster defensive typing and mediocre defensive stats also leave it vulnerable to the plethora of strong moves that flood the OU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower can be used in the final slot over Crunch but is vastly inferior, seeing as this set's primary purpose is to remove items with Knock Off, and most Superpower targets like Ferrothorn, Ash-Greninja, and Hydreigon are crippled by Knock Off or forced to Roost. A Swords Dance set can be used but is generally inferior because Crawdaunt is too slow to find an opportunity to boost its Attack without taking a significant amount of damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Kartana can beat Crawdaunt with their Grass-type STAB attacks and resist its Water-type STAB attacks but don't appreciate their items being removed. Tapu Bulu deserves a special mention because it also resists Crawdaunt's Dark-type STAB attacks and has several potential methods of recovering its HP. Although uncommon, Mega Venusaur is the one of the best defensive checks to Crawdaunt, as it only fears Crunch and can OHKO Crawdaunt with Giga Drain to heal any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Mega Evolutions</strong>: Certain Mega Evolutions like Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Gyarados don't take much damage from Knock Off. The first two can proceed to OHKO Crawdaunt with their super effective STAB attacks but can't switch into Crabhammer, while Mega Gyarados resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele all outspeed Crawdaunt and easily OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks but cannot directly switch into it. Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain protects it from Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, making it one of the best offensive checks to Crawdaunt one-on-one.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is an extremely strong and useful STAB attack, removing items from any Pokemon that attempts to switch into it such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Crabhammer is used over Waterfall due to its higher Base Power, allowing Crawdaunt to wallbreak more effectively and 2HKO Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Scizor, which Waterfall fails to do. Aqua Jet is useful priority for revenge killing weakened Pokemon that Crawdaunt can't outspeed, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T. Crunch is useful in very specific instances when Crawdaunt wants to hit certain Pokemon without an item harder than it otherwise would with Knock Off and doesn't want to risk missing with Crabhammer; some examples include Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Tangrowth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>When paired with Adaptability, a Choice Band transforms Crawdaunt into a scary wallbreaker that is very hard to switch into thanks to its great Water- and Dark-type STAB coverage. A Jolly nature could be used to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T, but Landorus-T often runs significant Speed investment, so an Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Crawdaunt's wallbreaking potential.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring in Crawdaunt through VoltTurn support or predicted doubles, as even resisted hits like Heatran's Magma Storm and Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulse will deal a respectable amount of damage. One of Crawdaunt's selling points is being able to remove items with its Adaptability-boosted Knock Off, so don't hesitate to use it if the opponent depends on Pokemon like Tapu Bulu or Tangrowth as their Water-type answer. If the opponent has a bulky Fairy-type that doesn't mind tanking a Knock Off and can recover easily, such as Clefable or Pain Split Magearna, try to catch these Pokemon on the switch with Crabhammer. Tapu Bulu resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and can recover HP via Grassy Terrain and Synthesis, so try to cripple it with Knock Off to potentially remove its Leftovers and then switch out to a Pokemon that can threaten it out. Aqua Jet's low Base Power means that it's rather easy to switch into, and as such, it should generally only be used for chip damage when Crawdaunt is at low HP and up against a foe that can KO Crawdaunt or against faster foes that Crawdaunt can revenge kill, such as Volcarona, weakened Mega Alakazam, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crawdaunt feels right at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn support because it finds few opportunities to come in freely due to its mediocre bulk. Teammates that can usually bring in Crawdaunt safely include Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T. Assault Vest Magearna in particular is a wonderful teammate thanks to its ability to switch into Tapu Lele and bring in Crawdaunt with a slow Volt Switch. Tornadus-T is also a fantastic teammate for its ability to switch into Grass-types that can beat Crawdaunt, such as Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Kartana, and bring Crawdaunt into play with U-turn on forced switches. It's useful to have fast offensive Pokemon on the team to patch up Crawdaunt's poor Speed for a wallbreaker. Mega Lopunny is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier and possesses excellent offensive synergy with Crawdaunt, while Tapu Koko appreciates Crawdaunt's Knock Off support, can threaten bulky Water-types for Crawdaunt, and can bring it in via U-turn against the Ground-types that Tapu Koko draws in. Certain late-game sweepers that appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to remove items from bulky Pokemon make for very good offensive partners. For example, Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja have an easier time sweeping once Landorus-T's Choice Scarf or Tangrowth's Assault Vest is removed. Rocky Helmet Garchomp can cripple Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu, and Heatran can use Toxic or Magma Storm to wear down Pokemon like Greninja and Tapu Fini.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence fills a small niche in the OU tier thanks to its access to Dragon Dance, solid Attack and Speed, and amazing ability in Moxie. Its Speed tier allows it to stand out compared to other Flyinium Z users such as Dragonite, Gyarados, and Landorus-T; after one Dragon Dance, Salamence outpaces speed demons Mega Alakazam and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, Salamence has multiple factors holding it back. Its resistance-laden typing is betrayed by its relevant weaknesses to Rock, Fairy, and Ice, with the first giving it a nasty vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Even with an Attack boost, Salamence can struggle to break past physical walls such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Skarmory, and can be hit first by priority users like Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny, the first being especially potent due to its super effective Ice Shard, and faster Choice Scarf users such as Kartana and Greninja. It also faces heavy competition from other Flyinium Z users, such as Dragonite, which shares its Dragon / Flying typing but has access to an incredible ability in Multiscale, and Gyarados, which has better STAB options and access to Taunt. As a result, it is difficult to justify fitting Salamence onto teams and requires a lot of support to utilize its full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salamence can run other Z-Crystals such as Dragonium Z, Groundium Z, and Rockium Z to hit targets such as Rotom-W, threaten Toxapex without a boost, and hit Zapdos without having to risk missing with Stone Edge, respectively. Unfortunately, it needs to give up the immediate breaking power of Flyinium Z to run these Z-Crystals, making Salamence less threatening against Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T. Running Dragonium Z also requires Salamence to run Outrage, which is blanked by Fairy-types and allows them to force a revenge kill if it locks into it. Salamence can also run coverage moves such as Aqua Tail to more easily threaten the likes of Gliscor and Landorus-T, and Iron Tail to smash Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu. However, giving up Substitute leaves it threatened by status moves such as Toxic from Slowbro, while giving up Stone Edge makes it less threatening against Zapdos. Salamence can use an Adamant nature to maximize its damage output and have the highest possible chance to OHKO Slowbro with a +1 Supersonic Skystrike after Stealth Rock. However, this leaves it much easier to revenge kill, with Choice Scarf Landorus-T now able to outpace it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Weavile is faster than Salamence before a boost and forces it out with Ice Shard. Ice-type coverage moves, such as Hidden Power Ice from Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko, Ice Punch from Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert, and Ice Beam from Mega Latias and Protean Greninja, also threaten an OHKO on Salamence. However, frail attackers like Weavile, Mega Alakazam, and Greninja cannot switch in directly and require proper positioning.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: If Salamence has used up its Z-Move or hasn't obtained any Dragon Dance boosts, defensive Fairy-types like Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Mega Altaria can survive Salamence's STAB move and strike back with their super effective STAB moves. Tapu Fini can also burn Salamence with Scald. Defensive variants of Magearna can survive a +1 Earthquake and retaliate back with Fleur Cannon or Ice Beam. Tapu Bulu deserves a mention because it can use Protect to blank Fly. It must watch out for Supersonic Skystrike, however.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Mega Tyranitar has enough bulk to survive a +1 Earthquake and retaliate back with Stone Edge. Salamence must also watch out for Pokemon that may carry Rock-type coverage, such as Stone Edge Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T resist Supersonic Skystrike and threaten Salamence back in return. Zapdos and Thundurus-T scare Salamence out with Hidden Power Ice, while Rotom-W threatens to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Utility variants of Thundurus-T can also prevent Salamence from boosting thanks to Taunt. However, Zapdos and Thundurus-T have to be wary of Stone Edge, and all three can be taken out by Dragonium Z variants.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Skarmory is bulky enough to take anything that Salamence throws at it and can heal with Roost and retaliate back with Counter. It can also phaze Salamence with Whirlwind, removing its stat boosts. Slowbro is worth mentioning because it has a favorable roll to survive a +1 Supersonic Skystrike and threaten an OHKO back with Ice Beam, while Mega Slowbro hard counters Salamence, surviving a +2 Supersonic Skystrike thanks to its massive Defense stat. Defensive Landorus-T reduces Salamence's Attack stat thanks to Intimidate and can hit it hard with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Greninja outspeed Salamence after a Dragon Dance boost and threaten it back with major damage. Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can come in multiple times throughout the game and wear down Salamence with Fake Out. If Salamence has used up its Z-Move, Mega Scizor can take anything except for Fire Fang, use it as setup bait, and force it out with Bullet Punch. The priority move that poses the biggest problem to Salamence is Weavile's Ice Shard because it threatens it with an immediate OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: The presence of Stealth Rock is very annoying for Salamence, as it cuts into its HP, leaving it susceptible to revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Kartana.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Flyinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance turns Salamence into a dangerous wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Fly turns into Supersonic Skystrike, giving Salamence a one-time strong burst of damage to blow through neutral targets like Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, and Landorus-T, with its regular version still letting it hit the likes of Tapu Bulu, Kommo-o, and Serperior if needed. Earthquake complements Salamence's Flying-type STAB move by smashing through Magearna, Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Mega Mawile. Substitute lets Salamence ignore status attempts from the likes of Toxic Slowbro and Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W as well as Leech Seed from Ferrothorn. Substitute is also helpful for blocking Intimidate from Landorus-T and Mawile before Mega Evolving. Stone Edge tears through the likes of Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Dragonite. Finally, Fire Fang hits Steel-types that are unbothered by Earthquake such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Kartana.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele before a boost, Speed tie with Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, and outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T after a boost. Moxie allows Salamence to snowball after a KO and has great synergy with Supersonic Skystrike, which lets it more easily score a KO thanks to its high damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Salamence shines best as a wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Depending on the matchup, determine if Salamence needs to sweep or wallbreak for its teammates to clean up later in the game and act accordingly. Salamence often finds opportunities to set up against Pokemon that it can easily force out, such as Heatran and Choice Scarf Kartana locked into Leaf Blade. If Salamence has Substitute, it can also take advantage of status users such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn lacking Gyro Ball, which cannot easily break its Substitute. If Salamence lacks Substitute, it needs to be careful of what it sets up on, because Pokemon like Toxapex, Chansey, and Heatran will threaten it with status, while Ferrothorn can wear it down with Leech Seed. Salamence also needs to be sure to carefully time the use of its Z-Move, as it will be wasted if the opponent baits it by switching into a Flying-resistant Pokemon or sacrificing a weakened Pokemon to entry hazards. It's preferable to commit to wallbreaking or sweeping in one attempt, as switching Salamence around and taking chip damage will decrease its setup opportunities later in the game, especially since it's weak to Stealth Rock and can be made more susceptible to revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flyinium Z Salamence finds its niche on hyper offense teams, which appreciate the snowball effect provided thanks to Moxie. A dedicated lead such as Mega Diancie, Excadrill, Taunt Mew, or Imprison Landorus-T is mandatory, as being able to deny entry hazards while setting up hazards of its own sets the stage for Salamence perfectly. Hazard removal is also highly recommended, so pairing it with a Defogger such as Serperior is greatly beneficial. Serperior also provides paralysis support with Glare and has the benefit of beating bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Slowbro one-on-one. Paralysis support is especially helpful if Salamence runs Substitute, as the chance of full paralysis grants it extra opportunities to set up with Dragon Dance. Magearna provides a solid answer to the likes of Weavile, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. In return, Salamence takes advantage of Fire-types that threaten Magearna such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Salamence also enjoys pairing with Fire-type teammates such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, as they can threaten Steel-types such as Celesteela and Skarmory and break past the likes of Clefable and Zapdos for Salamence to clean up. Lunar Dance support from Cresselia is beneficial, replenishing Salamence's HP lost from chip damage and Substitute as well as clearing status, granting it another chance at setting up to clean the opposing team. Flying-types like Mega Pinsir and Hawlucha can overwhelm shared checks for Salamence to clean up later in the game, and vice versa. If Salamence has Stone Edge, the removal of Zapdos is greatly beneficial, as Zapdos gives Mega Pinsir and Hawlucha major trouble.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Latias is a metagame staple thanks to its bulk, movepool, and defensive profile. It can come in on common Pokemon like Heatran, Kartana, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Zapdos, Rockium Z Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Battle Bond Greninja using Water-type moves consistently throughout a game. Mega Latias also outspeeds many of these Pokemon, notably Kartana, forcing them out with attacks like Ice Beam, Hidden Power, and Psychic. It's also one of the few Pokemon that can take any one move from Mega Medicham and threaten it back, giving faster-paced teams a decent answer to a Pokemon that usually requires a more passive switch-in. It's also the easiest answer to Swords Dance Gliscor to fit on teams. Mega Latias also has other options like Thunder Wave, Defog, and Calm Mind; its devastating Calm Mind set can outlast many offensive teams and threaten common balance and stall staples, including Toxapex, a common Haze user. However, Mega Latias struggles with four-moveslot syndrome. If its standard set drops Hidden Power Ground or Fighting, then Heatran, Excadrill, and Tyranitar can switch into it without much fear, while the same is true for Toxapex if it drops Psychic. It has some nasty weaknesses to Fairy, Ice, and Dark, being forced out by strong attackers like Tapu Lele and Mega Latios and Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar and Weavile. Mega Latias is vulnerable to poison and paralysis from Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, defensive Kommo-o, Zapdos, and Defog Gliscor, which can make it more difficult to check these Pokemon in the long run. It also struggles to break through threats like Magearna and Jirachi regardless of its set, and bulky foes like Clefable and Reuniclus sufficiently wall the utility set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits many prominent threats hard, including Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mega Latios, Mega Latias, Tornadus-T, Serperior, Zapdos, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana. Hidden Power Ground threatens Heatran and Magnezone while also hitting Mega Mawile, offensive Magearna, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for decent damage. Psychic OHKOes Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and offensive Kommo-o after Stealth Rock and threatens Toxapex and neutral targets like Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Kartana and Weavile, heavily damages Tyranitar, and deals decent damage to Steel-types like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Greninja, Magearna, and Volcarona while making defensive staples like Magearna, Reuniclus, Clefable, and Toxapex easier to pressure for teammates. Mega Latias is also a good Defogger due to its great natural bulk and good matchup against common Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Heatran lacking Toxic, and Landorus-T. However, it should avoid using Defog against status users and Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave and Defog can be used together, but this leaves Mega Latias unable to threaten Stealth Rock setters that can tank Ice Beam, like Heatran packing Toxic and Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mega Latias uses maximum HP to best handle the likes of Mega Swampert and Choice Scarf Kartana, and maximum Speed investment to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep Mega Latias healthy whenever possible so it can check threats consistently throughout the game. Scout for status moves from Pokemon it would normally pivot into, mainly Heatran and Gliscor. Use Thunder Wave or Defog, as needed, when Mega Latias forces out a foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Latias fits well on bulky offense and balance teams. Spikers like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Greninja make excellent partners to chip down foes, since Mega Latias can force a lot of switches; Tyranitar and Heatran are notable targets, as they can pivot around Mega Latias depending on its coverage moves. Ferrothorn checks Fairy- and Dark-types like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Tapu Fini, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Ash-Greninja and further solidifies the rain matchup, while Mega Latias can check Kartana, Heatran, and Ground-types. Skarmory is a secondary answer to Ground-types and a better answer to physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Tyranitar. Greninja is a fast Spikes setter that threatens offensive teams and benefits from Mega Latias coming in on Grass-types. Heatran is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Fairy-types and Tornadus-T, counter Volcarona and Steel-types, spread Toxic for more residual damage, and trap potential checks with Magma Storm, while Mega Latias can check Ground-types and Water-types like Rotom-W and Manaphy. Toxapex can check Fairy- and Dark-types while also spreading poison and burn with Toxic, Scald, and Toxic Spikes to gradually damage Pursuit users, while Mega Latias covers Ground- and Electric-types and Mega Alakazam lacking Calm Mind. Other Water-types, like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini, check Heatran should Mega Latias lack appropriate coverage, and Mega Latias answers Grass-types in return. Also, Rotom-W can pivot Mega Latias in and Tapu Fini can check Dark-types. Fairy-types like Clefable and Magearna pivot into Dark-type moves for Mega Latias; the former can set up Stealth Rock, while the latter can neutralize bulky setup sweepers with Heart Swap. Meanwhile, Mega Latias can check Heatran, Kartana, and Gliscor. Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T pressure Steel-types and Toxapex, with Gliscor able to absorb status moves and sweep with Swords Dance, while Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock. Mega Latias benefits both by checking Water- and Grass-types. Magnezone can trap Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Magearna that wall Mega Latias without Hidden Power Ground or Fighting. Defensive Kommo-o can set up Stealth Rock and check Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Hoopa-U.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Stored Power helps Mega Latias snowball, overwhelming Unaware users and opposing Calm Mind users like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Psyshock is much stronger out of the gate, which makes it much more difficult for Haze Toxapex and opposing Calm Mind users like Magearna and Magic Guard Clefable to stop Mega Latias's sweep. It also lets Mega Latias immediately threaten Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Medicham, and Kommo-o. Ice Beam hits Dark- and Steel-types like Excadrill, Greninja, and Ferrothorn and directly threatens prominent Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and opposing Mega Latias. Thunderbolt can be used over Stored Power or Psyshock to threaten Water-types like Toxapex, Greninja, and Tapu Fini and provide good neutral coverage with Ice Beam.</p> <p>Set up on forced switches and passive Pokemon like defensive Tornadus-T, defensive Clefable lacking Thunder Wave, Gliscor lacking Toxic, and Zapdos. Keep Mega Latias healthy whenever possible so it can set up more freely and pivot into attackers like Kartana more consistently. Scout for status moves from Pokemon it would otherwise set up on, mainly Gliscor. Keep entry hazards up to KO checks with fewer boosts. Psyshock sets can be used for quicker damage, while Stored Power sets generally needs to find opportunities to set up multiple Calm Minds in a row.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set enjoys entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Heatran, and Greninja to KO its checks with fewer boosts. Ferrothorn checks Fairy- and Dark-types like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Tapu Fini, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Ash-Greninja; Skarmory is a secondary answer to Ground-types and a better answer to physical attackers so Mega Latias doesn't get overwhelmed; Heatran checks Fairy-types and Steel-types while crippling checks like Tyranitar and Greninja with Toxic, and it traps and takes out Toxapex with Magma Storm so Mega Latias can more freely run Stored Power. Toxapex spreads residual damage with Toxic and Toxic Spikes and checks Pokemon that give this set a hard time, like Magearna, Jirachi, Weavile, and Tyranitar. Toxic Spikes Toxapex is also an essential partner for single-attack Mega Latias, since it cripples the Dark-types that would stone wall Stored Power or Psyshock. Mega Latias in turn can answer threatening Ground-types for Toxapex. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T can take out Steel-types and pressure Toxapex, since the Stored Power set can struggle to take them out early-game. Gliscor can pivot into status moves and be a potential secondary wincon with Swords Dance alongside Mega Latias, while Landorus-T can run Stealth Rock, pivot Mega Latias in on desirable setup targets with U-turn, or take out a bulky target with a Z-Move so Mega Latias can sweep more easily. Wallbreakers like the aforementioned Z-Move Landorus-T, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Swords Dance or Choice Band Kartana can threaten bulky targets and appreciate the defensive utility Mega Latias provides. Both Clefable and Magearna can pivot into Dark-type moves; Clefable is able to set up Stealth Rock and cripple Toxapex and Heatran with Knock Off, while Magearna can neutralize opposing setup sweepers with Heart Swap and get Mega Latias in safely against Tapu Fini and Clefable with Volt Switch. Defensive Kommo-o can set up Stealth Rock and check Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Hoopa-U.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Hidden Power Fire threatens Kartana, offensive Magearna, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. However, Hidden Power Ground and Fighting have a wider range of targets while still hitting most of these Pokemon adequately. On the utility set, Thunder gives Mega Latias excellent neutral coverage in tandem with Ice Beam while hitting Water- and Flying-types like Manaphy, Greninja, Tornadus-T, Celesteela, and Tapu Fini hard, but it lets most Steel-types check Mega Latias and is weaker than Psychic on neutral targets. Earthquake can be used over Hidden Power Ground; it 2HKOes Heatran and hits Magearna, Mega Diancie, Excadrill, and Tyranitar harder, but Grassy Terrain and burn weaken it significantly, the latter being common from Pokemon like Toxapex, Lava Plume Heatran, and Rotom-W. Surf hits Heatran, Excadrill, and Mega Diancie harder than Hidden Power Fighting or Ground while also doing decent damage to Volcarona, but other coverage moves overshadow it, and it leaves Mega Latias at the mercy of most Steel-types. Wish could be used on the utility set alongside Roost to heal teammates. However, Roost's 16 PP suffices for most games, and its teammates will usually already have reliable recovery. On Calm Mind, Substitute can be used over Ice Beam to punish switches, evade status from Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran, and use passive checks like Leech Seed Ferrothorn and defensive Clefable as setup fodder. However, it leaves Mega Latias completely walled by Dark-types and unable to check Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Kartana. Reflect Type can also be used; Mega Latias can set up on poisoned Pursuit Tyranitar, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magearna while also evading Toxic from Heatran and Toxapex. However, it has the same issues as Substitute while being even less consistent. Roar can rack up entry hazard damage and stop setup sweepers, but it's situational and Thunder Wave usually suffices in this regard. Toxic cripples Pokemon like Tyranitar, Greninja, Rotom-W, and Tapu Lele; however, it makes Mega Latias worse against Steel-types. Although Choice Scarf Latias is a fast revenge killer that can provide Healing Wish, it is not strong, lacks the defensive utility that Mega Latias offers, and is overshadowed by other Choice Scarf users like Kartana, Rotom-W, Greninja, and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey doesn't take much damage from anything Mega Latias can throw at it, and it stays healthy with Soft-Boiled and Natural Cure while crippling Mega Latias with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Z-Move Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf Kartana, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Greninja can outspeed and threaten Mega Latias with super effective coverage. However, they're crippled by Thunder Wave, and Mega Latias can often take at least one hit from them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Weavile can trap and remove Mega Latias, stopping the Calm Mind set particularly easily. However, they should be careful to not switch into Hidden Power Fighting or Thunder Wave against the utility set, and Reflect Type can play around them. Ash-Greninja outspeeds Mega Latias, which makes it better at stopping the Calm Mind set from getting out hand. However, it must avoid Hidden Power Fighting, Thunder, and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Magearna, Mega Scizor, and Heatran can switch into Mega Latias easily and set entry hazards on it, pivot with U-turn or Volt Switch, set up, and cripple it with status. However, most of these answers are susceptible to repeated damage due to lacking reliable recovery, super effective coverage moves, the Calm Mind set, and being trapped by Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison severely cuts into Mega Latias's longevity, and it can come from Pokemon it should be able to switch into, like Heatran, Kommo-o, and Toxapex. Paralysis is also threatening, especially if Mega Latias can't stay healthy due to full paralysis on Roost turns.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Diancie, Mega Mawile, Magearna, Tapu Fini, and Clefable are all able to take Mega Latias's attacks, threaten it with their super effective STAB moves, and take advantage of it to get up Stealth Rock or set up. However, they can be hindered by Thunder Wave, and Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Fini are setup fodder for the Calm Mind set. Heart Swap Magearna is particularly troublesome, since it can steal Mega Latias's Calm Mind boosts and thus become a threat itself.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Latios's great Speed tier and offensive stats make it a premier check to several threats in the OU metagame such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Moreover, its excellent offensive typing, high-powered STAB attacks, and vast range of coverage options make Latios a formidable offensive threat in its own right, able to threaten defensive staples like Toxapex, Gliscor, Mega Venusaur, and Zapdos. Mega Latios also sports numerous type resistances, great bulk, and access to recovery, enabling it to act as a solid pivot into Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks. Additionally, Mega Latios's naturally high Attack and access to Earthquake allows it to 2HKO common Psychic-type checks such as Heatran, Assault Vest Magearna, and Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Despite its strengths, though, Mega Latios is threatened by common Fairy-types in the tier such as Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, and Magearna and walled by Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Mega Latios is also troubled by faster offensive threats such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam and is highly vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Weavile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a potential coverage move to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor for huge damage, though other options are typically preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes very little from anything Mega Latios carries and can cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are a tremendous threat to Mega Latios, as they are immune to Draco Meteor and can threaten Latios with their STAB attacks. Tapu Lele can take any hit from Latios and OHKOes it with Moonblast. Calm Clefable can switch into Latios as it avoids the 2HKO from Psychic and easily outheal the damage with Soft-Boiled and Leftovers. Neither Magearna nor Mega Mawile appreciate an Earthquake, but if needed they can tank one and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Tyranitar and Weavile can cut Mega Latios's run short with Pursuit. Ash-Greninja can take any hit aside from Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt and OHKO Latios in return, and Hoopa-U has enough special bulk to tank Draco Meteor and KO with Dark Pulse or Hyperspace Fury.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types That Aren't Weak To Earthquake</strong>: Steel-types that aren't weak to Earthquake like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Celesteela can quite easily switch in on Mega Latios, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Offensive Pokemon faster than Mega Latios can revenge kill it. Both Protean and Battle Bond variants of Greninja outspeed Latios and easily KO it. Tapu Koko is immune to Draco Meteor and can OHKO Latios with Choice Specs Dazzling Gleam. Weavile can OHKO Latios with Icicle Crash and trap it with Pursuit. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T can deal heavy damage to Latios as well. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Tapu Lele can also revenge kill Mega Latios.</p>",

      "Mega Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Latios's most consistent STAB move, nailing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex. Earthquake deals with Pokemon that normally switch into Psychic-types, OHKOing Heatran and 2HKOing Assault Vest Magearna and Tyranitar if they have taken even minimal damage. Ice Beam allows Mega Latios to OHKO the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which can be threatening to balance teams Mega Latios usually finds itself in. Draco Meteor is Mega Latios's strongest STAB move and can be used to deal significant damage to neutral targets, even OHKOing offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Landorus-T. Thunderbolt allows Mega Latios to OHKO Ash-Greninja and deal huge damage to Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Roost increases Mega Latios's longevity, allowing it to switch into offensive threats such as Gliscor and Heatran more reliably. Roost also allows Mega Latios to beat many defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Mew, and Zapdos one-on-one.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature allows Mega Latios to outspeed key threats such as Kartana and Garchomp while not compromising the power of Earthquake. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty to make Mega Latios less liable to being revenge killed by priority users. However, you can elect to give Mega Latios a Hasty nature if your team heavily relies on Mega Latios to check specific special attackers like Heatran; although, this leaves Mega Latios more liable to Pursuit trapping.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Mega Latios is fairly straightforward. Mega Latios should stick to using the appropriate STAB move in most scenarios in order to deal as much damage as possible. However, if running it, beware of Draco Meteor's side effect, which prevents Mega Latios from spamming it. Latios should Mega evolve and use Earthquake on Magearna upon switching because it cannot be 2HKOed otherwise if the opportunity presents itself. Draco Meteor + Earthquake has a very large chance to KO Choice Band Tyranitar; however, Earthquake should still be used upon switching if possible because bulkier variants have a larger possibility to survive the combination. Mega Latios should preferably be brought in with VoltTurn support or double switches in spite of its respectable bulk in order to maximize its longevity and leave it out of range of being revenge killed by priority and faster Pokemon, but it can still be switched into Pokemon that it checks well, most commonly Heatran or Tapu Bulu.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is a very useful partner for Mega Latios because it removes all of the bulky Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Earthquake, such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, making it significantly easier for Mega Latios to wallbreak. Due to Mega Latios's potency as a wallbreaker, win conditions such as Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kartana benefit from Mega Latios's ability to punch holes in teams. Additionally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate Heatran and Magearna being KOed by Mega Latios, such as Shift Gear Magearna, make excellent teammates. Pokemon that lay entry hazards such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Ferrothorn make excellent teammates because their support helps wear down checks to Mega Latios such as Assault Vest Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar. Ferrothorn in particular is a useful teammate because it checks key offensive Pokemon that force out Mega Latios such as Double Dance Magearna, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Choice Specs Ash-Greninja.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing give it a place in OU as one of the metagame's most consistent and reliable checks to Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam while still packing plenty of Speed with Choice Scarf sets. Healing Wish is also an extremely valuable tool for bulky offense archetypes, giving the likes of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona a second shot a sweeping. Jirachi is no slouch offensively either, as courtesy of Serene Grace and Choice Scarf, Iron Head can pose a threat to several weakened or unprepared teams. Defensive sets can also be good picks on a handful of teams, notably providing Wish support and a near impenetrable counter to Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Magearna. Unfortunately, despite Jirachi's good typing, it is vulnerable to the tier's ever-present Ground-types in Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor and Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, as well as having a fearful weakness to Knock Off. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also struggle at times due to its rather average Speed and power and being pressured to U-turn not to lose momentum, which the opponent can and will take advantage of, whereas defensive sets also lose plenty of momentum naturally.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Z-Happy Hour is a potent set for Jirachi, as it can boost all of its sets by one stage and use its expansive mixed attacking movepool to attempt sweeping late-game. Unfortunately, Jirachi will require quite a bit of support in order to sweep with this set, may struggle to find setup opportunities, and will still lack in power after the boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Jirachi lacks a move capable of hitting Heatran for sufficient damage even after a boost, while in return, Heatran can threaten Jirachi with super effective STAB attacks and set up Stealth Rock. It should fear paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Jirachi's general lack of power often keeps it from hitting bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Rotom-W for good damage. Scald burns also heavily threaten Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Swampert, and Quagsire pose quite the big threat to Jirachi, as all can tank a hit and in return threaten Jirachi with powerful super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Ash-Greninja, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile are all capable of forcing Jirachi out with their super effective STAB attacks and Pursuit trapping it in the latter two's case. Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, however, must look out for Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Alongside Heatran, the likes of Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X can tank an Iron Head or two and heavily pressure Jirachi with their super effective STAB attacks. All must be wary of paralysis from Body Slam, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Jirachi doesn't take too kindly to having burn negate its Leftovers, and it also doesn't appreciate having a decent amount of HP cut from entry hazards if it's constantly switching in and out with U-turn. Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin are all particularly threatening, as these items and abilities discourage Jirachi from attacking.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Jirachi to keep up momentum and safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against the likes of Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, while also being the best option against foes that are weak to it such as Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja. It also lets teammates safely come onto the field when Jirachi forces a switch. Healing Wish is a useful support move that completely heals one of Jirachi's offensive teammates, giving them a second chance to set up and sweep. It can also be used to heal a teammate that’s needed to check an offensive threat. Fire Punch lets Jirachi deal super effective damage to Steel-types that would otherwise completely wall it such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Trick is an option that allows Jirachi to cripple common defensive switch-ins such as Toxapex and Celesteela, which improves its matchup against balance teams; however, Fire Punch is usually preferred. Ice Punch can be used to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor that give Jirachi trouble.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf lets Jirachi outspeed a number of naturally fast Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko, as well as opposing Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi should be switched into predicted resisted attacks such as Psychic from Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele and Moonblast from Mega Diancie. However, be wary of coverage moves such as Mega Alakazam's Shadow Ball, Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Hidden Power Fire, and Mega Diancie's Earth Power, as they leave Jirachi severely weakened and unable to switch in afterwards. Jirachi can use U-turn as it forces these Pokemon out to gain momentum; however, there are some late-game situations where it's better to spam Iron Head or weaken a predicted switch-in with a coverage move. Healing Wish should be used when Jirachi's boosted Speed is no longer needed and a weakened teammate can attempt to set up and sweep once fully healed. It should also be used to heal a teammate that's necessary in checking an offensive threat. Fire Punch should only be used against Steel-types if necessary, as this move is otherwise weak and can lose momentum by letting in threatening foes such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Garchomp. For these reasons, it's often preferred to pivot with U-turn into a wallbreaker that fares better against Steel-types. Trick should be used to cripple defensive switch-ins by hindering their ability to check other offensive threats, but it should only be used once Jirachi's increased Speed is no longer needed. Using Healing Wish immediately after Trick can be a smart way to bring a teammate in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its natural bulk and good defensive typing, as well as its ability to gain momentum, Jirachi is very useful to offensively oriented teams. Wallbreakers that can be brought in through U-turn such as Ash-Greninja, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile make good teammates. The former two can also deal with Heatran, the most common Jirachi counter. Likewise, Pokemon that can also use U-turn or Volt Switch such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W complete a VoltTurn core with Jirachi. Pokemon that can punch holes early-game and then proceed to sweep late-game such as Mega Mawile, Mega Heracross, and Mega Charizard X all appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish support. The latter two can also take advantage of bulky Steel-types that switch into Jirachi. Tangrowth forms a solid core with Jirachi, switching into Ash-Greninja and Garchomp for it, while Jirachi is able to take on strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Magearna as well as mixed attackers such as Kyurem-B that give Tangrowth trouble. Jirachi is walled by bulky Water- and Ground-types, so Pokemon that can take advantage of them such as Serperior, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B also make good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Wish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish allows Jirachi to heal both itself and teammates, allowing it to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B repeatedly throughout the match while functioning as potent utility for the rest of its team. This move has good defensive synergy with Protect, which lets Jirachi stall for Leftovers recovery and heal itself safely with Wish. It is also helpful for playing mind games with Mega Medicham and Hawlucha, which risk crashing and taking 50% recoil if they attack into it with High Jump Kick. Iron Head sports a 60% flinch rate after the boost from Serene Grace and a solid Base Power after the STAB boost, allowing Jirachi to pose a threat to the aforementioned Pokemon that it checks and meaning Tyranitar isn't able to Pursuit trap it with a modicum of consistency. U-turn allows Jirachi to both escape Magnezone's attempts to trap it and grab momentum versus Pokemon that it force out, benefiting from Jirachi's minimally invested Speed stat to help teammates switch in safely when the opposing player opts to not switch out. This move works well alongside Wish to help heal up weakened partners like Heatran when they aren't healthy enough to switch in safely. Body Slam has excellent synergy with Iron Head, having a 60% paralysis rate due to Serene Grace, allowing Jirachi to cripple common switch-ins like Heatran, Kartana, and Landorus-T, pressuring Volcarona, Garchomp, and Hawlucha that try to set up on Jirachi, and reducing the action rate of anything that is slower after the Speed drop to 30% on the turns when Jirachi uses Iron Head. This has particular utility on more defensively inclined teams that aren’t as reliant on momentum as well as on teams that aim to take advantage of paralysis with Pokemon like Mega Heracross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs along with a Careful nature optimize Jirachi's special bulk, helping it check Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Magearna, and Tapu Lele as consistently as possible and allow Jirachi to move before Timid Magearna as well as Modest Heatran. Leftovers is the item of choice, helping Jirachi check a number of Pokemon more consistently by restoring a little HP every turn. Serene Grace increases the rates of Iron Head and Body Slam's secondary effects.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Wish regularly to ensure Jirachi is as healthy as is reasonably possible to ensure that it can repeatedly check Pokemon like Kyurem-B consistently throughout the match. If Jirachi carries Body Slam, it is usually better to use that early-game instead of Iron Head in order to cripple common switch-ins like Heatran and Landorus-T; this is because Iron Head's targets, such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, typically switch out of Jirachi and attempt to take advantage of its passivity. The same applies if Jirachi carries U-turn, except that it is used more to grab momentum rather than to punish the opponent's attempt to create an unfavorable scenario for the Jirachi player. While it is usually advised to use Protect when healing Jirachi with its own Wish, be mindful that always using Protect when healing with Wish can be easily punished by your opponent, who can use it to set up entry hazards, boost their Pokemon's stats, or generate a free switch into a weakened Pokemon that can't otherwise get onto the field safely; thus, it is important to try and mix this up if you can by either attacking or doubling on an expected switch or by taking advantage of paraflinching to generate free turns. Speaking of Protect, don't be afraid to use it if it is unlikely that Jirachi will survive the next hit without recovery from Leftovers or Grassy Terrain, but once again make sure to always weigh up the risks of using it when you are in a poor position, as it can create free opportunities for a wary opponent just as much as it can save Jirachi's skin; don't forget that it has a wide range of utilities beyond Wish and turn-by-turn recovery, notably including stalling for poison damage and scouting for both coverage and Z-Moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi fits best onto balanced and stall teams, which need Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B kept in check. Reasonably bulky Pokemon that lack recovery or are otherwise easily worn down, such as Heatran, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Fini hugely appreciate Wish support on more balanced builds. Similarly, slow Pokemon that depend on being healthy to switch into something, take a second attack, and heal up, such as Chansey, Clefable, Quagsire, and Mega Sableye, make for excellent partners, as Jirachi can help take pressure off of them to recover off their own damage. Users of Magic Bounce or Defog are useful to reduce the pressure Spikes places onto Jirachi to use Wish repeatedly, making Mega Sableye, Zapdos, and Gliscor excellent partners. Pokemon that appreciate Pokemon like Heatran and Choice Scarf Landorus-T being lured out and paralyzed, including Tapu Bulu, Calm Mind Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Mega Heracross greatly appreciate the utility that Body Slam Jirachi brings to the table. Pokemon that can switch into Fire- or Ground-type moves, such as Toxapex, Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar, help relieve the pressure that said attacks put onto Jirachi. Similarly, responses to Ash-Greninja, Blacephalon, and other Dark- or Ghost-types, such as Weavile, Chansey, Mega Sableye, and the aforementioned Toxapex, are useful partners.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Jirachi to support its team by setting up entry hazards, which it can set up consistently thanks to its good typing and bulk. Iron Head is an extremely useful STAB attack, as it hits Fairy-types super effectively and has a whopping 60% chance to make slower foes flinch. U-turn allows Jirachi to generate momentum as well as pivot out of switch-ins that would otherwise trouble it, such as Landorus-T and Heatran. Healing Wish is an extremely useful support move that allows Jirachi to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate, which can be useful for helping a teammate sweep late-game. Body Slam and Thunder Wave are both options over Healing Wish, as they can provide Jirachi with a way to support its team in terms of speed control. Wish can be run as an alternative to Healing Wish but isn't preferred due to its inability to heal status or generate momentum as well. Fire Punch is also an option to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela super effectively, but it also isn't usually preferred due to the greater utility of Jirachi's other attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Near-maximum investment in HP alongside heavy investment in Special Defense gives Jirachi high special bulk, allowing it to check the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Magearna. The investment in Speed allows Jirachi to most notably outspeed Timid Magearna and Adamant Tapu Bulu to hit them with Iron Head while also outpacing the likes of Modest Heatran and Magnezone, which it can then pivot out of. Leftovers provides Jirachi with valuable passive recovery at the end of each turn and also allows it to negate burn damage if need be. Serene Grace is Jirachi's only possible ability, and provides it with a useful 60% flinch chance on Iron Head.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main function is to support teammates that appreciate either Healing Wish or Stealth Rock support. Due to the nature of this set, Jirachi should almost always aim to set up Stealth Rock when sent out. Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Magearna are all good examples of Pokemon Jirachi checks; thus, it should try to switch into and set up Stealth Rock against them. Jirachi's slow U-turn is one of this set's biggest perks, and it can be used to generate momentum on predicted switches into threats that check Jirachi, such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, or when Jirachi wishes to tank a hit and bring in a frailer teammate afterward. Because Healing Wish KOes Jirachi, the move shouldn't be used prematurely and should only be used once Jirachi is low on HP, as using Healing Wish right away would be a bit of a waste of a rather tanky Pokemon. Healing Wish allows a teammate of Jirachi that can sweep late-game, such as Mega Charizard X or Mega Pinsir, punch holes early-game and proceed to clean up later once its health has been restored. Iron Head should mainly be used against threats that take heavy damage from the move that could potentially pose a threat to the rest of Jirachi's team, such as Tyranitar and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best for primarily offensive teams, as it provides fantastic support in the forms of Healing Wish, entry hazards, and free turns provided by Jirachi's slow U-turn. Powerful setup sweepers that are capable of cleaning up late-game such as Landorus-T, Mega Pinsir, and Volcarona all appreciate the Healing Wish support Jirachi can provide them with, as it allows these threats to punch holes early-game and restore any damage or status ailments inflicted to sweep later on. Powerful wallbreakers such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Koko also make good teammates, as they appreciate Jirachi's ability to bring them in safely with its slow U-turn. Jirachi generally has great synergy with Rotom-W, which can form a VoltTurn core with it thanks to its access to Volt Switch as well as check most Fire-, Dark-, and Ground-types. Jirachi baits in Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, so answers to these such as Ash-Greninja, Tangrowth, and Rotom-W are required. Jirachi also invites in Ash-Greninja, so it should be paired with Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Fini to take care of it.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of Gastrodon's modest defenses, solid defensive typing that leaves it with only one weakness, and access to a reliable recovery move, it finds its niche in OU as an answer to special attackers like Heatran, Tapu Koko, Greninja, Magearna, and Mega Diancie. However, some of these Pokemon such as Heatran and Tapu Koko possess ways of getting around Gastrodon. While it being a Ground-type that isn't weak to Hidden Power Ice is already a great boon, Storm Drain only adds to its defensive qualities, making it a great answer to Water-types in general, as well as to rain sweepers like Kingdra and Ash-Greninja. Gastrodon faces competition from Toxapex, which is another bulky Water-type also capable of checking Ash-Greninja and Kingdra and providing Toxic Spikes or Knock Off support. Furthermore, Toxapex also has better overall bulk and access to Regenerator, which makes it less of a momentum drain than Gastrodon. It also struggles with mediocre bulk, especially physically, which makes it difficult for it to take hits from anything besides the special threats it checks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse can be used to increase Gastrodon's physical bulk and the power of its Earthquake, allowing it to defeat offensive teams; however, it gives up Toxic and it struggles to sweep due to its vulnerability to status. Clear Smog can be used to ruin setup attempts, which is useful due to Gastrodon's passive nature. However, it's useless against Substitute users and Steel-types. Mirror Coat can surprise some special attackers trying to 2HKO Gastrodon by usually OHKOing back. Gastrodon is a good user of this move thanks to its good HP stat, but it is very prediction reliant and situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Gastrodon cannot deal much damage to most Grass-types with its STAB moves, and threats such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur can easily set up or simply OHKO back with a 4x effective STAB Grass-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon that carry Grass-type coverage moves can almost always 2HKO or OHKO Gastrodon. Heatran can run Bloom Doom, which swiftly dispatches Gastrodon. Electric-types like Tapu Koko can sometimes run Grass Knot. Celesteela, which doesn't do much to Gastrodon otherwise, can sometimes carry Giga Drain. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y use Grass-type moves as their standard coverage and therefore can also defeat Gastrodon easily.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Gastrodon's defensive stats aren't the most excellent, especially physically, so powerful attackers such as Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham can break through it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Since Gastrodon is so passive and reliant on Toxic and Scald burns, setup sweepers can easily take advantage of it to set up and break through. Gyarados can freely setup on Gastrodon if it has Substitute as this allows it to avoid Toxic and Scald burns. Quiver Dance sweepers like Volcarona take relatively little after boosting and only fear Toxic. Swords Dance users like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor can set up easily, and Gastrodon needs to get lucky with Scald burns to pose any sort of threat, although it can use Ice Beam or Sludge Bomb to hurt Mega Pinsir and Tapu Bulu.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald deals decent damage and can inflict burns, limiting the effectiveness of physical attacks. Recover is required, as it prevents Gastrodon from being worn down and allows it to wall the Pokemon it switches into. Toxic is necessary for wearing down targets Gastrodon cannot do much else to, such as bulky defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Rotom-W. Earthquake provides Gastrodon with a secondary STAB that is useful for hitting Calm Mind Magearna much harder than Earth Power, as well as Assault Vest variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers increases Gastrodon's longevity, and Storm Drain gives it a useful immunity to Water-type moves. The EV spread maximizes Special Defense, allowing Gastrodon to take on special threats like Heatran, Greninja, Ash-Greninja, Mega Diancie, Blacephalon, and Magearna. A Sassy nature maximizes Special Defense, without decreasing Earthquake's damage output. An EV spread of 248 HP / 44 Def / 216 SpD allows Gastrodon to always survive two Secret Swords from Choice Scarf Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage, meaning Gastrodon can switch in on it safely, although the spread puts Gastrodon at risk of being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Blacephalon's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Gastrodon is pretty straightforward, as it basically boils down to using Recover to keep Gastrodon's HP high and using attacks and Toxic on the turns where Recover isn't necessary. Gastrodon can switch into special threats such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Greninja quite freely and heal off the damage, firing off Scald and Toxic to wear down bulkier foes. It's also a safe answer to common Volt Switch users like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Magearna, and it can easily switch in and block their attempts at gaining momentum or heal off the damage from their main attacks. When using Gastrodon, be wary of Toxic on defensive Pokemon that Gastrodon would otherwise check, such as Heatran. Similarly, scouting for Grass moves can be beneficial, such as Bloom Doom on Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon typically finds itself on balanced, bulkier teams due to its passive nature. Since it's so weak, it needs a teammate that can consistently deal with and wear down Ferrothorn, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu, all of which check it. Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X, Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, and Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur are all solid answers to the Grass-types that trouble Gastrodon. Additionally, certain Steel-type Pokemon can form sturdy defensive cores with Gastrodon given their excellent type syngergy: Celesteela and Mega Scizor both resist Grass-type attacks and typically pose an annoyance to the relevant Grass-type Pokemon, save for Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur, while Gastrodon can pivot into threatening Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon. Clefable can pass Wishes to Gastrodon and its teammates, which only adds to its longevity, it can also set up Stealth Rock and absorb Toxic for Gastrodon. In return Gastrodon can beat Steel-types that Clefable tends to struggle with. Although Gastrodon is fairly self-sufficient and does resist Stealth Rock, it appreciates entry hazard control to remove Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which can severely hamper its ability to switch in and its general longevity. Tornadus-T and Zapdos can Defog and check certain Grass-types like Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny possesses an amazing Speed stat that lets it outpace most of the unboosted metagame, thus making it an excellent revenge killer. Furthermore, Lopunny's high-Base Power STAB moves give it perfect coverage thanks to its ability Scrappy, which, when backed up by its great Attack stat, let it pose a threat to slower offensive threats that lack the bulk to take its attacks, like Greninja and Tapu Koko. On top of that, Lopunny has access to a wide supportive movepool consisting of moves like Encore and Power-Up Punch that helps it take on bulkier Pokemon it struggles against, such as Clefable and Toxapex. Additionally, STAB Fake Out is another great asset that lets Lopunny pick off weakened Pokemon that outspeed it such as Mega Alakazam. However, Lopunny lacks the immediate power to break through some of the bulkier Pokemon in the metagame such as Mew and Toxapex, which forces it to rely on Power-Up Punch and Encore to pose a threat to defensive teams. Despite Lopunny's good matchup against offense, it can be easily overwhelmed by residual damage from entry hazards, weather conditions, and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Tornadus-T and Tank Chomp, which leaves it vulnerable to priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Weavile's Ice Shard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Healing Wish can be used in the last slot to give Lopunny some late-game utility, as it lets Lopunny fully heal a weakened teammate; however, Lopunny is usually really good late-game, so it isn't the best idea to sacrifice it then. Facade lets Lopunny take advantage of non-Psychic Mew and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex to get a really strong STAB move with great coverage. However, this is very situational and being burned can be detrimental because Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick will do significantly less damage. Toxic is a nice option because it lets Lopunny slowly wear down some of its checks such as Landorus-T and Mew, although the likes of Clefable and Toxapex aren't affected by it, and Lopunny will be badly poisoned as well if it uses Toxic against Mew.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Lopunny lacks the initial power to break through most of the common physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, including the likes of Mew, Toxapex, Skarmory, Mega Slowbro, and Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Lopunny's impressive Speed stat, it can't outspeed most Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Landorus-T, which can force it out with Sacred Sword and Earthquake, respectively. Mega Alakazam deserves a mention as well because it naturally outspeeds Lopunny and OHKOes it with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Lopunny is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards, weather, and Rocky Helmet damage, which give it a harder time cleaning and revenge killing late-game because of priority users like Ash-Greninja and Weavile. This also means Lopunny is easier to pick off by weaker attacks like defensive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Celesteela's Heavy Slam.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out lets Lopunny pick off weakened targets that outspeed it like Mega Alakazam and boosted Volcarona. Ice Punch makes it easier for Lopunny to break through defensive Landorus-T, which can chip at it with Rocky Helmet damage or can wall it for a longer period during a game thanks to its Leftovers. It's also great for Gliscor, which can avoid being 2HKOed by Frustration. Quick Attack can be used instead of Ice Punch and alongside Fake Out for a deadly double-priority combination that can give offensive teams a lot of trouble, though it only makes Lopunny's matchup against balance and stall worse. Power-Up Punch lets Lopunny punish passive switch-ins like Mew and Clefable with Attack boosts to eventually break through them. Encore works well in combination with Power-Up Punch, since it locks passive Pokemon like Mew and Toxapex into their recovery moves, thus giving Mega Lopunny free setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Limber is Lopunny's best ability prior to Mega Evolution because it prevents Lopunny from being paralyzed in a pinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Lopunny is a fairly straightforward Pokemon due to its perfect coverage and great offensive stats, which give it a good matchup against offensive teams that lack a bulky Pokemon to take it on. However, in matchups where the opponent does have a reliable answer like Mew, Clefable, or Toxapex, it should be played more precisely. If Lopunny is running Encore alongside Power-Up Punch, it can use a different game plan; instead of catching passive Pokemon on the switch with Power-Up Punch, it should use one of its attacks to weaken the foe and force the opponent to use a recovery move. Then, it can use Encore and lock said check into its recovery move, thus giving Lopunny free room to start boosting its Attack and either force a switch or keep setting up on the recovery-locked foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lopunny works well on offensive teams that are looking for a good matchup against other offensive teams, so teammates that can cover the stall and balance matchups are great alongside it. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Tapu Bulu and Choice Band Victini are usually big nuisances for balance and stall teams, which Lopunny struggles against. Due to its frailty, Lopunny will also need a solid defensive backbone that can take hits for it and help bring it into the field safely. Pivots like defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna work here. Another support option that helps Lopunny against bulkier teams is entry hazard support. Stealth Rock and Spikes setters like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Greninja, and Garchomp can lay hazards and slowly wear down switch-ins, although Clefable is immune to them thanks to its Magic Guard ability. Additionally, Toxic Spikes from Toxapex or Greninja can cripple Mew and bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Slowbro, which have a harder time checking Lopunny when poisoned. Because of the prevalence of some of Mega Lopunny's checks such as Toxapex and Mew, teammates that act as lures for these are appreciated. Greninja, for example, can lure them both in and surprise them with Extrasensory and Dark Pulse, respectively. Kyurem-B is another good teammate when holding Icium Z because it can get a surprise KO on Mew while also pressuring Landorus-T. Lastly, Magnezone traps Skarmory and physically defensive Celesteela, two big roadblocks for Lopunny, thus giving Lopunny an easier time late-game.</p>"

      "PuP + Encore": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Frustration is capable of OHKOing frailer foes like Weavile and Volcarona after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Tapu Lele, Tornadus-T, and Gastrodon. High Jump Kick nails Kartana and Heatran for an OHKO. Power-Up Punch is used as a way to boost Mega Lopunny's Attack stat while doing chip damage to anything wanting to switch in on it, with +1 Frustration 2HKOing Toxapex and Gliscor and +1 High Jump Kick OHKOing Mega Mawile. Encore is used to take advantage of defensive Pokemon using status moves, such as Landorus-T and Heatran using Stealth Rock, Toxapex and Reuniclus using Recover, and Mega Latias and Gliscor using Roost. This interaction creates an awkward scenario for foes, forcing them to switch into a powerful STAB move or give Mega Lopunny a free turn to set up with Power-Up Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature allows Mega Lopunny to outpace Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Modest Mega Alakazam, which are all important targets.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is most effective as a wallbreaker and a sweeper, using the Attack boost from Power-Up Punch to puncture holes through teams while disrupting defensive walls with Encore. Mega Lopunny should be brought in whenever one of its powerful STAB moves are best to use, handling threats such as Heatran and Greninja when given entry by a slow pivoting move or acting as a revenge killer. Forcing defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Gliscor to recover their HP is ideal, as locking them into their respective recovery moves with Encore gives Mega Lopunny the opportunity to set up with Power-Up Punch while the foe must choose to either switch out and give Mega Lopunny free damage on a teammate or stay in while Encore-locked as it sets up. Mega Lopunny must be careful of strong defensive switch-ins that can immediately threaten it like Clefable and Zapdos, as well as Rocky Helmet users like Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Lopunny loves to be paired with other wallbreakers that can work in tandem with it to break apart the opposing team while covering its weaknesses, as well as teammates that love its ability to disrupt defensive checks. Offensive partners such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Victini work excellently with it, weakening defensive walls for Mega Lopunny to sweep with boosted attacks, with Kartana taking on Slowbro and Clefable, Garchomp beating down Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Toxapex, and Victini destroying Skarmory and Celesteela. Defensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Magearna that can make up for Lopunny's inability to switch into most moves safely are fantastic options, with the first baiting in Tornadus-T and opposing Landorus-T and the last two forcing in Ferrothorn and Chansey. Landorus-T also acts as an entry hazard setter with access to Stealth Rock, helping bring down opposing Pokemon into KO range of Power-Up Punch followed by a STAB option. Other hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Greninja, and the aforementioned Garchomp also work excellently with Mega Lopunny, with Ferrothorn and Heatran having a particularly good matchup against Clefable while walling Skarmory, while Greninja pressures Slowbro and switches into Weavile's Ice Shard in a pinch. Magnezone can act as a surefire way to trap and handle Steel-types Mega Lopunny may not want to deal with like Skarmory and Ferrothorn while having an excellent matchup against other physically defensive walls Mega Lopunny can't break through confidently, forcing them to use their recovery or status moves, which Lopunny can use Encore to lock them into.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp has settled itself as a powerful threat in the tier thanks to its exceptional base stats, reliable typing, and expansive movepool that supports both offensive and utility roles. Having access to powerful STAB moves and Swords Dance coupled with its high Attack, good Speed, and different Z-Crystal options, Garchomp becomes a formidable wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, pressuring common Defoggers like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. Garchomp can also function as a valuable support option, offering significant role compression thanks to its solid defensive profile. It can check key threats like Heatran while setting up Stealth Rock and utilizing utility moves such as Toxic to cripple foes or Dragon Tail and Roar to phaze setup sweepers. Moreover, Garchomp can punish physical attackers thanks to its ability, Rough Skin, letting it trade its health for damage. Its Mega Evolution is a great asset for sand teams as a premier wallbreaker with its gigantic Attack stat and impressive bulk coupled with its new ability, Sand Force. Mega Garchomp can also use its Special Attack stat to fire off a powerful Draco Meteor and Fire Blast, surprising many physically defensive walls such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W. While it is faster than Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, and both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions, Garchomp still falls short against top-tier Pokemon like Mega Latias, Mega Diancie, and Kartana, which are capable of hitting it hard with super effective or powerful moves. Its typing, although good, leaves it susceptible to commonly used attack types such as Ice and Fairy. It also faces huge competition in both of its roles as a wallbreaker and Z-Move user with Landorus-T, Kartana, and Kyurem-B and as a support Pokemon with Gliscor, which offers better longevity. Finally, Mega Garchomp's drop in Speed exposes it to threats like Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Mega Medicham.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Groundium Z can be used as another Z-Crystal option to break through would-be checks such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. It also allows to get a clean knockout on bulky Magearna that could otherwise live a simple Earthquake. However, this has much less useful applications in regards to breaking through Pokemon that it was previously walled by. Firium Z can be considered to hit defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor for huge damage. In the same fashion, Life Orb Garchomp can reverse positions very quickly for offense and hyper offense at the cost of its longevity, surprising various defensive Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Clefable and Ferrothorn at +2, which normally can live attacks from Garchomp without Life Orb. Leftovers can be used on bulkier variants to increase Garchomp's longevity. Yache Berry, although a niche option for offensive sets, allows to lure Pokemon using Ice-type attacks, such as Mega Latias, to retaliate with huge damage or apply status. Lastly, Choice Scarf takes advantage of Garchomp's unique Speed tier, transforming it into a soft check for threats like Volcarona after a Quiver Dance and Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance at the cost of being locked into a move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive checks like Tapu Fini and Clefable can pose significant problems for Garchomp, both being able to live a +2 Earthquake and, depending on their EV spreads, +2 Continental Crush at full health while striking back with Moonblast for super effective damage. Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele are faster threats that can OHKO Garchomp outright. Tapu Koko can also act as a check, as it is naturally faster and can remove Garchomp with Dazzling Gleam or Hidden Power Ice if it has been weakened. Magearna is also worth noting, since it can survive an unboosted Earthquake, knocking out Garchomp in return with Ice Beam or Fleur Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type coverage</strong>: Faster Pokemon using Ice-type moves can scare out Garchomp, cutting its rampage short. Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Greninja threaten it with Ice Beam, while Tapu Koko, Mega Alakazam, and even Choice Scarf Landorus-T can deal super effective damage with Hidden Power Ice. Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert under rain pose a threat with Ice Punch, while Weavile can use its Ice-type STAB moves to eliminate Garchomp. However, frail attackers like the aforementioned Tapu Koko, Mega Alakazam, and Weavile can't switch in directly, forcing careful positioning.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory is notable for not fainting from +2 Continental Crush and can retaliate with Counter to effectively take down Garchomp. It can also use Whirlwind to phaze Garchomp, preventing it from setting up. Unaware Clefable is also one of the hardest walls for Garchomp to break through, avoiding the 2HKO from Earthquake, scouting its Z-Move with Wish and Protect, and not fearing any of Garchomp's Attack boosts. Slowbro can easily face the Rockium Z variant and inflict super effective damage with Ice Beam, while Mega Slowbro is a hard counter, surviving +2 Devastating Drake from Garchomp's Outrage thanks to its gigantic Defense. Cresselia is a challenge for Garchomp with its natural bulk, the ability Levitate, and Ice Beam; however, it has to be careful of +2 Devastating Drake and against Mega Garchomp’s teams, since the sandstorm can weaken Moonlight, leaving it more exposed. Landorus-T fares decently against most variants of Garchomp thanks to its ability Intimidate, and it can inflict huge damage with Hidden Power Ice or Earthquake. Still, it has to be careful of Devastating Drake and Draco Meteor from Mega Garchomp, which can overwhelm it. Utility Kartana is also worth mentioning, as it is designed to win one-on-one against regular Garchomp, hitting it with a powerful Bloom Doom.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance effectively makes Garchomp a powerful threat. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move with its high Base Power, allowing it to break through many Pokemon after a Swords Dance, mainly threatening Heatran and Magearna for super effective damage. Outrage paired with Dragonium Z unleashes a 190-Base Power STAB move, breaking past most of the tier like Landorus-T and Mega Latias switching in at the cost of possibly being stopped by Fairy-types. Substitute is often paired with Dragonium Z, since it can ease its use and take advantage of passive Pokemon like Toxapex. Stone Edge is also another option that completes Garchomp's offensive presence by threatening Ground-immune Pokemon. With Rockium Z, Garchomp really scares common Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, and with Swords Dance, it can also break past Pokemon like Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Tapu Bulu. Due to its offensive pressure, Garchomp finds opportunities to set Stealth Rock as the foe switches. Other options rely on increasing its coverage, with Fire Fang targeting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, and Aqua Tail surprising Ground-types like Landorus-T. Dragon Claw can also be used, as it's a more consistent Dragon-type STAB move that does not lock Garchomp into it like Outrage does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature takes advantage of the unique Speed tier of Garchomp to outpace base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mega Medicham. Rockium Z and Dragonium Z are used to boost Stone Edge and Outrage, respectively. Rough Skin is the preferred ability to chip away the health of physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of the combination of bulk, good typing, and the fact that Garchomp forces a lot of switches to place Stealth Rock or set up with Swords Dance. With Rockium Z, you should use the Z-Move after setting up a Swords Dance for it to have enough power to break through the opposition and not waste it on targets that already take a lot from Stone Edge if the situation allows it. With Dragonium Z, Garchomp's use leans more heavily on predictions to catch would-be soft checks like Mega Latias and avoid launching the Z-Move into a Dragon-immune Pokemon. Garchomp can be used to switch into Heatran or Electric-type attacks but ideally only after it did its job of knocking out foes; otherwise, doing this can potentially hinder its wallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp fits more easily on offensive teams, as they take advantage of its aggressive and explosive nature. Serperior and Garchomp form a complementary core. Garchomp threatens common Flying- and Steel-types like Zapdos and Heatran, while Serperior can paralyze faster Pokemon like Mega Latias and Kartana, preparing the field for Garchomp. As a teammate, Kartana can also profit from the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp to clean the already weakened opposition with its ability Beast Boost. Efficient Defoggers, such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, are also recommended to preserve Garchomp from entry hazards that could weaken it and prevent it from completing its mission. Tapu Fini also stands out in this role thanks to its access to Defog and ability to set Misty Terrain, protecting Garchomp from status conditions and enabling it to set up. Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Scizor synergize well with Garchomp's typing, pivoting into otherwise super effective Fairy- and Ice-type attacks, while Garchomp handles Fire-type attacks. Their access to Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, can also help Garchomp enter the field safely. Mega Diancie and Heatran, while synergizing well with Garchomp overall, can also free up the Stealth Rock slot of Garchomp, allowing it to maximize its versatility and impact on the battlefield by running Substitute or other coverage moves. Finally, Pokemon like Greninja and Ferrothorn pair well with Garchomp to form a hazard-stacking core thanks to their access to Spikes.</p>"

      "Mixed Mega": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor breaks through fellow Dragon-types like Dragonite, Kommo-o, and Kyurem-B and hits neutral targets like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Gliscor for major damage. Earthquake is Mega Garchomp's most spammable STAB attack, hitting key Pokemon such as Toxapex, Magearna, and neutral targets that take a lot less from special attacks like Chansey and Tapu Fini. Fire Blast roasts Steel-types that are immune to or take neutral damage from Earthquake such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Mega Garchomp can use its fantastic typing to set up Stealth Rock, force out the likes of Heatran and Magearna, and threaten Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W for major damage. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can be used to snipe specially defensive Gliscor and hit Landorus-T and Dragonite without risking dropping its Special Attack from using Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Hasty nature is preferred to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before Mega Evolving and maximum Speed Landorus-T after Mega Evolving. A Mild nature is an option for maximizing the damage output of Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Ice at the cost of being outpaced by the aforementioned Pokemon. A Mild nature also allows Mega Garchomp to have a favorable role to OHKO defensive Landorus-T with Hidden Power Ice, guarantee an OHKO on Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, and allow the highest possible chance to OHKO bulky Tornadus-T with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. Both natures subtract from Defense rather than Special Defense, since Special Defense is deemed more important to help take on the likes of Heatran and Volcarona. Rough Skin is Garchomp's preferred ability before Mega Evolution to punish contact moves such as Landorus-T using U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Garchomp fills the role of an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. The timing for Garchomp to Mega Evolve depends on the current situation; delaying Mega Evolution lets Garchomp use its pre-Mega Speed stat to threaten and revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B. In these matchups, Garchomp's best scenario to Mega Evolve is after these Pokemon are eliminated or paralyzed. If there aren't targets like these with a Speed stat in between pre-Mega Garchomp and Mega Garchomp, it should Mega Evolve immediately to increase its damage output, though it can also delay for a bit to bluff as a different set. Once Garchomp Mega Evolves, it will be able to use its increased Special Attack to more easily threaten the likes of Skarmory and Mega Scizor with Fire Blast. If Mega Garchomp has Stealth Rock, it should take advantage of Pokemon like Heatran that are forced out to set up immediately. Because Mega Garchomp is forced into a nature that subtracts from its bulk by virtue of being a mixed attacker, it cannot make use of its great natural bulk as easily to tank hits such as Landorus-T's Earthquake and Choice Band Kartana's Leaf Blade, especially if it has been chipped throughout the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Garchomp set should only be used on bulky offense, balance, and sand teams that appreciate its mixed wallbreaking capabilities thanks to its increased Attack and Special Attack stats. Tyranitar and Hippowdon support Mega Garchomp with sand, activating Sand Force to boost the power of Mega Garchomp's Earthquake. Tyranitar also threatens Mega Latios and Mega Latias by potentially punishing them with Pursuit, weakening or eliminating them from the match, while Hippowdon can more solidly answer the likes of Hidden Power Ice Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Hippowdon can also run Stealth Rock to allow Mega Garchomp to more freely run Hidden Power Ice. On sand teams, Excadrill can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and acts as a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner with Sand Rush. Mega Garchomp supports Excadrill's offensive capabilities by breaking through its answers, such as Skarmory and Rotom-W, relieving a lot of pressure for Excadrill and allowing it to clean up later in the game. Pivots such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W are also beneficial, as they provide Mega Garchomp with a safe switch in with U-turn and Volt Switch. On bulky offense and balance archetypes, utility Magearna can bring Mega Garchomp in safely with Volt Switch and is a solid answer to Pokemon like Weavile, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele, while Mega Garchomp handles Fire-types that threaten Magearna such as Heatran and Volcarona. Ash-Greninja provides Spikes support to put pressure on threats such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny, and it appreciates Mega Garchomp roasting Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, allowing it to break through teams much more easily after they are weakened or eliminated. If Mega Garchomp runs Stealth Rock, Ferrothorn can form a potent hazard-stacking core with Mega Garchomp thanks to its Spikes support. Ferrothorn also has paralysis support with Thunder Wave, crippling faster threats such as Mega Latias and Mega Alakazam, and Knock Off to remove items such as Leftovers from Celesteela, letting Mega Garchomp wallbreak more easily. Tapu Fini summons Misty Terrain, allowing Mega Garchomp to switch into Scald more freely without the risk of being burned. Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support to allow Mega Garchomp to run Hidden Power Ice and appreciates Mega Garchomp blowing through Gliscor and Rotom-W. Mega Garchomp also appreciates Weavile trapping and eliminating Psychic-types like Cresselia with Pursuit, removing a major roadblock and allowing it to more easily clean up. Toxapex provides a solid answer to Greninja and can set up Toxic Spikes to place Pokemon such as Tapu Lele on a timer. Celesteela can solidly answer the likes of Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele and immediately threaten them with Heavy Slam.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock enables Garchomp to pressure teams by punishing switches and accumulating chip damage. Earthquake hits most of the metagame for neutral damage while threatening key targets like Magearna, Heatran, and Toxapex. With Garchomp's attacks handling Poison- and Steel-types, Toxic is an excellent option for crippling bulky switch-ins like Landorus-T, Zapdos, Tapu Bulu, and Rotom-W. Fire Blast punishes Steel-types unthreatened by Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, that can otherwise set entry hazards against Garchomp as well as Kartana and Mega Scizor, which can remove hazards and otherwise even turn Garchomp into setup fodder. Alternatively, Flamethrower offers better accuracy but lacks the power to 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage. Roar and Dragon Tail synergize well with Stealth Rock to accumulate additional chip damage. Roar is the more consistent of the two with its ability to phaze out common foes behind a Substitute, such as Hawlucha, Gyarados, Volcarona, and Serperior, but the chip damage that Dragon Tail is able to dish is nevertheless appreciated.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Garchomp is a powerful disruptor of VoltTurn strategies, leveraging its Electric immunity and the combined effects of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet to punish contact attackers for 30% of their health. Maximum Speed investment allows Garchomp to Speed tie with opposing Garchomp and outspeed up to base 100 Speed threats, such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Mega Medicham, ensuring it can hit first to take a chunk out of them or finish them off. Alternatively, a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 Spe with a Jolly nature enhances Garchomp’s ability to check threats like Kartana and common pivots like Landorus-T and Mega Scizor while maintaining the Speed to outspeed base 80 Speed threats, including Choice Band Hoopa-U.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garchomp excels at pivoting into physical threats, particularly U-turn from Landorus-T and Victini, and weak priority moves like Fake Out and Quick Attack from Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny to accumulate contact chip damage. It should set up Stealth Rock against foes it forces out, such as Choice-locked Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Magnezone. With the Toxic set, avoid aggressive predictions, as Garchomp already effectively lures and punishes common checks with ease. When using the Dragon Tail variant, frequently phaze foes to rack up chip damage and disrupt their momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tank Garchomp fits best on bulky offense teams that benefit from its role compression and ability to accumulate the required chip damage to put foes in revenge kill range for its teammates. Magearna's resistances and immunities patch up Garchomp's weaknesses to Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves, making it an ideal partner. In return, Garchomp provides a check to Fire-types like Heatran, Volcarona, and Victini thanks to its Fire resistance and Stealth Rock. Garchomp also benefits from Ferrothorn, whose Fairy resistance and Spikes create a strong entry hazard-stacking core, amplifying Garchomp's phazing and hazard damage potential. With Garchomp taking up the defensive Ground-type slot that traditionally goes to the additionally Ground-immune Landorus-T and Gliscor, Rotom-W makes for a solid partner by accommodating for Garchomp's lack of a Ground immunity and ability to pivot.</p>"

      "Swords Dance Mega": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance raises Mega Garchomp’s Attack stat to dangerous levels, letting it pose a threat to defensive teams. Substitute shields Mega Garchomp from status moves from the likes of Toxic Slowbro and Leech Seed Celesteela. Fire Fang lets Mega Garchomp threaten Tapu Bulu, Celesteela, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Aqua Tail breaks past Landorus-T and Gliscor. Earthquake smashes Magearna, Toxapex, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Koko and hits neutral targets like Ferrothorn hard. Finally, Stone Edge tears through the likes of Zapdos, Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is mandatory to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before Mega Evolving and maximum Speed Landorus-T after Mega Evolving. Rough Skin is Garchomp's preferred pre-Mega ability to punish contact moves such as Landorus-T using U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Garchomp functions best as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that punches holes through bulky teams for its teammates to clean up. If the opponent has any Pokemon that regular Garchomp outspeeds but Mega Garchomp does not, such as Mega Charizard Y or Kyurem-B, it is best to delay Mega Evolution until these targets are either removed or paralyzed. The best way to bring Mega Garchomp in safely is by pivoting support, aggressive switches, or sacrificing a Pokemon. If Mega Garchomp is paired with a sand setter, aim to keep the sand present to activate Sand Force before going in to wallbreak efficiently. The best scenario for Mega Garchomp to use Substitute is against forced switches from Pokemon like Heatran or Toxapex. If Garchomp has not yet Mega Evolved, it can also use this opportunity to bluff another set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Garchomp set should almost exclusively be used on sand teams that appreciate the wallbreaking capabilities it provides thanks to its sky-high Attack stat and Sand Force-boosted Earthquake and Stone Edge. Therefore, sand setters like Tyranitar and Hippowdon are perfect partners for Mega Garchomp. Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap the likes of Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Cresselia, while Hippowdon uses its solid bulk to take on Pokemon like Hidden Power Ice Tapu Koko. Excadrill has incredible synergy with Mega Garchomp, as the sand that Tyranitar or Hippowdon provides activates Sand Rush, turning it into a dangerous late-game cleaner that makes up for Mega Garchomp's middling Speed tier. In return, Mega Garchomp breaks through Pokemon like Landorus-T and Celesteela so that Excadrill can clean up. If Mega Garchomp forgoes Fire Fang, Magnezone can relieve a lot of pressure for it by trapping and removing Skarmory. Magnezone also provides some pivoting support with Volt Switch. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T are also appreciated, as they bring Mega Garchomp in safely with Volt Switch and U-turn. Tapu Fini takes on Ash-Greninja and provides Misty Terrain support, letting Mega Garchomp set up safely without fearing status. Serperior provides paralysis support with Glare, crippling faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mega Latias, removes entry hazards with Defog, and eliminates Skarmory with Hidden Power Fire. Choice Band Kartana puts heavy pressure on shared checks such as Skarmory; Swords Dance variants blow through Zapdos with Breakneck Blitz, and Choice Scarf sets clean through weakened revenge killers such as Weavile and Mega Alakazam. Ferrothorn provides Spikes support, limiting revenge killers such as Mega Medicham and Greninja. These Grass-types can also provide Knock Off support to remove items such as Leftovers from Celesteela, allowing Mega Garchomp to break teams more easily. Toxapex checks Greninja and sets up Toxic Spikes, putting pressure on Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Slowbro. Celesteela provides a reliable answer to the likes of Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele and sends them packing with Heavy Slam.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's phenomenal bulk coupled with a solid typing and access to some good support moves in Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, and Slack Off allow it to act as a really good blanket check to some common threats such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Mawile, Mega Charizard X, and Tyranitar. Sand Stream helps when it comes to dealing with rain teams and Mega Charizard Y. Unfortunately, Hippowdon's Ground typing makes it weak to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks, which are used by very common Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Greninja, and Weavile. Hippowdon is also very passive; it's easily shut down by Taunt and can become setup fodder if it doesn't pack Whirlwind.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide can be used instead of Stone Edge for more accuracy, but it doesn't ensure an OHKO on Mega Pinsir. Rocky Helmet can be used over Leftovers to punish physical attackers, but the passive recovery is generally preferred. A specially defensive spread and a Careful nature can be used to handle special attackers such Heatran, Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Magearna, Gengar, and Mega Charizard Y, but Hippowdon won't be able to check physical threats well, and it's outclassed in this regard by Pokemon such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: While Hippowdon has great physical bulk, its average Special Defense makes it vulnerable against special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Volcarona, Hoopa-U, and Mega Latios.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur can wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they tank Earthquake easily and can shrug off its common coverage moves. They can also cripple Hippowdon with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types threaten Hippowdon with their super effective STAB attacks. Offensive Pokemon such as both Greninja formes and Keldeo can easily OHKO it but don't like taking a Earthquake, while bulkier Water-types such as Alomomola and Suicune don't fear Earthquake and still threaten Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Mamoswine are able to either do considerable damage to Hippowdon or OHKO it with their STAB attacks, although they cannot switch in safely on Earthquake and don't like switching while Stealth Rock is set up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status ailments such as burn and poison, as well as entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, which prevents it from checking some threats effectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is one of the best options on Hippowdon because of its staying power and ability to switch in on plenty of threats. Earthquake is Hippowdon's most reliable attack, as it offers good power and can hit Tapu Koko, Mega Mawile, and Heatran hard. Slack Off provides reliable recovery for Hippowdon that, combined with its bulk, makes it hard to wear down. Whirlwind phazes foes and prevents Hippowdon from becoming setup fodder, mostly to Hawlucha, and it works well in tandem with Stealth Rock. Stone Edge is an alternative to Whirlwind that hits the common Flying-types that would wall Hippowdon otherwise, such as Zapdos, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind to cripple Pokemon that Hippowdon can't touch and wear down opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. Ice Fang is an option to deal with the likes of Garchomp, Dragonite, and Landorus-T, but it comes with the drawback of having to drop either Whirlwind or Stealth Rock, which makes Hippowdon not able to perform as well as it should.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 112 Def / 144 SpD ensures Hippowdon will avoid getting OHKOed by Tapu Koko's Twinkle Tackle after a Calm Mind, while also dodging a 2HKO from unboosted Tapu Lele's Moonblast, offensive Tornadus-T's Hurricane, and Modest Magnezone's Flash Cannon while having enough physical bulk to tank an Earthquake from +2 Adamant Landorus-T and Return from +2 Mega Pinsir. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with a source of passive recovery, which allows it to avoid being 2HKOed in most of the aforementioned close calls. Run Sand Force if Mega Venusaur or Synthesis Tapu Bulu is one of Hippowdon's teammates, as Synthesis recovers less when sand is present. An EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD is an option to handle physical attackers more easily while still being able to check Tapu Koko and Heatran to some extent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippowdon can function as a catch-all check for physical attackers that don't have super effective moves for it, such as Tyranitar, some Mega Mawile, and Mega Charizard X. It can also check a couple of special attackers such as some variants of Tapu Koko and Heatran. Due to its low Speed stat, Hippowdon will often move last, so be sure to keep it healthy with Slack Off to consistently check opposing Pokemon. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock many times throughout the match, so it doesn't need to worry about opposing entry hazard removers unless Stealth Rock being set up is necessary to win. Avoid letting Hippowdon be burned or poisoned, as it will interfere with its ability to check threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grounded Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Gengar can remove Toxic Spikes for Hippowdon, as well as being able to check Grass-types decently. Teammates that can take on Ice-, Water-, and Grass-types are appreciated. Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn can decently check threats such as Ash-Greninja, Kyurem-B, and Tangrowth, while Toxapex and Ferrothorn can additionally set up Toxic Spikes or Spikes, respectively. Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth can handle almost any Water-type in the tier without trouble. Heatran is an effective lure for Water-types, as it can trap them with Magma Storm and beat them with Bloom Doom. It can also threaten most Grass- and Ice-types with its Fire-type STAB moves. Excadrill is a decent teammate due to Hippowdon activating its ability Sand Rush; Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and outspeed Pokemon that threaten Hippowdon such as Tapu Lele, Keldeo, and Kyurem-B with Sand Rush and beat them. Mega Garchomp also benefits from the sand, which boosts its Ground- and Rock-type moves.</p>"

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Utilizing its great Speed, tricky STAB movepool, and solid attacking power, Weavile is a dangerous physical attacker capable of threatening out common metagame Pokemon like Landorus-T, Serperior, and Tornadus-T with ease and weakening defensive checks like Magearna and Tapu Fini with Knock Off. Weavile is the premier Pursuit trapper, removing crucial Pokemon like Mega Latias and Cresselia and picking off weakened threats like Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele. Additionally, its useful priority in Ice Shard can finish off faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Alakazam while helping take the heat off against chipped setup sweepers like Hawlucha, Mega Charizard X, and Tapu Koko. However, Weavile has an extremely hard matchup against Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile, as both are unbothered by its Ice-type attacks and Knock Off and threaten to OHKO it back. Weavile also has an incredibly hard time switching into nearly anything due to its weakness-laden typing and sad defensive stats, and is punished harshly by any type of entry hazard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Weavile can make use of a Swords Dance set with Groundium Z to OHKO Magearna and Toxapex, though the immediate power of Choice Band is sorely missed, and it rarely finds any setup opportunities due to its lack of good resistances and defensive stats, which renders it vulnerable to a warm summer breeze. Choice Scarf can be used to specialize against Mega Alakazam and also let Weavile revenge kill the likes of Tapu Koko, +1 Kommo-o, and +1 Mega Charizard X, though its attacking strength is quite weak without Choice Band.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Magearna, Tapu Fini, and especially Mega Mawile resist both of Weavile's STAB moves, and Mega Mawile and Z-Move variants of Magearna are completely unfazed by Knock Off. Other Fairy-types like Clefable and Diancie can take Knock Off from Weavile, and Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can threaten out Weavile with their Fairy-type STAB moves. However, Tapu Fini is incredibly bothered by Knock Off removing its only form of recovery, and Clefable can be broken through with a single Icicle Crash flinch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Physically defensive Steel-types like Skarmory and Mega Scizor can handle Weavile, with Mega Scizor even being able to threaten Weavile with super effective priority. However, neither of these Pokemon resist Beat Up and have to be wary about switching in when chipped down, and Skarmory has to worry about Icicle Crash flinches on top of everything else.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja and Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T can outspeed and threaten out Weavile, though none of these Pokemon would like to switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Weavile despises the presence of Stealth Rock as well as other types of entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as they quickly reduce the number of times Weavile can switch in and make progress. Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Toxapex can chip away at Weavile's health. Poison from Toxic Spikes or burn from Mega Sableye and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and Toxapex's Scald put Weavile on a timer; additionally, burn completely ruins Weavile's wallbreaking power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Icicle Crash slices through the plentiful Ice-weak Pokemon in the tier, with common examples being Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T; Grass-types like Serperior and Tapu Bulu; and Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Mega Latias. Its high flinch rate is the cherry on top, allowing Weavile to force its way through the likes of Clefable and Skarmory, among other targets. Knock Off mows down Psychic-types like Jirachi, Cresselia, and Reuniclus and annoys checks like Magearna, Tapu Fini, and Clefable by removing their Leftovers, or potentially Assault Vest in the case of Magearna, making them easier to chip down. Ice Shard is useful for finishing off faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam and Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Serperior. Beat Up can be used on certain offense teams for extra attacking power, notably avoiding the drop in power that Knock Off has against Pokemon that can't lose their item, which is generally helpful for repeated uses and especially useful for 2HKOing specially defensive Toxapex and pestering the likes of Magearna and Mega Scizor; it additionally avoids negative contact effects like Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Volcarona's Flame Body and it messes with Counter, with Weavile only being hit back for twice the damage of a single hit of Beat Up. Pursuit is one of Weavile's main draws, primarily to trap the aforementioned Psychic-types but also being generally useful to pick off any low-HP Pokemon and irritating Choice-locked Pokemon like Tapu Lele and even Greninja as they switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pressure allows Weavile to scout Choice Scarf from lead Landorus-T and Tapu Lele, which have abilities that visibly activate, as if their ability activates before Weavile's Pressure, it means they are faster.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weavile is the type of Pokemon that you want to bring in as much as possible, but due to its aforementioned frailty issues, doing so isn't straightforward; the best ways to get it in are through pivoting teammates or as a revenge killer, though due to its ability to trap Pokemon, it certainly brings a high enough reward to warrant high-risk double switches into it. Early-game Weavile should work at weakening its checks as they switch in with Knock Off. If Beat Up is used, it's a good option for getting 2HKOs against weakened Pokemon like Magearna that have already had their item removed, or Toxapex, regardless of whether it has an item or not. One thing to note about using Beat Up is that allowing the opponent to spread status will reduce the power of Beat Up; generally, Beat Up is only superior to Knock Off with 5 or preferably 6 hits. Weavile can aggressively switch into Cresselia to trap it, though with other Psychic-types, like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Reuniclus, it should beware of the possibility of super effective coverage in Hidden Power Fighting and Focus Blast or strong enough neutral hits, like Draco Meteor from Mega Latias and Mega Latios.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weavile is relatively unique in that it can fit on nearly every teamstyle, ranging from offense teams to semi-stall. On offense teams, Mega Medicham is a huge benefactor of the removal of Psychic-types like Mega Latias and Cresselia, and it has no problem splitting open the likes of Magearna and Mega Scizor with High Jump Kick. These offense teams also pack lots of pivoting support, like Landorus-T, Magearna, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W, providing Weavile with plenty of safe opportunities to get in. Beat Up does rely on the Attack stats of its teammates, and although the damage rarely varies in a very significant way, it's beneficial to pair Weavile with teammates that have high Attack stats like Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, and Mega Scizor. Kyurem-B is a notable teammate, as it shares checks with Weavile like Magearna, which it can heavily chip to give Weavile an easier time, or vice versa. On bulkier teams, Swords Dance Gliscor becomes a different beast entirely once Weavile disposes of the likes of Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Cresselia, which are some of Gliscor's most consistent defensive checks. Toxapex can absorb Toxic Spikes and covers some of Weavile's glaring defensive weaknesses, allowing Weavile to fall back on it. Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro complements Weavile by helping it break through Toxapex and Skarmory and compounding its chip damage on the likes of Magearna and Mega Mawile. Consistent entry hazard removal from teammates like Tornadus-T is necessary for Weavile to function over the course of a longer game, as it relies on a hit-and-run playstyle that doesn't work when it's punished for entering the field. Fire-types like Heatran, Victini, and the Mega Charizard formes appreciate Weavile removing items from Tapu Fini and Toxapex as well as trapping Mega Latias and Mega Latios.</p>"

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth is an effective pivot thanks to its great defensive typing in Grass, which allows it to check a number of threats such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Diancie, Garchomp, and Tapu Koko. It can perform as a great wall both physically with its Rocky Helmet set as well as specially with an Assault Vest, which is required for surviving hits from Pokemon like Ash-Greninja. Tangrowth is able to fill these roles well due to Regenerator, allowing it to heal off passive damage while switching, retaining momentum for its teammates while still being able to repeatedly switch into the threats that it needs to check. Despite its general lack of power, Tangrowth has great utility moves such as Knock Off and coverage moves such as Earthquake for Heatran, Hidden Power Ice for Landorus-T and Garchomp, Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, and Sludge Bomb for Tapu Bulu. However, Tangrowth is relatively passive and relies on its super effective coverage to be a threat, and the Assault Vest set is prone to Knock Off, which means that it has a much harder time switching into the threats that it needs to check if it loses its Assault Vest, especially as the likes of Serperior and Mega Alakazam tend to use Knock Off themselves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic lets Tangrowth wear down a variety of its checks better on the physically defensive set; this is best paired with Hidden Power Fire to deter Steel-types like Ferrothorn from switching in on Toxic. Focus Blast has good coverage and allows Tangrowth to hit Ferrothorn and Heatran in one slot, but the low accuracy and PP of the move may make this less desirable than its other moves. Stun Spore is an option over Sleep Powder to support slower teammates like Mega Mawile and offensive Heatran. Rock Slide punishes Fire-types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y that would switch into Tangrowth freely, but has no use otherwise. Worry Seed allows Tangrowth to counter even specially defensive Gliscor, though its utility is highly specific.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: The strongest counter to Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur takes very little damage from all of Tangrowth's coverage options, STAB moves, and Knock Off and in return can take out Tangrowth with a STAB Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Mega Pinsir have the ability to break past Tangrowth thanks to their super effective STAB moves and do not really fear anything from Tangrowth; Tornadus-T can use Hurricane, Hawlucha can break through Tangrowth with Acrobatics after consuming its item, and Mega Pinsir threatens Tangrowth with Aerilate-boosted Returns. Landorus-T, a Pokemon that Tangrowth is supposed to check, deserves a special mention as it can run Flyinium Z to cleanly OHKO Tangrowth.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Heatran resist Tangrowth's Grass-type STAB moves and threaten it with super effective Fire-type STAB moves of their own; Heatran must watch out for Earthquake, and Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona must watch out for Rock Slide, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, Weavile, and Kyurem-B can overpower even physically defensive Tangrowth easily due to their sheer power and super effective STAB attacks. Similarly, special wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Greninja, Magearna, and Mega Alakazam can threaten non-Assault Vest variants, the latter of which can also cripple Tangrowth with Knock Off.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off provides great utility in allowing Tangrowth to cripple its checks by removing their items or potentially scouting for Z-Crystals. Hidden Power Ice allows Tangrowth to hit Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor to prevent them from setting up on it. Sludge Bomb is useful to deal with Tapu Bulu, which can otherwise use Tangrowth as setup fodder. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to incapacitate a threat on the opponent's team, which is valuable to stop them from laying down entry hazards or setting up on it. Earthquake can be used to hit Heatran, Magearna, and Mega Mawile super effectively, although Tangrowth gets better use from the coverage provided by a Hidden Power and its utility moves. Hidden Power Fire can be run to hit Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, which resist Giga Drain and take very little from Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Tangrowth to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump as well as the OHKO from uninvested Landorus-T's Supersonic Skystrike and physical Kyurem-B's Ice Beam from full health. Rocky Helmet lets Tangrowth punish physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Tangrowth set is primarily used to check numerous physical attackers in the tier such as Landorus-T and Garchomp and should be used to switch directly into these threats. Due to this set's poor special bulk, switching into special attackers is not advised unless you are sure that Tangrowth can take the hit, such as against Tapu Koko. Sleep Powder should be used on a predicted switch into a threat like Tornadus-T that you wish to incapacitate; this can also be taken advantage of by predicting the threat that the opponent wishes to use as sleep fodder by using Knock Off or switching into a teammate that can take advantage of the designated sleep fodder. Tangrowth can make use of its super effective coverage to damage its foes, but most of the time, Giga Drain and Knock Off are relatively safe moves to throw out, especially since Knock Off can let Tangrowth scout for items and pivot more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates teammates that can deal with the strong special attackers in the tier that it cannot check due to the lack of special bulk. Toxapex is a good example, as it handles non-Extrasensory Greninja and Ash-Greninja; Toxapex also provides Toxic Spikes support. Magearna is also a good option that deal with numerous special attackers such as Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Ash-Greninja. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock for Tangrowth and can also check opposing Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can serve as great threats to Tangrowth. Entry hazard removers are good teammates to make sure that Tangrowth is not put into 2HKO range by the attackers that it checks in addition to damage that is not healed off completely by Regenerator; Zapdos is a great example, as it can also check Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T, a big threat to Tangrowth.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is an alternative to Giga Drain that pressures Mega Alakazam much better. Knock Off is Tangrowth's most useful utility move on this set, removing items and weakening foes for its teammates to take advantage of. Hidden Power Ice allows Tangrowth to weaken Landorus-T and Garchomp, which can otherwise set up on Tangrowth. Earthquake hits Heatran and other Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Mawile to weaken them for a partner to take advantage of. Sludge Bomb can be useful to take care of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko and can also come in handy against opposing Tangrowth and Tornadus-T; the poison chance can weaken them, and Sludge Bomb can do significant damage if the opposing Tangrowth's own Assault Vest has already been removed with Knock Off. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferrothorn, which takes the rest of Tangrowth's moves with ease, and it also hits Kartana and Mega Scizor; however, be wary, as Mega Scizor can threaten Tangrowth with U-turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature is used because Tangrowth's Speed is very low, and it is best to boost Tangrowth's Special Defense without harming any of its damage output. 252 HP and 12 Defense EVs allow Tangrowth to survive two Ice Punches from Jolly Mega Swampert after Stealth Rock damage, as well as a +1 Breakneck Blitz from Kartana.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to use Tangrowth's great bulk and wide set of resistances by switching it directly into the threats that it checks such as Tapu Koko, and Ash-Greninja; however, be careful when playing around Ash-Greninja, as it can put Tangrowth into a potential 2HKO range with either Ice Beam or Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock damage if Tangrowth is weakened. Thanks to Regenerator, Tangrowth can pivot into threats that can still hurt it and pivot back out to scout out what type of set the foe has. Knock Off in most cases is the safest move to throw out, as it can scout for items and potential Z-Crystals on the opposing team while weakening foes that rely on their items. Tangrowth can use its super effective coverage to weaken foes like Garchomp and Gliscor if it carries Hidden Power Ice and Ferrothorn if it has Hidden Power Fire. In most other cases, using Giga Drain or Knock Off is relatively safe. However, be wary of foes that tend to run Knock Off, such as opposing Tangrowth, as they can severely limit Tangrowth's ability to check the threats that it needs to; for example, an itemless Tangrowth can get 2HKOed by non-transformed Greninja with Choice Specs Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best on bulky offense and balance teams that require a strong pivotal check to Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type threats. Toxapex can handle the Fire-type threats that Tangrowth has difficulty taking on itself and forms a Regenerator core with Tangrowth. Heatran is a very good partner for Tangrowth, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock to help Tangrowth wear down the opposing team easily. Heatran can also handle Steel- and Grass-types such as Magearna and Mega Venusaur, as they take very little from Tangrowth's coverage options, and it appreciates Tangrowth's ability to check Ground-types like Garchomp for it. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor also pair well with Tangrowth; they appreciate Tangrowth's ability to check Water-types for them and can even weaken Fire-types like Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y. Entry hazard control is a good idea to run with Tangrowth, as it can get easily worn down by Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, which, even with Regenerator, can cause trouble for Tangrowth when it switches into the threats that it checks. Zapdos is a good teammate, as it likes Tangrowth's ability to take care of various special attackers for it, and it can check the likes of Mega Pinsir and Tornadus-T for Tangrowth in return. Tapu Fini is also a good partner due to the great type synergy that it has with Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini can clear entry hazards with Defog.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>Gliscor has proven to be one of the most defining Pokemon within the metagame, owing to its great typing, vast movepool, and incredible ability in Poison Heal, which not only grants it incredible passive recovery but also prevents it from being statused due to its constant state of being poisoned. These traits allow it to act as a valuable check to the prominent Heatran and to freely switch into Toxapex's Scald, not fearing a potential burn. Gliscor's Swords Dance variant is a premier setup sweeper, using its naturally good bulk and passive recovery to be difficult to pressure by defensive Pokemon. The aforementioned qualities also make it a utility powerhouse, being a great, consistent user of both Stealth Rock and Defog, as well as supporting its team with the momentum-grabbing U-turn. The downside to Gliscor's typing is its glaring 4x weakness to Ice leaving it threatened out by both Ice-types, like Kyurem-B and Weavile, and Pokemon carrying Ice-type coverage, like Mega Latias and Mega Latios. Additionally, Gliscor faces competition from the omnipresent Landorus-T, which is much more versatile due to being able to hold many different items like Rocky Helmet, Choice Scarf, and various Z-Crystals, unlike Gliscor, which must hold Toxic Orb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative EV spread for the Swords Dance variant is 248 HP / 80 Atk / 120 SpD / 60 Spe with an Adamant nature, as this allows Gliscor to always OHKO opposing Swords Dance Gliscor at +2 with Ice Fang and outspeed Timid Magnezone. Taunt can be slotted on instead of Roost on the utility variants to disrupt defensive teams; however, this set requires more careful play in regards to letting Gliscor take attacks, as it cannot manually heal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon, such as Kyurem-B and Weavile, can threaten Gliscor using its dire 4x weakness to Ice. Additionally, Pokemon carrying Ice-type coverage, like Ice Beam Magearna and Slowbro or Hidden Power Ice Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam, are similarly threatening and require careful scouting.</p> <p><strong>Strong Water-types</strong>: Strong Water-type attackers, such as Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Manaphy, can easily threaten Gliscor out with their powerful super effective Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune and -resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are not threatened by Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Mega Latias, and Rotom-W, have a much easier time switching into Gliscor and cannot be threatened in return.</p> <p><strong>Prevention of Toxic Orb Activation</strong>: Gliscor needs to stay in for a turn to be able to activate its Toxic Orb, so opposing Knock Off or status move users can incredibly hinder Gliscor by removing its greatest attribute in Poison Heal recovery.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers, such as Kyurem-B, Mega Medicham, and Choice Specs Tapu Lele, can threaten out Gliscor with a potential OHKO.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gliscor is an incredible Swords Dance user, owing to its incredible recovery and pseudo-status immunity, allowing it to set up boosts on the many Pokemon that cannot threaten it while also never being threatened by burn. Earthquake is Gliscor's strongest STAB move, hitting Steel-types like Magearna and Heatran super effectively. The Poison Heal and Toxic Orb combination gives Gliscor the benefit of a perpetually boosted Facade, letting it hit Pokemon not threatened by Earthquake, like Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Ice Fang can be used with an EV spread of 248 HP / 64 Def / 44 SpD / 152 Spe to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and opposing Gliscor harder; however, there is a drop in power compared to Facade against targets that it doesn't hit 4x super effectively. The given EV spread for Ice Fang Gliscor allows it to survive a +1 Mega Charizard X Flare Blitz when at full health and, most importantly, outspeed neutral-natured Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele, with the added benefit of outspeeding most opposing Gliscor and Landorus-T variants. Roost allows Gliscor to stay healthy and compounds on its already great passive recovery, letting it easily shrug off Scald from the likes of Toxapex, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs in combination with a Jolly nature allow Gliscor to outspeed Modest Heatran. The rest of the EVs are put into special bulk to help Gliscor take super effective special attacks, such as Tapu Fini's Scald and Landorus-T's Hidden Power Ice. Alternatively, a Careful nature allows Gliscor to have extra comfort when taking the aforementioned attacks while also letting it survive Ice Beam from uninvested Magearna and Mega Slowbro. Additionally, it can help Gliscor handle neutral hits, letting it always avoid the 2HKO from Mega Alakazam's Psychic and always survive Modest Heatran's Inferno Overdrive.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Once Gliscor has completed the crucial early-game task of activating its Toxic Orb, it can and should be switched into passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Chansey as much as possible, threatening to set up multiple Swords Dance boosts and spiral out of control. It can utilize Facade to efficiently chip away at common checks that have limited longevity, such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Even in the case where the opposing team has a counter to Swords Dance Gliscor, such as Mega Latias, Gliscor can still chip away at it with Facade and pressure its recovery moves, which is even more effective when Stealth Rock is present on the opposing side of the field. Many Pokemon that seemingly check Gliscor due to their typing, such as Celesteela and Tangrowth, can fail to pressure it in a meaningful way and can lose the one-on-one, as it can boost its Attack to +6 and use Roost to stay healthy enough to break them down slowly with Facade. When using Gliscor, you should always be mindful of Ice-type coverage from the likes of Magearna, Tapu Koko, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Alakazam and scout these attacks out before being confident to let Gliscor stay in against them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is generally only suited to teams ranging from balance to semi-stall, as it specializes in being a long-term threat rather than dealing immediate damage. Gliscor appreciates Stealth Rock support from the likes of Heatran and Clefable more than most Pokemon do, as the damage compounds with Facade to chip away at temporary checks, such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, as well as providing additional pressure on Mega Latias. Additionally, Stealth Rock is especially effective against the Rock-weak Ice-types that check Gliscor. Pursuit support from the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can remove Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Calm Mind Cresselia, which is incredibly beneficial, as they reliably check this set. Magearna is a good partner, as it can provide a slow Volt Switch, allowing a safe activation of Gliscor's Toxic Orb, as well as taking on Ice-types like Kyurem-B and Weavile. A bulky Water-type check that can handle the common Ash-Greninja, such as Toxapex, is needed due to Greninja threatening out Gliscor with an OHKO if it is brought in safely. Mega Latias can also make for a good partner, as it is able to check big threats to Gliscor such as Mega Swampert, Swords Dance Kartana, and opposing Ice Fang Gliscor.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gliscor's advantage over Landorus-T in a utility role is its incredible longevity, meaning that it can either set Stealth Rock or use Defog throughout the game without worrying about being chipped at by entry hazards and status conditions. Gliscor is able to switch into Heatran, one of the premier Stealth Rock users, and remove its Stealth Rock via Defog as it is threatened out by a potential Earthquake. Gliscor's pseudo-immunity to status and incredible recovery give it a good matchup against passive entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad, Clefable, Chansey, and Toxapex. This longevity is also a great merit as a Stealth Rock setter, as it is able to set its own entry hazards against the aforementioned Pokemon and regularly outlast opposing Defoggers like Rotom-W and Landorus-T over the course of a long game. Earthquake threatens out Heatran and Toxapex and prevents setup threats like Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile from taking advantage of Gliscor. Roost combines with Poison Heal to make Gliscor incredibly difficult to kill, even letting it shed its Flying typing to help out against Ice-type moves from slower Pokemon. Toxic allows Gliscor to efficiently threaten Pokemon that are not threatened by Earthquake, like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior, as well as Mega Latias and Mega Latios if it catches them switching in. This is especially good against opposing Defoggers, as they are put on a timer and will not be able to prevent Stealth Rock from Gliscor long-term. U-turn is a valuable momentum tool that can capitalize on Ground-type switch-ins, like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Mega Latias, both chipping away at them and gaining valuable momentum. Additionally, it utilizes Gliscor's ability to come in on status-inducing moves, like Toxic and Scald, to let it pivot out to a teammate that would have been threatened by them. Knock Off can be used to punish Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Chansey in a permanent way, removing their important items and hurting their capability to take hits throughout the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>136 Speed EVs, in conjunction with a Jolly nature, allow Gliscor to outspeed positive-natured Hoopa-U, as well as Timid Heatran and Adamant Excadrill. 64 Defense EVs allow Gliscor to always survive a +1 Flare Blitz from Mega Charizard X at full health. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to help Gliscor more comfortably switch into Heatran's Magma Storm and Zapdos's Hidden Power Ice. Toxic Orb in combination with Poison Heal gives Gliscor very strong passive recovery, which grants it incredible longevity, as well as making it practically immune to status conditions while it is poisoned.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>An important early-game task is ensuring that Gliscor's Toxic Orb can activate by keeping it safe from Knock Off and non-poison status conditions until it is poisoned. One safe way to do this is by switching Gliscor into defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Skarmory, Reuniclus, and Celesteela that cannot threaten to remove its item or reliably inflict another status condition. This can also be achieved by pairing Gliscor with slow users of pivot moves that can take a hit prior to bringing Gliscor in safely. This means that prior to Toxic Orb activation, Gliscor cannot safely switch into Heatran and Toxapex due to its fear of the significant chance for Lava Plume and Scald to burn. However, once Toxic Orb is activated, Gliscor can easily switch into any defensive Pokemon lacking strong super effective coverage, and it is able to take advantage of this with its utility movepool. This allows it to very easily switch into entry hazard setters like Toxapex, Clefable, and defensive variants of Landorus-T and Heatran. If Gliscor is able to badly poison the opposing Defogger, like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, or Zapdos, then it will not be able to stop Stealth Rock long-term. U-turn makes Gliscor a great Stealth Rock setter to have against stall teams, as it is able to pivot out with U-turn against a Mega Sableye predicting Stealth Rock, both chipping away at it and preserving momentum. Make sure to get the most out of U-turn by having Gliscor use it liberally to preserve momentum against incoming switches like Landorus-T and Mega Latias and bring in threatening offensive teammates. Gliscor can be OHKOed by offensive Heatran's Inferno Overdrive and by a potential Ice Beam from Magearna, so it is useful to scout for these moves beforehand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog Gliscor can fit on all kinds of teams ranging from bulky offense to stall, as its longevity grants it consistency in removing entry hazards throughout the game that is widely appreciated by teammates with Stealth Rock weaknesses, such as Kyurem-B, Zapdos, both Mega Charizard formes, and Volcarona. Stealth Rock makes Gliscor a better fit for bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Gliscor being able to set Stealth Rock freely in the face of many Pokemon that rely on status to avoid passivity, like Toxapex and Chansey. Additionally, powerful wallbreakers, such as Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele, appreciate Gliscor bringing them in safely via U-turn. Defensive Steel-types like Magearna and Jirachi are useful partners, as they can check both the threatening Tapu Lele and Ice-types like Kyurem-B. Toxapex can pivot into Water-type and Ice-type attacks and check Ash-Greninja, which outspeeds and OHKOes Gliscor. Heatran makes for a good partner, as it appreciates not needing to run Stealth Rock itself, and it can help out against the threatening Mega Mawile, as well as Grass-types like Serperior and Tapu Bulu, which take very little from Gliscor's Earthquake. When Gliscor is carrying Defog, it opens up move options for teammates like Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos, as they no longer need to run Defog themselves. Teammates with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Magearna, can help Gliscor safely activate its Toxic Orb early-game. Mega Medicham and Hawlucha can threaten to OHKO Gliscor with Ice Punch and set up on it with Swords Dance, respectively, so it can be beneficial to pair Gliscor with a bulky Psychic-type such as Slowbro, Cresselia, or Reuniclus.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine's primary role in OU is as a wallbreaker due to its high Attack stat and fantastic Ice- and Ground-type STAB combination that is very difficult to deal with defensively. It also has good utility due to its priority Ice Shard, threatening prevalent Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Access to Stealth Rock and its Ground typing are some of the main traits that help it fit onto teams, as both are invaluable. However, Mamoswine suffers competition from other Stealth Rock setters and Ground-type wallbreakers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp due to its mediocre Speed stat and subpar defenses, leaving it vulnerable to a lot of offensive Pokemon. Inability to reliably beat common priority users like Ash-Greninja and Mega Scizor further worsens Mamoswine's Speed issues. Overall, Mamoswine is a decent Pokemon but requires more team support than the most common Ground-types in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower can hit Ferrothorn, but that's about it. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, but the utility Stealth Rock and Knock Off provide isn't worth dropping most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is the biggest threat to Mamoswine due to its ability to tank multiple Earthquakes and use Roost to heal off the damage while threatening Mamoswine with Bullet Punch. Celesteela and Skarmory also eat Mamoswine's attacks pretty well but don't check it as well offensively and can be taken down with boosts from Metronome and timely Icicle Crash flinch. Ferrothorn can take any two attacks from Mamoswine if it's not fully specially defensive but does not have reliable recovery and cannot switch in repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Manaphy threaten to OHKO Mamoswine with super effective STAB moves. More defensive Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Alomomola can switch into Mamoswine relatively well and threaten it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona all naturally outspeed Mamoswine and threaten to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The likes of Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade, while being unable to switch directly in on Mamoswine, naturally outpace it and can OHKO Mamoswine with their super effective STAB moves. These Pokemon also can get revenge killed via Ice Shard when weakened enough. Mega Heracross's typing and bulk set it apart from other Fighting-types and let it switch in on Mamoswine's Earthquake pretty comfortably.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Shard helps Mamoswine check Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as pick off other weakened threats. Mamoswine makes a good use of Stealth Rock, since its great STAB coverage enables it to find many opportunities to set it up against Pokemon it threatens out. Knock Off, on the other hand, cripples Mamoswine's answers like Celesteela and defensive Rotom-W by removing their items for the rest of the battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is the preferred option, since Jolly doesn't allow Mamoswine to outspeed anything notable and lowers its firepower. Thick Fat is the ability of choice to reduce the damage Mamoswine takes from Fire- and Ice-type moves. Metronome is used to bypass would-be-checks such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor over time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine should be used as a wallbreaker to threaten defensive backbones that cannot stomach powerful Ice- and Ground-type attacks. Icicle Crash is often the primary option, because nothing is immune to it and Ice-type attacks are generally very difficult to switch into. In general, one should weigh the risk and reward scenario presented to them and select their move based on that; Earthquake might not lose you too much against a team whose Ground switch-in is Landorus-T. Mamoswine can also be used to check faster threats such as Garchomp with Ice Shard; you can use this opportunity to predict a switch and go for more powerful STAB attacks as well. Mamoswine shouldn't be directly switched in very often, as it has relatively poor defenses, but it can be used in some cases to block Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Magearna and Tapu Koko if you predict correctly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its great offensive presence and relative frailty, Mamoswine fits best on offensive teams that can give it proper support. VoltTurn pivots like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone can bring Mamoswine in on bulky Grass-types, which these three tend to lure in, for free so Mamoswine can force them out and take advantage of it The likes of Tapu Fini and Tangrowth take on offensive Water-types, mainly Ash-Greninja, for Mamoswine; the latter also checks Kartana. Ash-Greninja appreciates Mamoswine's ability to threaten most of its defensive stops like Toxapex and Tangrowth while also creating a hazard stacking core with Mamoswine.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While it's true that after Z-Conversion Porygon-Z becomes a threatening sweeper, its overreliance on stat boosts from the aforementioned move, inability to get a second chance at sweeping, and reliance on a lot of support hold it back from being viable in the metagame. Furthermore, Porygon-Z's low stats, except Special Attack, mean that it's hard to find setup opportunities due to low defenses and lack of resistances, so Porygon-Z is outclassed by better setup sweepers like Magearna.

Porygon-Z isn't worth using, though, as it struggles to break past common defensive or just bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, and the metagame has more consistent setup sweepers requiring less support like Magearna and Mega Mawile due to their better movesets and typings.</p>"}},

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W makes a great pivot for offensive teams thanks to its good typing, bulk, and set versatility. It's immune to Ground-type attacks from Landorus-T, Gliscor, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Garchomp and Spikes while also checking other popular threats like Heatran, Tornadus-T, Manaphy, and Greninja. Checking Ground-types and Heatran also make it a good Defogger, since they are all very common Stealth Rock setters, and its lack of passivity compared to other Defoggers like Gliscor and Zapdos is important for offensive teams, featuring a decently strong Hydro Pump and Volt Switch to keep momentum. It's also great against rain teams, being one of the best answers to Mega Swampert and other rain threats like the aforementioned Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Manaphy. This defensive profile lets Rotom-W come in, force out Ground-types with Hydro Pump, and easily pivot in offensive teammates with Volt Switch while wearing down foes. Rotom-W can also burn switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Tapu Bulu with Will-O-Wisp, punishing them without having to switch out. Will-O-Wisp is also great to reduce prediction, since most Pokemon that can switch into Hydro Pump or Volt Switch hate being burned. It can even run Waterium Z on its defensive set to OHKO Pokemon like Heatran and Gliscor or run a more offensive set with Electrium Z that lures in and takes out bulky targets that would otherwise pivot into it, like Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Manaphy. However, Rotom-W lacks reliable recovery, so it can sometimes struggle to pivot into what it needs to in the long run, especially if Wiki Berry Rotom-W gets hit by Knock Off from Pokemon it's meant to check, mainly Tornadus-T. Rotom-W is also vulnerable to Toxic from the Pokemon it's meant to switch into, namely Heatran and Gliscor. Lastly, while its bulk is good, it isn't good enough to comfortably answer very strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf variant provides some added Speed and can cripple passive foes with Trick as well as generate momentum with Volt Switch; however, sacrificing its defensive utility is usually not worth the trade-off. An offensive set with Hydro Pump / Volt Switch / Hidden Power Fire / Defog, Waterium Z, and an EV spread of 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe is an alternative for more offensively oriented teams. Thunder Wave is an option to cripple Clefable, Heatran, and Reuniclus as well as immediately neuter offensive threats like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon resist both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks and can threaten it out with super effective attacks. While Kartana and Tapu Bulu fear a burn upon switching in, they can still effectively scare out Rotom-W. Ferrothorn and Tangrowth can come in on Rotom-W freely but can be worn down with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B is a terrifyingly powerful Pokemon that resists both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and only partially fears a burn, which can be played around by Substitute variants, as well as threaten Rotom-W with Earth Power thanks to Teravolt. Mega Latios similarly fears nothing from Rotom-W and threatens it with a 2HKO from Psychic. Garchomp similarly does not appreciate being burned, but it is capable of threatening Rotom-W with a +2 Continental Crush.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Bypass Levitate</strong>: Despite having access to Levitate, there are still Ground-types that can threaten Rotom-W. Particularly, Rotom-W has to watch out for Landorus-T's Smack Down or Gravity and Mold Breaker Earthquake from Excadrill and Mega Gyarados, as all are able to circumvent Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Rotom-W's mediocre recovery means it is very susceptible to chip damage from various sources, such as Toxic from Heatran, U-turn from Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, and Stealth Rock. Keep this in mind as you try to keep Rotom-W healthy to check what it is needed for. Gastrodon is particularly noteworthy, as it is immune to Volt Switch and Hydro Pump and can cripple Rotom-W with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high special bulk like Chansey, Reuniclus, and Clefable can freely switch into Rotom-W, although they all fear the threat of Volt Switch. Natural Cure and Magic Guard allow the aforementioned Pokemon to shrug off burns, and both Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus can use Rotom-W as setup fodder.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rotom-W is a good Defogger thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Greninja and ability to keep up momentum with Volt Switch. Besides providing recovery, Pain Split can punish healthy switch-ins due to Rotom-W's low base HP stat, especially Chansey, which is one of the most common switch-ins to Rotom-W on stall teams. Will-O-Wisp cripples some of its switch-ins like Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Kyurem-B, Tapu Bulu, and Assault Vest Magearna. Toxic can be used over Defog, Pain Split, or Will-O-Wisp to more heavily cripple switch-ins that aren't as fazed by burn, like Tangrowth, Gastrodon, Serperior, Kommo-o, and Mega Latias. However, it doesn't do anything to Steel-types that check it like Ferrothorn and Magearna.</p> <p>Rotom-W can run a fully physically defensive or specially defensive set, depending on what threats its team needs it to check more. A physically defensive spread lets it better check the Ground-types of the tier, most notably Swords Dance Gliscor, as well as miscellaneous threats like Hawlucha, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Scizor. It also avoids the OHKO from Mega Mawile's Play Rough and Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. Meanwhile, a specially defensive spread lets it more efficiently pivot into Battle Bond Greninja, Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, and offensive Heatran. Wiki Berry is an alternative to Pain Split that doesn't cost a turn to use, helping Rotom-W preserve momentum, pivot wallbreakers in, and switch into attacks like Greninja's Dark Pulse even when worn down, which is especially good on offensive teams. It also saves the moveslot needed for Pain Split. Waterium Z, on the other hand, lets Rotom-W OHKO Pokemon it otherwise couldn't like Gliscor, Heatran, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Koko while heavily damaging others like Tapu Lele, offensive Magearna, and Garchomp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus-T can check Grass-types like Kartana, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu, run Defog so Rotom-W has an extra moveslot, and switch into Mega Medicham while also forming a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W. Rotom-W pivots into Ice-type moves from Weavile and Mega Latias while also answering Heatran in return. Mega Scizor can similarly check Grass-types and form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W while also checking strong Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias, with Rotom-W answering Heatran and Tornadus-T and using Defog to aid Mega Scizor's longevity. Heatran can answer Grass-types like Kartana and Serperior, handle Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Magearna, and spread residual damage with Stealth Rock alongside Magma Storm and Toxic. Rotom-W can answer opposing Heatran, Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T, and Water-types like Mega Swampert and Greninja in return while pivoting Heatran in safely on some of its targets, like Magearna and Ferrothorn, to preserve its health. Ferrothorn can be a sturdier Water-resistant Pokemon and Grass-type check while spreading residual damage with entry hazards and using Knock Off, removing Leftovers to make Rotom-W's Volt Switch damage stick, while Rotom-W checks Heatran and Tornadus-T. Assault Vest Magearna has amazing synergy with the physically defensive set, taking strong special attacks from Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Mega Diancie, Mega Latios, Tapu Lele, and opposing offensive Magearna while enjoying Rotom-W taking on Fire- and Ground-types. It also appreciates Rotom-W keeping entry hazards off the field to make up for its lack of recovery. The two form a solid backbone for offensive teams against Ash-Greninja, since Magearna can take Dark Pulse, while Rotom-W can take Hydro Pump and clear the Spikes it sets. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T enjoy Rotom-W taking Water- and Ice-type attacks for them, with Gliscor able to act as a strong wincon with Swords Dance and absorb status from Heatran, while Landorus-T sets up Stealth Rock and forms a good VoltTurn core with it. Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can trap checks like Mega Latios, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias, with Mega Tyranitar able to set up Stealth Rock, and Weavile using Knock Off to remove bulky targets' Leftovers so Rotom-W's Volt Switch damage sticks. Both appreciate it pivoting them in safely with Volt Switch and taking strong Water-type attacks for them. Volcarona appreciates Rotom-W keeping entry hazards off the field and answering Heatran and Water-types, and it takes advantage of Volt Switch pivoting to more easily set up Quiver Dance on Pokemon like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias lacking Thunder Wave.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch helps Rotom-W maintain offensive momentum, limiting free switches in from Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias. Thunder is Rotom-W's strongest Electric-type STAB attack and when paired with Electrium Z can heavily damage unsuspecting targets, including Toxapex, Clefable, Zapdos, and Magearna. Pain Split helps Rotom-W last longer so it can be more effective. Moreover, it can be especially helpful against bulkier teams, allowing Rotom-W to constantly pressure Pokemon such as Chansey and overall not be as easy to wear down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs in tandem with a Timid nature allow Rotom-W to always outspeed Gyarados and Heatran. 184 Special Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Celesteela and Toxapex with Electrium Z-boosted Thunder after Stealth Rock, a 2HKO on offensive Garchomp with Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, and an OHKO on Weavile with Electrium Z-boosted Thunder. Waterium Z is also a viable option over Electrium Z for a better nuke against the likes of Garchomp, specially defensive Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Mega Tyranitar. By doing so, it is usually better to run Will-O-Wisp over Thunder, as without the Z-Crystal, Thunder is not as reliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to not carelessly waste Rotom-W's Z-Move. You should be patient with using the Z-Move by making sure your opponent won't anticipate and scout for it. Try to aggressively switch Rotom-W in on a predicted switch from a Pokemon such as Toxapex or Magearna and surprise it with its Z-Move. Lots of balance and stall teams tend to rely on a single Pokemon such as Mega Latias or a defensive Grass-type like Tangrowth to check Rotom-W, so focus on removing it by bringing in a counter with Volt Switch. The main attraction of this set is the great utility Rotom-W offers with the combination of applying constant pressure with Volt Switch and Pain Split. Setting up entry hazards and pivoting to strong wallbreakers enhances Rotom-W's ability to break apart teams. Keep in mind that Rotom-W will have trouble consistently checking Pokemon such as Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Gyarados. Be careful with hard switching it in often, as Rotom-W is frail and prone to being worn down, especially when Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Scizor can switch into Grass-types that force Rotom-W out and form a potent VoltTurn core alongside it. Scizor draws in Heatran, Toxapex, and Celesteela, all of which Rotom-W can take advantage of. Additional Fire- and Flying-type checks are crucial alongside this set, as Rotom-W is not a reliable switch-in to the likes of Heatran, Hawlucha, and Tornadus-T. Calm Mind sweepers such as Clefable and Mega Latias are good teammates for Rotom-W, as it can remove surefire checks like Heatran and Toxapex, allowing them to set up and sweep a lot more easily. Clefable in particular can also aid in setting up Stealth Rock, which helps Rotom-W even more by getting more chip damage on switch-ins alongside Volt Switch. Rotom-W appreciates entry hazards to have a better chance at pressuring teams. Ferrothorn and Greninja are great partners, as they can reliably set up Spikes to help Rotom-W's Volt Switch be more impactful.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Uxie appears to be entirely outclassed by other Psychic-types such as Mew and Tapu Lele. However, Uxie's combination of Trick Room, Stealth Rock, and Memento gives it a defined niche on Trick Room teams, as it's able to compress roles very efficiently by acting as a Stealth Rock setter and Trick Room setter while being able to provide its team members valuable momentum with Memento. Uxie's fantastic defensive stats also allow it to survive almost any hit and set up Trick Room in most scenarios. Despite this, Uxie is only viable on dedicated Trick Room teams, as it's completely outclassed by other Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Slowbro on any standard team. Uxie is also extremely passive, as it's unable to do much damage because of its pathetic offensive stats and because it usually can't afford to run an attacking move. It doesn't help that dedicated Trick Room teams are generally questionable in regards to viability and consistency, often considered just a gimmick.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Uxie has a large movepool with a lot of utility options, but most of them are impossible to fit into a moveslot due to the nature of Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Mega Heracross and Hoopa-U easily OHKO Uxie with Pin Missile and Hyperspace Fury, respectively. Other Pokemon that can 2HKO Uxie such as Ash-Greninja, Alolan Marowak, Mega Charizard Y, and Bisharp can easily dispatch of it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye is capable of bouncing back Stealth Rock thanks to Magic Bounce, but it can't stop Uxie from setting up Trick Room and must be wary of Skill Swap.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room makes slower Pokemon, such as Crawdaunt and Mega Mawile, go first against faster attackers such as Greninja and Tapu Bulu. Stealth Rock is Uxie's niche over other Trick Room setters, providing key role compression. Memento is used to give Pokemon such as Alolan Marowak a chance to set up with Swords Dance, and it also ensures that a Pokemon can come in without taking damage. Magic Coat is the main option in the last slot, as it allows Uxie to bounce back Spikes from passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, as well as preventing double Taunt from Pokemon such as Tapu Fini. Skill Swap is also a viable option, removing abilities such as Skarmory's Sturdy and allowing Uxie to set up Stealth Rock on Mega Sableye.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread runs enough Defense investment to survive Knock Off from Choice Band Weavile and puts the rest into Special Defense, making Uxie extremely hard to OHKO with special and physical moves. For example, Uxie is able to live Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch, Choice Specs Gengar's Shadow Ball, and Landorus-T's Supersonic Skystrike. 0 Speed IVs are used to allow Uxie to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible under Trick Room. Uxie's only ability is Levitate, which gives it a somewhat useful Ground-type immunity. Mental Herb is used as a one-time buffer against Taunt. Red Card is also an option to phaze setup sweepers that attack Uxie, as well as preventing Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Tapu Koko from gaining momentum with U-turn and Volt Switch respectively, as it will force them out into a random Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Uxie should usually set up Stealth Rock first, over Trick Room, in order to preserve Trick Room turns, but if you're facing a Pokemon that can 2HKO Uxie, such as Hoopa-U and Greninja, prioritize setting up Trick Room first. Magic Coat shouldn't be used against Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, as they can predict it and just attack Uxie, but it should be used against common Spikes setters, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Preserving Uxie to set up Trick Room later in the match usually isn't worth it, although if it can be done without letting a teammate take too much damage, you can do it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Uxie is only viable on dedicated Trick Room teams, so powerful, slow wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt, Stakataka, Alolan Marowak, and Mega Mawile make for good teammates, as they can take advantage of Trick Room to the fullest potential. Uxie is usually only setting up Trick Room once a match, so other Trick Room setters such as Magearna, Stakataka, and Cresselia also make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy is one of the undisputed strongest stallbreakers in the whole tier thanks to the combination of Tail Glow and Hydration, which makes it temporarily immune to Toxic in rain, so it naturally finds itself a place on several rain teams as their countermeasure to the stall matchup. Additionally, Manaphy is also a deadly wallbreaker with a rain-boosted +3 Hydro Vortex that makes it almost effortless to weaken typical rain checks for the likes of Mega Swampert and Ash-Greninja to clean up. With Psychic as coverage, Manaphy can also break past notable threats to rain, such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Manaphy's great bulk all-around also gives it a plethora of opportunities to set up, and a Water-type resistance helps with the opposing Ash-Greninja matchup in rain. However, Manaphy's relative lack of raw power makes it somewhat predictable and exploitable, as it needs to set up with Tail Glow to actually do damage, making easier to play around than most wallbreakers. This, accompanied by the fact that nearly all teams have something to outspeed it, also makes it a bit easy to play around, as it's not hard to pivot into a faster Water-resistant threat as it sets up Tail Glow, such as Serperior or Protean Greninja, and even when Manaphy does take down a Pokemon on the opposing team, it will be likely forced out by a faster threat such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko or Kartana.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers can be used over Waterium Z, especially on Rest variants, if Manaphy's team already packs a Z-Move user, but struggling to break past other Water-types like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W isn't quite ideal. Energy Ball helps out with Gastrodon and lets Manaphy save its Z-Move against Tapu Fini and Rotom-W; however, Manaphy can't break past Toxapex and Mega Venusaur without Psychic. Z-Rain Dance is an interesting option for some hyper offensive teams, but more often than not, there are far better sweepers to do the job.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Psychic on the Rest set to hit bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and allows Manaphy to conserve its Z-Move versus Mega Latias. However, it has limited targets and forces Manaphy to use its Z-Move on Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Rain Dance is also an option over Psychic on the Rest set to let Manaphy be self-sufficient against stall, but this leaves it unable to break past Gastrodon lacking Clear Smog and Toxapex.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Though niche, Mantine is arguably Manaphy's greatest enemy, being able to wall Manaphy indefinitely and Haze any boosts off. Gastrodon is an excellent check, but Rest variants can beat non-Clear Smog Gastrodon one-on-one. Toxapex struggles with Psychic variants and Rest variants if it's not running Haze; however, it can still be a nuisance to Manaphy otherwise. Lastly, Tapu Fini and Rotom-W resist Manaphy's Water-type STAB moves but are vulnerable to a +3 Hydro Vortex in rain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: The likes of Assault Vest Amoonguss and Ferrothorn take very little damage from whatever Manaphy attempts to do and deal heavy damage with their Grass-type STAB moves. Non-Assault Vest Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth are in a similar boat, but they take considerably more from +3 Ice Beam. Mega Venusaur takes on the few variants that lack Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias</strong>: Mega Latias switches in seamlessly against Manaphy, and variants packing Thunder can 2HKO it. Calm Mind variants can also slow down Manaphy's wallbreaking attempts.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers that can OHKO Manaphy, such as Kartana and Tapu Koko, are threats to be careful of, especially if they manage to pivot in as Manaphy sets up. However, other faster attackers can pick it off after some damage, such as Garchomp, Flyinium Z Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "2 Attacks + Rest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest, in conjunction with Hydration, allows Manaphy to recover all of its HP without consequence while rain is active. Surf is recommended over Scald due to its higher Base Power; Hydro Vortex coming off of Scald notably fails to achieve several notable OHKOs versus targets such as Mega Latias and Chansey at +3, and the added benefit of burns does not help in wearing down the majority of its checks. Ice Beam targets Mega Latias, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth without having to use its Z-Move, while Psychic enables Manaphy to break past Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Toxic can be used instead of a coverage move to annoy Gastrodon and Rotom-W, OHKO Shedinja, and chip away at Grass-types like Tangrowth long-term.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Manaphy to outspeed Timid Magnezone. Waterium Z provides Manaphy with a strong tool to break past specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Magearna as well as Water-type switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Ferrothorn after a Tail Glow boost. An EV spread of 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Tapu Bulu, which works well on Ice Beam variants. Another alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Gyarados and Tapu Fini but comes at the cost of significantly reducing Manaphy's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To maximize Manaphy's effectiveness as a stallbreaker, aim to have rain active as much as you can; the boost it provides Water-type moves allows a boosted Manaphy to break past usual checks such as Mega Latias and Ferrothorn with Hydro Vortex while also providing more opportunities for Manaphy to use Rest. Rest enables Manaphy to be played much more aggressively; HP conservation is not as important when it is able to recover lost HP without much consequence. As such, do not be afraid to use Manaphy to weaken or remove bulkier foes, as it is easily able to find chances to freely recover on passive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Gastrodon. However, Manaphy should avoid using Rest on the last active turn of rain, as rain will end before Hydration gets a chance to activate. Be sure to conserve Manaphy's Z-Move for bulkier targets such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Tangrowth, as they become more difficult to break past without it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Manaphy should only be used on rain builds. As such, Pelipper is a mandatory partner for Manaphy; it allows Manaphy to take advantage of Hydration and heal freely with Rest while also boosting the power of Manaphy's Water-type moves, allowing it to bypass some of the sturdiest defensive threats such as Mega Latias and Chansey. Ferrothorn also serves as an excellent partner for Manaphy; it provides Manaphy with entry hazard support while also being able to pivot into Tapu Koko and Mega Latias. Additionally, it possesses the ability to lure in and cripple Pokemon such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and opposing Ferrothorn with Knock Off, making them significantly easier for Manaphy to break through. Other rain staples such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Tornadus-T all appreciate Manaphy's ability to wear down traditional rain checks such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Rotom-W and are able to pivot into some of Manaphy's checks; the former pivots into Tapu Koko and the last into Grass-types such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu.</p>"
      },
      "Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Surf's added power makes it the preferred STAB move over Scald. Ice Beam is instrumental to break past Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and Dragon-types like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Kommo-o. Psychic helps out against Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, both of which can be notable annoyances to rain teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z gives Manaphy a strong nuke in Hydro Vortex that can plow through Water-resistant Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W at +3 in rain. Hydration helps Manaphy rid itself of Toxic from the likes of Chansey and Toxapex under rain. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed the likes of Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B and Speed ties with Mega Charizard Y, which would get rid of the rain that Manaphy thrives in thanks to Drought.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>An important aspect of using Manaphy is deciding whether to attack straight away or to set up. If your opponent has a healthy check to Manaphy, such as Gastrodon, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, or Assault Vest Tangrowth, it might be smart to double switch instead of trying to set up. If your opponent has a faster threat that can knock out Manaphy, such as Tapu Koko or Kartana, don't let them in for free as you set up a Tail Glow; sometimes, it's better to just attack them on the switch, especially if your team doesn't have a dedicated switch-in. Keep Manaphy healthy if it can potentially break a team; it can stomach a hit from the likes of Tapu Fini, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth if it needs to, and it can check threats to rain such as Ash-Greninja, for example. Don't be scared of letting Manaphy get inflicted by status as long as your Pelipper is healthy; however, if you're using it outside of a rain team, be very wary of Toxic from Chansey and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain support from Pelipper is highly recommended, as Manaphy only excels as a stallbreaker thanks to Hydration, and the Water-type boost from rain is more than welcome, especially for breaking Chansey and opposing Water-types. Teammates such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Kingdra appreciate typical rain checks getting weakened by Manaphy and can make up for Manaphy's subpar Speed. Mega Swampert also provides a very useful Electric-type immunity. While Manaphy helps with Ash-Greninja, other checks such as Ferrothorn, Magearna, and the aforementioned Kingdra help solidify the matchup, as Ash-Greninja is a deadly threat to rain teams.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to an insanely high Base Power STAB attack in V-create, a great coverage option in Bolt Strike, and utility in U-turn and Trick, Victini can operate effectively in OU as either a Choice Scarf or Choice Band user. Victini's unique typing and good bulk gives it many opportunities to switch in against common threats in the OU tier such as Magearna and Tapu Lele and wreak havoc. Alternatively, Victini can use a Z-Celebrate set to boost all its stats once per match, becoming a terrifying late-game sweeper that can be difficult to revenge kill. Stored Power is very strong after a boost, and with a useful coverage option in Focus Blast, Victini has the ability to shred through common defensive cores as well as offensive teams. Its good bulk and somewhat useful resistances give Victini plenty of chances to setup. Unfortunately, Victini's average attacking stats forces it to heavily rely on Z-Celebrate's boosts in order to pose much of a threat when running this set. Furthermore, Victini's typing causes it to be weak to every form of entry hazard as well as common priority, such as Sucker Punch and Water Shuriken.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victini has an expansive offensive movepool, featuring good options such as Glaciate, Blue Flare, Thunder, Energy Ball, Shadow Ball. Victini can use said movepool to function as either a mixed or special attacker with an Expert Belt or Choice Specs, though it usually breaks much more of the metagame when functioning as a physical wallbreaker. Trick Room is an option for taking advantage of V-create's Speed drops; however, Victini is often too fast to make use of Trick Room and is more effective as a moderately fast wallbreaker anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Garchomp and Mega Charizard X can somewhat reliably check Victini thanks to their resistance to V-create and Bolt Strike. Mega Latios and Mega Latias are also troublesome due to their resistances to Victini's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Slowbro and Alomomola resist V-create and only really need to watch out for Choice Banded Bolt Strike, which they can pivot into and switch to the appropriate teammate thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Some of OU's Ground-type Pokemon are bulky enough to tank an attack from Victini and threaten it with super effective Ground-type attacks. Examples include Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon, which can also use Whirlwind to get rid of Victini's boosts.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Weavile and Tyranitar are able to trap Victini if it's locked into Zen Headbutt or sometimes even V-create in Tyranitar's case. Victini is also very vulnerable to being revenge killed by them after using V-create.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Victini's average Speed, it is outsped and threatened by common Pokemon in Greninja, Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. It can also be picked off by Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken. All of these Pokemon have to be wary of Victini after a Z-Celebrate, however.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Victini to gain momentum and deal chip damage to Fire-resistant switch-ins like Tyranitar and Mega Latias. Final Gambit lets Victini quickly remove or force damage on a problematic Pokemon. It's particularly useful for getting rid of checks like Mega Latias, Heatran, and Toxapex, which may open the door for a teammate that shares these checks with Victini. Trick cripples walls such as Toxapex. If the opponent has multiple defensive stops to Victini such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Gliscor, the move ensures that Victini isn't limited to getting a single KO with Final Gambit. Bolt Strike can be run over Final Gambit to hit Water-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment ensures that Final Gambit deals as much damage as possible when Victini is healthy. If Victini is running Bolt Strike, maximum Attack investment should be used instead to secure the 2HKO on Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Choice Scarf turns Victini into an effective revenge killer, letting it outspeed threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Alakazam, and non-Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Think twice before using V-create if the opponent has an obvious switch-in to it, such as Heatran, Toxapex, or Tyranitar. U-turn is often a safer play, especially if Victini has another teammate that can deal with the threat that's in front of it. Consider using Final Gambit if doing so will significantly help out one of Victini's teammates by removing a shared check. For example, removing Mega Latias is highly beneficial for teammates like Kartana and Swords Dance Gliscor. Preserve Victini's health as much as possible before using Final Gambit; don't unnecessarily switch it into Stealth Rock or strong attacks. Final Gambit can be used early-game in order to immediately force a trade, which can be helpful against offensive teams. Trick should be used against defensive teams that rely on walls like Toxapex to check Victini.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Victini's ability to lure in checks like Mega Latias, Heatran, and Toxapex and KO them with Final Gambit make for good teammates. These include Pokemon such as Kartana, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Mega Scizor. Victini is susceptible to all entry hazards and has a Stealth Rock weakness, so it really appreciates Defog support. Tapu Fini is an excellent Defogger to pair with Victini because it can reliably switch into entry hazard setters like Heatran, Ash-Greninja, and Toxapex that trouble it. Gliscor is another great Defogger that can deal with Heatran, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and most Ground-types. Tornadus-T and Zapdos are solid Defoggers that can switch into Ground-type attacks for Victini as well. Solid answers to Water-types, particularly Ash-Greninja, are needed. Kommo-o checks Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Heatran for Victini and pressures defensive cores with its Z-Move and coverage options. Assault Vest Tangrowth checks Ash-Greninja and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp, and it can use Earthquake or Knock Off in order to weaken Heatran. Rotom-W deals with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Hippowdon in addition to Heatran and brings Victini in against Grass-types with Volt Switch, making it an exemplary partner. Wallbreakers benefit from the U-turn support Victini provides and help to break through defensive cores. Mega Medicham and Hoopa-U are notable examples, since they threaten many of Victini's switch-ins including Heatran, Tyranitar, Toxapex, and Mega Latias.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike is strong coverage, nailing Toxapex and other Water-types and significantly chunking Heatran. U-turn not only gives Victini a strong move to pivot with but also does substantial damage to Mega Latios and Tyranitar. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB attack that can be occasionally useful to ease prediction, such as against the core Toxapex + Landorus-T. Brick Break OHKOes Tyranitar one-on-one, preventing it from Pursuit trapping Victini, and 2HKOes bulkier Heatran variants that are only 3HKOed by Bolt Strike. Trick can cripple certain targets, but few Pokemon manage to wall Choice Band Victini anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Victini's good defensive typing to bring it in as often as possible, such as against Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Bulu or Power Whip from Ferrothorn, Giga Drain from Tangrowth, Leaf Blade and Sacred Sword from Kartana, and Fleur Cannon from Magearna. Play aggressively with Victini; good prediction skills are important to effectively wallbreak against common cores such as Landorus-T + Heatran. Be wary of using V-create against teams with Tyranitar or Weavile, as it leaves Victini very prone to being trapped by Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Koko is an excellent partner, using Volt Switch or U-turn to bring in Victini against bulky Grass-types to fire off strong V-creates. It also sets Electric Terrain, helping Victini muscle through Heatran. Defog support is paramount; Stealth Rock and Spikes wear down Victini incredibly quickly, preventing it from checking Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu effectively. Toxic Spikes are a nuisance for Victini, too, putting it on a timer. Good options for Defoggers include Zapdos and Mega Latios, the latter of which checks Heatran and baits in Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Scizor for Victini. Good Ash-Greninja checks are also important partners; while any of Victini's moves will OHKO it, Ash-Greninja is very effective at coming in after a KO or on a double switch and applying pressure with strong STAB attacks, so Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Magearna are good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebrate works in conjunction with Normalium Z to give Victini a +1 boost in all of its stats except for accuracy and evasion, turning it into a lethal sweeper under the right conditions and making it tough to revenge kill thanks to the defensive boosts. Blue Flare is incompatible with Celebrate, which makes Searing Shot the best Fire-type STAB move for this set; it does good damage after a boost, though it's weak unboosted. STAB Stored Power gets boosted to 120-Base Power after Z-Celebrate is used. It's used over other Psychic-type moves like Psychic and Psyshock because it allows Victini to OHKO Toxapex, thus avoiding Haze from it, as well as Alolan Marowak and Tapu Koko. Focus Blast hits Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively, which otherwise wall this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Z-Celebrate can only be used once, so ensure that Victini's checks and counters are worn down or eliminated before it attempts to sweep. Once Victini's set up, all it has to do is pick the right coverage move and start getting KOs. Victini can attempt to spread burns early-game in some matchups thanks to Searing Shot's high burn chance, though that's pretty much all it can do before setting up due to its poor coverage without Stored Power and lack of breaking power without a boost. If there's a Choice Scarf user on the opposing team like Garchomp or Keldeo, it should try to avoid taking too much damage while setting up in order to survive a Hydro Pump from Keldeo or an Earthquake from Garchomp. When facing stall, Victini can't do anything until Chansey is removed, so try to remove it either through trapping it or with a lure. While Unaware Clefable may seem like another roadblock for Victini, it can't wall Victini if it loses its Leftovers because Searing Shot's burns will slowly wear it down and put it in range of Victini's attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victini is weak to Stealth Rock and doesn't like being poisoned by Toxic Spikes, so Defog users like Mew and Mega Scizor make for good teammates for an easier time sweeping. Bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Gastrodon need to be weakened for Victini to clean up more effectively, so teammates like Ash-Greninja and Heatran that can pressure them early-game are appreciated. Ash-Greninja can also set up Spikes for it. Spikes users like Ferrothorn and Greninja help Victini muscle through bulkier foes such as Mew thanks to the additional chip damage. Victini can't threaten Chansey even after a boost due to its sky-high Special Defense, which gives it a bad stall matchup as long as Chansey is alive. Therefore, teammates that can lure in or pressure Chansey like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele can help Victini in this regard. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Weavile can remove Mega Latias for Victini, which can be a pain to break through. They can also force mind games against Chansey and weaken it for Victini. Smeargle is an interesting partner, as it sets up Sticky Web for Victini, thus making it impossible to revenge kill after the Z-Celebrate boost.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Serperior's ability to spam Leaf Storm and receive a Special Attack boost due to Contrary makes it a fantastic cleaner for offensively inclined teams that require its ability to handle various threats such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Tapu Koko. A good matchup against Sticky Web teams due to Contrary and the ability to overpower balance staples such as Clefable and Toxapex makes Serperior excellent against a good portion of the meta. Serperior is also able to take advantage of its switch-ins through the use of Substitute, allowing it to safely use Glare to cripple offensive threats, or Leech Seed to annoy passive Pokemon, limiting its defensive counterplay. Additionally, an amazing Speed tier lets Serperior outspeed many relevant offensive threats such as Mega Latios, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. However, its mediocre bulk means it's a Grass-type that is unable to check Ash-Greninja and switch into strong attacks, and a bad Special Attack stat also means Serperior struggles to deal damage right away.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dropping Hidden Power Fire and running a Glare + Leech Seed set is a possible option, although it leaves Serperior incapable of dealing with sturdy Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. It also comes with PP problems and reliance on Leech Seed for damage to save PP. Hidden Power Ground is an option to nail Heatran and other Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Victini, but is generally outclassed by Hidden Power Fire. A Defog + Synthesis set is able to remove hazards against the likes of Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex while keeping itself healthy. This set is unable to handle Heatran, however, which therefore is able to keep up its hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pressure Users</strong>: Moltres sports a positive type advantage versus Serperior and PP stalls its Leaf Storms. Zapdos is a shakier check, but Heat Wave does over half and Zapdos can spam Roost enough to use up all of Serperior's Leaf Storms, although Leech Seed variants can give it some trouble. Even Suicune behind a Substitute is able to PP stall Serperior by repeatedly using Protect and Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although all of OU's viable Fire-types are annoyed by Glare or Leech Seed, they're all able to handle Serperior decently well. Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and the rare Blacephalon can throw off super effective attacks, while Volcarona, Victini, and Mega Charizard X can use Serperior as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias can all pivot into Serperior and deal heavy damage with their respective STAB moves or Ice-type coverage while keeping themselves healthy with Roost, although none enjoy being hit by Glare. Kommo-o can make use of Clangorous Soulblaze to bypass Serperior's Substitute and dent it significantly.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth are all able to handle Serperior with their access to Sludge Bomb, as well as Clear Smog in Amoonguss's case. Mega Venusaur also has a neutrality to Hidden Power Fire due to Thick Fat, and Amoonguss and Tangrowth both utilize Regenerator, which makes them harder to chip down.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela and all Magearna sets have the potential to beat Serperior one-on-one, although Glare can help Serperior muscle past them in conjunction with boosted Hidden Power Fires.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Massive special bulk, access to reliable recovery, and Natural Cure healing off status makes Chansey somewhat of an obstacle, although it dislikes Leech Seed + Substitute and Knock Off in tandem with boosted Leaf Storms.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny can put a quick end to Serperior's sweep, although Glare can alleviate this problem. Serperior is also vulnerable to strong priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Weavile.</p>",

      "Taunt Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm allows Serperior to threaten common Stealth Rock setters offensively and to become a threat in its own right with repeated Special Attack boosts. Taunt has various uses on this set, most notably preventing entry hazards from being set by the likes of Chansey, Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Serperior can also use Taunt to prevent opposing hazard removal from Pokemon like Mega Latias. Taunt and Rocky Helmet allow Serperior to comfortably beat Chansey one-on-one by preventing both healing and status moves and discouraging attacking, respectively. Glare allows Serperior to punishes switch-ins like Magearna, Heatran and Tornadus-T, as well as stopping Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X from freely setting up on it. Defog allows Serperior to clear entry hazards, which it is able to do in the face of common entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>208 HP EVs in conjunction with 48 Defense EVs allow Serperior to survive rain-boosted Waterfall followed by Ice Punch from Jolly Mega Swampert. The rest is put into Speed in order to Speed tie with opposing Serperior.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior can use its solid Speed to force a Defog opportunity, even by sacrificing itself to the likes of Heatran if necessary. The threat of paralysis can often force out the likes of Mega Medicham and, at full health, faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja that can't OHKO Serperior, giving it opportunities to use Defog completely for free. Serperior should proactively use Taunt against Stealth Rock users like Ferrothorn and Heatran if entry hazards are cleared, even at the expense of being OHKOed, as its main objective is to enable its teammates that are weak to Stealth Rock at all costs. It can additionally sacrifice itself to get a crucial paralysis off against the likes of Volcarona and Mega Charizard X, also being able to limit them to one Speed boost with Taunt, ensuring that they are not able to negate the Speed drop. Although Serperior finds great success when used in an aggressive, sacrificial fashion, it has defensive utility in that it can switch into Mega Swampert and Kartana once and revenge kill Mega Medicham and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Serperior is exclusively used on hyper offensive teams, as they appreciate Serperior's useful utility movepool alongside its lack of passivity. Hyper offense threats that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, highly appreciate the extra security that Serperior's Defog brings. Another way Serperior can help the aforementioned Pokemon is its ability to threaten Water-types, such as Tapu Fini and Rotom-W, and Ground-types such as Garchomp. Serperior appreciates a dedicated lead such as Mega Diancie, Taunt Mew, or Excadrill starting the game off with entry hazards clear, as using Defog loses valuable momentum. Additionally, Serperior is a good facilitator for hazard setters such as Greninja, as it can prevent opposing Defog by using Taunt. Pairing Serperior with a Steel-type teammate such as Magearna is useful, as it can check Tornadus-T, which outspeeds and threatens to OHKO Serperior. Special attackers that struggle with Chansey, such as Volcarona and Shift Gear Magearna, appreciate Serperior's ability to chip away at Chansey and prevent its healing.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Fire allows Serperior to hit sturdy Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Substitute takes advantage of passive threats that rely on status or are too weak to break it in one turn, such as Toxapex and Rotom-W. Glare is used to cripple switch-ins such as Tornadus-T and Heatran and also to paralyze offensive threats such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Volcarona. Leech Seed can be used over Glare to allow Serperior to wear down and eventually beat its checks such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Assault Vest Magearna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP investment prevents Serperior's Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip, while the remaining EVs are placed into Speed and Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its mediocre bulk, avoid switching Serperior into strong attacks, as they will leave it heavily weakened. Thus, Serperior should attempt to safely get on the field against threats it has a good matchup against, such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Make sure to conserve Leaf Storm's limited PP. Attempt to use Glare against Serperior's checks as they switch in, as most of its targets such as Kyurem-B, Tornadus-T, and Heatran can either OHKO Serperior or deal heavy damage to it if they don't get fully paralyzed. Similarly to Glare, if using Leech Seed, predict switch-ins and use Leech Seed as they come in; afterwards, use Substitute repeatedly to let Leech Seed wear down the target while keeping Serperior safe from damage and status. Certain Pokemon that Serperior otherwise handles well can run status moves to cripple it, such as Clefable with Thunder Wave, so try to scout for those moves with Substitute and avoid status as a whole, since it prevents Serperior from properly wallbreaking. Serperior can be used early in the match to weaken defensive walls for teammates, but it can also be conserved to be an effective late-game cleaner, so make sure to use it wisely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offense staples such as Magearna and Mega Medicham are prime partners for Serperior, as they pressure Heatran and help Serperior break down teams, especially in tandem with Glare support. Entry hazard setters like Mew, Mega Diancie, and Excadrill are also good partners, as Serperior punishes Defog due to Contrary and can deal with opposing Rapid Spin Excadrill by using Substitute to avoid Toxic. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Assault Vest Magearna can get Serperior on the field safely against passive walls such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. All three examples also help against Ash-Greninja thanks to their Dark resistance. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Ash-Greninja all enjoy their checks getting paralyzed in order to break through them more easily. In addition, both Greninja formes can utilize Spikes and also keep up the pressure against Tornadus-T and Heatran. Heatran itself is an ideal partner, as it's able to draw in Water-types that Serperior can take advantage of such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini while being able to threaten Steel-types that Serperior struggles with like Celesteela and Magearna. Water-type teammates such as Toxapex and Gastrodon are appreciated, as they handle Ash-Greninja while easing the matchup versus certain Fire-types such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Glare is used to paralyze fast threats that could be an issue for slower builds and cripple switch-ins to Serperior like Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Tornadus-T to increase its chances of breaking past them later on. Defog can remove entry hazards in a pinch, allowing teammates at low HP to have one more go. Knock Off can help with removing items like Assault Vest and Leftovers, which could later help Serperior break past certain Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Magearna and Leftovers Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Removing Chansey's Eviolite can also be very helpful. Hidden Power Fire is an option over either Defog, if your team doesn't need the added entry hazard control, or Knock Off and complements Leaf Storm by weakening Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor that can take multiple Leaf Storms with relative ease while also being able to revenge kill Choice Scarf Kartana. Toxic is another option that helps with breaking Pokemon like Zapdos and Tangrowth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature lets Serperior outspeed most of the tier due to its great Speed tier, including opposing Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana that could otherwise revenge kill it and naturally faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior's main purpose is to clean late-game, when the opponent's Grass-type answers have been weakened and counters have been eliminated. Try to weaken opposing Pokemon that can take Leaf Storm with the rest of your team, and with Serperior's support options, as this increases Serperior's chances to clean. Until this has been accomplished, Serperior will mostly find itself using Glare and Knock Off to support its teammates before it's ready to clean. As Leaf Storm only has 8 PP, it is important to keep track of how many times you need to use it late-game. Pressure users like Zapdos and Kyurem quickly drain PP, so watch out for those. Glare can paralyze offensive switch-ins, easing up Serperior's job, while also providing speed control for slower Pokemon on your team that appreciate faster checks being crippled. Because of the great pressure Serperior often exerts on bulkier builds, it gets many opportunities to use Defog when forcing a switch. Using Knock Off to remove Leftovers on switch-ins like Heatran, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn, Eviolite from Chansey, or the occasional Assault Vest from Tangrowth or Magearna could also be very beneficial for Serperior's chances to clean up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Serperior is often found on more offensive builds, as the role compression it provides is often very useful. Slow wallbreakers like Mega Heracross and Mega Mawile appreciate the Glare support that Serperior provides, as it further helps them with punching holes and breaking through the opponent's team without having to worry about getting revenge killed by a faster check. Breaking past walls with these Pokemon also helps Serperior out late-game by increasing its chances to clean. Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran and Spikers like Ash-Greninja provide good teammates, as the chip damage from their entry hazards makes Leaf Storm harder to switch into. Magnezone's Magnet Pull is very helpful in trapping Steel-types, which can often provide trouble for Serperior. Heatran is a great partner, as it beats Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn and Fire-types like certain variants of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, which both resist Leaf Storm and can often easily stop Serperior's attempts at cleaning if at high enough HP. Ash-Greninja is another great partner, as it can offensively pressure Steel- and Fire-types as well, which helps out Serperior a lot. Mega Alakazam can help with weakening Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran for Serperior, and in return it appreciates the Knock Off support Serperior provides.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is an incredibly versatile Pokemon, with a typing laden with useful resistances and immunities to pivot around and check various Electric- and Fairy-types, great Attack stat and STAB combination to hit large swaths of the tier and consistently clean up games, and a utility movepool that allows it to play both sides of the entry hazard game. It works great with fabled partner Tyranitar or other alternative sand setters like Hippowdon, acting as the star player of teams within the consistent sand archetype. It makes great use of Z-Moves to overcome would-be checks like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, of course depending on the choice of Z-Crystal. Excadrill is far from limited to just sand teams, as it can put in a good shift as a specially defensive pivot on bulkier teams and even a dedicated lead, both making use of Excadrill's coveted combination of Stealth Rock + Rapid Spin and helpful ability in Mold Breaker. However, Excadrill's offensive presence can often be two-dimensional, with Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Zapdos acting as consistent annoyances to it outside of its less consistent lure Z-Moves. Excadrill has plenty to worry about in terms of faster attackers, as it has overall unimpressive bulk, and sand can't always be up to patch its middling Speed. Additionally, Excadrill struggles in longer games against opposing hazard setters due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can be used on Mold Breaker sets to give Excadrill better prowess as a revenge killer for frail attackers like Greninja and Mega Medicham. Leftovers Sand Rush variants of Excadrill can drop Swords Dance for Stealth Rock on bulkier teams. Giga Impact can be used alongside Normalium Z to give Excadrill a weapon against Rotom-W while still hitting the same targets as Rock Slide, though Giga Impact is a very inconsistent move outside of its Z-Move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela are the top of the pile when it comes to Excadrill answers, shrugging off Excadrill's Steel- and Normal-type attacks and being fine for the most apart against its Rock-type attacks. Rotom-W is gifted with an ideal typing to handle Excadrill, with a 4x resistance to Steel and great physical bulk to boot, though Excadrill can adapt with Normalium Z + Giga Impact to lure it. Heat Wave Zapdos provides a solid answer to the most common variants of Excadrill, punishing it for even daring to use Iron Head or Rapid Spin, though it falls victim to Rock Slide and Breakneck Blitz. Pelipper and Mega Charizard Y handle Iron Head and Earthquake well and clear Excadrill's sand, with Mega Charizard Y then outspeeding it and threatening it with an OHKO. However, Excadrill can deal with Mega Charizard Y and Pelipper with the same tech mentioned previously, and Mega Charizard Y needs to already be Mega Evolved before initially switching into Excadrill in order to outspeed it, as Sand Rush will still be active until the end of the turn if the weather is changed mid-turn by Charizard gaining Drought.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Slowbro can survive any hit from +2 Excadrill and threaten it back with Scald; Mega Slowbro is even more consistent at this task with its absurd bulk and better Special Attack. Buzzwole can near enough offer the same promise, though against Adamant Steelium Z sets, it has to rely on being at full health or having Excadrill waste its Z-Move prior to coming in.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Excadrill commonly runs a Z-Crystal, removing any form of healing it may have and dooming it in longer games where it has to act as a spinner. Spikes are the most horrible entry hazard to face by far, digging into Excadrill dramatically more than Stealth Rock's paltry 3.25%. No matter what hazard is on the field, spinning can always be a pain, especially against contact punishers like Rocky Helmet Zapdos and Landorus-T and Iron Barbs Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Despite the sky-high number Excadrill's Speed hits in sand, Unburden Hawlucha and Trace Mega Alakazam can one-up it and threaten to OHKO Excadrill with High Jump Kick and Focus Blast, respectively. Mega Charizard Y throws out Excadrill's sand to be able to outspeed it in sun; however, the Speed change does not happen on the same turn, meaning that if Charizard Mega Evolves in front of Excadrill in sand, Excadrill will still attack first on that turn. Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny prey on Excadrill outside of sand and can waste crucial sand turns with Fake Out. Ash-Greninja can threaten Excadrill both inside and outside of sand with Water Shuriken and Hydro Pump, though it must be said that, before Battle Bond is activated, Water Shuriken is severely inconsistent at OHKOing Excadrill and should be used to finish it off after chip damage instead.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sand Rush": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Swords Dance, Excadrill can take full advantage of its typing and reasonable bulk to set itself up to punch through walls. With the combination of Swords Dance and Steelium Z, Excadrill can bust through the likes of Landorus-T and Gliscor with +1 and +2 Corkscrew Crash, respectively. Outside of its usage as a strong Z-Move, Iron Head is a great complement to Earthquake that hits Ground-immune foes like Mega Latias and Tornadus-T and Grass-types like Serperior and Tapu Bulu. Earthquake is Excadrill's stronger STAB option, an obvious inclusion to hit Steel-types and other neutral targets. Rapid Spin gives Excadrill some valuable role compression to open up more team options due to the reduced need for other entry hazard removal. Rock Slide gives Excadrill a way to threaten Flying-types that otherwise wall it, like Zapdos, pre-Mega Charizard and Mega Charizard Y, Pelipper, and Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Steelium Z is Excadrill's most consistent wallbreaking tool, patching up Iron Head's lower power to punch through temporary checks like Landorus-T. Leftovers is the best non-Z-Crystal option for Excadrill, giving it better longevity and staying power and making it a more respectable spinner. An Adamant nature is preferred for the power boost, letting Excadrill OHKO Hippowdon with +2 Corkscrew Crash, though Jolly can also be used to outspeed the likes of Kommo-o, base 95 Speed Pokemon with a neutral nature like Modest Tapu Lele, and common variants of Gliscor as well as base 100 Speed Pokemon with a neutral nature like Mega Medicham and Volcarona outside of sand while at worst Speed tying with opposing Excadrill. Rockium Z is a niche option for a Z-Crystal, with its niche over Normalium Z being that Continental Crush gives Excadrill an option against Celesteela and hits ideal targets like Zapdos and Gyarados hard even before setting up. Additionally, it is used with Rock Slide, which is a better move than Giga Impact outside of their Z-Move uses.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Excadrill has plenty of entry points during a game, mostly through Tapu Koko and Magearna, which Excadrill can conveniently block Volt Switches from, as well as the likes of Mega Latias, Clefable, and Cresselia that can't hit Excadrill very hard. When it's holding a Z-Crystal over Leftovers, however, this defensive usage is limited to fewer occasions, so aim to have your sand up when you get Excadrill in, so you can make the most of the limited opportunity by setting up and breaking through the opposing team. Having Stealth Rock on the field early helps with this, digging into common Flying-type answers like Zapdos while also incrementally chipping Rotom-W alongside sand damage. In matchups where Excadrill is walled, you should not bother setting up, though Excadrill can still be plenty helpful by chasing out threats like Calm Mind Magearna and by spinning away entry hazards, especially in the face of setters like Chansey, Clefable, and Skarmory once it loses its Rocky Helmet. It shines in late-game situations where you can afford to sacrifice your sand setter to give Excadrill the maximum amount of turns to clean up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sand Rush Excadrill is logically only used on sand teams, fitting snugly into both the offensive and defensive core and making use of Sand Rush to become an elite revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Mega Tyranitar is by and large the most common sand-setting teammate, working well with Excadrill offensively by pressuring Flying-types via either trapping them with Pursuit or just obliterating them with Stone Edge if they get overconfident. It additionally makes great use of its Special Defense boost from sand to check Heatran and find opportunities to set Stealth Rock to support Excadrill. Hippowdon is the other option; what it lacks in offensive presence, it aims to make up for by being better at sticking around via Slack Off, making it a much better Stealth Rock setter and better at setting sand, even having the option to run Smooth Rock, though the defensive overlap and relative passivity does not go unnoticed. Toxapex fits snugly onto sand teams because of its crucial resistance to Water and its incredible longevity. On top of this, it absorbs Toxic Spikes, giving relief to Excadrill on teams where it is relied upon as the entry hazard setter, and can also carry Toxic Spikes itself to ease the matchup against Mega Medicham and rain teams. Celesteela is a very solid answer to both Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele as well as improving the matchup against offense teams with its Leech Seed + Protect shenanigans. Zapdos answers Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Hawlucha handily, threatening Static paralysis along the way. Kartana fits well onto sand teams, having respectable Speed that gives the team an option to revenge kill the likes of Mega Medicham and Garchomp outside of sand. Choice Band is the best for immediate power and therefore revenge killing, though Swords Dance can be useful to lure Zapdos and Skarmory with Normalium Z and Fightinium Z, respectively, with both variants doing the job of threatening out Water-types. Mega Garchomp can be used on teams featuring Hippowdon or non-Mega Tyranitar as the sand setter, with it benefitting greatly from Sand Force to wallbreak; mixed sets can prey on annoyances like Rotom-W and Skarmory with its coverage, and Swords Dance sets work away at shared checks with Excadrill. For ​non-Z-Move variants of Excadrill, offensive Z-Move variants of Landorus-T and Garchomp can make for interesting teammates, with Rockium Z variants of both being able to puncture Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Celesteela. Additionally, they provide solid defensive utility, with Landorus-T bringing an immunity to Ground and Garchomp being able to help against Heatran and Mega Charizard Y with its resistance to Fire. Mega Latias appreciates Excadrill's proficiency at handling Fairy-types like Magearna and Tapu Koko; in return, Mega Latias provides a solid answer to threats like Mega Charizard Y and Landorus-T, can take chunks out of the likes of Celesteela and Zapdos with Thunder and Ice Beam, and act as a secondary wincon with Calm Mind. Tornadus-T can remove important items like Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Zapdos and Leftovers from Celesteela while also providing a check to Mega Medicham. Serperior feasts on Rotom-W and can work together with Excadrill against shared checks like Celesteela and Zapdos, even having the niche option of Knock Off to improve its competency at this role further.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With significant investment into its bulk and Leftovers, Excadrill really comes into its own as a Stealth Rock setter, finding opportunities to block Volt Switch from the likes of Magearna and Tapu Koko and taking full advantage with Stealth Rock. On teams that can already fit in Stealth Rock handily, Excadrill can use Iron Head to hit Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable and Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Gliscor. Earthquake slams the Electric-types and Steel-types like Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Jirachi that Excadrill likes to aggressively come into and also pressures entry hazard setters like Heatran and Toxapex. Toxic is great for catching irritating Defoggers like Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T and overall reduces Excadrill's passivity, as it can catch the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Serperior as they switch in. Rapid Spin is one of the main draws of Excadrill as a defensive piece, clearing opposing hazards while maintaining its team's own. Excadrill has the staying power to invalidate passive hazard setters like Clefable, lead Diancie, and Skarmory without Rocky Helmet.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 Speed EVs put Excadrill ahead of Modest Heatran, with the rest going into bulk to help Excadrill last against repeated resisted hits like Magearna's Fleur Cannon. Leftovers is crucial for this variant to function, improving Excadrill's longevity and letting it slowly heal off entry hazard damage and weak attacks while it stays on the field.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main draw of defensive Excadrill is its obvious good matchup against Volt Switch users like Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Koko, as it makes good use of its resistance to Fairy and neutrality to Ice to ensure that it can always comfortably come in. Part of Excadrill's intended role in longer games is to stick around, so you need to both watch for any sort of negation of Leftovers, either through burn or item removal, and be mindful of how much you send it in, especially if you're not pairing it with a Wish passer. Before Excadrill can comfortably spin away entry hazards, a teammate must remove Rocky Helmet from the likes of Landorus-T and Skarmory first with Knock Off. Excadrill has far from unlimited staying power, so your priority will be to cut the longevity of opposing hazard setters even shorter with status and chip damage; for example, catching opposing Landorus-T with Toxic early- or mid-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Excadrill is suited for teams ranging from bulky offense to semi-stall with bulky teammates that can somewhat take the burden off of Excadrill defensively somewhat so it can focus on providing utility and blocking Volt Switch. Wish users like Chansey and Clefable enable less careful play with Excadrill, as it can negate accrued chip damage on Excadrill from repeated hits. Although Excadrill does have the Steel typing, it's still horrible at taking on Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam, so pairing it with an answer to them like Magearna or Cresselia is quite important. Toxapex reduces the burden on Excadrill to come in and spin, since it absorbs Toxic Spikes, and it provides a good defensive answer to Fire-types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. In return, Excadrill can quieten Volt Switch users to help Toxapex. Spikes are logical to pair with Excadrill, considering its method of entry hazard removal allows you to keep your hard-fought layers, so Skarmory makes for a good teammate; however, this does raise the issue of having two Steel-types on your team with neither of them solidly checking Tapu Lele or Mega Alakazam. Knock Off users like Tornadus-T and Clefable can remove opposing Rocky Helmets to aid Excadrill in spinning away hazards. Excadrill invites in Gliscor completely for free, so it must be paired with a counter to it, such as Ice Beam Mega Latias or Mega Slowbro. Tapu Fini appreciates Excadrill freeing up a moveslot for it by carrying hazard removal so that it can run other options like Calm Mind or Whirlpool; in return, it can provide a stop to dangerous Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Mega Gyarados and help against Mega Swampert. Both Mega Charizard formes can make for good teammates, as Mega Charizard X can forcefully drag down opposing Landorus-T, while Mega Charizard Y benefits from Excadrill's Volt Switch blocking and improves the team's matchup against opposing rain and offense teams.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Excadrill is a great dedicated lead thanks to Mold Breaker, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock without being blocked by Magic Bounce. Earthquake is important for tearing through common targets like Magearna, Toxapex, Heatran, and other Excadrill, and Mold Breaker allows it to threaten Rotom-W for super effective damage. Rock Tomb messes with Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Zapdos and is a good anti-setup tool against Dragon Dance users like Mega Charizard X and Gyarados. It also drops Serperior's Speed stat thanks to Mold Breaker bypassing Contrary. If Excadrill's teammates have these targets accounted for, it can use Toxic to cripple opposing leads, bypassing Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Finally, Rapid Spin lets Excadrill provide hazard removal support to its teammates; it can also potentially spam Rapid Spin against opposing entry hazard leads until it is KOed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to bypass Magic Bounce and set up Stealth Rock in the face of Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. A Jolly nature lets Excadrill Speed tie with other maximum Speed Excadrill and outspeed Timid Heatran. A Focus Sash is mandatory so that Excadrill can survive a strong move and set up Stealth Rock reliably. Alternatively, Excadrill can run an EV spread of 124 Atk / 132 SpD / 252 Spe to survive 4 hits from Choice Specs Greninja's Water Shuriken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Focus on setting up Stealth Rock immediately and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, even at the cost of being KOed. Fast Defog users like Tornadus-T and Serperior should be met with Rock Tomb immediately. Avoid leading with Excadrill if the opponent has a Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Greninja, or Garchomp on their side of the field, as they are incredibly hostile lead matchups for Focus Sash Excadrill. The former two can eliminate it with the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick; Greninja can potentially KO it with Water Shuriken thanks to being a multi-hit move; and Garchomp can threaten Excadrill with Earthquake, set up Stealth Rock, and deny its attempts to remove entry hazards thanks to Rough Skin. Excadrill should also tread carefully against the likes of Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Rocky Helmet users like Tornadus-T and Skarmory, as they can punish Excadrill with chip damage or paralysis in the case of Static Zapdos if it tries to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. If Excadrill is at low enough health and is KOed by the chip damage from Ferrothorn, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet, Rapid Spin will fail to remove entry hazards. Thanks to its Electric immunity, Excadrill checks enemy Tapu Koko and should be kept healthy to handle it later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Excadrill set is best suited for hyper offense teams, as they appreciate it starting the game off well with Stealth Rock and preventing opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Taunt Serperior is a fantastic teammate, as it provides a backup hazard removal option with Defog, enabling hazard-weak hyper offense teammates like Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Gyarados. Serperior also has the benefit of checking enemy Garchomp attempting to counter lead Excadrill. Other hyper offense teammates like Dragonite, Magearna, and Mega Gyarados are also good fits, as they can find opportunities to set up against Pokemon that Excadrill has chipped with Rock Tomb. The former also enjoys having entry hazards kept off the field, making it easier to preserve Multiscale and allowing more setup opportunities. Since Excadrill fills the roles of both a dedicated lead and a hazard remover, it is also a good fit on dual screens archetypes, as it opens up a team slot for Tapu Koko to set Reflect and Light Screen, providing much easier setup opportunities for Mega Gyarados, Hawlucha, and Shift Gear Magearna. Cresselia provides a safe switch-in against Mega Lopunny, a horrible lead matchup for Excadrill, and provides Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance support to cripple faster threats like Mega Alakazam and restore a teammate back to full health, respectively. Kommo-o is another good partner that has the benefit of using its typing to check Ash-Greninja, which usually gives hyper offense teams major trouble. Tapu Lele is also a good teammate because it checks Fighting-types like Kommo-o and provides Psychic Terrain to deny priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny.</p>"

However, Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile hit much harder thanks to Huge Power and higher-Base Power moves, making them significantly harder to wall. Mega Medicham also possesses a higher base Speed to make up for its lackluster defensive typing, while Mega Mawile possesses a good defensive typing to make up for its low Speed.</p>"}},

Water / Ground typing with the ability Water Absorb allows Seismitoad to completely wall the common Rotom-W, as well as being a superb check to other dangerous Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, Magnezone, and Mega Manectric. Seismitoad can also be a great switch-in to the threatening Magma Storm Heatran, which usually threatens bulkier teams considerably. Unfortunately, the major downside to Seismitoad is its lack of reliable recovery, which, in addition to its average bulk, leaves it vulnerable to being chipped down by entry hazards and attacks throughout a game. Seismitoad can also be easily threatened out by the plethora of strong offensive Grass-type Pokemon commonly seen in the tier, such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior, as well as Grass-type coverage. Lastly, Seismitoad also faces stiff competition from Gastrodon, which possesses the same defensive utility, superior bulk, and reliable recovery in the form of Recover.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stomping Tantrum can be used when Seismitoad is paired with Tapu Bulu to bypass the weakening of Earthquake in Grassy Terrain. Sets using Earth Power should always run a Calm nature to maximize its damage output. An Infestation trapping set is also possible, using an EV spread of 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe with an Adamant nature and holding Groundium Z, to trap and KO Pokemon such as Toxapex.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Seismitoad is quite easily threatened out by the common Grass type Pokemon in the tier, such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Ferrothorn, only being able to fish for a Scald burn as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type coverage</strong>: Grass-type moves like Bloom Doom from Heatran and Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y can promptly remove Seismitoad, and more uncommon moves like Giga Drain from Volcarona, Energy Ball from Magearna and Mega Alakazam, and Grass Knot from Tapu Koko can surprise Seismitoad with massive damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Seismitoad lacks reliable recovery and has to rely on Leftovers, unless it's running Rest. This means that entry hazards, Leech Seed, and especially Knock Off can greatly harm Seismitoad's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers such as Mega Medicham and Kyurem-B threaten to OHKO Seismitoad if they are able to get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that can shrug off Seismitoad's moves such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind Reuniclus and Calm Mind Clefable can take advantage of it.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Since Seismitoad walls Rotom-W and various other common Volt Switch users, it gets many free opportunities to set up Stealth Rock during a game. Scald hits common Pokemon such as Landorus-T super effectively and can heavily punish switches to physical attackers like Kartana and Tapu Bulu with a burn. Earthquake hits common defensive Pokemon super effectively, importantly being able to OHKO Heatran and 2HKO Assault Vest Magearna and specially defensive Toxapex. Knock Off can also be used in place of Earthquake to remove items such as Leftovers from common switch-ins such as Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Serperior, as well as Eviolite from Chansey. Toxic threatens Pokemon that do not fear Seismitoad's STAB attacks, such as Rotom-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias. Refresh can also be used, as it allows Seismitoad to not fear Will-O-Wisp or Toxic from Pokemon it is tasked with dealing with, such as Rotom-W. Rest can be used on bulkier teams to allow Seismitoad to heal itself, although this requires a lot of team support such as Heal Bell and Wish; therefore, Refresh is much easier to fit onto Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 Speed EVs allow Seismitoad to outrun uninvested Mega Scizor and threaten it with a Scald burn. 244 HP EVs and 36 Defense EVs allow Seismitoad to avoid the OHKO from a Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile. Lastly, the rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to help Seismitoad better take on special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Magearna. If Earthquake is not being used, you should use a Calm nature instead to maximize the amount of damage Scald does. It is also possible to use an alternate physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe with an Impish nature, which allows Seismitoad to better take on physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Tyranitar, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Mawile. However, the specially defensive set is more commonly useful due to the prevalence of Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seismitoad should be sent out against Pokemon that it can easily wall, such as Rotom-W, allowing it to freely set up Stealth Rock or potentially Scald burn an incoming switch-in. Seismitoad is also adept at coming in on predicted Electric-type moves, specifically Volt Switch from the likes of Magearna and Tapu Koko, allowing it to threaten them out with Earthquake. Also, make sure to take full advantage of Water Absorb to get free recovery from a Choice-locked Greninja using Hydro Pump or a Toxapex using Scald. While Heatran is a Pokemon that Seismitoad can switch in on and threaten, you should also be wary of Heatran's Grassium Z variant, which threatens to OHKO Seismitoad. You should make sure to keep multiple layers of Spikes off the field when using Seismitoad, as it isn't able to reliably heal off this damage. It also allows your opponent to bait your Seismitoad in with their Electric-types, causing it to take Spikes damage and get worn down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad fits on a plethora of team styles, but it's especially good on teams ranging from semi-stall to bulky offense. You should always pair Seismitoad with a Grass-type check, such as Magearna, Heatran, or Celesteela. Heatran is especially noteworthy because of its ability to handle the dangerous Serperior and because Heatran greatly appreciates both Seismitoad's immunity to Water-type attacks and not needing to run Stealth Rock itself, freeing up a moveslot for Protect or Taunt. It is also a good idea to run both a Dark-type answer such as Clefable or Magearna and a Fairy-type check such as Jirachi or Heatran for Greninja's Dark Pulse and Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam, as Seismitoad cannot switch into these moves repeatedly. Entry hazards limit the number of times Seismitoad can switch in, so pairing it with hazard removal such as Tornadus-T is highly beneficial. Wish support can be useful when using Seismitoad, as it acts as an extra safety net when Seismitoad's HP runs low, so pairing it with a Wish passer such as Jirachi or Clefable is beneficial. If your Seismitoad isn't running Refresh, it is a good idea to bring cleric support from the likes of Clefable and Chansey, preventing your Seismitoad from being worn down by status and waking it up if it opts to use Rest.</p>"

  "Scolipede": {
    "overview": "<p>Scolipede can fulfill the role of a cleaner and wallbreaker in one slot due to its access to Speed Boost and Swords Dance to threaten offensive and defensive teams. Functioning in these roles is enabled by decent Attack, good Speed, and a sufficient movepool, so Scolipede can utilize strong attacks and coverage moves such as Megahorn, Earthquake, and Aqua Tail. However, Scolipede's below average defenses mean Scolipede will require entry hazard removal to set up properly. Even if Scolipede manages to set up, it will often be in range of priority moves from Ash-Greninja, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, for example, meaning its capabilities cannot be fully unleashed in practice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Savage Spin-Out is extremely powerful after a Swords Dance boost, OHKOing Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and even some resistant to the move such as Keldeo after Stealth Rock. However, the prevalence of Landorus-T and Celesteela make Hydro Vortex superior. Scolipede can be used as a suicide lead, stacking Spikes and Toxic Spikes and taking a Pokemon down with it using Endeavor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Getting off a big hit on Scolipede as it tries to set up and revenge killing it with priority is the most efficient way to handle Scolipede. Ash-Greninja, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile are examples of strong priority users.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock reduces Scolipede's setup opportunities because of its poor bulk. Stealth Rock also places Scolipede in range of strong priority attacks from Ash-Greninja and Mega Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Playing Around Hydro Vortex</strong>: Scolipede may be able to set up on Pokemon such as defensive Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, Tapu Fini, and bulky Grass-types when Stealth Rock is up. If this happens, baiting Hydro Vortex allows Pokemon such as Zapdos to reliably defeat Scolipede.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Alomomola, and Skarmory can take on and defeat Scolipede one-on-one if they are not sufficiently weakened. Physically defensive Mantine and Clefable can also take on Scolipede lacking Poison Jab and then proceed to cripple it or knock it out.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Swords Dance, Scolipede is able to punch holes into defensive teams or sweep. Megahorn is Scolipede's strongest attack; at +2, it is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Bulu. Aqua Tail pairs well with Megahorn, netting massive damage against Celesteela, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor when powered up by Waterium Z. Hydro Vortex, after Scolipede uses Swords Dance, also OHKOes defensive Landorus-T, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier. Earthquake rounds off Scolipede's coverage, defeating Heatran, Mega Mawile, and, more importantly, Toxapex. Spikes can be used in this slot as well to pressure switch-ins, but it is best used when Scolipede is on hyper offense teams because it will usually want to maximize its coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z grants Scolipede a 175-Base Power Hydro Vortex so Scolipede can break defensive Landorus-T and take out a weakened Mega Scizor. Life Orb seems like an appealing option, but the recoil and lack of power makes it inferior. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are required for Scolipede to outpace the faster Choice Scarf users in the tier such as Keldeo and Latios after a Speed Boost. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack so Scolipede can hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scolipede's typing allows it to get a free Swords Dance against Tapu Fini and most Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, so utilize these opportunities right away. Otherwise, Scolipede will be forced to take damage in order to set up. If this is the case, prioritize removing entry hazards so Scolipede can set up in front of Mega Scizor and defensive Landorus-T and stay out of the KO range of most priority.</p> <p>If Scolipede cannot sweep, recklessly use Swords Dance and do massive damage to a check or counter shared by a teammate with a boosted Hydro Vortex. If Spikes is used on Scolipede, set up hazards and play aggressively to weaken defensive hazard removers such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor with Hydro Vortex.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock will cause Scolipede issues, so an entry hazard remover is recommended. Mew, Mega Scizor, Latios, and Tapu Fini are solid teammates, especially since Scolipede can preserve their health by absorbing Toxic Spikes. Scolipede will have limited setup opportunities outside of against bulky Grass-types and the aforementioned Tapu Fini, so VoltTurn users that can get Scolipede free switches on these Pokemon are nice. Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Manectric are prime teammates.</p> <p>Scolipede can support other physical sweepers because it breaks or wears down a lot of common answers to physical attackers such as Landorus-T. Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X are solid teammates because of this. Greninja, while a special attacker, is a fine team option, as Scolipede forces in and wears down Celesteela and Ferrothorn, common checks to Ash-Greninja, and gives Protean Greninja the option to forego Hidden Power Fire. Finally, Scolipede can be used on rain teams, as the rain boost to Hydro Vortex and +2 Attack creates a lot of OHKOes on Pokemon such as Zapdos, Celesteela, and Clefable.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is a unique Calm Mind user in the OU metagame that makes use of its solid typing, bulk, and access to Magic Guard and Recover to quickly overwhelm passive teams that rely on more passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Celesteela, and Tangrowth. Thanks to these traits, Reuniclus is also a really effective stall and balance breaker. In addition to this, if opted for, it can outlast Dark-types like Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar with the combination of Acid Armor and Toxic Spikes or Spikes support, making it a versatile threat. Reuniclus also finds itself coming out on top in wars against Calm Mind users like Clefable and Magearna thanks to its access to Psyshock. While Reuniclus's bulk is solid, Reuniclus is very slow and will often have to take a hit before it can move, which can force it into rather awkward situations when attempting to set up. If Reuniclus opts to run Acid Armor, it will find itself overly reliant on Toxic Spikes and Spikes support, meaning that it has to be played very patiently before it can pull off a sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reuniclus can run a spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 80 SpD / 44 Spe with a Bold nature and Leftovers to avoid being 2HKOed by Moonblast and Thunderbolt from Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko prior to set up, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Hoopa-U put heavy pressure on Reuniclus, and it usually has to rely on Toxic Spikes or PP stalling them to sweep. Mega Sableye walls Reuniclus's usual set and can utilize Imprison to prevent Reuniclus from using Recover, and it only really has to watch out for variants with Energy Ball or Signal Beam. Mega Gyarados is one of the best counters to Reuniclus, as its base forme is immune to Toxic Spikes, and it sets up on Reuniclus once it's Mega Evolved. Hydreigon also deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate and is immune to Reuniclus's Psychic-type attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Blacephalon, Gengar, and Alolan Marowak can offensively check Reuniclus, but they are susceptible to repeated attacks from Reuniclus and entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick</strong>: Taunt users such as Heatran, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini prevent Reuniclus from using any of its status moves and can thus prevent it from sweeping. Trick users such as Victini and Hoopa-U can cripple Reuniclus.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile and Kartana can overwhelm Reuniclus before it sets up.</p>",

      "2 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock allows Reuniclus to win Calm Mind wars against Mega Alakazam and Clefable and lets it get past Chansey. Focus Blast allows Reuniclus to KO Dark-types like Greninja and Tyranitar as well as Steel-types such as Heatran. It also makes Reuniclus more capable of handling stall teams utilizing Mega Aggron than it would be without it. Alternatively, Energy Ball gives Reuniclus the ability to hit the aforementioned Dark-types more accurately as well as Water-types like Mega Swampert. It also lets Reuniclus hit Mega Sableye, Pyukumuku, and Quagsire, which makes it possible to break through stall teams utilizing Mega Sableye. Signal Beam hits Dark- and Psychic-types like Hoopa-U, Mega Alakazam, and opposing Reuniclus. However, because of the move’s lower Base Power, Reuniclus struggles more against bulky Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Reuniclus to outspeed Toxapex and set up against it before it uses Haze. Rocky Helmet lets Reuniclus switch into and wear down Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny. Psychium Z gives Reuniclus a way to break past or wear down Pokemon that can ordinarily take a boosted Psyshock and potentially beat Reuniclus one-on-one like Mega Scizor, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini if Reuniclus isn't running Energy Ball, and Kartana if Reuniclus is using Energy Ball. Fightinium Z with Focus Blast lets Reuniclus overcome bulky Steel- and Dark-types like Heatran, Hydreigon, both Greninja formes, and both Tyranitar formes. It's also worth noting that Focus Blast boosted by Fightinium Z never misses, making it reliable in scenarios where you can't afford to miss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Reuniclus should attempt to stay healthy to check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Protean Greninja. Be careful about what to set up on early-game, as Reuniclus will often be forced out, and the opposing team will still be healthy enough to check it. Try to set up entry hazards early-game to use Reuniclus to force in checks like Greninja, Tyranitar, and Heatran that are easily worn down to facilitate a late-game sweep. If Reuniclus is running Focus Blast, take advantage of the fact that it can often lure in Dark-types that think they're safe hard switching in and try to catch them on the switch. However, be sure to sufficiently wear down Tyranitar into range of Focus Blast. Reuniclus should attempt to set up on Pokemon that can’t severely threaten it like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Chansey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes helps wear down the opposing team, which makes it easier for Reuniclus to facilitate a late-game sweep. Ferrothorn and both Greninja formes are good options for this. Pursuit support is useful in removing opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latias, and Blacephalon for Reuniclus. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile are good partners for this. Despite Reuniclus having coverage for Dark-types like the Greninja and Tyranitar formes, they are still an issue in a one-on-one situation, so checks for Dark-types like Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, and Toxapex are needed. Magnezone works well with Reuniclus by threatening and removing Mega Scizor, which is quite troublesome for Reuniclus otherwise.</p>"

Leftovers gives Reuniclus a form of passive recovery. Rocky Helmet is another option that notably allows Reuniclus to wear down Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar by itself. Magic Guard is the preferred ability to ignore Toxic poison and similar status ailments, which sets it apart from other sweepers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Reuniclus to check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Protean Greninja early-game. Switch Reuniclus into Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and other passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tangrowth to use them as setup bait. Use Recover liberally to stay healthy throughout the match to stay out of range from critical hits and to consistently check Fighting-types. If Toxic Spikes is up on the opposing side of the field, use Reuniclus to force in a Dark-type such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, or Tyranitar. In a situation where Weavile or Tyranitar is expected to switch in, Reuniclus should use Acid Armor so that it can set up safely after. If Toxic Spikes isn't up on the field, Reuniclus should either double switch out to a teammate that can take on these respective Dark-types or use Acid Armor to safely escape Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes or Spikes is essential whenever using Reuniclus. Toxapex is a very notable Toxic Spikes setter, as it fits on most bulky builds very well. Greninja can be used too. Toxapex also checks Ash-Greninja, which forces out Reuniclus, even after the use of Calm Mind. Reuniclus appreciates the presence of Spikes on the opposing field because it wears down usual switch-ins. Ferrothorn usually fits better on defensive teams and checks Ash-Greninja as well. Tyranitar and Weavile can Pursuit trap bulky Psychic-types that can usually trouble Reuniclus, such as Mega Latias.</p>"

Amoonguss's excellent defensive ability in Regenerator only further bolsters Amoonguss's defensive prowess, as it keeps Amoonguss from having to waste time recovering, meaning it doesn't lose momentum as easily and can be a good pick on more offensively oriented teams despite not having a strong offensive presence. Unfortunately, Amoonguss's defensive typing also gives it some nasty weaknesses to common offensive types in Flying, Ice, Fire, and Psychic, making it vulnerable to threats like Tornadus-T, Weavile, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele, and its low Speed and attacking stats can make it somewhat passive, giving setup opportunities or free switches to a vast number of offensive Pokemon once it has used Spore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used on a more physically defensive set to nail the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which could otherwise use Amoonguss as setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: The combination of super effective STAB moves and a resistance to Grass makes Tornadus-T, Celesteela, and Mega Pinsir hard for Amoonguss to handle, but they must fear Spore.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: The likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Hoopa-U are able to bust through Amoonguss with their Psychic-type STAB moves, although Tapu Lele must be wary of being hit hard by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran are just a few Fire-types that are able to beat Amoonguss with their Fire-type STAB moves, while Amoonguss can do little to retaliate outside of Spore and Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem-B, Weavile, and the rare Mamoswine hit Amoonguss hard with their Ice-type STAB moves; however, Mamoswine can't switch directly into a Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Various Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss's utility and STAB moves tend to bait in a variety of bulky Pokemon that can switch freely and proceed to either set up on Amoonguss or outlast it 1v1. This includes Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur. Others such as Clefable, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Celesteela can all switch in and eventually outlast Amoonguss if the right conditions are met. For example, Clefable needs Flamethrower and Amoonguss needs to have put something to sleep with Spore prior to Clefable switching in, Skarmory, Toxapex, and Celesteela all switch into Amoonguss easily after it has put something to sleep too.</p>",

      "Black Sludge": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore grants Amoonguss the ability to put threatening Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Mawile, Mega Alakazam, and Heatran to sleep and somewhat makes up for Amoonguss's lack of offensive presence by allowing it to force out Pokemon with the threat of getting put to sleep. Hidden Power Fire allows Amoonguss to check Kartana while also preventing it from being setup fodder for Mega Mawile and Shift Gear Magearna as well as Spikes fodder for Ferrothorn. Sludge Bomb's notable poison chance and damage output makes it the preferred option over Clear Smog, but Clear Smog can still be chosen to neutralize boosting threats such as Clefable and Serperior. Stun Spore can be run instead of Sludge Bomb to still cripple threats that think they're safe after Amoonguss has put a Pokemon to sleep. It should be noted that Giga Drain can be foregone in favor of Stun Spore if Amoonguss's team already has another reliable way of beating Ash-Greninja.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to survive a +2 Smart Strike from Kartana. The given Special Defense investment along with a Calm nature allows Amoonguss to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulse after Black Sludge recovery and lets Amoonguss check Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Koko more reliably. On stall teams, a more physically defensive spread can be run to check threatening stallbreakers such as Mega Mawile and Choice Band Tapu Bulu more reliably. Rocky Helmet should be used with this spread to wear these Pokemon down more steadily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Amoonguss should be brought in safely against Pokemon that it can check, such as Ash-Greninja, Magearna, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable. From there, it should look to cripple the opposition. Thanks to Amoonguss's decent bulk and Regenerator, it can also pivot into Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Kartana to scout what move they lock themselves into. However, you should be careful when using Amoonguss to check these Pokemon, as it lacks recovery and can't reliably take on Pokemon like Choice Band Kartana and Tapu Bulu because of this. Be mindful of when to use Spore because a fodder Pokemon could come in to take it for other Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Heatran, and Tornadus-T, which will actively be looking to take advantage of Amoonguss. If Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Zapdos are predicted to switch in once another Pokemon has been put to sleep with Spore, Amoonguss should attempt to cripple them with Stun Spore, in Tornadus-T and Mega Alakzam's case, or poison them with Sludge Bomb. It's also important to actively utilize Regenerator with double switches out of Pokemon that it checks, as Amoonguss needs to be at a high range of HP to consistently check Pokemon, and this allows it to keep up the maximum amount of momentum, especially after using Spore.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amoonguss fits on teams ranging from balance to bulky offensive to even some stall teams. While Amoonguss has enough bulk to pivot into Ash-Greninja, having a Dark-resistant Pokemon like Clefable, Assault Vest Magearna, or Tyranitar is mandatory to prevent Amoonguss from getting flinched down by Dark Pulse. Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Jirachi can check Psychic-type Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele that threaten Amoonguss. Because Heatran is a massive threat to Amoonguss, Pokemon that can check it such as Garchomp and Gliscor are good teammates. Slowbro in particular is a good partner to Amoonguss, as they can form a Regenerator core while Slowbro checks Heatran, Mega Medicham, and Mega Latios. In return, Amoonguss keeps Electric-types in check and removes Toxic Spikes. Electric-types like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko are capable of checking Tornadus-T, which is one of the main Pokemon that will try to actively take advantage of Amoonguss. It should be noted that Tapu Koko nullifies Spore's ability to cripple a Pokemon, so make sure to be careful when using both on the same team. Because Amoonguss has to stay at high health to consistently check Pokemon, teammates that can remove entry hazards like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W are good options.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Amoonguss's preferred Grass-type STAB move, as it can be used to regain HP as well as being useful against some problematic Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Keldeo. Sludge Bomb is used to hit Grass- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Tangrowth and has a chance to cripple possible switch-ins, such as Mega Latios and Landorus-T. Clear Smog can be used over Sludge Bomb, serving as a way to neutralize threats like Calm Mind Mega Latias and Clefable, but the power and utility of Sludge Bomb is better in most cases. Also, the chosen Poison-type STAB attack is the move that activates the effect of Stomping Tantrum against Steel-types such as Heatran and Magearna. Stomping Tantrum allows Amoonguss to lure in and OHKO all Heatran and Magnezone sets after a failed move and Stealth Rock damage. It also chips at Magearna, even more so if used after the Poison-type move. Keep in mind that if you use Stomping Tantrum without activating its effect, it will be a very weak move. Hidden Power Fire makes Amoonguss into a good Kartana check, as well as giving it a way to hit Ferrothorn and prevent a favorable scenario for Mega Scizor to set up or stay against Amoonguss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs combined with 96 Defense EVs let Amoonguss always survive a +2 Kartana's Knock Off after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense along with Assault Vest to take hits from some powerful special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Shift Gear Magearna. 120 Defense EVs can be used instead of the standard EV spread to have a good chance of surviving +2 Kartana's Smart Strike after Stealth Rock, but the drop of bulk on the special side can be missed. Regenerator is chosen to make Amoonguss a great pivot and sponge for special hits, regaining some HP every time it switches out. A Sassy nature is used to boost the Special Defense without losing any of the offensive stats, since both are important on this set. The drop in Speed doesn't make any difference, since Amoonguss will not outspeed anything relevant anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As this set is used to swallow some special moves, try to avoid Amoonguss taking powerful physical moves because it may miss the amount of HP lost while dealing with hits it would otherwise take, even factoring Regenerator. Also, although Amoonguss can check Ash-Greninja and lure in Heatran very well, it's recommended to scout for moves that may disrupt this set, such as Ice Beam on Ash-Greninja and Inferno Overdrive on Heatran. Preserving HP by switching out after checking the desired Pokemon is highly recommended. Leaving Amoonguss at low HP or counting only on Giga Drain for longevity can leave it unable to take special hits anymore. Regenerator is what makes this set a good pivot, so use it wisely. Amoonguss can also be used to remove Toxic Spikes from your side of the field, but keep in mind that a burn from Toxapex's Scald, for example, can be critical, putting Amoonguss in range of some attacks or, if your opponent has a Heatran, Magnezone, or Magearna, leaving it unable to deal with them properly because of the Attack reduction. When facing foes such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, do not hesitate to click Sludge Bomb, even if predicting a Steel-type to come in; Stomping Tantrum is here to be used in these situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amoonguss fits best alongside Pokemon that are weak to strong Water-types as well as Tapu Koko, such as Tyranitar and Mega Scizor. Pokemon that are vulnerable to Toxic Spikes like Greninja and all of the Island Guardians appreciate Amoonguss as a teammate because of its ability to absorb them. Due to the fact that Amoonguss invites in many powerful Flying-types, means of checking Mega Pinsir, Hawlucha, and Tornadus-T, such as Celesteela and Tapu Koko, make great partners for Amoonguss. Physically defensive pivots like Landorus-T and Mega Scizor are also good options as partners, since they can cover the physical attackers that this set is weaker to.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola's massive HP stat combined with decent Defense, alongside access to the combination of Wish and Regenerator, gives it a niche on certain teams as a somewhat reliable Wish passer. Alomomola can find several opportunities to Wish pass during a game thanks to its good physical bulk. On the downside, Alomomola's low base 40 Special Attack means that it is very passive and thus heavily reliant on Scald burns or utility moves such as Toxic and Knock Off. It offers very little to a team outside of Wish passing due to its low offenses, lack of useful resistances, and its bad Special Defense, which makes it mostly outclassed by Chansey as a Wish passer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are no other viable options for Alomomola in the OU metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Bulu, Kartana, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone are just a few of a slew of Grass- and Electric-types that are able to deal with Alomomola by using their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Boosting sweepers, especially those not hindered by Scald burns or Toxic, such as Calm Mind Magearna and Tail Glow Manaphy, are able to take advantage of Alomomola's innate passivity and use it as setup fodder. Substitute users such as Hone Claws Kyurem-B and Serperior do something similar, as Alomomola is too weak to break their Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Even with a sky-high HP stat, Alomomola's very low Special Defense stat leaves it vulnerable to powerful Choice Specs users such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Heatran can prevent Alomomola from using utility moves such as Wish and Toxic, which can severely limit its ability to act as a defensive threat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "WishPass": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is used to punish Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Mega Latias that may otherwise try to use Alomomola as setup fodder. Toxic also pressures defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be able to sit in against Alomomola and waste its PP. Knock Off is an option to remove items from Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Wish is Alomomola's means of recovery, which it can use to heal both itself and its teammates. Protect enables Alomomola to stall out a turn, gaining an additional turn of Leftovers recovery, getting potential Toxic damage on a foe, punish Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick, scout for Choice item users like Kartana and Tapu Koko, and even receiving its own Wish if necessary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Since Alomomola's base HP is already so high, it better maximizes its bulk by investing heavily in both defensive stats. There are few Pokemon that will not be healed back to 100% as a recipient of Alomomola's Wish even without it investing into HP, so there is little reason to do so heavily. Therefore, only 40 HP EVs are used, maximizing Leftovers recovery, while 216 Defense EVs combined with a Bold nature hit a jump point in Defense. Maximum Special Defense investment allows Alomomola to stomach hits from Pokemon such as non-transformed Choice Specs Greninja. Leftovers grants Alomomola additional passive recovery, allowing it to more reliably handle threats such as Garchomp and Mega Lopunny. Rocky Helmet can be used in place of Leftovers to chip away at physical attackers, especially U-turn users such as Mega Scizor and Landorus-T; however, the passive recovery provided by Leftovers generally grants better defensive utility in a wider range of situations. Regenerator is what makes Alomomola such a defensive threat, healing a third of its health just for switching out, as well as an excellent Wish passer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Once Alomomola has been brought in, it is usually best to try and throw out either a Knock Off or a Toxic to cripple the opponent's initial switch-in. Alomomola is a relatively safe Pokemon to use when scouting offensive threats such as Greninja and Keldeo for coverage moves thanks to its great bulk combined with Regenerator, so don't be afraid to switch it in during situations such as this. Lastly, keep in mind that Alomomola needs to be at a relatively high amount of HP in order to reliably wall many of the more powerful wallbreakers in OU, so try not to let it get too weak; sometimes, it is best for Alomomola to receive its own Wish, rather than passing it, so that it can remain healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran and Alomomola create a good defensive core, with Heatran being able to check a number of the common Pokemon that can give Alomomola trouble such as Grass-types, Mega Charizard Y, and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. In return, Alomomola keeps Heatran healthy with Wish, negating Heatran's lack of a recovery move. Physically defensive Landorus-T can be used to check physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp that may otherwise overwhelm Alomomola. Unaware Clefable deals with setup Pokemon such as Tail Glow Manaphy and Swords Dance Garchomp. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele all appreciate being kept healthy via Alomomola's Wish, giving them greater staying power. Alomomola is also able to threaten most Steel-types with Knock Off and Scald burns.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is a premier hazard setter in the OU tier, as it has access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock. They are very important in pressuring opposing teams as they switch Pokemon, which is why Ferrothorn is so successful. Ferrothorn can also annoy other teams with moves like Leech Seed and Knock Off, which whittle or cripple opposing Pokemon. Thanks to solid defenses and an excellent Grass / Steel typing that provides plenty of resistances, it finds many opportunities to set up entry hazards or fire off moves to annoy the opposing team. Ferrothorn is naturally a good check to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Swampert, though it is easily worn down by the latter two. While Ferrothorn is a very good Pokemon, it is extremely slow, which hampers its offensive presence, since it will practically always be outsped. Fortunately, it has high-Base Power STAB moves, so it is not completely passive. Ferrothorn is also 4x weak to Fire, so it should be wary of Hidden Power Fire from Pokemon it is tasked to check like Greninja and Kyurem-B and it is easily forced out by Heatran and other Fire-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rocky Helmet can be run on more physically defensive spreads to punish physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Tapu Bulu. An Iapapa Berry can be run instead of Leftovers on fast-paced teams, which generally gain more from the burst recovery than the passive recovery from Leftovers, as Ferrothorn won't be wanting to stay in as much to make the most use of it. Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal with Kartana, which Ferrothorn is otherwise setup fodder for, though it is useless outside of this application. Bulldoze can be run on teams that are weak to Heatran and Magnezone, but Ferrothorn can't afford to fit it very often. Toxic is an interesting option to punish Pokemon like Zapdos, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y that don't mind anything else Ferrothorn can dish out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y are extremely threatening to Ferrothorn, as they OHKO it with their STAB moves. Pokemon that Ferrothorn are usually able to check, such as Tapu Koko, Serperior, and Mega Diancie, can run Hidden Power Fire to dent it significantly. The special attackers in particular don't mind Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types with Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Zapdos is one of the best counters to Ferrothorn, as it takes pitiful damage from all of Ferrothorn's attacks, can remove any entry hazards, and threatens to do massive damage if it carries Heat Wave. Magnezone is also a large threat to Ferrothorn, as it can trap it with Magnet Pull and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye prevents Ferrothorn from setting up hazards and can take any combination of attacks from it, not even being annoyed by Knock Off or Leech Seed. It should be noted that Impish Ferrothorn does Speed tie with Mega Sableye and can threaten to 2HKO a weakened Mega Sableye on the switch. However, Ferrothorn is generally dead weight in matchups against Mega Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss primarily counter Ferrothorn, as they take very little damage from its attacks and threaten to beat it down with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur in particular does not mind Knock Off. Tangrowth is an okay check, as it is unaffected by Leech Seed, but it fears losing its item, particularly if it is an Assault Vest variant. Kartana can use non-Thunder Wave Ferrothorn as setup fodder, though the rare Hidden Power Fire variants can handle it easily.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mega Medicham is very threatening to Ferrothorn not carrying Protect, as High Jump Kick is a clean OHKO. Other Fighting-types such as Kommo-o and Mega Lopunny can also threaten Ferrothorn, but they fail to OHKO it unless they are boosted. Mega Gallade and Mega Heracross can potentially set up a Swords Dance against Ferrothorn or OHKO with Close Combat. Foes like Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Magearna often carry Focus Blast, which means Ferrothorn has to be careful of switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Various wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B can overwhelm Ferrothorn with coverage or sheer power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes can be extremely useful for pressuring grounded foes, though Stealth Rock can be run instead of Spikes if Ferrothorn's team can't afford to fit the move anywhere else. Leech Seed provides Ferrothorn with a way to restore HP and is particularly helpful for wearing down Pokemon such as Heatran. Gyro Ball allows Ferrothorn to handle fast Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele; alternatively, Thunder Wave lets it cripple them. Knock Off can be used to remove items of common switch-ins such as Heatran, Tangrowth, and Celesteela, which limits their effectiveness. Power Whip is the main STAB move due to its ability to OHKO Ash-Greninja and deal large amounts of damage to Tapu Fini and Manaphy. Protect can be used to stall turns and gain extra recovery—which is great with Leech Seed—as well as scout for coverage moves. This is also very helpful against Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. Both Stealth Rock and Spikes can be used on the same set, but that forces Ferrothorn to give up one of its other useful utility or attacking moves. Ferrothorn is fairly versatile and can handle many different threats between its options. As such, you should be mindful when considering what moves to run on Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP in tandem with 232 Special Defense EVs and a Sassy nature ensure that Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse does not 3HKO at full HP. The leftover EVs are put into Defense to ensure that Ferrothorn can take a +1 Supersonic Skystrike from Gyarados if at full HP. If running anything other than Gyro Ball, Careful is the preferred nature. If Hidden Power Fire is used, Ferrothorn needs a Sassy nature and 8 Special Attack EVs to ensure that it OHKOes Kartana. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with an Impish nature allows Ferrothorn to better take on physical attackers such as offensive Landorus-T. Chople Berry is an alternative item that allows Ferrothorn to take a powerful Fighting-type move from Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. Chople Berry should be used with Thunder Wave, as it allows Ferrothorn to cripple these faster threats after surviving the hit, making it easier for the rest of your team to deal with them. Gyro Ball is also an option instead of Thunder Wave to check Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Ferrothorn on favorable circumstances, like when against weaker Pokemon such as Toxapex or Pokemon that it walls such as Tapu Koko. Use the early turns with Ferrothorn to set up entry hazards, because this pressures the opponent's entire team and in some cases forces in hazard removers. Leech Seed and Knock Off should be used to whittle down threats as they switch in, particularly if you predict big threats to switch in or if Ferrothorn has already set up hazards. Leech Seed should also be used to keep Ferrothorn healthy throughout the match so that it can stick around to check various threats or set up entry hazards again if they get removed. Generally, it is best not to sacrifice Ferrothorn until the opposing hazard remover has been weakened, if one's present at all.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T and Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn the freedom to run Spikes. Landorus-T and Ferrothorn together check a large amount of the metagame as well thanks to their solid type synergy. Greninja can defeat common entry hazard removers such as Zapdos and Mega Scizor, and provides a lot of offensive presence to complement Ferrothorn's more passive nature. Pelipper and its rain deserves a special mention as it allows Ferrothorn to take on Fire-type attacks more easily; in return, Ferrothorn checks Tapu Koko for it. Rain's offensive threats like Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert are also good teammates, as they pressure the Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn. Garchomp is also strong against many Fire-types, namely Heatran, and appreciates the hazards Ferrothorn sets up, as they wear down many of its common checks. Ferrothorn can support its teammates by removing items like Assault Vest from Tangrowth and Leftovers from Tapu Fini that are forced to use Defog. Fast pivots like Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T provide speed control and momentum while taking advantage of the hazards that Ferrothorn sets up by forcing switches. Rotom-W relieves pressure from Ferrothorn by being an extra check to Pokemon such as Greninja and Landorus-T while providing utility in Volt Switch. Fast wallbreakers such as Weavile and Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate having Spikes up to wear down the opposing team and provide offensive firepower that makes up for Ferrothorn's mediocre offensive presence.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp's combination of two strong STAB moves, a powerful priority move, and the means to boost its Attack makes it a threatening physical attacker in the OU tier. Dark is one of the most devastating offensive typings in the game, which allows Bisharp to pose a big threat to defensive teams with its powerful Knock Off. In addition to this, Swords Dance + Sucker Punch gives Bisharp a powerful cleaning tool that enables it to also be a pretty threatening Pokemon for offensive teams under the right circumstances. Bisharp's Defiant ability bolsters its sweeping capabilities, gaining an Attack boost any time one of its stats is lowered. Its Dark / Steel typing is also somewhat decent, giving Bisharp resistances to Dragon, Ice, Flying, and Ghost. On the flip side, Bisharp's relatively low base 70 Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the offensive metagame, making it heavily reliant on Sucker Punch, a move that can be circumvented if the foe does not use an attacking move. Bisharp is also relatively frail, unable to take most moderately strong attacks if it does not resist them. Bisharp is often vulnerable due to its weaknesses to common Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-types, such as Mega Charizard X, Gliscor, and Mega Lopunny.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used to give all of Bisharp's attacks an additional boost, but it comes at the cost of much-reduced staying power. Life Orb recoil will wear away at Bisharp and can end up putting it into range of priority moves or weaker attacks that it would have otherwise been able to survive. Lum Berry enables Bisharp to heal itself of any major status condition, allowing it to play more aggressively when facing Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Sableye, Amoonguss, and Slowbro that could all otherwise cripple it with status moves or Scald. Shuca Berry gives Bisharp the ability to take a Ground-type attack from common checks such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which it can then threaten with either Knock Off or Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punch. Low Kick can be used to nail Pokemon such as Heatran, Greninja, and Mega Gyarados. Lastly, Pursuit can be used in place of Swords Dance, granting Bisharp the ability to situationally Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Mega Latios, Chansey, and Alakazam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: With a resistance to both Knock Off and Sucker Punch, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Heracross are all able to effectively check Bisharp and OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves. Keldeo is a particularly good example, as it also resists Bisharp's Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physical walls such as Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon are all able to stomach hits from Bisharp and can aptly deal with it. Zapdos and Hippowdon threaten to KO Bisharp with Heat Wave and Earthquake, respectively, while Tangrowth threatens to put Bisharp to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Gyarados take advantage of their resistance to Sucker Punch to check Bisharp, with Mega Gyarados even being able to use it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, boasting good power combined with the ability to remove the affected Pokemon's item. Iron Head is Bisharp's secondary STAB move, hitting Fairy-types that resist Dark hard while also being a good move to use if a Pokemon has already had its item removed or cannot have its item removed. Sucker Punch gives Bisharp a means of priority, which allows it to somewhat cover for its relatively low Speed stat for an offensive Pokemon, enabling it to pick off frailer offensive threats and dealing significant damage at +2. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's Attack and turns it into a fearsome offensive sweeper that is able to threaten some of the bulkiest defensive walls. Black Hole Eclipse gives Bisharp a strong 140-Base Power Dark-type Z-Move that OHKOes many defensive Pokemon at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment enables Bisharp to hit as hard and as fast as possible, which are two important traits for a physical attacker. An Adamant nature is preferred to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Celesteela, Toxapex, and Mega Scizor with +2 Black Hole Eclipse if choosing to run Darkinium Z, although Stealth Rock damage is also required in the case of latter three. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Tapu Bulu and Mega Heracross, although the additional wallbreaking power provided by an Adamant nature is generally the superior option. Bisharp is commonly used on teams that already carry a Z-Move user, so a Black Glasses is best all around option, boosting both of its Dark-type moves without any drawbacks. Darkinium Z is the best option otherwise. Defiant is Bisharp's ability of choice, enabling it to attain a +2 Attack boost whenever any of its other stats drop, such as against a Pokemon using Defog or Intimidate users entering the field.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One of the first things to note is that if one is using Darkinium Z Bisharp, Sucker Punch has a higher 70 Base Power compared to Knock Off's 65, meaning that using Sucker Punch as the Z-Move will give Dark Hole Eclipse a higher Base Power. It is also worth noting that Z-Moves have neutral priority by default, so using Sucker Punch as the base of the Z-Move will not cause the attack to have +1 priority; it will be neutral priority. Bisharp is used either as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker or as a late-game cleaner. As a wallbreaker, Bisharp can pave the way for another sweeper by using Knock Off or Black Hole Eclipse to weaken or KO a threatening defensive Pokemon. However, sometimes all that is needed is for Bisharp to use Sucker Punch to weaken an offensive threat so that it can then be revenge killed by a teammate. As a late-game cleaner, Bisharp will most likely utilize the combination of Swords Dance and Sucker Punch to sweep through a weakened team. Keep in mind that Bisharp's excellent Defiant ability means that it has the capacity to become a massive threat at any turn, as it gains an Attack boost if any of its stats are lowered. This will often cause Defog users to think twice before removing entry hazards, and Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados also have to play carefully around Bisharp, as if they don't, things can get out of hand quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hazard stacking offensive teams, usually those that use Sticky Web or Spikes in particular, are the types of offensive teams that Bisharp fits best on. Its Defiant ability makes it a good deterrent to Defog, and Bisharp's middling Speed tier means that it often appreciates Sticky Web support in order to outspeed faster offensive threats. With that in mind, Pokemon such as Ribombee, Araquanid, and Greninja are good partners for Bisharp, as they all fit well on these archetypes and are adept at setting up hazards. Bisharp generally pairs well with most physical attackers, as Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Medicham  can work to overwhelm bulkier physically defensive Pokemon that Bisharp would not be able to overcome alone. Lastly, since Bisharp is forced out by almost all Fighting-type Pokemon, it is often a good idea to pair Bisharp with other offensive Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Tornadus-T that are able to check threats such as Keldeo and Mega Heracross.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon is a decently powerful wallbreaker in the tier due to a solid Special Attack stat, a good STAB move in Dark Pulse, and great coverage options like Flash Cannon and Earth Power. Despite being a primarily offensive Pokemon, decent bulk, reliable recovery in Roost, and a unique typing allow it to check a number of Pokemon such as Heatran, Ash-Greninja before transformation, Reuniclus, and Blacephalon. Hydreigon's Speed tier, while good enough to outspeed Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, unfortunately narrowly misses out on base 100s. Hydreigon is also aided by its useful ability Levitate, granting it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, meaning it doesn't have to use Roost as much as other Pokemon and making it a more reliable switch-in to Pokemon that pair well with these entry hazards such as Reuniclus. However, Hydreigon lacks the immediate power and Speed of other offensive wallbreakers and pivots in the tier like Ash-Greninja and Mega Latios. Additionally, it can be hard to justify the use of Hydreigon on a lot of teams because of how specific its niche in the tier is.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydreigon has an expansive movepool containing a number of solid moves including Fire Blast, U-turn, and Defog, but it is difficult to fit such moves onto the set without making it less effective. Hydreigon is an effective user of Choice Specs due to its solid Special Attack stat and decent Speed tier; however, no Roost causes it to be worn down much more easily, resulting in it checking things less effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes practically no damage from any of Hydreigon's moves and can freely get up Stealth Rock or poison it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types that either are faster than Hydreigon or can take one of its coverage moves such as Clefable, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini pose huge threats to Hydreigon, as they can threaten it with their Fairy-type STAB moves or, in Tapu Bulu's case, Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: While Hydreigon does carry Earth Power for Steel-types, some take very little damage from it or are immune to it, namely Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Magearna, and Celesteela, although they are prone to being worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Due to the lack of Draco Meteor, Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and Keldeo can come in without taking much damage and OHKO Hydreigon with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types with solid special bulk such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Mantine can easily take any of Hydreigon's moves and threaten it with Toxic or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Hydreigon such as Mega Alakazam, Kartana, and Weavile can threaten to OHKO Hydreigon with their super effective moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Darkinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's mandatory STAB move, packing a decent Base Power and 100% accuracy. Earth Power allows Hydreigon to deal heavy damage to Steel-types such as Heatran, Magearna, and Magnezone while also hitting Tyranitar. Flash Cannon punishes Fairy-types that try to switch into Hydreigon, namely Clefable and Tapu Bulu. Roost improves Hydreigon's longevity when it is needed to check certain Pokemon such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja. Taunt can be run instead of Earth Power to pressure bulkier teams better, but notably gives up the ability to hit Magearna for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 Special Defense EVs ensure Hydreigon isn't 2HKOed by Battle Bond Greninja's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock. 232 Speed EVs in tandem with a Timid nature allow Hydreigon to outspeed base 95s, and the rest is dumped into Special Attack in order to keep Hydreigon's offensive presence intact. A Modest nature can be used instead if the extra damage dealt to Clefable and Tapu Bulu is deemed necessary, but the inability to outspeed Pokemon such as Z-Move Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Excadrill can be disappointing. Darkinium Z powers Dark Pulse up to a 160-Base Power Black Hole Eclipse, granting Hydreigon the ability to deal heavy damage to checks, including Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Levitate is Hydreigon's only ability, but it is nonetheless a good one, giving it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and most Ground moves, although it should be noted that Hydreigon is a poor switch-in to the majority of Ground-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon can be used to check a number of Pokemon such as Heatran, Battle Bond Greninja, and Reuniclus due to its bulk and two immunities. However, you should be wary of switching it into Heatran and Greninja without knowing their sets, as Heatran can potentially OHKO Hydreigon with Corkscrew Crash or annoy it with Toxic, and Greninja can carry Ice Beam on Battle Bond sets or can be Protean, which Hydreigon fails to check at all. Also, if Hydreigon is needed to check something, you should make sure to keep it healthy with Roost so it can continue to do so throughout the match. Since Hydreigon is known to be a utilizer of both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf, it is reasonable for the opponent to suspect that Hydreigon could be using one of these items, so it can be valuable to bluff these sets to surprise Pokemon that could otherwise beat this set if it were locked into a move. If facing a Clefable or specially defensive Tapu Bulu, it is essential to attempt to predict them to switch in and hit them with a Flash Cannon, as otherwise Hydreigon is forced out by Moonblast or Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set can be used on offensive and balanced teams alike due to its reliability and ability to check dangerous Pokemon for such archetypes. Steel-types like Heatran and Celesteela are welcome teammates, as they have solid type synergy with Hydreigon, providing it a switch-in to Fairy and Ice-type moves that it would otherwise fold to. Similarly, Fairy-types and bulky Psychic-types including Clefable, Reuniclus, Mew, and Mega Slowbro are decent partners, as they can beat Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and Hawlucha that tear through Hydreigon. Stealth Rock and especially Spikes setters such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Greninja help to wear down Hydreigon's checks. Pokemon that enjoy Fairy-types being weakened like Hawlucha, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny are good partners, since Hydreigon can deal heavy damage to said Fairy-types with Flash Cannon. Tornadus-T is an exemplary teammate, as it can annoy Hydreigon checks such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Magearna with Knock Off and chip damage from U-turn, and it additionally forces in Heatran, which Hydreigon can take advantage of. Likewise, Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and other Grass-types lure in Pokemon that Hydreigon can use to get free turns out of, like the aforementioned Heatran, Tangrowth, and Zapdos, while also wearing down Steel-types that check Hydreigon with repeated use of Leech Seed and boosted Superpowers.</p>"

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is one of the deadliest sweepers in the tier because of its access to Quiver Dance, high Special Attack stat, and decent Speed stat. Its large movepool, which is complemented by Z-Moves, allows Volcarona to pick its checks and counters. Volcarona also has a ton of setup opportunities in a tier infested with Steel-types and passive Pokemon such as Tangrowth. However, Volcarona is held back by its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, requiring Defog or Rapid Spin support. Volcarona will also lose to a common Pokemon depending on its set, meaning it can be inconsistent. Finally, Volcarona often cannot sweep in practice, since it will be forced out by Choice Scarf users above its Speed tier such as Greninja as well as strong priority users such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Pinsir.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock must be removed before Volcarona is sent in or otherwise it is much less threatening. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Z-Move Heatran can set Stealth Rock well.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Greninja can revenge kill Volcarona with Rock Slide. Keldeo and Garchomp can also be problematic, although they are much less common.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong priority can pick off Volcarona. Mega Pinsir and Mega Mawile can revenge kill it with little prior damage. Rarer threats such as Azumarill and Crawdaunt can remove it with ease.</p> <p><strong>Selective Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Toxapex is a solid answer to non-Psychium Z or Swarm sets. Tapu Fini can get massive damage on Volcarona without Giga Drain through the combination of Nature's Madness and Moonblast. Mantine is a solid all-around answer.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey completely walls Volcarona and puts it on a timer with Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is Volcarona's secondary STAB move, preventing Mega Tyranitar, Mega Latias, and Mega Latios from walling it. When combined with Buginium Z, it becomes Savage Spin-Out, which can be used to muscle past Pokemon such as Garchomp and Victini on the switch. Hidden Power Ground rounds off the set to let Volcarona break past Heatran, a Pokemon that many teams prefer not to let switch in freely. It also hits foes that resist Volcarona's STAB combination, like Mega Charizard X, Toxapex, and Mega Diancie, super effectively. Psychic is an option with Psychium Z to break through specially defensive Kommo-o and Toxapex harder. Giga Drain is an option over Bug Buzz or Psychic to hit Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and specially defensive Rotom-W and recover health. This is best used with an alternative item such as Firium Z or Charti Berry.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flame Body is the preferred ability for its burn chance in clutch moments. Buginium Z should be used with Bug Buzz to access Savage Spin-Out, while Psychium Z is the item choice for sets running Psychic, granting access to Shattered Psyche. If Giga Drain is used, however, Firium Z should be the item of choice—Inferno Overdrive is capable of OHKOing Naive Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y at +1 and has insane power in general, allowing Volcarona to surprise and OHKO Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B without a boost. Iapapa Berry gives Volcarona more setup and sweeping opportunities, notably compensating for Stealth Rock damage and preventing Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken from picking it off, especially if another Z-Move user is present on the team. Lum Berry is an option to let Volcarona set up once safely in the face of status users like Thunder Wave Rotom-W and Clefable and Toxic Gliscor and Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volcarona should not set up until its counters are cleared. Volcarona's matchup does fluctuate, so there are moments where it can set up mid-game and go for a sweep right off the bat. A lot of Pokemon are setup bait to Volcarona, but those Pokemon can often annoy Volcarona back. Celesteela can use Leech Seed on it and switch around until Volcarona is in range of priority. Ferrothorn can do the same or cripple Volcarona with Thunder Wave. These are the types of situations where directly attacking is usually more safe and beneficial than using Quiver Dance.</p> <p>Volcarona should only come in when entry hazards are off the field, since they greatly cripple it. Volcarona should keep as much of its health to be out of range of priority attacks and set up comfortably. Because of this, the best way to bring it in is through VoltTurn support, double switches, or after sacrificing a Pokemon. Similarly, do not make reckless plays in trying to take advantage of Flame Body. Potentially burning a Mega Scizor is not worth taking U-turn damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is mandatory. Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Tapu Fini are solid options on more defensive teams, while Excadrill and Kartana are options on more hyper offensive teams. Mega Diancie can also discourage hazards from going up and can use Stealth Rock itself, meaning Volcarona can take advantage of Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field. Depending on Volcarona's set, it will be walled by certain Pokemon, so lures to such threats are nice. Buginium Z sets lose to Toxapex, so Thunder Punch Mega Mawile and Extrasensory Greninja can pressure it. Psychium Z Volcarona sets need a way to weaken Tyranitar, so Mega Latios is a phenomenal teammate, since it can pressure it with Earthquake. Tyranitar itself is an interesting teammate too, since it traps Mega Latios and Mega Latias for Psychium Z Volcarona and can support a potential Rapid Spin Excadrill as another teammate. Pokemon that can switch into common attackers that force out Volcarona like Ash-Greninja are required. Tangrowth and Toxapex can do this reliably.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Swarm": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Volcarona to dodge common status moves such as Toxic from Heatran, which Volcarona can potentially beat one-on-one if it is able to avoid a Magma Storm. It also prevents revenge killing options like Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Greninja if it is able to keep its Substitute after getting a KO. Quiver Dance allows Volcarona's Substitute to become even more formidable with Special Defense boosts, with uninvested Heatran's Magma Storm failing to break it after two Quiver Dances. Bug Buzz is powered up by Swarm significantly, being able to OHKO Garchomp at +1 with a Swarm boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>128 HP EVs, in combination with Leftovers, allow Volcarona to use Substitute five times from full health, while also avoiding its Substitute being broken by Toxapex's Scald, Heatran's Lava Plume, and Zapdos's Discharge after a Quiver Dance. Additionally, they allow Volcarona to survive a +1 Knock Off from Kartana from full HP. 184 Speed EVs let Volcarona to outpace maximum Speed Landorus-T. The rest of Volcarona's EVs are pooled into Special Attack, maximizing its offensive potential and allowing it to OHKO Naive Kyurem-B with a Swarm-boosted +1 Bug Buzz.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the nature of this set, which involves Volcarona sacrificing its own HP, it is advised to not bring Volcarona in early-game and to instead opt to wait for its checks to be whittled down. Volcarona can set up a Quiver Dance freely in front of common Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Magearna; however, using Substitute first allows Volcarona to dodge status attempts such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Ferrothorn and Toxic from Toxapex. When faced with a Pokemon that Volcarona can't outright OHKO with a non-Swarm Bug Buzz, it can repeatedly use Substitute to get into Swarm range. However, an unrevealed Substitute can be a lethal weapon, baiting Toxic from the likes of Heatran and Chansey as Volcarona sets up a surprise Substitute. Using this method, non-Taunt Heatran can be beaten one-on-one if Volcarona uses Quiver Dance as it comes in. Chansey is a much less straightforward battle, but Volcarona does have the potential to outplay even Toxic variants with the correct Substitute plays.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is a great fit for hyper offense teams, being able to effortlessly clean up late-game against weakened teams. Entry hazard removal is essential, so pairing it with a Defog user that fits onto hyper offense like Landorus-T or Serperior is a good idea. Taunt Serperior is an especially great Defog user to partner Volcarona with, as it has the added benefit of being able to beat Chansey one-on-one. In addition to hazard removal, Volcarona appreciates a dedicated lead such as Taunt Mew, Imprison Landorus-T, or especially Mega Diancie being able to prevent opposing hazards on the opening turns. Another benefit of a dedicated lead is their consistency in setting up Stealth Rock, which chips down both Mega Charizard formes and Kyurem-B. Paralysis support from the likes of Thunder Wave Rotom-W and Glare Serperior is especially helpful to this variant, as Substitute allows Volcarona to take full advantage of potential full paralyses. Lunar Dance support from Cresselia gives Volcarona a second life, replenishing both its PP and the HP lost from the use of Substitute, which can allow Volcarona's Quiver Dance to outlast Haze's 48 PP.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance turns Volcarona into a dangerous late-game cleaner. Bug Buzz shatters bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro, Mega Latias, Mew, and Cresselia. Volcarona can also swap out Bug Buzz for Hidden Power Ground or Psychic to pressure Heatran and Toxapex if its team struggles against them at the cost of worsening its matchup against Pokemon that it would otherwise break through, such as Greninja, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Finally, Roost keeps Volcarona healthy throughout the game, letting it defensively check the likes of Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Kartana and continue threatening the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed investment allows Volcarona to outspeed Greninja after a boost, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense, enabling it to more easily check physical attackers like Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Kartana and punish them with a chance to burn with Flame Body. Leftovers is recommended to provide Volcarona with extra longevity. Buginium Z allows +1 Volcarona to OHKO Mega Tyranitar with Savage Spin-Out, while Firium Z and Psychium Z let it OHKO Gliscor with Inferno Overdrive and Toxapex with Shattered Psyche after Stealth Rock. Additionally, all three Z-Crystals allow Volcarona to reduce the damage it takes from Knock Off. Alternatively, 136 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Volcarona to outspeed Jolly Kommo-o before a boost and Mega Alakazam at +1. However, not running a Bold nature worsens Volcarona's ability to check the aforementioned physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulky Volcarona functions best as a late-game cleaner and serves as a good defensive check against physical attackers like Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Kartana, thanks to its increased bulk letting it take further advantage of Flame Body. Volcarona often finds setup opportunities against Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Magearna and passive Pokemon like non-Thunder Wave Clefable, Mega Latias, and Cresselia. The battlefield must be cleared of Stealth Rock for Volcarona to be able to wall its main targets, meaning that keeping entry hazards off the field should be prioritized more than setting your own. Volcarona must be wary of status conditions at all times, especially Toxic, as it reduces its efficacy. Since this Volcarona set is completely walled by Toxic Chansey as well as Toxapex and Heatran, depending on Volcarona's coverage move, it must wait until they are dealt with before attempting to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Volcarona variant finds its home on bulkier teams ranging from bulky offense, balance, and stall, which enjoy its capability as a late-game cleaner and defensive utility with Flame Body. Volcarona appreciates wallbreakers like Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham breaking down problematic checks like Toxapex, Heatran, and Chansey. Multiple forms of entry hazard removal are highly recommended; on bulky offense teams, you can run a Defogger like Tapu Fini or Rotom-W with Mega Diancie or a secondary Defogger like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while stall teams prefer Mega Sableye and a Defogger like Gliscor. Volcarona majorly benefits these archetypes by handling Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile for Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Choice Scarf Landorus-T acts as a solid revenge killer against the likes of opposing Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard X; Tapu Fini checks Ash-Greninja and summons Misty Terrain, shielding Volcarona from status conditions like poison and allowing much safer setup opportunities; Gliscor provides a solid answer to Heatran and can bring in Volcarona safely with U-turn. Tapu Bulu is another solid teammate for Volcarona, as it can handle Ash-Greninja and Mega Diancie and summon Grassy Terrain, providing Volcarona with extra longevity and reducing the damage taken from Earthquake, and in return, Volcarona can heavily punish checks like Mega Scizor. Volcarona also enjoys cleric support from partners like Clefable, Chansey, and Magearna, curing any status afflicted, such as paralysis from Serperior's Glare or Toxic from Seismitoad and Gastrodon. Additionally, the former two provide Wish support, improving its longevity and allowing it to conserve its Roost PP and switch into the likes of Mega Mawile more easily. Toxapex absorbs foes' Toxic Spikes and sets up its own, putting Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Diancie on a timer and easing the matchup against rain teams. Shed Shell variants can also switch into Heatran and Tapu Fini and remove their Leftovers with Knock Off.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion has a great Speed tier that allows it to perform as a decent offensive Stealth Rocker. It possesses a near-unresisted STAB combination, which allows Terrakion to serve as a strong wallbreaker and cleaner for offensive teams. On the downside, however, its typing also leaves it weak to Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type moves used by Landorus-T, Greninja, and Tangrowth, which are all common in the OU tier; this also means that it can be easily revenge killed by Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken. In addition, it also faces competition as a wallbreaker and entry hazard setter from other threats, such as Landorus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Stealth Rock entry hazard lead set with Focus Sash is a usable option due to its strong STAB moves allowing it to match up well against a number of entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn while also making use of Taunt to deter Defog users. However, this set has a bad matchup against some hazard leads such as Azelf, and Ash-Greninja is able to take advantage of lead Terrakion by transforming after taking it out. Double Kick can be used on this set specifically to beat Smeargle, preventing it from setting up Sticky Web or Stealth Rock. A Choice Band set allows Terrakion to work as a powerful wallbreaker by taking advantage of the lack of Pokemon that resist its STAB coverage and of its great Speed tier to revenge kill. Most notably, it can threaten normal checks such as Mega Mawile with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. Hidden Power Ice may be used with a Life Orb to avoid recoil and wear down Landorus-T and Garchomp, although this option forces it to cut some of its bulk in order to power Hidden Power Ice up, leaving it at the mercy of Battle Bond Greninja and its Choice Specs-boosted Water Shuriken when unboosted.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon all resist Terrakion's Rock-type STAB moves and can threaten it with their Ground-type STAB moves. Landorus-T also cuts Terrakion's Attack with Intimidate, severely limiting its damage output. All except for Landorus-T must watch out for Close Combat if significantly weakened, and they do not appreciate getting hit with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo, Toxapex, Greninja, Ash-Greninja, and other bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini all take advantage of Terrakion due to their great natural bulk. Keldeo can take easily take out Terrakion with a Water-type STAB move, and Toxapex can easily take a hit from all of Terrakion's moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur can take most of Terrakion's attacks and respond with a strong super effective Grass-type STAB move. Tangrowth can get worn down with Toxic, while Mega Venusaur does not have the ability to consistently switch into Terrakion due to its lack of Regenerator. Tapu Bulu is a notable mention, as it is able to take advantage of most hits from the Choice Scarf set, although it must watch out for either Continental Crush or a Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Super effective priority such as Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, Mega Medicham's Bullet Punch, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and the rare Breloom's Mach Punch are able to pick off a weakened Terrakion and stop any sweep cold in its tracks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Terrakion to serve as a bigger threat against many defensive builds that lack faster answers to it, allowing it to wallbreak with ease. Stone Edge is notable for having a large lack of resistant Pokemon in the OU metagame. With Rockium Z, it turns into a strong 180-Base Power Continental Crush, picking up notable OHKOs at +2 on physically defensive Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T, after Stealth Rock damage and an Intimidate drop in the case of Landorus-T, as well as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Close Combat is Terrakion's secondary Fighting-type STAB move, which allows it to hit the Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon that resist Stone Edge such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Stealth Rock lets Terrakion support the rest of its team by providing residual damage for teammates to take advantage of, and it works well on this set because, after a Swords Dance boost, Terrakion can take advantage of many common entry hazard removers such as Zapdos and Tapu Fini.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature allows Terrakion to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding threats such as Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, Manaphy, and Landorus-T. The choice between Rockium Z and Life Orb on this set depends on the team; if a more useful Z-Move user is not present on the team, then Rockium Z can be used to turn Stone Edge into a powerful Continental Crush, which can dent even Pokemon that resist it very hard. However, Life Orb is a very useful item that can power up Terrakion's moves at the cost of its health, making it easier to be taken out by the likes of pre-transformation Battle Bond Greninja's Water Shuriken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set serves mainly as an early-game wallbreaker, using its great Speed tier to threaten defensive threats such as Celesteela, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost using Continental Crush. Bringing Terrakion in with the assistance of Volt Switch and U-turn or double switches is a great way of keeping it healthy so that it does not fall to priority moves such as +2 Bisharp's Sucker Punch later on in the match. When using this set, Stone Edge is the safer move to use due to its lack of resistant Pokemon in the metagame, but you can predict threats that resist Rock-type moves such as Scarf Excadrill to come in by hitting them with Close Combat on the switch. Use Swords Dance on a predicted switch into a defensive threat, such as Landorus-T, and take it out with a Continental Crush, although you should be wary for opponents that try to scout for the Z-Move. The way this set is used depends on the last slot; if using Stealth Rock, it is wise to set it up against threats that Terrakion normally forces out such as Ferrothorn or Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Garchomp and Mega Mawile that appreciate Stealth Rock support or appreciate Terrakion's ability to wear down and take out the likes of Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Landorus-T pair well with this Terrakion set. These wallbreakers can even wear down threats to prepare for a late-game Terrakion sweep. Partners that can take on faster offensive checks to Terrakion like Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko pair well with this set; such partners include Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Keldeo, for example. Terrakion can find itself hindered by its weaknesses to Water-type moves from threats such as Ash-Greninja, which can deter Terrakion from setting up with Hydro Pump. Partners such as Assault Vest Tangrowth can assist in taking these threats on and therefore perform well with Terrakion. Given that this set can severely weaken or take out Landorus-T, a teammate that appreciates this such as Swords Dance Mega Mawile or Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X can easily find more opportunities to set up and sweep.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is Terrakion's strongest STAB Rock-type move and is mainly used to revenge kill threats that are not OHKOed by Rock Slide, such as Mega Charizard X and Gyarados, as well as Gengar and Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock damage. It can also be used to clean weakened teams that tend to lack strong Rock-resistant Pokemon. Close Combat lets Terrakion hit the Steel- and Ground-types that resist its Rock-type coverage such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp; it is also useful for a more accurate way to hit Greninja. Rock Slide provides an extra Rock-type move and can be used when you want to preserve PP on Stone Edge, as well as when you want to be more confident in hitting targets, such as revenge killing Volcarona, for example. Unlike Stone Edge, it also has a flinch chance, which can be useful in certain situations. Toxic allows Terrakion to passively wear down checks that can consistently switch into this set such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T. Earthquake, while somewhat redundant with Terrakion's phenomenal STAB coverage, allows Terrakion to more securely get damage on the likes of Tapu Koko, Mega Mawile, and Magearna, which can all be revenge killed with some prior damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature allows Terrakion to make use of its great Speed tier and Attack stat to serve as an efficient revenge killer with its near-unresisted STAB combination. A Choice Scarf is used so that it can perform as one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, being able to outspeed boosted threats like Volcarona, Salamence, and Mega Charizard X and even other fast Choice Scarf users like Nihilego, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and is only situationally helpful, as many threats with Dark-type coverage have other super effective coverage against Terrakion, such as Bisharp and Greninja, meaning that it is not recommended to try to switch directly into Dark-type attacks to get the Justified boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Given that this set's primary function is as a revenge killer, it is recommended to bring Terrakion in after an opposing sweeper has KOed a teammate so that it can retaliate using its great STAB coverage. In addition to this, if the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened, this set can also serve as a cleaner due to its great Speed and STAB moves. When using this set, Stone Edge is a more spammable move than Close Combat, but Close Combat can be used if you are predicting a threat that resists Terrakion's Rock-type STAB to switch in, such as a Steel-type like Ferrothorn or a Ground-type like Garchomp. The decision between using Stone Edge and Rock Slide to revenge kill depends on the threat that Terrakion is up against and their amount of HP. For example, it is always safe to use Rock Slide to revenge kill Volcarona, which faints from full, but not against the likes of Salamence and Mega Charizard X, as they are not OHKOed. Stone Edge is necessary until they have taken enough damage to be KOed by Rock Slide. If a threat that can continuously come in on Terrakion such as Landorus-T or Tangrowth is healthy, then it is a good idea to go for Toxic, as it will hinder their ability to switch into Terrakion later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pairing Terrakion with partners that appreciate its ability to revenge kill threats such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X is key, as this gives more opportunities for another sweeper on Terrakion's team, such as Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados, to set up and sweep. If this set wants to have a chance of cleaning end-game after successfully being used to revenge kill threats, it is going to need some key threats worn down or taken out in order to sweep. While Toxic helps wear down Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and other walls, Terrakion is going to need assistance from wallbreakers and other partners that can wear these threats down, such as Greninja, which can also set up. There are also other wallbreakers that help with weakening these threats for Terrakion including Mamoswine, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile. Partners that resist Water and can deal with both Choice Scarf Keldeo and Ash-Greninja serve as great partners due to Terrakion's massive Water-type weakness; Assault Vest Tangrowth works great in this regard and can even wear down Tapu Koko for Terrakion to clean later on in the match if Terrakion forgoes Earthquake.</p>"

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great Speed, decent bulk, and superb utility toolkit, Tornadus-T is one of the best pivots in the tier, fitting on a wide variety of teams. It provides teams with consistent entry hazard removal with Defog thanks to its perfect-fitting ability in Regenerator, and it can pester various defensive switch-ins with options like Knock Off and Taunt. It works well both as a defensive piece and as an attacker, with multiple options like Flyinium Z and Fightinium Z to deal huge damage. Its respectable offensive presence provides lots of opportunities to pivot out with U-turn to bring in other offensive teammates. However, its offensive presence is quite linear, meaning that its easily checked by the likes of Tapu Koko and Zapdos and struggles to dent Magearna. It's deathly afraid of paralysis from the likes of Chansey and Serperior, and it often has to rely on the poor accuracy of Hurricane in order to beat threats like Kartana, Mega Medicham, and the aforementioned Serperior.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icy Wind can be used with Icium Z to snipe Swords Dance Gliscor as well as Landorus-T and Garchomp, though it has very little other use. Superpower is a way to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran without going full send on Fightinium Z, but it doesn't do as much damage, failing to OHKO either. Firium Z can be used with Heat Wave to OHKO Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Mega Mawile and deal significant damage to other Steel-types like Jirachi and Celesteela. Life Orb increases Tornadus-T's offensive potency without using up a Z-Crystal, though the recoil cuts into its immediate longevity, especially while Stealth Rock is up. Toxic provides a safe punish to the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko by putting them on a timer. Assault Vest is an option to enable Tornadus-T to more safely make trades and scout special attacks when Defog is taken care of by another teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Magearna, Heatran, and Mega Mawile resist Hurricane and can hit Tornadus-T back hard, though the likes of Heatran and Celesteela are really bothered by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zapdos all defensively check and threaten out Tornadus-T with their Electric typing. Electric-type coverage is also quite threatening, with examples including Thunder Punch from Kommo-o and Thunder from Clefable and Mega Latias.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile outspeeds and threatens to OHKO Tornadus-T with Icicle Crash, though it can't switch in safely. Kyurem-B can tank hits and beat Tornadus-T without much issue. Ice-type coverage is commonplace, so watch out for Ice Punch from Mega Medicham and Kommo-o and Ice Beam from Clefable and Protean Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie both destroy Tornadus-T one-on-one, though the former needs to scout for Fightinium Z from Tornadus-T. Mega Tyranitar is especially irritating due to its powerful STAB Pursuit forcing damage and potentially removing Tornadus-T entirely. Landorus-T and Tapu Bulu can snipe incoming Tornadus-T with Stone Edge, sometimes boosted into Continental Crush by Rockium Z for a clean OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny all outspeed and can threaten a chipped Tornadus-T, though none of them are interested in switching in directly.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong> Thunder Wave users like Chansey, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn completely ruin Tornadus-T by removing its crucial good Speed, which prevents it from pivoting safely and revenge killing. Serperior can catch Tornadus-T with Glare as it switches in, and Zapdos's Static ensures Tornadus-T is never free to use Knock Off and U-turn.</p>",

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane deals solid damage to neutral targets like Landorus-T and lets Tornadus-T OHKO Serperior, Mega Medicham, and Kartana in a pinch. Knock Off is a great punish to common Hurricane answers like Chansey, Magearna, and Celesteela, reducing their bulk or longevity so that they're easier to break through. Heat Wave is another option that allows Tornadus-T to accrue chip damage on various Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Mawile, lets it threaten Ferrothorn significantly better, and OHKOes Kartana with consistent accuracy. U-turn is an invaluable momentum tool that allows Tornadus-T to capitalize on the switches it forces as well as chip Mega Tyranitar and Rotom-W. Taunt is great for passive walls like Chansey, Toxapex, and Skarmory, as it prevents them from healing off damage and responding with status. It's additionally useful for forcefully preventing entry hazards from the likes of Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T and prevents Zapdos from healing off Stealth Rock damage. Defog synergizes well with Regenerator, as Tornadus-T heals off Stealth Rock damage by default, allowing it to clear hazards with less risk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs and 64 Defense EVs let Tornadus-T survive an Ice Punch from Mega Medicham from full health. The Speed investment allows Tornadus-T to outspeed Choice Scarf Magnezone. Rocky Helmet chips away at contact attackers like Landorus-T and Mega Medicham, while Flyinium Z provides both access to an accurate powered-up Hurricane and less damage from Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tornadus-T has the unique benefit of being a Defogger with Regenerator, meaning that it will heal off Stealth Rock damage; however, Tornadus-T cannot meaningfully heal itself up while Stealth Rock is on the field, so it should avoid trading significant amounts of health while Stealth Rock is active. If carrying Taunt, can aggressively come in on Stealth Rock Gliscor, Chansey, and Ferrothorn to remove their entry hazards, but otherwise, it risks taking a crippling status condition. Early-game, Tornadus-T can switch in to scout or threaten Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu and defensive Landorus-T and can punish their contact moves with Rocky Helmet. Since Tornadus-T can heal off minor chip damage with Regenerator, it finds easy entry against passive walls like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Gliscor, not caring so much about Scald and Toxic damage as long as it doesn't stay in for too long. Against overly hostile offense matchups, Tornadus-T is most useful brought in through other pivots or as a revenge killer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus-T fits well on teams ranging from bulky offense to balance, providing consistent entry hazard removal and pivoting support. Other pivots like Landorus-T and Magearna have great synergy because they can work in tandem with Tornadus-T to generate momentum, with Landorus-T sharing resistances with Tornadus-T and reducing its defensive burden. Wallbreakers like Mega Medicham and Mega Tyranitar are the prime beneficiaries of the momentum that Tornadus-T generates, and they can break through the likes of Magearna and Zapdos to make Tornadus-T more potent. Bulky Ground-types like Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Excadrill check Electric-types like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W and block Volt Switch, with Tornadus-T handling Grass-types like Kartana for them in return. Tornadus-T is a great choice for a Defogger on rain teams, too, as it has a great resistance to Grass, and its Hurricane is boosted to 100% accuracy while rain is active. Sand teams are another good option due to Tornadus-T's aforementioned good synergies with Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill, the latter providing excellent speed control and Rapid Spin support to free Tornadus-T's moveslots. Other Regenerator users like Toxapex and Slowbro form consistent defensive pivoting cores, and they can be switched between each other infinitely to stall out Celesteela's Leech Seed and potentially force a draw against stall teams. Mega Latias shares resistances to Grass and Fighting with Tornadus-T and reduces its defensive burden, additionally helping to check Electric-types for it.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is a solid damage-spreading option, and Supersonic Skystrike blows through neutral targets with consistent accuracy and great power without using an extra slot. Knock Off is a traditional complement to Hurricane for punishing Steel-types by removing their item, but All-Out Pummeling is a great option to snipe certain Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill and others like Mega Tyranitar. Heat Wave is complementary coverage for Flyinium Z sets that threatens Steel-types switching in and gives a higher accuracy move to OHKO Kartana without wasting Tornadus-T's Z-Move. U-turn generates momentum while chipping defensive answers like Rotom-W and Mega Tyranitar. Taunt makes damage stick to targets by blocking their recovery, blocks status attempts from the likes of Chansey and Gliscor, and makes Tornadus-T a much better Defogger by proactively stopping entry hazards from Gliscor and Toxapex to take the pressure off of itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outpace Choice Scarf Tyranitar. 128 HP EVs ensure that Tornadus-T survives Flamethrower from Mega Charizard Y in sun, with the extra 8 Defense EVs letting it survive Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock damage. Focus Blast should only be used with Fightinium Z due to the low reward compared to the risk. Otherwise, Flyinium Z should be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used to check Grass-types, revenge kill the likes of Kartana and Mega Medicham, remove entry hazards with Defog, and generate momentum with U-turn, but the lack of bulk makes it more important to conserve HP, especially against the likes of Choice Scarf Kartana. Supersonic Skystrike can be used to surprise neutral targets like Landorus-T and Tapu Lele early-game, and it can also be saved as a perfect accuracy move for crucial turns against the likes of Mega Medicham. Hurricane into Supersonic Skystrike finishes off Toxapex and specially defensive Gliscor, so it can pivot with U-turn to build momentum if the opponent attempts to scout the Z-Move. Tornadus-T can OHKO Mega Tyranitar and offensive Heatran with All-Out Pummeling, though it never hurts to scout with U-turn first in case Mega Tyranitar switches to scout or Heatran is specially defensive. Other times, Tornadus-T can use its Z-Move to heavily dent or finish off Mega Mawile or Mega Diancie. Hurricane's accuracy is too poor to trade damage consistently, so the focus should be on using it to chip switch-ins and then pivoting out straight away.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, where it can make progress on top of serving as a pivot and Defogger. Other pivots like Magearna form a pivoting core with Tornadus-T, getting it in easier and keeping up momentum. Bulky Ground-types like Seismitoad and specially defensive Gliscor can patch up Tornadus-T's poor matchup against Electric-types and block Volt Switch. Ferrothorn can handle Electric-types for Tornadus-T and set Spikes to chip down the likes of Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Magearna. Calm Mind Mega Latias greatly benefits from Tornadus-T removing Heatran and Mega Tyranitar with Fightinium Z. Spikes from Ferrothorn and Skarmory aids Tornadus-T in chipping switch-ins like Jirachi and Magearna and making its U-turn generally more potent against grounded targets.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus acts as a niche wallbreaker in the tier thanks to its great Special Attack, colorful coverage, and access to a potent boosting option in Nasty Plot, allowing it to break through metagame staples like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Celesteela. Thundurus also has a respectable Speed stat, letting it outpace common Pokemon in Garchomp, Kartana, and Mega Latios, and an Electric / Flying typing gives it some useful defensive merits such as an immunity to Earthquake and a resistance to Grass and Flying; these notably allow it to stay in on bulky Grass-types like specially defensive Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth and means it can check Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Kartana. However, Thundurus's mediocre bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock mean it can't do this very reliably. Though Thundurus has overall good coverage, it struggles to break through Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur as well as Calm Mind Mega Latias thanks to its best attack for them being the weak Hidden Power Ice, which they negate with their abilities or stat boosts. Unfortunately, despite its good typing and decent Speed tier, Thundurus is very prone to being revenge killed, either by faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko or by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Flying is an option over Hidden Power Ice that gives Thundurus a better matchup against Grass-types, specifically Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur. It leaves Thundurus unable to OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor, though, making it the worse choice of Hidden Power the majority of the time. A Defiant set with the moves Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, Knock Off, and Superpower could be used as a means of deterring Defog. However, it can prove to be inconsistent due to its inability to garner any boosts outside of Defiant. Because of this, it has to use Life Orb to attempt to make its offensive presence more consistent, causing it to be worn down exceptionally quickly. Thunder Wave is a decent option over Nasty Plot, providing good general speed control by crippling sweepers and faster Pokemon like Shift Gear Magearna, Mega Alakazam, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, and Mega Lopunny, which allows it to act as an emergency check to them. It also catches Tornadus-T if they try to pivot out safely with U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Strong Priority</strong>: Thundurus's main downfall is that it has mediocre bulk and just a decent Speed tier, meaning it is very prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny and priority from Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Assault Vest Magearna and Gastrodon take very little from Thundurus's attacks and can retaliate with Fleur Cannon or Toxic, respectively. However, it should be noted that the latter can fall to a +2 All-Out Pummeling after some prior damage. Calm Mind Mega Latias can use Thundurus as setup fodder, even with a Nasty Plot boost. Although 3 Attacks Mega Latias is 2HKOed most of the time by +2 Hidden Power Ice, it can retaliate with an Ice Beam, which threatens to KO Thundurus after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Though Thundurus has a good matchup against a few of them, Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur can beat Thundurus handily if it doesn't have Hidden Power Flying, with the former being able to stomach a +2 Hidden Power Ice easily and hit it with Spore and the latter actually walling it thanks to Thick Fat. Even Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can beat Thundurus if it is weakened.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ice has fantastic coverage alongside Thunderbolt, hitting Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Focus Blast rounds out the set's coverage, hitting Heatran, Ferrothorn, Mega Tyranitar, Chansey, and Kyurem for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>4 Defense EVs let Thundurus take two unboosted Leaf Blades from Kartana at full HP. Fightinium Z gives Thundurus access to a powerful All-Out Pummeling, which coupled with a Nasty Plot boost can help it break through Pokemon like Assault Vest Tyranitar and Gastrodon. It also helps with the stall matchup, providing Thundurus with a nuke that can break through Quagsire and even Chansey if it has taken some prior damage. Leftovers is an alternative if the Z-Crystal is already in use on Thundurus's team, improving Thundurus's ability to check certain threats while also making it more resistant to being revenge killed. However, it comes at the cost of a worsened stall matchup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- and mid-game, bring in Thundurus through double switches, on a free switch from Volt Switch or U-turn, or after a teammate faints to break through teams; set up Nasty Plot on forced switches in order to break through the opposing team. Thanks to Thundurus's typing and coverage, it can stay in on Grass-types like Ferrothorn, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth that may try to switch in on a predicted Thunderbolt. Aside from its offensive capabilities, Thundurus can be used as a switch-in to Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Kartana, though it should be noted that it will fall to coverage from Landorus-T and can lose to the other two if Stealth Rock is up or it has taken even minor chip damage. Furthermore, if Thundurus takes too much damage from trying to check these Pokemon, it will no longer be able to take a hit from the aforementioned Grass-types after setting up, forfeiting its ability to break through them. Against more offensive teams, it can be better to just throw out attacks rather than to set up, as Thundurus won't have as many opportunities to set up due to being outsped by Pokemon commonly found on such teams like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thundurus should be used on offensive teams due to its fragility and relative lack of setup opportunities, so it should be paired with other Pokemon that fit on this archetype. Mega Latias is a big issue for Thundurus; 3 Attacks Mega Latias can comfortably take a +2 Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with Ice Beam, which can KO after Stealth Rock, while Calm Mind Mega Latias actually uses Thundurus as setup fodder. Pursuit support from Tyranitar and Weavile can remove Mega Latias, making them very valuable partners. VoltTurn users like Landorus-T, Assault Vest Magearna, and Tornadus-T are great assets to Thundurus, as they give it more opportunities to wallbreak. Entry hazard setters like Focus Sash Landorus-T, Greninja, and Excadrill work well alongside Thundurus on hyper offensive teams, as they help to weaken its checks in range with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Sticky Web is an interesting option, rendering Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Protean Greninja unable to revenge kill Thundurus, so Araquanid and Ribombee can be good partners to set it up. Sweepers found on hyper offense like Shift Gear Magearna, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados that can clean up after Thundurus has broken through the opposing team are great teammates.</p>"

  "Thundurus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus-T is a powerful Electric-type wallbreaker that is able to power through typical Electric-type checks such as Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon thanks to the combination of an absurdly high Special Attack stat and a vast movepool. Despite its high Special Attack, Thundurus-T depends on boosting with Nasty Plot to break past the aforementioned Pokemon and specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Latias and Magearna. This is often easier said than done because Thundurus-T's Speed, while decent for a wallbreaker, leaves it easily revenge killed by much faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Garchomp, which means it often won't get a safe chance to boost. Thundurus-T has issues breaking neutral targets such as Mega Latias and Mega Latios because it relies on Hidden Power Flying to hit these Pokemon. As an offensive Electric-type, Thundurus-T is heavily overshadowed by Tapu Koko, which is much faster and provides more utility for a team beyond just being a wallbreaker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrium Z can give Thundurus-T an extremely powerful STAB Z-Move that gives it a better matchup against Assault Vest Magearna, but it loses the ability to dent Pokemon like Chansey. Thundurus-T can make use of Agility to boost its Speed, which improves its offensive matchup against Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Medicham, but this requires giving up an important coverage option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Thundurus-T's merely decent Speed means that it is outsped and threatened by Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Greninja, and Mega Lopunny. Still, keep in mind that none of these Pokemon want to switch directly into Thundurus-T's moves. Mega Latias, however, can freely switch into Thundurus-T's coverage and STAB moves and easily recover back its health, while Mega Alakazam can easily Trace Volt Absorb and block its STAB attacks. Both of these Pokemon threaten Thundurus-T out of the battlefield because it only has Hidden Power Flying to deal any significant damage to them, while they can easily retaliate after switching in with their powerful moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Assault Vest Magearna take any move that Thundurus-T goes for and can either recover the damage done or retaliate with Toxic or Fleur Cannon and Ice Beam in Magearna's case. While these Pokemon do need to be cautious of Thundurus-T's Z-Move, they can deal with it more easily once it has exhausted its Z-Move, forcing Thundurus-T to continue boosting with Nasty Plot in order to beat them. Unaware Clefable is also a definite counter because it will always take very little damage from Thundurus-T's attacks. Even though this is mitigated by Electrium Z, it still requires prediction for Thundurus-T to beat Clefable.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Thundurus-T's only special Flying-type STAB move, but it is necessary to power through bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth as well as provide neutral damage to Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Alakazam without using its Z-Move. Focus Blast powered by Fightinium Z allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Tyranitar and severely dent Chansey at +2. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative move to hit Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for super effective damage while still being able to hit Grass-types, but it comes with the cost of losing coverage against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z is used to power through Pokemon such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn. Volt Absorb gives Thundurus-T some defensive utility by being able to switch into a Choice-locked Tapu Koko's Electric-type STAB move or Volt Switch from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Magearna and recover some health while denying them momentum.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against balanced teams, it is best to determine whether Thundurus-T even has an opportunity to set up, especially against faster offensive threats like Garchomp, Mega Latias, and Mega Alakazam, since they can switch into it and threaten it out, which is why it is best to simply fire off a strong attack so that they don't necessarily come in for free. Thundurus-T can take advantage of its typing to freely set up against Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor. Thundurus-T can also come into battle by a teammate pivoting against other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone, but this play is generally not worth it because Thundurus-T relies on being healthy in order to effectively break foes like Assault Vest Magearna while having a chance to stay out of KO range of revenge killers' neutral attacks. Before sending Thundurus-T into battle, make sure Stealth Rock is cleared, as it can wear Thundurus-T down quickly if it switches into battle repeatedly. Try to save Thundurus-T's Z-Move for a target that is normally not threatened by either Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Flying such as Chansey, Assault Vest Tyranitar, or Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from the likes of Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T makes them excellent partners to give Thundurus-T an easier time coming into battle. Toxapex can make a decent parter for Thundurus-T because of its ability to set Toxic Spikes, which can ease Thundurus-T's matchup against Gastrodon and Tangrowth. Pivots such as Landorus-T, Magearna, and Tornadus-T make for fantastic partners for Thundurus-T because they can bring it into the battlefield safely. Landorus-T also provides Intimidate support. Other offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Kartana, and Tapu Lele greatly appreciate Thundurus-T luring in and removing bulky Grass-, Water-, and Steel-types. Mega Scizor can also make for a decent teammate, since it also lures in Water-, Steel-, and Electric-types such as Magnezone, Toxapex, and Celesteela for Thundurus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set streamlines Thundurus-T to take up a supporting role rather than a wallbreaking one, using Volt Switch to gain momentum on passive switch-ins like Chansey and Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice threatens Landorus-T and Gliscor and prevents Garchomp from switching in safely. The main draw of this set is Taunt, being able to block entry hazards from the likes of Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, additionally blocking hazards removal attempts from the first and attempts to heal or inflict status from the last two, allowing Thundurus-T to disrupt Chansey and get damage to stick on other Pokemon that need to manually heal like Clefable and Zapdos. Defog allows Thundurus-T to clear the field for Rock-weak teammates if necessary, additionally being able to clear Toxapex's Toxic Spikes or Skarmory's Spikes while threatening them out. Thunderbolt can be used to more directly challenge the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, though Thundurus-T sorely misses the momentum gained from Volt Switch. Thunder Wave is an option on teams that already have a Defogger or spinner or can otherwise handle entry hazards, punishing the likes of Mega Charizard X and Mega Latias harshly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>112 HP EVs allow Thundurus-T to survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Greninja when at full HP. Rocky Helmet is used to punish contact moves such as Landorus-T's U-turn and Chansey's Seismic Toss, though Iapapa Berry is another viable option that improves Thundurus-T's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thundurus-T can use its typing and decent bulk to switch directly into the likes of Landorus-T and Gliscor, threatening them out with Hidden Power Ice and being able to clear any entry hazards they might set. It can often sacrifice HP in the means of hazard control, such as using Taunt against the likes of Heatran or Clefable to prevent possible Stealth Rock, especially so with Iapapa Berry, but you should preserve Thundurus-T's HP should you want to keep it around to block Volt Switch from the likes of Magearna and Tapu Koko or to check Hawlucha and Choice Scarf Kartana. The main focus should be to keep entry hazards off of the field with Taunt and Defog, and building momentum with Volt Switch comes second.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set lets Thundurus-T act as a Defogger, pivot, and Volt Switch blocker, all very attractive traits for hyper offense teams, which can struggle to fit all of these while stacking threats. Entry hazard leads like Mew and Mega Diancie can start off the game with hazards that Thundurus-T can take advantage of with Volt Switch and prevent removal of with Taunt, additionally keeping the field clear so that Thundurus-T doesn't need to lose momentum by using Defog. Other Taunt users like the aforementioned Mew and other users like Kommo-o and Serperior can work in tandem with Thundurus-T to prevent both opposing hazards and removal while making manual healing incredibly difficult. Rock-weak hyper offense threats like Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Gyarados are especially appreciative of Thundurus-T's hazard control. Magearna can handle the likes of Kyurem-B and Kommo-o, which would otherwise take advantage of Thundurus-T's inability to meaningfully hit them.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T's versatility is impossible to compete with; not only does it act as a blanket check for physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Choice Scarf Kartana using its perfect-fitting ability Intimidate and pose a significant threat with its absurd base 145 Attack stat to throw off STAB Earthquakes and potential Z-Moves, but it also has nearly every utility option you would want to run on it, from both Stealth Rock and Defog to U-turn and Knock Off. All of this is complemented by its all-rounder stats, including its workable Speed stat that makes Choice Scarf sets an option, and its impressive Ground / Flying typing that possesses important immunities to common types in Electric and Ground. Landorus-T is the godfather of role compression, ticking lots of boxes and opening up all sorts of possibilities in regard to teambuilding. However, Landorus-T has no forms of reliable recovery, making its defensive profile noticeably temporary. Its middling Speed and 4x weakness to Ice are both plenty exploitable, with its presence encouraging faster attackers like Mega Medicham and Tapu Koko to pack Ice-type coverage to threaten it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smack Down can be used to force out Skarmory and Celesteela, hit Rotom-W as it switches in, and work in tandem with Swords Dance to force Stealth Rock against Defoggers such as Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T. Yache Berry allows Landorus-T to stay in against the likes of Hidden Power Ice Tapu Koko, Ice Punch Mega Medicham, and Weavile to trade damage. Life Orb gives offensive variants a useful power boost that lets it surprise Toxapex with an OHKO and 2HKOes Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock with Earthquake, though the Life Orb recoil doesn't help Landorus-T's already limited longevity. Soft Sand is an option that skips the recoil damage to give Earthquake a general power boost, still being quite favorable to OHKO Toxapex, but it's limited to only boosting Earthquake and isn't as potent. A Relaxed nature with minimum Speed investment can be run to underspeed opposing Landorus-T and Rotom-W, allowing it to get the slower U-turn out and take advantage of predicted Volt Switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory and Celesteela have an easy time walling Landorus-T for the most part, with Zapdos being able to easily defensively answer Landorus-T lacking a Rock-type move and Toxic and punishing its U-turn with Static. Hawlucha can use some defensive Landorus-T variants as setup fodder, and Mega Charizard Y and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T can switch into Earthquake and offensively threaten out Landorus-T, though they have to be careful about switching into potential Z-Moves or other Rock-type attacks. Levitate users like Mega Latias and Rotom-W can handle Landorus-T defensively, but in practice, they are incredibly irritated by U-turn, which they don't resist.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tapu Bulu halves the power of Earthquake with its terrain and takes neutral damage from U-turn, and Serperior can switch into Earthquake and threaten Landorus-T with Leaf Storm. However, these Pokemon have to be very careful of Supersonic Skystrike wiping them out instantly. Defog + Synthesis Kartana can switch into Landorus-T and reliably heal off damage, use Defog on its Stealth Rock, and OHKO it with Bloom Doom. Other variants of Kartana like Swords Dance and Choice Band can threaten Landorus-T, though it doesn’t resist Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Ash-Greninja outspeeds and OHKOes Landorus-T if it's able to get in safely, even having the option to hit Choice Scarf Landorus-T with its priority Water Shuriken. Under rain, Mega Swampert outruns even Choice Scarf Landorus-T and can OHKO it with Waterfall, and Manaphy and Pelipper can brave an attack and threaten back with their rain-boosted STAB attacks. Toxapex can survive Earthquake from full health and threaten Landorus-T with a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Weavile, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B are able to outspeed and chase out Landorus-T with ease, despite Weavile having a hard time switching in and all three potentially needing to brave Stealth Rock damage to do so. Ice-type coverage is everywhere in the tier, partially thanks to Landorus-T's prominence, so Hidden Power Ice from Tapu Koko and Zapdos, Ice Beam from Mega Latias and Magearna, and Ice Punch from Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile are all something to be very careful of.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Landorus-T's average Speed leaves it liable to being threatened out by strong attackers like Mega Medicham, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y if they are able to get in safely. Landorus-T can circumvent this vulnerability with Choice Scarf, however.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Landorus-T acts as a revenge killer with considerable defensive utility, being able to threaten out fast attackers like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko and clean up late-game with Earthquake. U-turn allows Landorus-T to build momentum as it forces out attackers, and it is an especially useful move to have when Choice-locked, as locking into the wrong move can give a free turn to foes. Stone Edge snipes the likes of Zapdos, non-Mega Charizard, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T. Explosion deals massive damage to neutral targets like Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T before bringing in a teammate for free with momentum. Hidden Power Ice hits opposing Landorus-T and prevents Gliscor from switching in safely. Punishment is a last-ditch defense against certain Calm Mind sweepers, switching in to revenge kill a set-up Mega Latias after three Calm Mind boosts, OHKO Reuniclus after four boosts, and deal huge damage to Cresselia after four boosts. Hidden Power Fire allows Landorus-T to consistently revenge kill Choice Band and Swords Dance Kartana. Defog allows Landorus-T to clear entry hazards in a pinch, further compressing roles for its team and supporting hazard-weak teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>64 Defense EVs let Landorus-T always survive +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock damage, and 208 Speed EVs give Landorus-T the jump on +1 Kommo-o, with the rest of the EVs pooled into attack. A more defensive spread of 32 HP / 128 Atk / 128 Def / 220 Spe ensures that Landorus-T survives a Flare Blitz from Jolly Mega Charizard X after Stealth Rock damage, outspeeds Adamant Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance, and dumps the remaining EVs into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The primary benefits of Choice Scarf Landorus-T are that it gives its team a great Speed tier and can revenge kill very fast attackers like Mega Alakazam, though it doesn't need to shy away from taking hits itself by any means. Landorus-T's bulk, helped by Intimidate, lets it switch into physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Choice Scarf Victini short-term, and its typing gives it opportunities to predict and switch into Volt Switch from the likes of Tapu Koko and Magearna and resisted attacks like Mega Alakazam's Focus Blast and Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick if it needs to, but it should be avoiding switching into these Pokemon often due to the high risk. Aim to use U-turn more often than not to bring in offensive teammates safely and mitigate the risk of handing over a dangerous free turn due to being Choice-locked. However, this can be detrimental when facing contact-punishing ability users like Zapdos and Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet users like opposing Landorus-T and Tornadus-T, so manually switching out would be better in those matchups.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T is perhaps the most versatile in regard to the team styles that it fits on, ranging from acting as an entry hazard control option on hyper offense teams to being a revenge killer and providing speed control for balance teams. On hyper offense teams, it would be paired with a dedicated lead, like Mew or Mega Diancie, that is tasked with both starting the game off with Stealth Rock and keeping off opposing hazards, reducing the risk of Landorus-T of killing its momentum with Defog. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B are prime candidates for Landorus-T's pivoting, as they can break holes in opposing teams that include Landorus-T's answers like Rotom-W and Zapdos. Heatran has useful resistances to both Ice and Fairy, letting it switch into the likes of Magearna and Tapu Koko to punish their attempts to predict Landorus-T; Heatran is additionally able to set Stealth Rock and take chunks out of Rotom-W. Bulky pivots like Magearna and Rotom-W work together with Landorus-T to continue the chain of momentum and can take the heat off of it in the face of threats like Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert, respectively. Defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn form a nice defensive backbone for Landorus-T on balance teams, switching into Ash-Greninja and setting hazards, while, in return, Landorus-T chases out the likes of Tapu Koko, Mega Alakazam, and Swords Dance Mega Charizard X. Calm Mind Mega Latias benefits from Landorus-T threatening Steel-types like Magearna, Jirachi, and Heatran and using U-turn to pivot it in on Pokemon that it can set up on, like Tapu Bulu, Rotom-W, and Zapdos.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Landorus-T generally prefers to use Stealth Rock over Defog by virtue of having very limited longevity, which doesn't mesh well with an ideal entry hazard removal option; however, it certainly can use Defog well, and the choice of whether to run Stealth Rock or Defog should be based on what fits the team better. It can even run both at once if necessary, letting it both set and clear hazards depending on the circumstance. Earthquake is an obvious choice to hit back at the likes of Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile while acting as a short-term check to them. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes opposing Landorus-T, hits Garchomp harder, and somewhat pressures Gliscor, but it generally shouldn't be used against anything without a 4x Ice weakness due to its low power. Toxic punishes defensive answers like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and opposing Landorus-T, as well as putting offensive Pokemon that might attempt to use Landorus-T as setup fodder, such as pre-Mega Charizard, Dragonite, and Hawlucha, on a timer. Fly should only ever be used alongside Flyinium Z, with Supersonic Skystrike allowing Landorus-T to take out an unsuspecting Hawlucha attempting to use it as setup fodder, as well as sniping Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Serperior and hitting neutral targets hard. Hidden Power Fire lets Landorus-T actually beat Kartana as opposed to just switching in to lower its attack and scout its move, with the added bonus of dealing extra damage against Mega Scizor. Knock Off is great against item-reliant Pokemon like Chansey, Celesteela, and Tapu Fini, and it prevents Gliscor from switching in safely before its Toxic Orb activates. U-turn is very important for generating momentum, with Landorus-T being able to both force switches and underspeed the likes of Gliscor and Kartana to bring in a teammate completely freely. Rock Tomb is a niche option that threatens Mega Charizard X before it Mega Evolves, negates the Speed boost from Dragon Dance, and prevents Hawlucha from setting up safely due to the Speed drop.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 Speed EVs ensure that Landorus-T outpaces Modest Heatran, with the remaining EVs put towards physical bulk. Maximum HP and Defense investment can also be used if Heatran is adequately covered by teammates, maximizing Landorus-T's physical bulk and letting it get the slower U-turn against standard Landorus-T sets and Gliscor. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves, most commonly U-turn from opposing Landorus-T and Mega Scizor and attacks from Kartana and Mega Medicham. Iapapa Berry gives Landorus-T some of the longevity it desires, giving it a second wind after trading HP with the likes of Mega Charizard X. Flyinium Z punishes Hawlucha and Grass-types like Serperior and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main benefit of defensive Landorus-T is that it can directly switch into physical attackers like Choice Scarf Kartana and Mega Lopunny and use its lower Speed to safely bring in a teammate with U-turn. Landorus-T can punish threatened Pokemon like Heatran by setting Stealth Rock for free as they switch out, and after it has already set them up or if it is more advantageous to do so, it can keep momentum going with U-turn after forcing a switch. When facing the likes of Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile, conserving Landorus-T's health is quite important due to the fine margins of these one-on-one interactions.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best used on offense and bulky offense teams, which benefit from its immediate bulk and aim for fast-paced games where Landorus-T's lack of longevity doesn't hold it back as much. It pairs great with other pivots like Magearna, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T, all of which are capable of generating momentum just like Landorus-T. Assault Vest Magearna acts as a blanket special check to complement Landorus-T's similar physically defensive capabilities, with its typing providing a useful resistance to Grass to help with Kartana and handling Ice-types like Weavile and Kyurem-B short-term. Rotom-W and Tornadus-T offer entry hazard removal, and Mega Medicham, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B are prime examples of wallbreaking teammates for Landorus-T to get in safely with U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Carrying Stealth Rock allows Landorus-T to compress roles for its team even in this offensive role, additionally giving it more usefulness in the face of roadblocks like Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Mega Latias. Furthermore, Landorus-T has an easier time getting Stealth Rock opportunities with this set due to Swords Dance letting it threaten out Mega Sableye and Gliscor and its Z-Move alone threatening out Tornadus-T. Substitute could be used instead of Stealth Rock if it's already fit elsewhere on the team, easing prediction in regard to Z-Move usage and blocking status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn. Swords Dance aids Landorus-T's wallbreaking, with its boosted STAB Earthquake and especially its Z-Moves reaching absurd heights. Earthquake complements either choice of Z-Move very well by hitting Steel-types, and it's just a good, consistent damage dealing option. Supersonic Skystrike blows through pretty much anything that doesn't resist it, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Continental Crush snipes common Flying-resistant checks like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Celesteela, being able to OHKO the last at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Excadrill and Speed tie with other Landorus-T. Flyinium Z and Rockium Z need to be used with Fly and Stone Edge, respectively, both bolstering Landorus-T's breaking power immensely.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This best way to use this set is to get in safely with pivoting support or after a sacrifice, with the goal being to set up a Swords Dance to flip the script against an incoming defensive answer like Tapu Bulu or Ferrothorn with Flyinium Z or others like Zapdos and Rotom-W with Rockium Z. Landorus-T can use these same free turns to set up Stealth Rock early in the game, which is especially useful if its defensive answers are still healthy. In the case of the Flyinium Z variant, Landorus-T only has one shot to hit Ground-immune Pokemon, so make sure that its target is in KO range if it isn't outright OHKOed, and be careful when the opponent has a low health Pokemon waiting to be sacrificed. Additionally, Flyinium Z Landorus-T's known downside of relying on its Z-Move to hit so many Pokemon gives opponents lots of reason to switch out against +2 Landorus-T to burn its Z-Move, so keep in mind that your opponent might bring in the likes of Heatran or Jirachi, Flying-resistant Pokemon weak to Ground, to waste Supersonic Skystrike. If Landorus-T's set hasn't been revealed, and it's still plausible that it's a defensive set, then it can surprise the likes of Tornadus-T with an immediate Z-Move rather than waiting to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is generally seen on offense teams, acting as the recipient of pivoting support rather than the pivot itself. Bulky pivots like Magearna and Rotom-W can get Landorus-T in safely and make up for its lack of bulk. Tornadus-T is another option that can support against Kartana and Mega Medicham and carries Defog. Ash-Greninja is one of the top beneficiaries of Landorus-T's removal of Tapu Bulu, and it creates a hazard-stacking core with its Spikes. Rockium Z variants remove key Flying-types in Zapdos and Celesteela, allowing Choice Scarf Kartana to go wild late-game. Weavile can Pursuit trap Mega Latias and can weaken the likes of Rotom-W and Skarmory. Tapu Koko is an offensive pivoting option that benefits from the removal of Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn and can pressure Landorus-T's defensive answers.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Landorus-T has a great toolkit for a lead Pokemon, making use of Focus Sash to set Stealth Rock consistently to start off a game with momentum for its hyper offense teammates. Earthquake is important for hitting Stealth Rock users like Heatran and lead Excadrill, as well as trading damage without committing to using Explosion. Rock Tomb is Landorus-T's specialized weapon against faster Defoggers, ensuring it's able to force Stealth Rock and chip down the likes of Tornadus-T and Zapdos. It additionally slows down fast threats like Tornadus-T and Mega Latias, allowing a previously slower teammate to revenge kill or set up on them easier. With Imprison, Landorus-T can actively block entry hazards from setters, notably Excadrill and opposing Landorus-T. Explosion spreads good damage to targets like Rotom-W and Mega Latias and lets a teammate come in safely with momentum the next turn. Additionally, it prevents Defog attempts from slower Pokemon on the turn it's used. Hidden Power Ice is an option to replace Imprison that gets valuable damage on Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T and puts Gliscor in range of Explosion the next turn. U-turn should only be run with Yache Berry, giving Landorus-T better utility mid-game rather than sacrificing itself with Explosion. Additionally, on sets featuring both Imprison and U-turn, Landorus-T can block opposing U-turn with Imprison.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature lets Landorus-T Speed tie with other maximum Speed Landorus-T, which is important for Imprison. Otherwise, the Speed is generally useful for Excadrill and more consistently hitting opposing Landorus-T with Explosion. If running Hidden Power Ice, a Naive nature should be used instead. Yache Berry allows Landorus-T to set Stealth Rock against Mega Medicham while still surviving Kyurem-B's Ice Beam and Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Hidden Power Ice. When running Yache Berry, a spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe should be used instead, as this set is tailored more towards having mid-game usage as well instead of using Explosion for momentum.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For the most part, this set's usage is quite linear. Prioritize setting Stealth Rock, even if Landorus-T must be sacrificed to do so. Imprison is always the play against slower Stealth Rock users like Ferrothorn and Excadrill; against faster dedicated leads like Mew and Diancie, it's better to either lead with a teammate that threatens them out instead if possible or to just attack them due to Mew outspeeding and using Taunt and Diancie potentially Mega Evolving. Faster Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Kartana should be met with Rock Tomb immediately, and if the opposing team isn't bothered by Stealth Rock, Landorus-T can even explode immediately to put the likes of Mega Latias and Pelipper out of commission. Another case where leading with Landorus-T should be reconsidered is against Taunt Serperior, which can prevent Stealth Rock from the get-go and is unfazed by Rock Tomb due to Contrary. Yache Berry lead Landorus-T variants do not share the sacrificial nature as Focus Sash variants, and it is often good to preserve Landorus-T for later in the game after setting Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is made for hyper offense teams, as they appreciate Landorus-T starting the game off well with Stealth Rock, with it generating useful momentum from the very start with its self-sacrifice and potentially preventing Stealth Rock with Imprison. Taunt support Serperior helps with entry hazard control, blocking hazards with Taunt and having the option to use Defog against defensive setters like Ferrothorn in a pinch to enable hazard-weak teammates. Examples of hazard-weak hyper offense teammates that appreciate Landorus-T stopping defensive Stealth Rock setters like Ferrothorn are Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Gyarados. The latter two are notable due to Landorus-T's proficiency at weakening the likes of Rotom-W and Zapdos with Explosion, making them easier to break through later on. Other setup sweepers like Mega Tyranitar and Dragonite are good fits for the hyper offense teams this set is seen on, and they can find early opportunities against Pokemon that Landorus-T slowed with Rock Tomb. Cresselia provides a good switch-in against Mega Medicham, an incredibly hostile lead matchup for Focus Sash Landorus-T, and can provide the team with Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance support. Kommo-o is a threatening setup sweeper with Clangorous Soulblaze, and it has the additional quality of soft-checking Ash-Greninja with its typing.</p>"

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem has an interesting niche thanks to its ability to PP stall several Pokemon with its useful combination of Substitute, Pressure, and Roost. Kyurem's typing and respectable bulk allow it to take advantage of some of the tier's premier walls, such as Toxapex and Chansey, and pivot into Choice-locked Kartana's Leaf Blade and Greninja's Hydro Pump. Its decent Special Attack stat and access to Ice- and Ground-type coverage let it hit a vast majority of the tier for neutral damage and threaten many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tornadus-T. However, Kyurem's mediocre base 95 Speed leaves more to be wished for in a metagame full of faster threats that can beat it, such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Medicham, and Kartana. Kyurem is also susceptible to every form of entry hazard and requires entry hazard control to perform its niche to its fullest potential. Moreover, Kyurem's ability to PP stall takes a big hit if it is inflicted with status, which is fairly common in the OU metagame, and its typing leaves it susceptible to the plethora of Steel-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon and moves that plague the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers can be used with to provide Kyurem more opportunities to use Substitute and reduce the amount of turns it needs to waste using Roost. Groundium Z is another option for a Z-Crystal that specializes in punishing Toxapex and Steel-types like Magearna and Jirachi, potentially KOing them after Earth Power the previous turn. Life Orb is a niche set that can be used to make the most of Kyurem's good Special Attack stat and strong coverage, making Earth Power significantly more threatening against Toxapex, and with these sets even tacking on Draco Meteor to obliterate neutral targets like Rotom-W and Manaphy and deal impressive damage overall, though, without Substitute, Kyurem struggles more against Chansey once its option to block status and waste Seismic Toss isn't around. Dragon Tail is a nice option to rack up entry hazard damage on the likes of Chansey and Mega Scizor coming into Kyurem, additionally phazing out Calm Mind Cresselia, though it's a niche option due to being a lot less useful against offensive teams and being hard to fit over other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Ash-Greninja, and Kartana can all pressure Kyurem with super effective coverage or STAB attacks but are forced to take a significant amount of damage if Kyurem is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although they can't directly switch into Kyurem's attacks, Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can both threaten Kyurem out with their Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Magearna can all beat Kyurem one-on-one, but they must be careful of getting worn down over time. Mega Scizor in particular can comfortably take any hit from Kyurem and threaten it out with Bullet Punch, which Kyurem is unable to PP stall.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Certain setup sweepers that don't mind Ice Beam or Earth Power, such as Volcarona and Mega Scizor, can set up on Kyurem with ease.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Fini</strong>: Tapu Fini can easily survive and gradually heal off any attack that Kyurem possesses and can threaten it out with its Fairy-type STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Roost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gains Kyurem free attacking turns against Pokemon that are incapable of breaking its Substitute with one attack, such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Rotom-W; it also eases prediction against certain cores that try to pivot around Kyurem like Heatran + Stone Edge Landorus-T. Once behind a Substitute, Kyurem is able to PP stall super effective moves with low PP, such as Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball and Tyranitar's Stone Edge. Ice Beam allows Kyurem to immediately threaten the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor and Zapdos, with Earth Power complementing it well by hitting Steel-types like Heatran and Magearna. Roost is crucial for keeping Kyurem healthy throughout the match while setting up Substitutes and taking entry hazard damage and for PP stalling foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Chansey from breaking them with Seismic Toss. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure Kyurem avoids the OHKO from Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast. Metronome pairs nicely with Substitute, allowing Kyurem to possibly muscle through defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Clefable, and most importantly Toxapex, which Kyurem would struggle to break through otherwise, thanks to the additional damage per turn. Icium Z lets Kyurem use Subzero Slammer, which is difficult to switch into offensively and defensively. Subzero Slammer is especially useful if Kyurem is behind a Substitute, OHKOing Pokemon that could otherwise stomach a hit and force it out like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, and Clefable. Leftovers is an acceptable alternative to potentially give Kyurem more opportunities to use Substitute throughout the game, but it misses out on the additional power that Metronome and Icium Z provide.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem's priority should be to set up a Substitute against Pokemon that it forces out or Pokemon that can't break its Substitute, such as Slowbro and Toxapex or that it threatens out, like Gliscor and Zapdos. Once behind a Substitute, Kyurem's combination of Pressure, Roost, and respectable bulk should be utilized to deplete opposing Pokemon of their PP. Some notable examples include Celesteela and Clefable, as these can be PP stalled out of Heavy Slam and Moonblast, respectively, leaving them incredibly passive if they choose to stay in and try to beat Kyurem one-on-one. Try to keep Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off of the field to keep Kyurem as healthy as possible and maximize its ability to switch into Pokemon it can beat like Toxapex and Zapdos. Leech Seed and status conditions, especially paralysis and poison, hinder Kyurem's ability to PP stall foes, so try not to switch into status-inducing moves and prioritize getting behind a Substitute against status spreaders like Toxapex.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers, such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T, are vital to prevent Kyurem from being worn down over time. Defensive Landorus-T pairs nicely with Kyurem because draws in great targets like Tapu Bulu and Zapdos that Kyurem can take advantage of, using U-turn to bring in Kyurem safely with momentum, and it can also help against physical threats that can threaten Kyurem like Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X. Kyurem greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes support to wear down the opposing team over time and make its job of stalling foes out easier. Toxapex is a phenomenal partner, as it can set up Toxic Spikes of its own and absorb opposing ones while helping check Pokemon that trouble Kyurem like Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Ash-Greninja. Magearna, specifically Shift Gear and Calm Mind variants, makes for a good teammate, as it can take advantage of teams that have been weakened by Kyurem to have an easier time sweeping late-game. Magearna also appreciates Kyurem's ability to pressure opposing Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Magearna, and Heatran. Similarly, threatening wallbreakers like Mega Mawile and Mega Alakazam appreciate the pressure that Kyurem exerts on the Steel-types mentioned earlier and are difficult for offensive teams that can pressure Kyurem to switch into. Magnezone can trap and potentially remove annoying Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Celesteela for Kyurem.</p>"

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting some of the most absurd base stats in the tier, a devastating signature move to power up with Icium Z, and a wealth of useful coverage moves like Fusion Bolt, Kyurem-B was already destined to be one of the best wallbreakers around. With the dual threat of a maximum-power Subzero Slammer and Fusion Bolt, very little can stand up to Kyurem-B defensively, and it's a big contributing factor to the importance of defensive Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi to stave it off. Its natural bulk is rather immense, letting it find easy entry against Zapdos and Gliscor and trade blows with the likes of Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Kartana. However, Kyurem-B relies on its Z-Crystal for a large part of its offensive prowess, with raw Freeze Shock being unreliable due to its charge time and Ice Beam not packing nearly as much power, meaning that after Subzero Slammer is used, Kyurem-B can be handled by the likes of Clefable and Chansey with relative ease. Its base 95 Speed isn't lightning fast, so there's no short supply of revenge killers like Mega Medicham and Choice Band Kartana that can show it the door.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb is nice for focusing on Kyurem-B's mixed offensive prowess, boosting its other attacks like Fusion Bolt and Earth Power in exchange for losing its one-time Ice-type nuke by dropping Icium Z. Hidden Power Fire is a nice option for this set to pressure Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, and Roost is important to offset the Life Orb recoil damage, but all of Earth Power, Hidden Power Fire, and Roost cannot be viably fit at once. This set doesn't see consistent use because one of Kyurem-B's main draws is its immense immediate breaking power with Subzero Slammer, and alongside Stealth Rock, it gets worn down very quickly. Choice Band is an intriguing item choice that lets Kyurem-B cut through nearly any Pokemon with proper prediction, with an OHKO on Toxapex and 2HKO on Heatran and Magearna with Adamant Fusion Bolt. Outrage can be used on this set to fill in for Freeze Shock's absurd power, with only bulky Dragon-resistant Pokemon avoiding the 2HKO from it, and Iron Head can be used to smash Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is the closest thing to a perfect Kyurem-B counter, resisting Ice, having the bulk to shrug off most of anything else Kyurem-B has to throw out, and being able to heal the damage off with Roost afterwards. Even worse, it has priority Bullet Punch that threatens to 2HKO Kyurem-B back. Jirachi is similarly irritating due to how it can heal off chip damage with Wish, and Magearna can threaten out Kyurem-B with an OHKO from Fleur Cannon and semi-reliably stay healthy with Pain Split. The last two aren't as comfortable with Kyurem-B when Electric Terrain is up, however, as Kyurem-B is then a hair away from 2HKOing them with Fusion Bolt. Ferrothorn is able to wall Kyurem-B quite consistently after it uses up its Z-Move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Faster, powerful attackers like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Choice Band Kartana can take advantage of Kyurem-B's average Speed to force it out, threatening an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Status</strong>: Kyurem-B is liable to being chipped down rapidly by entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, and Toxic can enable the likes of Toxapex and Slowbro to handle Kyurem-B by spamming their recovery moves to stall out poison turns. Burn is even more ruinous for Kyurem-B, as it neuters its stronger attacking stat, meaning it by no means has safe entry against the likes of Rotom-W and Toxapex.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Despite its huge drawback of needing to charge up for a turn, Freeze Shock is used for its insane Base Power that lets Subzero Slammer hit the maximum Base Power for a Z-Move. Though its primary use is with Icium Z, crucially skipping the charge turn, it still packs a punch if it can be pulled off safely via prediction or against a passive Pokemon, and it has a nasty paralysis chance to boot. Fusion Bolt is the perfect complement to Kyurem's Ice-type attacks, pressuring Water-types like Toxapex and chipping away at neutral targets like Magearna and Heatran as they come in. Kyurem-B even has a good Special Attack stat to wield Ice Beam with, granting it a consistent Ice-type attack to hit easy targets like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Gliscor without burning up its Z-Crystal. Roost is useful for healing off entry hazard damage and giving Kyurem-B some longevity for taking on the likes of Zapdos and Choice-locked Ash-Greninja. Substitute both eases prediction and prevents desperate status counterplay from the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, even guarding it from revenge killers if it's fortunate enough to keep the Substitute after claiming a KO. Additionally, it can provide a turn of protection while charging up Freeze Shock. Earth Power is another option that benefits from Kyurem-B's mixed offensive prowess, and it's best used for hitting Heatran and Mega Mawile for 2HKOs and pressuring Rotom-W in a comparable way. Hone Claws strikes fear into defensive teams that had hoped to stall or otherwise switch around Kyurem-B, punishing passive play like nothing else.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Naive and Hasty natures are useful for Speed tying with Pokemon with base 95 Speed like Tapu Lele and opposing Kyurem-B as well as outspeeding Kommo-o, though a Lonely or Naughty nature can feasibly be run when the aforementioned threats are already handled well for a general power boost, with benefits including a confirmed 2HKO against non-Leftovers Slowbro with Fusion Bolt and better odds to OHKO Ferrothorn with Subzero Slammer. The Naive and Naughty natures leave Kyurem-B's Defense as is, which is helpful against the likes of Landorus-T, Mega Charizard X, and Kartana, though the Hasty and Lonely natures are better for taking hits from special attackers like Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Fini. Kyurem-B can also run a bulkier EV spread very well because its base Attack is so high that it doesn't necessitate full investment in order to be a strong wallbreaker, giving its Roost sets much more defensive utility in the face of the likes of Protean Greninja and letting it make trades against Mega Diancie and Mega Charizard Y. An EV spread of 248 HP / 116 Atk / 32 SpD / 112 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Kyurem-B to outspeed Modest Heatran and survive Moonblast from Mega Diancie, with the rest pooled into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-B has the bulk to be thrown at its ideal targets like defensive Landorus-T and Zapdos and is adept at cracking holes early-game, being able to significantly weaken the likes of Magearna and Heatran if not claiming a KO outright. Save your Z-Move until it can either grab a KO or otherwise get lots of value, as it's preferable to hold onto the threat of Subzero Slammer as long as possible to keep the likes of Clefable and Ferrothorn uneasy. Kyurem-B can pepper the likes of Magearna and Heatran with Fusion Bolt or Earth Power as they come in, though when facing Mega Scizor, its presence makes wallbreaking attempts somewhat of a lost cause until it's worn down enough or removed. Kyurem-B has a superb matchup against rain teams, being a great lead against Pelipper to either claim a KO immediately or otherwise start punching holes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most of the time, Kyurem-B is fit onto offense and bulky offense teams, tasked with breaking open holes for fast cleaners and benefiting from free entry opportunities gifted by its pivoting teammates. Choice Scarf Kartana and Mega Lopunny are examples of fast threats that can balance out Kyurem-B's average Speed, with Kyurem-B clearing a path for them by taking chunks out of Magearna and Rotom-W and actively hunting down Landorus-T and Zapdos for them. Tapu Koko boosts Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt to worrying levels of power, being able to OHKO specially defensive Toxapex when using an Attack-boosting nature and 2HKOing Magearna. Weavile shares quite a few checks with Kyurem-B, such as Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and the aforementioned Magearna, so they work well together to menace and overwhelm these Pokemon. Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain is wonderfully synergistic, as it guards Kyurem-B against nasty status attempts from Scald or Toxic from Toxapex and Slowbro and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, letting Kyurem-B come in safely. Mega Diancie provides useful entry hazard control with Magic Bounce and appreciates Kyurem-B blowing past the likes of Celesteela and Ferrothorn and chipping at shared annoyances in Jirachi and Mega Scizor. Landorus-T, Magearna, and Tapu Koko can provide useful pivoting support to bring Kyurem-B in against ideal targets like Zapdos and Chansey.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo's solid Special Attack and Speed stat allow it to function as a solid balance breaker in the OU tier. A Water / Fighting typing in conjunction with solid bulk for an offensive Pokemon allows Keldeo to check threatening Water-, Fire-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Weavile. Keldeo's STAB Secret Sword also allows it to bypass traditional checks to special attacking Water-types such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, not all shines for Keldeo, as numerous Pokemon such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tapu Fini are all hard counters to most Keldeo sets. Keldeo also lacks any powerful coverage options and is forced to rely on weaker moves such as Hidden Power and Icy Wind.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind + 3 Attack set with Hyper Beam and Normalium Z allows Keldeo to not only boost its Special Attack but to blow through traditional counters such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini with a powerful Breakneck Blitz as well. This set has only one attempt to get off its Z-Move, though, and it is very weak without a boost. Choice Scarf can be used to pressure normally faster Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Volcarona, but is very mediocre at accomplishing anything else, because of the popularity of bulky Grass-types and Toxapex. Toxic, while undesirable to be Choice locked into, can be useful for chipping away at Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Slowbro that take little damage from any of Keldeo's attacks but despise status ailments.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Mantine, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro all resist Keldeo's STAB attacks and can either status Keldeo or hit it super effectively with their STAB attacks. Though, do note that Toxapex, Mantine, and non-Psyshock Slowbro can lose to Taunt variants.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth all take little damage from any attack Keldeo can throw at it and in turn can hit Keldeo super effectively with STAB Grass-type attacks. Tapu Bulu also resists Keldeo's STAB moves, but has to be wary of being burnt by Scald and a Choice Specs Hydro Pump or Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Kartana, Mega Alakazam, Mega Diancie, and Tornadus-T can all outspeed Keldeo and OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind in conjunction with Substitute allows Keldeo to set up repeatedly on passive foes like Chansey and Celesteela, meaning it can easily break through bulkier teams. It also stops them from draining Keldeo's health with Toxic and Leech Seed. Keldeo can break past Toxapex with burn and hazards long-term, making Substitute a better choice overall compared to Taunt, which aims to break past Toxapex immediately by setting up on it and blowing it back with the combination of Waterium Z and Hydro Pump. Scald is Keldeo's most spammable move and is used instead of Hydro Pump for its reliability and higher PP on Substitute sets, as well as its burn chance. This allows Keldeo to annoy common cores such as Heatran + Tapu Bulu. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to beat Chansey and pressure Assault Vest variants of Tangrowth and Magearna while letting it beat other Pokemon that resist or are immune to Scald such as Ferrothorn, Ash-Greninja, Kyurem-B, and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers heals chip damage from defensive foes that have been Taunted such as Scald from Toxapex and Heavy Slam from Celesteela, allowing Keldeo to set up more Calm Mind boosts and beat bulky teams with a bit more ease. It also provides Keldeo with longevity so that it can switch into the likes of Heatran and Ash-Greninja more safely.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against more offensive teams, Keldeo can be switched into resisted attacks from foes that it forces out such as Heatran, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Tyranitar. Scald should be spammed early-game to fish for burns on the likes of Tapu Bulu, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias. Keldeo should only attempt to set up once its checks have been weakened or removed. Taunt should be used before setting up against Pokemon that can use Toxic such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Chansey, as a poison status can prevent Keldeo from beating bulky teams effectively. Keldeo can be used to beat a lot of stall teams on its own, but it should first be brought in via an aggressive switch, as most Pokemon used on this playstyle will be able to poison or burn Keldeo or Knock Off its Leftovers before it can start setting up. Keldeo also has to be wary of physically defensive Tangrowth, Unaware Clefable, and Heart Swap Magearna on these teams, as they can tank its attacks and force it out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo struggles to beat Mega Latios and Mega Latias, so Pursuit trappers that are able to remove them such as Tyranitar and Weavile make useful partners. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Keldeo's job a lot easier. Hazard setters like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar are able to keep up hazards for most of the game. Powerful wallbreakers like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Rockium Z Garchomp form strong offensive cores with Keldeo. The latter two can also force in and weaken Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini that give Keldeo a hard time, while the former can take advantage of bulky Grass-types that Keldeo forces in. Keldeo can act as a check to Ash-Greninja and Heatran, but it gets worn down quickly, so other checks to these Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tapu Bulu, or Garchomp and Mega Latias, respectively, are needed. Bulky Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can take even a boosted attack from Keldeo and force it out, so a reliable switch-in to these Pokemon such as Tornadus-T or Mega Scizor is a useful partner. Bulky Steel-types such as Celesteela and defensive variants of Magearna are able to take on Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Bulu that give Keldeo a hard time. They also provide a secondary soft check to Ash-Greninja.</p>"

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ash-Greninja</h3> <p>Ash-Greninja remains a prominent offensive Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its great Special Attack, fantastic STAB combination, and high Speed that allows it to outrun even Tapu Koko and Weavile once transformed. Water Shuriken allows it to pick off weakened setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Shift Gear Magearna and faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Mega Alakazam. Spikes allows it to punish and wear down its checks over time, allowing Ash-Greninja to have an easier time grabbing KOs. However, despite its upsides and ability to match up well against offense, Ash-Greninja struggles against bulkier cores utilizing Pokemon such as Chansey and Toxapex, often just being used to set up Spikes for its teammates. Its fragility also leaves it prone to priority moves such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out, as well as preventing it from pivoting in consistently throughout a battle.</p> <h3>Greninja</h3> <p>Greninja, courtesy of its stellar Speed tier and amazing ability in Protean, is one of the OverUsed metagame's premier offensive threats, as it is more than capable of pressuring both faster, offensively inclined teams and bulkier builds. Its expansive movepool is a major contributing factor to its potency as an offensive force as well: because it has such a high number of move options, it can circumvent would-be counters and defensive checks and leave one's opponent guessing at Team Preview. Additionally, Greninja is one of the few viable offensively inclined user of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which it is a stellar user of. Greninja only truly falls short when it comes to bulk, which renders it incapable of taking even resisted hits repeatedly, and the inability to run every coverage move on one set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ash-Greninja</h4> <p>Ash-Greninja does not have many other viable options, as Spikes is far superior to other last move options. However, if Spikes is already present on the team, Ash-Greninja can opt to run Ice Beam to more immediately threaten Tapu Bulu, Dragonite, and Kommo-o. U-turn allows Ash-Greninja to maintain momentum for its team and pairs well with other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele, which are able to take advantage of common switch-ins to Ash-Greninja like Chansey and Toxapex. Both Hydro Pump and Surf can be used together on rain teams.</p> <h4>Greninja</h4> <p>Hidden Power Electric is an option on regular Greninja to hit Gyarados and Mantine. Z-Happy Hour Greninja can serve as a threatening sweeper, but it suffers from lack of viability because of Greninja's frailty and lack of coverage when using it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ash-Greninja</h4> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey doesn't care for any of Greninja's attacks thanks to its amazing bulk; however, it can be pressured with Spikes and double switches to chip away due at it to its lack of passive recovery. Assault Vest Magearna's bulk allows it to take on Greninja, and it can force Greninja out and gain momentum through Volt Switch. However, it lacks reliable recovery and is vulnerable to Spikes, meaning that it can be overwhelmed over time by repeated Choice Specs Hydro Pump hits.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Hydro Pump and isn't 2HKOed by Dark Pulse, meaning that it can make progress with Leech Seed or set up entry hazards. Tapu Bulu resists both of Greninja's STAB attacks and can force it out with Wood Hammer or Horn Leach. However, both Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu can get worn down by hazards, which allows Greninja to break through them later. Tapu Bulu can also be surprised by coverage moves such as Ice Beam and Gunk Shot. Mega Venusaur can withstand Greninja's moves without fearing Ice Beam thanks to Thick Fat and can force it out with the threat of Giga Drain or force progress against Greninja's team with Knock Off. Though it's worth noting that Mega Venusaur's Synthesis doesn't fare well against the rain that Greninja may be paired with.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex's bulk allows it to take on Greninja's STAB attacks and force progress by setting up Toxic Spikes; however, it doesn't resist Dark Pulse and lacks an immediate way to threaten Greninja, meaning that Greninja can fish for Dark Pulse flinches. Tapu Fini is a fantastic answer to Ash-Greninja due to resisting both of its STAB attacks, threatening it out with Moonblast and being able to immediately use Defog to remove any Spikes layers Greninja tries to set up. However, it lacks reliable recovery, so it can be worn down, especially if it has to rely on teammates to remove entry hazards. Seismitoad and Gastrodon don't resist Dark Pulse, but they're immune to Hydro Pump thanks to Water Absorb and Storm Drain, respectively, and can pressure Greninja with an Earthquake or Toxic. Keldeo and Mega Gyarados both resist Greninja's STAB attacks, and Keldeo can threaten it out with Secret Sword, while Mega Gyarados can set up on it with Dragon Dance. However, all of these Pokemon are grounded and take hazard damage. While uncommon, Mantine's typing and bulk allow it to safely switch into Greninja, and it is immune to Hydro Pump thanks to Water Absorb, is unaffected by Spikes, and can remove Greninja's Spikes with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kommo-o can take on Greninja thanks to its typing and force it out with its Fighting-type STAB attacks, giving itself an opportunity to set entry hazards or set up with Dragon Dance or Clangorous Soulblaze. Hydreigon's resists and can take Greninja's STAB attacks, can heal off any damage with Roost, and is immune to Greninja's Spikes. Bulky variants of both Kyurem and Kyurem-B can soft-check Greninja with their bulk; Kyurem-B can immediately threaten it out with Fusion Bolt, while Kyurem can set up Substitute; however, they are very hazard-weak and can be flinched down with Dark Pulse. While niche, Mega Altaria's typing grants it resistances to both of Greninja's STAB attacks, and it can threaten Greninja out with Pixilate Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Alakazam, and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana and Tapu Lele can all outspeed Greninja even after it transforms and OHKO it due to its frailty. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is notable in that it's the only faster Pokemon in the tier that can safely revenge kill Greninja without fearing Water Shuriken's due to Psychic Terrain. However, apart from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, all of these Pokemon are prone to getting revenge killed by Water Shuriken if they're in range.</p> <h4>Greninja</h4> <p><strong>Set-dependent Switch-ins</strong>: Greninja has no true, guaranteed switch-ins because of its expansive movepool. Given that it is limited to four moveslots, it can be countered or checked defensively if Greninja is not carrying the appropriate moveset or move. Toxapex and Mega Venusaur can wall Greninja if it lacks Extrasensory; Chansey can wall Greninja if it is not physically based and running Low Kick; Ferrothorn is a good answer for those lacking Hidden Power Fire; and Gastrodon will completely stop those lacking Hidden Power Grass. Assault Vest Magearna avoids the 2HKO from most of Greninja's moves, but it should be wary of Z-Dig variants and is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery. Keldeo, while prone to residual wear and chip damage, can irritate Greninja lacking Extrasensory. Alomomola's massive HP stat allows it to avoid the 2HKO from a majority of its coverage moves, fearing only the rare Hidden Power Grass and Electric.</p> <p><strong>Naturally Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile all outpace Greninja and can threaten it depending on its current typing. Mega Alakazam is particularly annoying due to how it can steal Protean with Trace and become even more threatening. Priority users like Mega Pinsir, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham can also pick off Greninja if it's weakened enough.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Battle Bond": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is favored due to its being Greninja's strongest viable STAB attack. Alternatively, Surf trades power for more consistency and PP. Dark Pulse gives Greninja perfect neutral coverage against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon. Additionally, Dark Pulse also comes with a chance to flinch, allowing Greninja to fish for it on weakened non-Dark-resistant checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Water Shuriken becomes one of the strongest priority moves when Greninja is transformed and allows Greninja to check faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Sand Rush Excadrill, and boosted Volcarona. Spikes allows Greninja to wear down and punish checks in the long run such as Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, and Kommo-o as well as support its teammates in games where it will struggle to make progress.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs maximizes Greninja's power and gives it the extra power to activate Battle Bond. However, Waterium Z allows Greninja to use a one-time Hydro Vortex to power through Pokemon such as Celesteela and Tornadus-T and allowing it to crucially switch moves. A Timid nature is used to allow Greninja to outspeed Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko after transformation.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Greninja's main purpose is to KO a foe to activate Battle Bond and act as a powerful cleaner thanks to its great stats once transforming. Playing Greninja aggressively, especially if it's carrying Choice Specs, is most recommended to get the most out of Greninja's effectiveness as a wallbreaker due to it still having just enough power even prior to transformation. Predicting switches, such as against Pokemon that Greninja forces out like Heatran and Gliscor, helps Greninja pick up KOs on weakened foes more easily or support offensive partners. Against bulkier teams where Greninja can struggle to make progress, setting Spikes should always be prioritized. Good switching as well as VoltTurn support helps out Greninja immensely, since its very frail and can't switch in very easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ash-Greninja fits best on offense and balance teams. Pivots such as Tapu Koko and Assault Vest Magearna can get Ash-Greninja in safely. Tornadus-T and Mega Scizor can also pivot Ash-Greninja in safely while being able to check Grass-types. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Kyurem-B can let Ash-Greninja clean more easily and enjoy the Spikes support that Ash-Greninja provides. Offensive Stealth Rock users such as Garchomp and Landorus-T can help support Ash-Greninja, since they can pressure checks such as Toxapex and Magearna. Cleaners such as Choice Scarf Victini and Mega Lopunny appreciate the extra offensive pressure that Ash-Greninja's Spikes provide, and they checks with Ash-Greninja. Ferrothorn resists Electric and Grass and provides Stealth Rock. Pelipper provides rain and can pivot Ash-Greninja in safely with U-turn. Other teammates alongside Pelipper such as Mega Swampert and Manaphy are great teammates, as they can help overwhelm defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Chansey, and Mega Swampert can also set entry hazards for Ash-Greninja. Toxapex and Clefable resist Fighting and can support Ash-Greninja with Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively. Bulkier wincons on balance teams such as Calm Mind Mega Latias and Swords Dance Gliscor appreciate Ash-Greninja's Spikes support and its ability to pressure checks such as Heatran and Mega Latias.</p>"

      "Physical Protean": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>When paired with Groundium Z, Dig allows Greninja to remove two very prevalent checks to Ash-Greninja that it lures in, Assault Vest Magearna and Toxapex, additionally hitting other Pokemon out of reach of Greninja's coverage, like Heatran. Low Kick in combination with Fightinium Z targets the likes of Ferrothorn and Chansey, KOing them after small prior chip damage while also dealing good damage to switch-ins like Magearna and Celesteela. Greninja can also add U-turn to its kit, dealing notable damage to neutral targets and synergizing well with Spikes. Ice Beam gives Greninja solid special coverage that nails Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Latios. Gunk Shot takes advantage of the likes of Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu being lured in assuming they are dealing with Ash-Greninja, only for Gunk Shot to permanently remove them. Greninja can also take advantage of Poisonium Z, giving it a powerful hit that upgrades Gunk Shot's 2HKO on Tapu Fini into an OHKO and hits Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Rotom-W hard neutrally. Spikes lets Greninja punish the opposing team long-term, which is useful against defensive checks like Ferrothorn and Gastrodon that are vulnerable to Spikes. Toxic Spikes can punish grounded threats like Mega Medicham, opposing Greninja, and Tapu Lele hard, and Greninja can remove Toxapex with Groundium Z to maintain them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Groundium Z allows Greninja to remove Toxapex and Assault Vest Magearna, two common Ash-Greninja checks; Dig should never be used without it. Fightinium Z is used similarly, targeting Chansey and Ferrothorn instead, additionally maintaining the ability to hit Heatran and Tyranitar. Life Orb lets Greninja generally hit harder without using a Z-Crystal, increasing the potency of its coverage. Poisonium Z solidifies Greninja's matchup against Fairy-types and continues to let it hit neutral targets like Kyurem-B and Tornadus-T hard, and, as Gunk Shot is already a move that is being run, Greninja gains a free moveslot over Groundium Z and Fightinium Z variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Ash-Greninja's reputation forces quite direct responses to Greninja, many opponents are aware of the possibility of Tectonic Rage and scout accordingly, even more so after Greninja reveals itself to have Protean rather than Battle Bond. Try to get Greninja in front of Pokemon like Landorus-T that both it and Ash-Greninja threaten, and play it very offensively utilizing the switches it forces; attempt to read incoming Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu with Gunk Shot, Assault Vest Magearna and Toxapex with Tectonic Rage, or Chansey and Ferrothorn with All-Out Pummeling. Greninja can also use its own offensive pressure to set Spikes, wearing down the opposing team indirectly instead and safely making progress regardless of the opposing team. Greninja is most effective early-game before its set is revealed, so try to get it in early-game with pivot moves like U-turn and Volt Switch or via a double switch so it can make the most of the opponent's uncertainty.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, luring in defensive Pokemon and removing them to benefit itself and its offensive teammates. Volcarona sets without a Z-Move appreciate Greninja, as they benefit from both the Groundium Z variant removing Toxapex and the Fightinium Z variant removing Chansey. Greninja struggles to switch directly into hits, so pivots like Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Magearna can help it get onto the field safely. Tapu Lele appreciates the removal of Jirachi and Magearna via Tectonic Rage, and in return, it sets Psychic Terrain to prevent the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham from pestering Greninja with strong priority moves. As mentioned previously, Spikes can assist cleaners like Choice Scarf Kartana and Landorus-T and wallbreakers like Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile, wearing down defensive answers and punishing switches.</p>"

      "Special Protean": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump hits the hardest neutrally and threatens Fire-types like Heatran, Victini, and Volcarona that would otherwise wall or set up on Greninja. It can additionally be powered up by Waterium Z into Hydro Vortex, becoming an incredibly strong neutral hit that OHKOes Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile, as well as Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam can be used instead to hit Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos harder and threaten Dragon-types like Garchomp, Mega Latias, and Kommo-o; however, dropping Hydro Pump makes Greninja vulnerable to the aforementioned Fire-types, especially Heatran, as it resists Greninja's coverage moves. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini, which are common checks to Ash-Greninja, as well as Grass-types like Serperior. Ice Beam can be used over Gunk Shot, giving Greninja the aforementioned benefits without replacing Hydro Pump and thus making it vulnerable to Fire-types. Hidden Power Fire allows Greninja to threaten Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, additionally giving it resistances to Grass and Bug—helpful against Ferrothorn's Power Whip and Mega Scizor's U-turn, respectively—as well as Fairy, which helps it more safely chip away at Magearna. Extrasensory threatens Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur and, in conjunction with Life Orb, 2HKOes Toxapex, preventing it from switching in safely; however, it has a very limited amount of uses otherwise and is usually only seen on teams with Psychic Terrain support, meaning Hidden Power Fire is generally preferred. Grass Knot allows Greninja to hit the likes of Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Spikes allows Greninja to support its team with entry hazards and wear down its own checks, like Toxapex and Chansey, while additionally giving it a valuable immunity to Electric. Toxic Spikes can be used instead to punish teams lacking a Poison-type, with targets like Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Mega Swampert being ideal, although the prevalence of Toxapex harshly reduces its consistency. U-turn can be used to gain momentum, mostly being suited for teams that either already have Spikes or don't want them due to preferring to keep entry hazards off of the field.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z gives Greninja a strong attack that can finish off chipped neutral targets when necessary, although Life Orb can be used if you would prefer to fit a Z-Crystal on one of Greninja's teammates or if it isn't running Hydro Pump. Sets lacking Gunk Shot should use a Timid nature instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to how much set versatility Greninja has, it has a tendency to land unexpected damage, such as against Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn switching in expecting an Ash-Greninja only to be punished by Gunk Shot and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Protean can be used defensively against slower Pokemon, gifting Greninja with new resistances in place of its base typing's weaknesses; make sure to get the most out of this by making plays like using Hidden Power Fire to resist an incoming Fleur Cannon from Magearna or using Spikes to block Volt Switch. In matchups where Greninja faces a hard counter, like Toxapex or Chansey, focus on setting Spikes; Greninja can often successfully sacrifice its own HP to reach three layers of Spikes, severely reducing opposing counterplay to itself and its teammates. Greninja can use its offensive presence to become a devastating momentum tool with U-turn, pairing with other pivots to keep up pressure on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Greninja is suited best for offense and bulky offense teams, harassing common defensive Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn while supporting teammates with entry hazards. Mega Mawile greatly appreciates Greninja's Spikes wearing down the likes of Heatran, Magearna, and Toxapex; in return, it can break holes in the opposing team for Greninja to clean up late-game. Tapu Lele similarly appreciates Spikes weakening Steel-types like the aforementioned Heatran and Magearna as well as others like Jirachi, and it can increase the potency of Greninja's Extrasensory by setting Psychic Terrain. Pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Magearna, and Tornadus-T can assist in getting the frail Greninja onto the field; Landorus-T can additionally set Stealth Rock, synergizing with Greninja's Spikes. Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Landorus-T appreciate Greninja's Spikes setting the stage for them to clean up; in a similar vein, wallbreakers like Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile, which easily force switches, also appreciate Spikes support.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide allows Greninja to revenge kill dangerous offensive sweepers such as Volcarona and Gyarados. U-turn is a great move to gain momentum on the Pokemon that Greninja naturally threatens, such as Landorus-T and Heatran. Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus-T and Garchomp and hits Zapdos harder than any other move on the set. Gunk Shot is preferred in the last slot to hit Tangrowth, as well as OHKOing Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele and 2HKOing Tapu Fini. Another option is Low Kick, which OHKOes both regular and Mega Tyranitar, as well as netting coverage against Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone. Spikes is also an option, as Greninja's high Speed usually allows it to get up a layer of Spikes in most games. Hydro Pump is an alternate option that gets boosted by rain, is Greninja's strongest viable option against Shift Gear Magearna, and has decent neutral coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed investment allows Greninja to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Hasty is the preferred nature to maximize Ice Beam's damage output while letting Greninja handle opposing Ash-Greninja, though Naive can be used to improve Greninja's ability to handle other priority moves. The given Special Attack EVs are to OHKO Kartana with Ice Beam, and the remaining EVs are put into Attack. Protean gives Greninja STAB on every move that it uses and makes it an effective revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hard switching Greninja into attacks is not recommended, as it's very frail and gets worn down easily from entry hazards. Choice Scarf Greninja is best used as a revenge killer of boosting Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gyarados. While Greninja can't actually switch into any boosting Pokemon, it can revenge kill them with the appropriate coverage move. U-turn is often a solid move to use against the Pokemon that it naturally forces out, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, so use it often to gain momentum. Use Gunk Shot and Ice Beam on targets such as Tangrowth and Zapdos, which usually check Greninja, that might be lured in; if running it, use Low Kick against Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Greninja set can't do much to walls such as Chansey and Skarmory; as such, strong wallbreakers that can advantage of the momentum and free switches that U-turn provides, such as Swords Dance Landorus-T, Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, and Hoopa-U, make for good teammates. Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn that appreciate Greninja's ability to revenge kill setup sweepers also make for good teammates, as they're setup bait for Volcarona and, to a lesser extent, Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados. Choice Scarf Greninja also appreciates defensive Pokemon that can make up for its lackluster defenses, so Pokemon such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and Landorus-T also make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<p>Diggersby isn't necessarily a bad wallbreaker; in fact, it's actually quite difficult to switch into. Its main issue, however, is that it faces immense competition from other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and even Hoopa-U. Diggersby's below average Speed stat and subpar defensive typing leave it very vulnerable to common offensive threats such as Greninja, Kartana, and Kyurem-B. Its mediocre bulk is also problematic because anything it fails to OHKO will most likely deal a heavy amount of damage to it, so it will often be dead weight against offensive teams. Overall, Diggersby has almost nothing to distinguish itself from the plethora of other wallbreakers in the tier, and there's just very little reason to use it over something else.</p>",
    "sets": {"Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Quick Attack lets Diggersby threaten weakened offensive threats such as Tornadus-T and Greninja. Spikes provide great team support and help Diggersby wallbreak more effectively throughout the game by softening up Pokemon that may try to pivot into it, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Tangrowth. Diggersby can force a decent amount of switches against bulkier teams, so it should have plenty of opportunities to lay Spikes down, giving it a slight niche over other wallbreakers. Alternatively, Fire Punch provides valuable coverage against Celesteela which resists both of its STAB moves, as well as OHKOes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana. Foul Play is boosted by Huge Power, so it's also an option for dealing solid neutral damage to most of the tier, although it provides no real coverage.</p>"}},

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Diancie is a superb Pokemon in OU thanks to its solid Speed and attacking stats, STAB combination, coverage moves, support movepool, and Magic Bounce ability. Mega Diancie's typing and ability allow it to set up Stealth Rock in the face of entry hazard control options such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos and force out Mega Sableye with Moonblast. Additionally, the combination of Substitute and Endeavor allows it to shine as one of the most consistent leads for hyper offense teams, as Magic Bounce allows it one turn to set up Stealth Rock and deny hazards before going down. Mega Diancie's typing also lets it check troublesome Fire-types such as Volcarona and Victini in a pinch. Diancie also has the option to delay Mega Evolving so that it can make use of its better bulk to more easily handle attacks from Pokemon like Heatran. However, Mega Diancie is burdened with a poor HP stat, and its typing leaves it riddled with a crippling 4x weakness to Steel, as well as weaknesses to common offensive types such as Ground, Water, and Grass. Additionally, it is outpaced and immediately threatened by common Pokemon such as Greninja, Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Landorus-T. Offensive Mega Diancie also cannot fit all of the coverage and utility options it wants into one set, while the lead variant must choose between Diamond Storm to threaten Volcarona, both Mega Charizard formes, and Calm Mind Tapu Koko or Moonblast to threaten Dragon-types and Mega Sableye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nature Power is an option on offensive Mega Diancie if it is paired with Tapu Bulu or Tapu Koko, granting it a coverage option to let it bait in and wipe out bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Seismitoad with Energy Ball or 2HKO Celesteela and Toxapex with Thunderbolt, respectively. However, it is less consistent than its other coverage options and takes up a moveslot. Explosion can be used on lead variants to deny any attempts at removing Stealth Rock with Defog or Rapid Spin, provide offensive momentum for its teammates, and act as a surprise factor against Toxapex and Chansey. However, it is less consistent for longer games and forces Mega Diancie to ditch Substitute and Endeavor, leaving it without an option to weaken Heatran and Magearna. Mega Diancie can also make use of Heal Bell to provide cleric support for teammates such as Volcarona, Serperior, and Kartana. However, this forces it to give up a consistent utility option such as Protect, leaving it without an option to scout for potential Z-Moves and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor can switch into Mega Diancie depending on its coverage and moveset and threaten it with an OHKO. However, the latter two must beware of Hidden Power Fire, while Magearna must be wary of the Substitute + Endeavor variant. Jirachi also deserves a mention because it can threaten Mega Diancie with an immediate OHKO, survives Earth Power from the offensive set, and can potentially outplay the lead variant thanks to Wish + Protect.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Toxapex don't take much damage from Mega Diancie's STAB combination and can force it out in return. However, Toxapex must be wary of Earth Power from the offensive variant, while all three of them must watch out for Substitute + Endeavor from the lead variant. Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert in the rain outspeed Mega Diancie and threaten it with an OHKO with their super effective STAB moves, but they cannot afford to switch into it directly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Excadrill is perhaps the Ground-type that Mega Diancie should most definitely be wary of because it resists both STAB options, uses Rapid Spin to get rid of Stealth Rock, and threatens it with an OHKO in return. Sand Rush variants under the sand can outspeed it, while Mold Breaker variants can bypass Magic Bounce to set up Stealth Rock, with specially defensive variants even being able to survive Earth Power from full HP. Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Swampert can also threaten Mega Diancie with Earthquake should they get an opportunity to switch in safely. The former two, however, must watch out for Hidden Power Ice. On top of this, setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dragon Dance Kommo-o commonly carry Earthquake, allowing them to break through Mega Diancie with ease.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types such as Serperior and Choice Scarf Kartana outspeed and threaten Mega Diancie with an OHKO. However, they cannot repeatedly come into Mega Diancie's attacks. Additionally, bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn can switch into Mega Diancie's attacks, with the latter resisting both STAB options, and force it out with their super effective STAB moves. Ferrothorn must watch out for Hidden Power Fire, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana and Landorus-T outpace Mega Diancie and deal heavy damage to it, especially after it Mega Evolves. Mega Diancie's crippling Steel weakness also leaves it vulnerable to revenge killing attempts from Mega Medicham's Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Chansey and Cresselia don't take much from Mega Diancie's attacks and can stall out its Diamond Storm PP with their recovery moves. Calm Mind variants of Cresselia can also use offensive sets as setup fodder. However, neither of them enjoys being worn down by the Substitute + Endeavor variant.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Diancie's high Speed, solid attacking stats, and Magic Bounce allow it to scare out Pokemon like Zapdos and Mega Latias to set up Stealth Rock. If one of Mega Diancie's teammates runs Stealth Rock, it will allow room to run Protect to safely Mega Evolve and scout potential Z-Moves like Magearna's Twinkle Tackle and Choice-locked Pokemon like Kartana and Landorus-T. Moonblast blows through Dragon-types like Garchomp, Kyurem-B, Kommo-o, and Dragonite and threatens Mega Sableye, which blocks entry hazards via its own Magic Bounce. Diamond Storm smashes Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona, both Mega Charizard formes, and Tornadus-T and chips the likes of Chansey and Celesteela. Earth Power threatens Heatran, Toxapex, and Magearna. Hidden Power Ice snipes Gliscor and Landorus-T. Finally, Hidden Power Fire punishes Steel-types that attempt to switch in to force Mega Diancie out, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Hasty nature is chosen instead of Naive so that Diancie can make use of its special bulk to more easily handle special attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. If Mega Diancie forgoes Diamond Storm, a Timid nature should be used instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to Mega Diancie's solid matchup against common Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, as well as Gliscor and Landorus-T if it carries Hidden Power Ice, it can set up Stealth Rock and discourage them from attempting to remove Stealth Rock. After Diancie Mega Evolves, it can also discourage Gliscor and Landorus-T from attempting to set up their own Stealth Rock. If Mega Diancie is facing a stall team, it can be used in the lead position to discourage Mega Sableye from attempting to block Stealth Rock with its own Magic Bounce, allowing Mega Diancie a free opportunity to set them up. If Mega Diancie is facing a Pokemon that it easily scares out, it can use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or use its coverage options to punish predicted switch-ins, such as Earth Power for Magearna and Hidden Power Fire for Mega Scizor. Due to Mega Diancie's crippling weakness to Steel, Hidden Power Fire must be used as Mega Scizor switches in or on a risky prediction because Mega Scizor can immediately force Mega Diancie out with Bullet Punch. Diancie can also potentially hold off on Mega Evolving, as it can make use of its better bulk in scenarios where its Speed stat after Mega Evolving isn't needed. Most notably, it can use that bulk to trade damage against setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona and set up Stealth Rock against the likes of Victini and Tornadus-T if you value its HP over Magic Bounce. If Mega Diancie runs Protect, it can use the opportunity to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon such as Kartana, Landorus-T, and Greninja and act accordingly. Mega Diancie can often be used in the lead position and use Protect immediately against Pokemon that attempt to anti-lead against it, such as Ferrothorn and Landorus-T, as this can discourage them from attempting to set up entry hazards freely. After Mega Diancie uses Protect, it can then switch out against a predicted attack. This is in contrast to the Stealth Rock variant, which requires an opportune time to activate Magic Bounce, as Mega Diancie's frailty makes it difficult to freely set up Stealth Rock or attack unless it is facing a Pokemon that doesn't threaten it, such as Tornadus-T. Do not hesitate to make an aggressive switch to deny hazards if you are willing to take the risk, since this can be a deciding factor between a win and a loss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Diancie set functions best on offense and bulky offense teams, which value its role compression of a Stealth Rock setter, wallbreaker, and entry hazard blocker. Grass-types like Serperior, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu can threaten bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Serperior can provide paralysis support with Glare to cripple faster targets like Mega Alakazam and can lure in and threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire should Mega Diancie run a different coverage move, such as Earth Power. Choice Scarf variants of Kartana benefit from Mega Diancie breaking through physical walls like Zapdos and defensive Landorus-T, and they can revenge kill faster targets such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko, while Choice Band and Swords Dance sets heavily pressure shared checks like defensive Magearna. Additionally, Kartana can use Knock Off to remove items such as Leftovers from Celesteela and Ferrothorn, making it easier to overwhelm them with repeated attacks. Serperior and Kartana also appreciate Mega Diancie keeping Stealth Rock up against Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Tapu Bulu can extend Mega Diancie's longevity thanks to Grassy Terrain. Pivot support from teammates like Zapdos, Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T is also beneficial, as they can grant a free entry with Volt Switch and U-turn. Heatran provides a solid answer to Steel-types like Magearna and Celesteela and can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Mega Diancie more room to run Protect. Magnezone can trap and remove Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor, taking some pressure off of Mega Diancie and allowing it to run Earth Power or Hidden Power Ice over Hidden Power Fire more easily. Wallbreakers like Victini, Kyurem-B, and Weavile benefit from Mega Diancie's ability to block hazards, letting them blow through shared checks like Tapu Fini and Celesteela. Volcarona also appreciates Mega Diancie keeping Stealth Rock off the field, allowing it to set up Quiver Dance more freely. Tapu Lele helps soften the opposing team to allow Mega Diancie to clean up later in the game, and it protects it from priority moves such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Medicham. Tapu Fini protects Mega Diancie's teammates from status attempts thanks to Misty Terrain, provides a solid answer to Ash-Greninja, and utilizes Taunt + Nature's Madness to break past bulkier teams. If Mega Diancie runs Stealth Rock, it can form a powerful hazard-stacking core with Greninja thanks to its Spikes support. Additionally, Greninja has the benefit of luring in and wiping out Tapu Fini with Gunk Shot and Magearna with Tectonic Rage and threatening Gliscor and Landorus-T with Ice Beam, allowing Mega Diancie to more easily run Hidden Power Fire over Earth Power and Hidden Power Ice. Dragonite and Thundurus-T also benefit from Mega Diancie keeping hazards off the field, as this allows them to set up more safely without being bothered by Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Endeavor": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is designed to make use of Mega Diancie's status as an offensive Magic Bounce user to create one of the most consistent leads for hyper offense teams. Other leads like Taunt Mew and Imprison Landorus-T need to actively spend a turn to prevent opposing entry hazards, whereas Mega Diancie can focus on setting Stealth Rock thanks to Magic Bounce. The combination of Substitute and Endeavor, coupled with its great Speed, allows Mega Diancie to go above and beyond just hazard control and become a significant threat in its own right. Substitute lets Diancie damage itself at a consistent pace, putting its health as low as possible to maximize the effectiveness of Endeavor. This allows Diancie to threaten even its own checks, like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn, with prompt removal, aiding teammates that may struggle with them. Diamond Storm is a strong STAB option that threatens fast Calm Mind users like Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam, which would otherwise bulldoze past a lot of hyper offense teams, as well as hitting Rock-weak threats like Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes super effectively and Fairy-resistant foes like Celesteela and Toxapex neutrally. Moonblast can threaten out Fairy-weak Pokemon like Garchomp and Mega Sableye, the latter of which would otherwise prevent Diancie's Stealth Rock via its own Magic Bounce, additionally hitting physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T harder and having significantly more PP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs maximize Mega Diancie overall bulk while letting it use Substitute four times from full health and end up at 1 HP afterwards to maximize Endeavor damage; this investment also lets Mega Diancie survive three Seismic Tosses from Chansey and for base Diancie to survive an Earthquake from offensive Landorus-T. Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Diancie to outspeed Kartana and Speed tie with Mega Latias and opposing Mega Diancie. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to give non-Mega Diancie the best chance to survive strong physical attacks like Kartana's Leaf Blade. The nature used depends on Diancie’s choice of coverage; run Jolly for Diamond Storm and Timid for Moonblast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The most important thing to consider when leading off with Diancie is if and when you should Mega Evolve it. The choice between the bulk of non-Mega Diancie and the high Speed of Mega Diancie is yours to make based on the opposing lead, creating an incredibly long list of Pokemon that Diancie can effectively lead off against. The threat of Mega Evolution is usually enough to dissuade opposing leads from attempting to set Stealth Rock, opening up more possibilities for Diancie as a lead. It is often safer to hold off on Mega Evolving when facing Landorus-T, as non-Mega Diancie always survives a Jolly Earthquake from it, and Mega Diancie is outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf variants. The same logic applies on a wider scale in terms of taking as little damage as possible by utilizing the better defensive stats of non-Mega Diancie in cases where the superior Speed of Mega Diancie isn't needed; a good example of this is using Substitute against Rotom-W or Magearna before Mega Evolving, as Diancie doesn't need to Mega Evolve to outspeed them and can use the extra special bulk to prevent Volt Switch from breaking its Substitute. After Diancie sets Stealth Rock, it can Mega Evolve to become faster than the opposing Pokemon and repeatedly set up Substitute safely or use Endeavor straight away if it has been severely damaged by the likes of Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is perfect for hyper offense teams, especially ones that make use of setup sweepers that are crippled by Stealth Rock, such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite. Despite how good Mega Diancie is at preventing opposing entry hazards, it still appreciates a backup hazard removal option like Serperior or Choice Scarf Landorus-T in case it gets KOed or Mold Breaker Excadrill bypasses Magic Bounce. As Ash-Greninja can threaten out Diancie in the lead matchup, it's necessary to bring a check to it that fits on the hyper offense playstyle, like Kommo-o, Tapu Fini, or Breloom. Calm Mind Magearna shares checks like Gastrodon and Jirachi with offensive Mega Diancie, so it appreciates how Diancie can lure them in and take them out of commission with Endeavor.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the tier due to its incredible offensive stats and typing that allow it to threaten a majority of defensive and balanced teams with its STAB moves and great coverage. Its high Special Defense stat also allows it to check the likes of Mega Latias and Mega Alakazam from full health, although Hoopa-U should not be used as a primary check to these special attackers. On the flipside, its middling Speed stat, despite being good for a wallbreaker of its caliber, leaves it at the mercy of a number of faster offensive threats in the metagame such as Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Tapu Lele. It also carries poor physical bulk along with a 4x weakness to one of the strongest momentum-gaining moves in the game, U-turn, meaning that Hoopa-U tends to get overwhelmed by the likes of U-turn Tornadus-T, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf helps patch up Hoopa-U's subpar Speed stat, improving its matchup against the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, and Kartana. However, without Choice Band or offensive Z-Moves, Hoopa-U will have a much more difficult time wallbreaking defensive structures. Assault Vest elevates Hoopa-U's already good special bulk, allowing it to soft check the likes of Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios. On physically oriented Hoopa-U variants, Knock Off is a safe progress-making option that punishes common Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Magearna, though it's not useful against Mega Evolutions like Mega Mawile and Mega Scizor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster physical threats such as Kartana, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard X are all able to OHKO Hoopa-U due to its low physical bulk. Faster U-turn users, even ones with no investment in Attack, such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and specially oriented Tapu Koko, are even more noteworthy, since they will force Hoopa-U out and always gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Magearna and Mega Mawile are able to switch in on both of Hoopa-U's STAB moves and force it out with their Fairy-type moves, but they can be beaten with coverage such as Fire Punch on Choice Band variants or Fighting-type moves like Focus Blast, especially when they're boosted into All-Out Pummeling. Tapu Fini and Clefable do not mind taking Hoopa-U's Dark-type STAB move and retaliating back with Moonblast, but they have to be careful about a potential Gunk Shot and Psychic-type STAB moves. Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie outspeed Hoopa-U and threaten an OHKO with Moonblast as well, though they are much less consistent switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can switch in on Hoopa-U's STAB moves and threaten it back with Stone Edge and Knock Off, respectively. Moreover, they can punish Hoopa-U even further with Pursuit, which is made even easier by the Defense drop from Hyperspace Fury and a potential Choice item to lock Hoopa-U into its move. However, relevant Dark-types need to be aware of Hoopa-U's potential Fighting-type coverage.</p>",

Ice Punch smashes Landorus-T, even after an Intimidate, and threatens out Gliscor after Hoopa-U is revealed to be faster. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that resist Hyperspace Fury like Tapu Fini, Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Bulu. Fire Punch lets Hoopa-U hit targets such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Magearna, and Mega Mawile for super effective damage. Finally, Drain Punch can be used to hit Tyranitar, which resists Hoopa-U's other moves, and allows Hoopa-U to heal off residual damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Hoopa-U's damage output, while a Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Timid Heatran. Alternatively, Hoopa-U can run 32 HP EVs to always survive 2 Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam at full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Hoopa-U's poor Defense stat, it can find difficulty switching in safely, especially against physical attackers. Therefore, the best scenarios to bring Hoopa-U in safely are through aggressive switches, getting assistance from Volt Switch and U-turn, and after a teammate is KOed. Since this set relies on physical attacks instead of special attacks, Hoopa-U can't switch into Scald from the likes of Toxapex and Slowbro because its damage output will be reduced if it gets burned. Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's most spammable move due to it being the most immediate STAB option. If Hoopa-U is facing a Pokemon that it can easily force out it can use its coverage moves for predicted switch-ins, such as using Gunk Shot as Tapu Fini comes in expecting Hyperspace Fury. Be careful not to lock into Hyperspace Fury or Zen Headbutt if the opposing team has a Tyranitar or Weavile because they can punish Hoopa-U with Pursuit thanks to its poor Defense stat, the Defense drop from Hyperspace Fury, and their immunity to Zen Headbutt. Hoopa-U must also be wary of U-turn from faster Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor; even without any Attack investment, they can still OHKO it with U-turn thanks to its typing and poor Defense stat, and if it switches out, they can find easy opportunities to bring in a Pokemon that can threaten its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Hoopa-U shines best on bulky offense teams, where it is tasked with punching holes for faster cleaners and appreciates the free entry provided by its pivoting teammates. Prominent examples of such teammates are Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, Magearna, and Tapu Koko, as they can bring Hoopa-U in safely with U-turn and Volt Switch. Magearna can also use its typing to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Weavile. Heatran sets up Stealth Rock and checks Fairy-types that can revenge kill Hoopa-U, such as Tapu Lele. Since Hoopa-U is very vulnerable to U-turn and Volt Switch, partners such as Zapdos and Rocky Helmet Landorus-T are also appreciated, as they can punish U-turn with Static and chip damage, respectively, and in the case of Landorus-T, block Volt Switch with its typing. Tapu Fini provides support with Misty Terrain, allowing Hoopa-U to switch into Scald without the risk of getting burned. Mega Lopunny is also a great partner, as it appreciates Hoopa-U handling bulkier Pokemon that it struggles with such as Clefable, Slowbro, and Cresselia. In return, Mega Lopunny deals with fast-paced teams, which can give Hoopa-U a lot of trouble. Choice Scarf Kartana is a strong cleaning option that benefits from Hoopa-U breaking through opposing physical walls like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Skarmory. Tapu Lele can provide Psychic Terrain to block priority moves like Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and boost the power of Zen Headbutt. Entry hazard removal is also appreciated, so Hoopa-U enjoys pairing with Rapid Spin Excadrill and Defoggers like Gliscor, Zapdos, and Rotom-W. The latter two can also bring Hoopa-U in safely via Volt Switch, while Gliscor blocks Volt Switch thanks to its typing.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot gives Hoopa-U the ability to beat most of its checks and, overall, greatly threaten any kind of defensive structure. Dark Pulse is Hoopa-U's best special Dark-type STAB move, with the added bonus of occasionally making foes flinch, giving a potential backdoor against every Pokemon slower than Hoopa-U. Its improved version, Black Hole Eclipse, is a powerful nuke to OHKO common defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Scizor. Psychic is a solid secondary STAB move that nicely complements Dark Pulse, allowing Hoopa-U to threaten many Dark-resistant Pokemon, such as Kommo-o and Tapu Fini, while hitting Toxapex much harder. Psyshock, while weaker than Psychic, helps Hoopa-U to beat the likes of Chansey more easily, which is especially helpful on variants not running Fightinium Z. Finally, Focus Blast, with its accuracy patched for one time thanks to Fightinium Z, covers the few Pokemon that withstand Hoopa-U's STAB moves, such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Mawile, and Magearna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 HP EVs ensure Hoopa-U always takes two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam from full health. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Timid nature lets Hoopa-U outspeed Timid Heatran and Jolly Tapu Bulu. A Modest nature can be used to secure the OHKO on Chansey at +2 with All-Out Pummeling and have a better roll to OHKO Gliscor at +2 with Dark Pulse while still being able to outspeed Modest Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hoopa-U needs to remain relatively healthy in order to trade more easily with its checks and, first and foremost, wallbreak. Therefore, an extensive usage of pivoting moves, such as U-turn and Volt Switch, is recommended in order to conserve its HP. Ideally, Hoopa-U should be brought in on passive defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and defensive Kommo-o, that offer Hoopa-U opportunities to set up with Nasty Plot and soften the opposing team with its STAB moves. The decision of whether to attack or set up depends on the opposing team's structure. In general, it is better to spam attacks versus offensive teams, due to them having a multitude of ways to revenge kill Hoopa-U, whereas setting up Nasty Plot versus defensive teams has a higher chance to score several KOs. Finally, knowing when to trigger Hoopa-U's Z-Move is an important aspect of the Pokemon. Conserving it to keep the threat of Hoopa-U beating one of its checks is essential for Hoopa-U to pressure the opposing team and open up its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hoopa-U fits best on offense, bulky offense, and balance teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and can give it proper support. Pivoting teammates are greatly appreciated to provide Hoopa-U more opportunities to get in safely and wallbreak. Mega Scizor and Magearna are strong answers to Fairy-types. Rocky Helmet users, such as Landorus-T and Zapdos, force the opponent to think twice when it comes to clicking U-turn against Hoopa-U; Rocky Helmet Garchomp fits this category minus access to pivoting moves. Zapdos is especially good in that role, since Static can slow down most users of U-turn, meaning they are no longer able to outspeed and threaten Hoopa-U. Tapu Koko is a noteworthy partner that serves both as a late-game cleaner, appreciating Hoopa-U's wallbreaking ability, and as an offensive pivot, helping Hoopa-U to get on the field safely. Finally, utility pivots such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Rotom-W provide Defog to avoid chip damage from entry hazards on Hoopa-U. In terms of offensive partners, Tapu Lele forms an unstoppable core with Hoopa-U for any defensive teams, combining to overload Steel-types incredibly quickly. Additionally, Tapu Lele both boosts the power of Hoopa-U's Psychic and protects it from Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch with Psychic Terrain. Mega Medicham has similar synergy at the cost of using the Mega Evolution slot. Keldeo likes Hoopa-U's ability to wear down Tapu Fini and pressure Mega Latias, while Keldeo provides resistance to U-turn and Dark-type moves. Cleaners that struggle against bulkier structures, including Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, love Hoopa-U's favorable matchup against these teams. Victini is another Choice Scarf user that fits this category but with the added bonus of having an answer to Fairy-types, access to U-turn, and the potential to snipe Hoopa-U's checks with Final Gambit. When it comes to defensive partners, Heatran puts both a 4x resistance to Fairy- and Bug-type attacks and Stealth Rock on the table to support Hoopa-U's wallbreaking. Tapu Fini is a solid answer to offensive Dark-types such as Weavile and Ash-Greninja, and it helps Hoopa-U switch into walls using Scald and status moves more easily thanks to Misty Terrain.</p>"

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion's unique typing and decent well-rounded stats give it a niche in the tier, with its defensive utility including forcing out Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran and proving useful against Water-types like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Fini, and Manaphy. Its ability also provides free entry and recovery from Scald from the likes of Toxapex and Slowbro. Its signature move, Steam Eruption, is like Scald on steroids, and the burn chance often makes Volcanion quite unpleasant to switch into even for solid defensive answers. However, it doesn't have the offensive prowess to justify its low Speed, so it finds itself walled by common defensive Pokemon like Mega Latias, Toxapex, and especially Chansey. It has some incredibly frustrating weaknesses in Rock, Ground, and Electric, the first one punishing Volcanion with the omnipresent Stealth Rock and the last two being common offensive types. It also has no reliable recovery, so its defensive value comes from immediate bulk rather than longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<p>Other Options</p> <p>=============</p> <p>On bulky offense and balance teams, Volcanion can run a defensive Leftovers set with a spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 40 SpD / 44 Spe and a Bold nature, making use of Roar to phaze setup Pokemon like Volcarona and Clefable and rack up entry hazard damage, with Roar being especially useful against hyper offense teams by dragging in the hazard-weak Mega Charizard X and Unburden Hawlucha at inopportune times, and Protect to more consistently recoup health. 40 Special Defense EVs allow Volcanion to survive +1 Thunderbolt from non-Modest Magearna, and the Speed EVs allow Volcanion to hit the same benchmark of outspeeding uninvested Mega Scizor, leaving the remaining EVs to be dumped into physical bulk to better handle the likes of Hawlucha and Mega Medicham in a pinch. Volcanion can make use of Substitute to dodge status attempts from the likes of Toxapex and Clefable and ease prediction against offense teams, though it has a difficult time cleanly breaking through the likes of Chansey and Mega Latias.</p> <p>Checks and Counters</p> <p>===================</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Seismitoad and Gastrodon are able to completely neutralize Volcanion's Steam Eruption and threaten it out with their Ground-type STAB attacks or status moves. Rotom-W is able to take Volcanion's attacks and chip it down with Volt Switch or, even worse, Gigavolt Havoc from offensive sets. Toxapex is able to wall Volcanion for the most part, able to threaten it with Toxic, lay down infuriating Toxic Spikes, and even remove its item with Knock Off. Tapu Fini is able to defensively handle non-Sludge Bomb sets, threatening to cut Volcanion down to size with Nature's Madness or remove its item with Knock Off, though it's unable to threaten Volcanion back if it lacks both of these moves.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Mega Latias and Mega Latios are able to handle Volcanion's dual STAB combination and either set up on it with Calm Mind or whittle it down with attacks while staying healthy, though Sludge Bomb hits neutrally and can poison them as they come in. Hydreigon is another good answer to Volcanion, shrugging off its attacks and threatening it back with its own Earth Power while staying healthy with Roost. Kommo-o is another Pokemon unaffected by Volcanion's attacking power, even being able to use Bulletproof to block ​Sludge Bomb, though it hates having to risk burn from Steam Eruption, throttling its capability offensively and dooming the longevity of Leftovers sets.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Though none switch in directly, Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Thundurus-T, and Zapdos can threaten Volcanion using their STAB attacks​. Other users of Electric-type attacks, like Thunder Mega Latias, Thunderbolt Magearna, and Bolt Strike Victini, are something Volcanion would prefer to avoid, the latter two being Pokemon that Volcanion would otherwise wall.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: As a grounded Rock-weak Pokemon, Volcanion does not have it easy in the realm of entry hazards. Spikes are frustrating, Stealth Rock is horrible, and Toxic Spikes are completely ruinous, meaning that Volcanion requires strong hazard control lest it get chipped down quickly. Knock Off is generally annoying, but even more so to Leftovers variants that can't otherwise heal. Toxic from the likes of Toxapex, Slowbro, and Gastrodon completely is devastating for Volcanion and prevents it from doing its job.</p>",

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption is a very spammable move, being powerful in its own right and threatening out Fire-types like Volcarona while also bugging answers like Mega Latias and Toxapex with burn. Flamethrower punishes Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, which are generally unable to hit Volcanion back meaningfully. Sludge Bomb hits Tapu Fini, an otherwise check that is unaffected by Steam Eruption's burn chance, and is an even better option against Mega Latias and Clefable. Explosion is a big neutral hit capable of KOing Volcanion's checks and counters and at lower percentages, and it makes sure that Volcanion will always find value even in the face of hard counters like Chansey, allowing it to cleanly trade itself off late-game when facing offensive teams. Superpower can be used to keep a little bit of pressure against Chansey switching in without committing to Explosion, and it is additionally useful against Greninja and Hydreigon. Earth Power can be used to threaten Heatran harder and chip away at incoming Toxapex.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The physical bulk investment allows Volcanion to survive Fake Out followed by High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham. 28 Special Attack EVs ensure that Volcanion OHKOes uninvested Mega Pinsir with Flamethrower. 128 Speed EVs with a Relaxed nature allow Volcanion to outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor, though the Speed EVs can be dropped to 4 instead if this benchmark isn't required, instead letting Volcanion outspeed ​Sassy Celesteela and putting the rest of the EVs into its attacking stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volcanion gets a lot of mileage out of its resistances to Fire, Fairy, and Ice, helpful against ​Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran, Fairy-types like Magearna and Tapu Fini, and Choice-locked Weavile's Icicle Crash and Protean Greninja's Ice Beam. Its immunity to Water is wonderful to have against Manaphy and switching into Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, with its very presence discouraging the use of their Water-type attacks; however, Volcanion does not want to be a team's primary check to Greninja, but rather a secondary answer to its Water-type STAB attacks that defensively complements other checks to it like Ferrothorn and Magearna. Entry hazard control is a priority due to Volcanion's Stealth Rock weakness being exacerbated by the complete lack of recovery on this set, as unnecessary damage takes away from its ability to face off with the likes of Choice Scarf Kartana, Choice Specs Greninja, and Mega Alakazam one-on-one.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volcanion's defensive presence is built for offense teams that plan to see the game out quickly with offensive pressure, meaning that its lack of longevity isn't as much of a problem. Tapu Bulu brings a useful resistance to Dark, and its Grassy Terrain greatly assists Volcanion with passive recovery, as well as helping it take Earthquake better. Mega Diancie is a great teammate, as it not only draws in Steel-types and can scout Ash-Greninja's attack with Protect, but it has the obvious upside of Magic Bounce to make it more difficult for Stealth Rock setters. Additionally, Defoggers like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T are necessary when using Volcanion due to how weak it is to every hazard. The aforementioned Tornadus-T can add to this with Taunt, providing further counterplay against hazards. Pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T and Tapu Koko is a natural addition to offensive structures, and they can bring in Volcanion unscathed and in prime position to make trades.</p>"

  "Ribombee": {
    "overview": "<p>Ribombee carves itself a niche in the tier by its ability to reliably set Sticky Web for offensive teams. Its fantastic Speed and ability Shield Dust let Ribombee overcome common anti-leads, as it is faster than Mega Medicham and can't flinch from Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. It also has some nice utility in Stun Spore and is less passive than other suicide leads thanks to a passable Special Attack stat, a strong STAB move in Moonblast, and the ability to boost in Quiver Dance. Despite this, Ribombee can still be underwhelming, as it lacks power if opting for Stun Spore over Quiver Dance and otherwise struggles with common Pokemon such as Heatran and Tornadus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ribombee has a number of utility moves at its disposal, such as Toxic, Tailwind, Defog, and U-turn; however, it is almost impossible to fit them on the set without making it less effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types that aren't 4x weak to Hidden Power Fire such as Heatran, Celesteela, Magearna, and Excadrill are issues for Ribombee, as they can threaten it with their STAB moves and take little damage from Ribombee. Heatran and Excadrill get a special mention, as Heatran is immune to Hidden Power Fire thanks to Flash Fire and can set up Stealth Rock and Excadrill can Rapid Spin away Ribombee's Sticky Web. However, they are all annoyed by Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types that resist both of Ribombee's attacks like the aforementioned Heatran, Volcarona, and Victini are huge problems for it, as they too take very little damage from Ribombee and can OHKO it with their STAB moves. Similarly to Steel-types, though, they do not appreciate being paralyzed by Stun Spore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web lowers the Speed of all opposing grounded Pokemon by one stage, rendering the majority of revenge killers unable to successfully remove sweepers and making a lot of offensive Pokemon much harder to deal with if the opposing team aims to keep faster foes in check that way. Moonblast is Ribombee's most powerful and accurate Fairy-type STAB move, hitting Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny. Hidden Power Fire deals heavy damage to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, particularly the latter two, which are often major issues for the offensive teams Ribombee finds itself on. Stun Spore is used to cripple Pokemon that Ribombee would otherwise not pose a major threat to, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T, and against setup sweepers that could cause you problems. Quiver Dance can instead be used, allowing Ribombee to become much more threatening and therefore successfully set up Sticky Web against Defog users such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Mew.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment in tandem with a Timid nature allows Ribombee to outspeed a number of notable Pokemon, such as Greninja and Tornadus-T. Maximum Special Attack investment gives Ribombee as much offensive presence as possible. Focus Sash is used to guarantee that Ribombee is able to set up Sticky Web. Shield Dust is Ribombee's best ability, as it allows it to ignore potential annoying secondary effects from moves such as freezes from Ice Beam, burns from Flamethrower, and flinches from Fake Out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ribombee is fairly straightforward to use; in most situations, you should send out Ribombee turn one and set up Sticky Web. When facing setup sweepers or Speed-boosting sweepers such as Shift Gear Magearna, Gyarados, and Blacephalon, you should prioritize using Stun Spore to ensure Ribombee can outspeed and KO them so they do not sweep your team. If opting to use Quiver Dance, it is best to use it in situations where the foe cannot deal much damage to Ribombee, such as against defensive Landorus-T and non-Gyro Ball Ferrothorn, or to threaten Defoggers such as Zapdos and Mew. In some cases, it is a good idea to keep Ribombee alive, even if it's at 1 HP, as its Speed can be very useful in revenge killing Pokemon like Greninja and non-Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ribombee is only used on very offensive teams that appreciate the speed control that Sticky Web provides. Thus, Pokemon like Focus Sash Excadrill and Greninja are good partners, as they can form deadly entry hazard stacking cores on these kinds of teams. Strong wallbreakers with middling Speed stats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard X are great partners, as they appreciate the speed control from Sticky Web. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Magearna, Gyarados, Blacephalon, and Manaphy are solid teammates, since they too benefit from Sticky Web by making it harder to revenge kill them. Because Sticky Web is absolutely paramount to the success of the teams that utilize it, Defog deterrents such as Serperior and Bisharp are very useful.</p>"

  "Toxapex": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxapex is unlike its fellow contenders for the best Pokemon in the tier; what it lacks in set diversity and flashy options, it makes up with its sheer streamlined efficiency in soaking up attacks from huge threats and sinisterly tiring out the opposing team with its bag of tricks. Its defensive stats are gargantuan, and the longevity that it gets from Regenerator is absurd; babysitting threats like Ash-Greninja, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona is second nature to it. It's bulky enough to dare opposing pivots like Magearna and Rotom-W to tickle it with Volt Switch while it spreads status easier than hot butter. Being both the best Toxic Spikes setter and by far the most splashable Poison-type in the tier means that if you are interested in not losing to Toxic Spikes or would like to inflict them yourself, you typically have to go through Toxapex. It's very hard to justify not using this behemoth on anything south of offense. However, as many tricks as it may have, it is still just like your average starfish; it is very slow, can hardly lift an arm to deal any significant damage, and is stuck to the ground in ways that wallbreakers like Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill can appreciate. It isn't able to stop apex predators like Mega Alakazam, Swords Dance Gliscor, and defensive Heatran from finding easy entry on it, and there are plenty of other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, and Kyurem-B that it needs to step aside from if they're able to get in unscathed. Lastly, although Toxapex has a plethora of useful options, it can only run four of them at once, so it can be difficult to fit everything you want on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Infestation allows Toxapex to trap greedy Pokemon like Chansey and Slowbro, spread chip damage to poison-immune Pokemon like Mega Mawile, and prevent opposing double switches thanks to the trapping effect. Block is a longer-term version that skips the chip damage in order to ensure that a passive adversary can be choked out over a long period of time. It can be coupled with Spite to improve its efficiency at this, allowing Toxapex to burn out opposing Toxapex and utility Clefable and live to tell the tale. Blizzard paired with Icium Z is an off-beat option to snipe Gliscor that additionally removes the need to fish for a Scald burn against Landorus-T and Garchomp. Gunk Shot with Poisonium Z is a similar idea that takes a heavy chunk out of each of the guardian deities, OHKOing each of them but Tapu Fini. Z-Liquidation is an option for Toxapex to hit Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Tyranitar on their comparatively weaker Defense stat. Eject Button is an option for more offensive builds that mitigates Toxapex's drain on momentum by allowing it to reverse opposing pivot moves like U-turn, heal off the damage with Regenerator, and bring in a teammate for free. On stall teams, Toxapex can even afford to drop Recover to fit an extra utility move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type Coverage</strong>: Top of the pile is Mega Alakazam, which not only can punch through Toxapex with ease but also has Magic Guard before Mega Evolving and Trace to copy Toxapex's Regenerator after Mega Evolving, so there are very little circumstances where it is scared of switching into Toxapex directly. Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele are two absurdly strong wallbreakers that can OHKO Toxapex outright, though they don't have complete freedom in switching in due to Toxapex's threat of status with Scald, Toxic, and Toxic Spikes, and they can be put on a timer by Payapa Berry variants of Toxapex. Lower down on this list is Psychic Mega Latios, which can finish off Toxapex and isn't affected by Toxic Spikes, Psychium Z Future Sight Slowbro, and the uncommon Hoopa-U, which hardly even needs its Psychic typing to punch through Toxapex. Volcarona will sometimes run Psychic with Psychium Z to overcome Toxapex.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Swords Dance Gliscor is perhaps Toxapex's kryptonite; once its Toxic Orb is activated, it leisurely switches into Toxapex and milks it for setup opportunities relentlessly. Seismitoad can make Toxapex feel useless with its immunity to Scald and tendency to run either Refresh or Rest to clear status, and it can set Stealth Rock or pressure Toxapex with Earthquake. Landorus-T, Excadrill, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp are some more offensively inclined Ground-types that can bowl through Toxapex should they get a safe opportunity to switch in. On top of this, top physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados commonly carry Earthquake, allowing them to finish off or break through Toxapex. Both Protean Greninja and Kommo-o can make use of Groundium Z to clear out Toxapex immediately.</p> <p><strong>Status Absorbers</strong>: Magic Guard users like Reuniclus and Clefable find it very easy to get entry on Toxapex and can set up on it and pressure it with super effective attacks like Psyshock and Thunder. In Clefable's case, what it can often lack in breaking power, it will make up for in utility, using Toxapex as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, remove items, and either clear status with Heal Bell or spread its own with Thunder Wave. Manaphy in rain is another absurdly difficult Pokemon to deal with, as it can boost itself up rapidly with Tail Glow and threaten with rain-boosted Hydro Vortex and Psychic while Hydration + Rest handles any sort of counterplay from Toxapex. Although teams that use Tapu Fini—a grounded Pokemon afflicted by Toxic Spikes—as their Defogger are structurally weak to Toxapex, Misty Terrain allows a whole host of Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Kartana, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B to switch directly into Toxapex completely safely without fear of burn or poison.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko is the most immediately threatening of the Electric-types, being able to instantly remove Toxapex with +1 Thunderbolt or an unboosted Electric-type Z-Move. Magnezone and Thundurus-T can both 2HKO Toxapex, and Choice Specs Magnezone and Electrium Z Thundurus-T fare even better, being able to nab an OHKO. Zapdos and Rotom-W are usually quite lame against Toxapex, but they can tack on Electrium Z to take it out by surprise. Calm Mind users like Magearna and Clefable make use of Thunderbolt and Thunder to threaten Toxapex, Kyurem-B is rarely seen without its handy Fusion Bolt to 2HKO Toxapex, and Choice Band Victini can throw off Bolt Strike for huge damage.</p> <p><strong>Other Wallbreakers and Stallbreakers</strong>: Magma Storm + Taunt Heatran and Whirlpool + Taunt Tapu Fini can remove Toxapex from the game and don't have much issue switching directly in. If the opponent doesn't scout for Shed Shell, which allows Toxapex to flip this matchup and escape the partial trapping effect, that's on them. Toxapex happens to be part of the long list of Pokemon that get turned inside out by +2 Mega Mawile, which can be especially scary with Thunder Punch; Toxapex can only fish for a Scald burn in desperation. Serperior can bulldoze through Toxapex with repeated boosts, able to stop status, recovery, and Haze attempts with Taunt. Tornadus-T can pepper Toxapex with Hurricane while stopping it from healing or striking back meaningfully with Taunt and having Flyinium Z for extra consistency in this one-on-one.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is very beneficial for Toxapex because it lets it threaten more statuses than just poison, able to burn greedy Steel-types like Kartana, Mega Mawile, and Ferrothorn. If worsening Toxapex's ability to touch these Steel-types doesn't scare you off, then you might appreciate Knock Off as another potential option, which trades off status pressure to remove passive recovery directly, great for removing Leftovers from the likes of Heatran, Seismitoad, and Tapu Fini. Haze allows Toxapex to limit boosters like Volcarona, Reuniclus, Mega Scizor, and Kommo-o. Toxic is another quite direct self-defense mechanism, helping against many threats, including both Mega Charizard formes, non-Substitute Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Mega Latias. Toxic Spikes are a huge draw of Toxapex, as they more or less punish offensive teams just for being too offensive to include their own Toxapex; in one turn, Toxapex can shut out grounded attackers like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko, and the opponent better hope they get their Tapu Fini on the field before it's too late, as Toxic Spikes will activate before Misty Terrain does. Baneful Bunker is Toxapex's venomous take on Protect, useful for punishing contact attackers like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and U-turn Landorus-T, scouting Choice-locked foes, and racking up status damage. Recover bolsters Toxapex's longevity in direct one-on-ones and is—nearly—undroppable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>36 Defense EVs are used to ensure Toxapex avoids the 2HKO from Kartana's Leaf Blade from full health, with the rest pooled into Special Defense to help its main jobs of answering threats like Mega Charizard Y and Ash-Greninja and eating Volt Switch from Rotom-W and Magearna. Black Sludge is the most consistent option; there is little else to say other than it gives Toxapex more free turns to use its utility moves instead of healing itself. Shed Shell is an entertaining option that should always be paired with Knock Off, which allows Toxapex to have a lasting impact on Magma Storm Heatran and Whirlpool Tapu Fini while avoiding being forcefully removed by the trapping effect. Payapa Berry works great with Toxic to force a limit on Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele. Rocky Helmet feels pretty luxurious, but punishing U-turn from Landorus-T and Mega Scizor and other attacks from Choice Scarf Kartana is quite appealing. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD with a Bold nature is another great option for Toxapex that helps against physical attackers, with the Defense investment allowing it to survive Mega Medicham's Zen Headbutt from full health, while the Special Defense investment prevents Volcarona from 2HKOing it with Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's pretty hard to go wrong with using Toxapex. Try to get Toxic Spikes on the field as early as possible against offensive teams. The gameplan is to lock out their biggest threats with the threat of status from the get-go and put pressure on their methods of entry hazard removal to eventually be able to choke them out with passive damage. It's perfectly fine to trade health to aggressively get a layer of Toxic Spikes if the opposing team has poor removal, with Toxapex taking attacks like Landorus-T's Earthquake, Rotom-W's Volt Switch, and Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt from full health. If it's not running Shed Shell, do not let Toxapex's Water typing fool you into thinking it has any business dealing with an unscouted Heatran or Tapu Fini; the threat of Magma Storm or Whirlpool coupled with Taunt threatens to immediately remove an unsuspecting Toxapex from the game. When it's running Shed Shell, though, scout and avoid opposing Knock Off carefully if you are facing a team with a trapper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxapex fits on teams ranging from bulky offense to stall but mostly prefers teams on the bulkier side where its occasional passivity isn't as out of place. Ground-types like Gliscor, Excadrill, and Seismitoad can interrupt opposing Volt Switch and all appreciate Toxapex's handling of Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. On the topic of Excadrill, sand teams in general appreciate Toxapex due to how elite it is at handling Mega Charizard Y and Water-type threats, and Mega Tyranitar specifically can check Heatran, add to Toxapex's status chip damage with sand, and threaten Choice-locked attackers like Ash-Greninja and Tapu Lele with a heavy Pursuit. Celesteela forms quite a splendid partnership with Toxapex due to its proficiency at handling opposing Psychic- and Ground-types. Magearna is another option for a Psychic-type check that helps against Kyurem-B and also holds a useful resistance to Dark; together, Ash-Greninja is handled very well, as Toxapex can scout Dark Pulse before going right to Magearna. Slowbro forms a solid core with Toxapex despite doubling up on the Water typing. It specializes in handling physical threats like Mega Swampert, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Medicham, while Toxapex deals with Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Ash-Greninja and clears opposing Toxic Spikes. Both Mega Latias and Mega Latios are good teammates thanks to their great matchup against offensive Ground-types and their shared resistances with Toxapex, allowing them to back it up defensively. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can lay down Spikes to harass Steel-types, with Skarmory helping against Mega Mawile and Kartana and Ferrothorn checking Electric-types like Tapu Koko. Cresselia and Reuniclus are examples of bulky Psychic-type setup sweepers that can rely on Toxic Spikes to outlast Dark-types. Additionally, Cresselia provides a rock-solid answer to Psychic-types like Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham. Chansey covers undesirable special attackers like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Tapu Koko and backs up the majority of Toxapex's matchups against special attackers. Tornadus-T can defensively check and threaten the likes of Landorus-T and Kartana and forms a Regenerator core with Toxapex, giving the team plentiful longevity.</p>"

  "Araquanid": {
    "overview": "<p>Araquanid is a suicide lead for Sticky Web teams. Its typing and bulk allow it to take attacks such as the combination of Fake Out + Return from Mega Lopunny and Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja. However, it is extremely slow and vulnerable to hazard control techniques, including Taunt and Defog.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band Araquanid is usable on Trick Room teams; this set would generally run Liquidation / Leech Life / Toxic / Hidden Power Fire with a Brave nature. However, it is generally outclassed by Crawdaunt, as Crawdaunt boasts Swords Dance, Aqua Jet, and the ability to break through common defensive threats such as Toxapex. Araquanid is rather one-dimensional in its role as a Sticky Web user, so unless a team features Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Uxie, it's safe to assume Araquanid is being used to set Sticky Web.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Taunt Tapu Koko and Taunt Tapu Lele are able to prevent Araquanid from setting Sticky Web. While they will usually be hit by a follow-up Liquidation, Araquanid cannot afford to predict a use of Taunt, as Taunt is not always used on either of these Pokemon, and Araquanid will fail to set Sticky Web if they simply attack Araquanid and 2HKO it. The rare Tapu Fini also can Taunt Araquanid and successfully use Defog against it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Defog Mega Scizor not only walls Araquanid but also can use Defog to remove Sticky Web. Swords Dance Mega Scizor also sets up on Araquanid and will usually win, as hyper offense has very few checks to Swords Dance Mega Scizor. Araquanid will struggle to muscle past Mega Scizor regardless of the set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web provides speed control to support the team. Liquidation is boosted by Araquanid's signature ability Water Bubble, and it OHKOes Pokemon that can prevent Araquanid from using Sticky Web such as Magic Bounce Mega Diancie, paving the way for a sweep from a teammate such as Mega Pinsir or Bisharp. Magic Coat allows Araquanid to bounce back hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes from the likes of Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, and it makes Taunt users wary about Taunting Araquanid. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Kartana, which can normally use Defog to remove Sticky Web. On the other hand, Toxic allows Araquanid to cripple Defog users such as Mantine, Zapdos, and Mew. Mirror Coat is a niche choice that allows Araquanid to use its good special bulk to bounce a special attack back, such as Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, potentially OHKOing a threat. Leech Life is a final option that gives Araquanid a secondary STAB move to hit the likes of Ash-Greninja, but it is not recommended, as it is weak and does not qualify for a Water Bubble boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack allows Araquanid to hit as hard as possible with Water Bubble-boosted Liquidation. The Special Attack investment lets Araquanid always OHKO Kartana with Hidden Power Fire. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP to give Araquanid extra bulk to check Pokemon such as Heatran and Greninja, as well as always survive Fake Out + Return from Mega Lopunny. A Brave nature is used to boost the power of Liquidation without compromising Araquanid's bulk or ability to OHKO Kartana. Water Bubble is the best possible ability on Araquanid, as not only does it double the power of Araquanid's Water-type moves, but it also gives Araquanid a resistance to Fire-type moves and immunity to burns from the likes of Mega Sableye and Mew.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Araquanid should nearly always be your lead, unless it is paired with a second suicide lead such as Focus Sash Landorus-T or Excadrill. If it's possible to preserve Araquanid after setting Sticky Web and the opposing team has a Greninja or a Heatran, keeping Araquanid can be convenient to switch into the likes of Water Shuriken and Magma Storm.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir and Bisharp are standard Pokemon on Sticky Web teams that also appreciate Araquanid's ability to either KO or severely damage common checks such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. Araquanid is best paired with another suicide lead to form a double Focus Sash core. Landorus-T and Excadrill are excellent partners in this regard, setting Stealth Rock relatively reliably. Araquanid fits best on hyper offense, so strong breakers that appreciate Sticky Web support such as Tapu Lele and Kartana are generally ideal.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Pyukumuku's combination of good defensive stats, a pure Water typing, access to reliable recovery, and an amazing ability in Unaware, it's able to carve itself a decent niche by being an Unaware user with better overall bulk than both Quagsire and Clefable, allowing it to handle certain setup sweepers and offensive threats such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Swampert, and Manaphy better than the other two, while having useful and unique utility options in Block, Spite, and Soak that make the target unable to switch out, lower the target's PP, or allow it to poison Steel- and Poison-types. Aside from being an Unaware wall, Pyukumuku's other role is that of a bulky trapper that is able to either PP or Toxic stall passive targets such as Clefable, Gliscor, and Celesteela. This is incredibly useful for stall teams that want to remove a specific nuisance early on. However, Pyukumuku is a massive momentum drain, so much so that it basically requires that you use it exclusively on stall teams where its teammates can make up for its shortcomings. It also has a barren movepool, leaving it both one-dimensional and predictable. Due to not having any attacking options and only being able to inflict damage with Toxic, Pyukumuku is extremely passive and will lose to any Taunt users while being severely annoyed by Substitute users. Finally, even though it has a lot of unique features going for it, Pyukumuku can still fall behind the other Unaware users; Quagsire having actual attacking options prevents it from being complete Taunt bait, and it also checks Choice Band Tyranitar and provides a useful Electric immunity, while Clefable can support teammates with the use of Heal Bell and Wish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Innards Out, while less reliable than Unaware, can be used to force damage onto strong wallbreakers and thus remove them from the match. The moveset should be Toxic / Soak / Rest / Block with maximum HP investment, a Hasty nature, 0 IVs in Attack, Defense, and Special Defense, and an Aguav Berry, and it should be set to Level 96. This set maximizes Pyukumuku's HP while lowering its bulk as much as possible. Pyukumuku will end up with 301 HP, the same amount as Hoopa-U, which lets Innards Out OHKO it, and it also prevents Pyukumuku from getting 3HKOed by Seismic Toss. If the foe isn't able to OHKO Pyukumuku but takes over 75% of its health, the Aguav Berry heals 50% of its HP and puts it in range of the next attack, maximizing the effects of Innards Out. Gastro Acid over Block can be used to remove Poison Heal from Swords Dance Gliscor and Magic Guard from both Clefable and Reuniclus, but it's usually not worth losing an important move in Block, and Spite sets can still beat the aforementioned targets. Counter over Block is another possible option, allowing Pyukumuku to remove frighteningly strong physical wallbreakers such as Kartana, Mega Mawile, and Choice Band Hoopa-U in exchange for Pyukumuku's HP while not having to utilize Innards Out, but losing Block puts a damper on its PP and Toxic stalling capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Heatran and Protean Greninja are able to completely shut down Pyukumuku and stop it from utilizing any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users such as Serperior are able to bypass Pyukumuku's only form of damage and become unaffected by Block. Mega Gyarados can also use Substitute and also ignores Unaware thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos are able to switch into Pyukumuku and force it out, and both boast reliable recovery in Roost, allowing them to mitigate Toxic damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu are able to overpower Pyukumuku using their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Hoopa-U, and Mega Heracross are able to overpower Pyukumuku and easily 2HKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Block is used to prevent the target from switching out, which can allow Pyukumuku to PP stall foes with Spite more effectively or force more Toxic damage to quickly rack up. Recover gives Pyukumuku reliable recovery and allows it to continuously check threats throughout the match. Spite, in tandem with Block, allows Pyukumuku to deplete the PP of Poison Heal and Magic Guard users and beat Manaphy. This especially helps against Calm Mind Clefable, which is otherwise a very annoying threat to any stall team that lacks Haze Toxapex. Rest is used to relieve Pyukumuku of status and beat other defensive walls such as Chansey and Toxapex, but, more importantly, it allows Pyukumuku to effectively outstall Mega Sableye if Block gets bounced back and traps Pyukumuku. Taunt may also be used instead of Rest to accelerate the PP stalling. Alternatively, Toxic and Soak are also viable options instead of Spite and Taunt. Toxic is Pyukumuku's main and only real form of damage and, in conjunction with Soak, allows it to poison the majority of the tier, barring certain Magic Guard, Magic Bounce, and Poison Heal users. Soak allows Steel- and Poison-types to get hit by Toxic and can also remove the target's access to its STAB-boosted moves. One of the main advantages of using Toxic + Soak is being able to cripple common switch-ins such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, making it more effective against offensive teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense investment allows Pyukumuku to more easily handle the large number of physical attackers in the tier. Unaware allows Pyukumuku to check setup sweepers by ignoring their boosts. Leftovers allows Pyukumuku to avoid important 2HKOs from strong offensive threats and gives it a small amount of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to preserve Pyukumuku's HP and keep it healthy enough to check setup sweepers such as Hawlucha and Manaphy and some wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Use Recover liberally to keep Pyukumuku healthy and scout possible Z-Moves from wallbreakers such as Landorus-T, which might put it in range of regular attacks. Keep Pyukumuku away from common Taunt users such as Heatran to prevent it from getting crippled. Use Block when you suspect the opponent to stay in with a trappable target, such as against Clefable if Pyukumuku is running Spite. If using the Soak + Toxic variant, try not to reveal Soak- against Steel and Poison-types such as Celesteela and Toxapex until you have trapped them with Block.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku only fits on stall teams, so staples of the archetype are the best teammates. Mega Sableye is a good example here, as it can bounce back Taunt from Heatran and check non-Z-Move variants. Chansey is able to take on a large variety of powerful special attackers that can overwhelm Pyukumuku such as Choice Specs Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Latios. It can also utilize Heal Bell to cure Pyukumuku of status. Zapdos is able to check an otherwise devastating stallbreaker in Mega Gyarados while also removing entry hazards that may cut into Pyukumuku's longevity. Physically defensive Tangrowth can also deal with Mega Gyarados, and with Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Bomb, it can deal with Kartana or Tapu Bulu, respectively. Hippowdon is able to soft check physical attackers that Pyukumuku cannot, such as Mega Mawile and Choice Band Tyranitar, while also providing a useful Electric immunity. Jirachi, while sometimes harder to fit on stall teams, is able to take on important threats in Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B and pass Wishes to Pyukumuku.</p>"

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<p>Mimikyu holds a niche in the OU metagame due to its unique typing and ability Disguise, which gives it a free turn to attack or set up. Defensively, Mimikyu can act as a blanket check to many threats such as Volcarona and Mega Medicham. Ghost- and Fairy-type STAB moves allow Mimikyu to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage. Decent Attack along with access to Swords Dance and great STAB coverage allows Mimikyu to clean easily. However, Mimikyu struggles to break common defensive Pokemon such Toxapex and Landorus-T. Also, once Disguise is broken, Mimikyu is very easy to revenge kill, as it is very frail and isn't very fast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mimikyu can use Trick Room effectively, as it can almost always set up Trick Room thanks to Disguise. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Red Card can be used in conjunction with Disguise to phaze a foe. Taunt can be used to stallbreak; however, this is done better by Tapu Koko. Destiny Bond can be used to take a foe down with Mimikyu.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn can easily take multiple Shadow Claws and either knock Mimikyu out with Gyro Ball or cripple it with Thunder Wave or Leech Seed. Mega Scizor, Celesteela, Magearna, and Skarmory can all take at least one boosted Shadow Claw and retaliate with their Steel-type STAB moves or, in Skarmory's case, phaze Mimikyu out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Landorus-T is a great answer to Mimikyu, as it can tank any hit Mimikyu can throw at it and do massive damage with Earthquake. Toxapex can use Haze to remove any Swords Dance boosts and threaten Mimikyu with a Scald burn. Finally, Mega Venusaur is a great counter to Mimikyu if Mimikyu has already used its Z-Move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Excadrill is a good check to Mimikyu, as it can KO it through Disguise thanks to Mold Breaker. Other Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele can also prey on Mimikyu's low defenses. Naturally faster Pokemon such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp can also revenge kill Mimikyu once Disguise is broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Mimikyu to boost its below-average Attack stat. Shadow Sneak makes up for Mimikyu's low Speed and is used to revenge kill faster threats. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest move, hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny for massive damage. Finally, Shadow Claw has nearly perfect neutral coverage with Play Rough and can hit Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Celesteela, Gengar, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item, as it gives Mimikyu a consistent boost in power, allowing it to hit much harder. Ghostium Z lets Mimikyu fire off a strong Never-Ending Nightmare, which allows it to break through certain threats such as Celesteela. Maximum Speed and Attack investment allows Mimikyu to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. An Adamant nature allows Mimikyu to do much more damage to Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T and Celesteela, especially after a Swords Dance, and it is the preferred nature on Sticky Web teams. However, a Jolly nature allows Mimikyu to outpace Jolly Landorus-T, Hasty Kyurem-B, and non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mimikyu's Disguise should be saved until the mid- or late-game, as Disguise can be used to stop a setup sweeper such as non-Mega Gyarados or Volcarona. However, it is acceptable to use up Mimikyu's Disguise early-game to weaken Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Try to use Swords Dance when Mimikyu has a clear shot at sweeping or when you need to break through the opposing Pokemon. If Ghostium Z is run over Life Orb, use Never-Ending Nightmare after a Swords Dance to break Pokemon such as Celesteela. Be careful of Psychic Terrain, as it blocks Shadow Sneak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mimikyu fits very well on Sticky Web teams, as it can benefit from the foe's Speed decrease and can spinblock. Thus, Sticky Web setters such as Smeargle and Shuckle make good teammates. Other Pokemon found on Sticky Web teams such as Bisharp and Mega Pinsir also make good teammates. Magnezone can trap bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Slow VoltTurn users such as Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna can get Mimikyu in without breaking Disguise. Entry hazard setters such as Greninja and Garchomp can wear down Mimikyu's checks, allowing it to sweep. Heatran is also a good partner, as it deals with Ferrothorn and Scizor while also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Finally, wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile can make it easier for Mimikyu to clean up late-game.</p>"

  "Kommo-o": {
    "overview": "<p>Kommo-o is a valuable addition to a number of offensive teams, as the combination of a powerful Z-Move, colorful coverage, and access to Stealth Rock makes it simultaneously one of the best sweepers and Stealth Rock users for such teams. Likewise, Belly Drum with Salac Berry is also a deadly sweeper that can be quite the useful addition to hyper offense by cleaning up teams or punching hole for fellow sweepers. Kommo-o's bulk and typing are beneficial to its offensive role too, letting it act as a soft check to many Pokemon that are troublesome to offense, such as Ash-Greninja, Blacephalon, Tyranitar, and Heatran while allowing Kommo-o to set up Stealth Rock or Substitutes on a number of common Pokemon in the tier, such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Tapu Bulu. Its bulk and typing also make it resistant to a number of forms of revenge killing, such as Choice Scarf Kartana and priority like Water Shuriken or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, a specially defensive set can also be run on stall teams, which provides stall a switch-in to notable breakers such as Blacephalon, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados. However, Kommo-o does have its downsides. Its typing, while good in a lot of regards, leaves it weak to some common typings like Psychic, Ice, and especially Fairy. This weakness to Fairy also extends to the fact that Fairy-types can easily block its Z-Move and prevent it from sweeping, as can Pokemon sacrificed to entry hazard damage. Additionally, its Speed is only decent, meaning offensive sets are prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Greninja. As for the specially defensive set, it can struggle defensively due to a lack of access to any reliable recovery, making it over-reliant on Wish support from other members of its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If using specially defensive Kommo-o with other consistent entry hazard setters, you could replace Stealth Rock with a coverage move like Poison Jab to catch Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu or Toxic to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Specially defensive Kommo-o only has Earthquake to hit Fairy-types, meaning it is forced out by the majority of Fairy-types in the tier, such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, and Clefable. The Belly Drum set has a better matchup, with +6 Thunder Punch OHKOing quite a few common ones, but it still misses out on healthy Clefable and is outsped by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham don't really fear much from defensive Kommo-o and easily OHKO it in return. Additionally, bulkier Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Mew, and Mega Slowbro can at least take one hit from +6 Kommo-o and threaten it back, with Reuniclus actually being able to set up on it with Acid Armor if at full HP.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic renders the defensive set unable to properly check the Pokemon it should and limits how many turns the offensive set has to break. Burn and paralysis severely cripple the offensive set, either leaving it much weaker to the point where it can't break or prone to being revenge killed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Clanging Scales ignores Substitute from Volcarona and Kyurem-B, forcing them out. Close Combat lets Kommo-o hit Steel-types like Heatran and Magearna. Drain Punch is a viable alternative that provides Kommo-o with some extra longevity and still lets it threaten Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Excadrill, and Mega Tyranitar. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable for decent damage and OHKOes offensive Tapu Bulu after Stealth Rock damage. Flamethrower lets Kommo-o threaten Steel-types that are neutral to Fighting such as Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Skarmory as well as threaten Magearna on the switch in. Kommo-o is an effective Stealth Rock setter, as its decent bulk and good typing let it force out Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Heatran, giving it plenty of free opportunities. Finally, Taunt shuts down any attempts at status, recovery, or Haze from the likes of Toxapex, Chansey, and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Clangorous Soulblaze boosts Kommo-o's damage and gives it a one-time omniboost, allowing it to blow through physically defensive Pokemon and sweep late-game. Bulletproof provides Kommo-o with an immunity to bullet moves such as Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball and Blacephalon's Shadow Ball. Soundproof grants an immunity to opposing Clangorous Soulblaze. A Hasty nature allows Kommo-o to outspeed Mega Lopunny after a boost. If Kommo-o runs Flamethrower, a spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe should be used instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kommo-o should save its Z-Move for late-game scenarios where Fairy-types have been removed, since they are immune to Clangorous Soulblaze and prevent the stat boosts. Kommo-o's Z-Move will also be wasted if the opponent sacrifices a weakened Pokemon to entry hazards, so be wary of this. Kommo-o must be wary of the Defense and Special Defense drops from Clanging Scales and Close Combat, as this can make it more vulnerable to revenge killing attempts from Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana. Kommo-o must also watch out for status users like Thunder Wave Chansey and Ferrothorn and Toxic Toxapex and Slowbro, as they can prevent it from sweeping; if Kommo-o has Taunt, then it should always use it against potential status users before setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Kommo-o set fits best on offense and hyper offense teams where it can clean up after its teammates break down walls. Protean and Battle Bond Greninja are great partners if Kommo-o runs Stealth Rock, as they can directly wear down checks like Tapu Fini and Magearna with attacks and indirectly with Spikes. Protean Greninja is especially notable, as it can lure in and KO Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable with Gunk Shot. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Mawile and Mega Charizard X can force through walls and pave a way for Kommo-o to clean up. Magearna can take on the likes of Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, while Kommo-o can take on Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Heatran for Magearna. On hyper offense teams, Fire-type partners like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona appreciate Kommo-o taking on Ash-Greninja, which usually gives hyper offense teams lots of trouble. In return, they can handle Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable and force damage against Tapu Fini so that Kommo-o can clean up. Serperior can grant additional Taunt support to deter entry hazards, provide paralysis support with Glare, and threaten Tapu Fini.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance allows Kommo-o to boost its attacking stats, with its advantages over Clangorous Soulblaze being that it cannot be blocked by Fairy-types, can be used more than once, and potentially frees up Kommo-o's item slot for alternate Z-Crystals. Close Combat is a strong STAB option that lets Kommo-o hit neutral targets for the highest possible damage. Ice Punch is a good coverage option that allows Kommo-o to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp on their 4x weakness to Ice, as well as taking out other chipped Ice-weak targets like Tornadus-T and Mega Latias. When holding Groundium Z, Kommo-o can use Dragon Dance as Magearna or Toxapex is lured in and OHKO its switch-in on the next turn with Tectonic Rage. Alternatively, it can wield Poisonium Z to KO Tapu Fini and Clefable with a +1 Acid Downpour and Tapu Bulu with a +1 Poison Jab. Additionally, it can use a combination of Poison Jab followed by Acid Downpour to KO Unaware Clefable. Another option is Kommonium Z, combining the boosts of both Dragon Dance and Clangorous Soulblaze to increase Kommo-o's stats to an incredibly threatening level, as well as hitting physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T and Rotom-W on their weaker Special Defense.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Speed-boosting nature lets Kommo-o outspeed Timid Heatran and Gyarados, as well as Mega Lopunny at +1. When using the Kommonium Z variant, a Hasty nature is preferred to maximize the damage output from Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soulblaze. 252 Attack EVs are used to give Kommo-o the best chance to KO Unaware Clefable with the combination of Poison Jab into Acid Downpour. Groundium Z variants do not require maximum Attack investment to KO their intended targets, so a spread of 40 HP / 216 Atk / 252 Spe can be used instead to allow Kommo-o to survive three Seismic Tosses. Bulletproof Kommo-o can check Blacephalon via its immunity to Shadow Ball, with its immunity to Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball also being beneficial. Soundproof is another option, as it gives Kommo-o an immunity to opposing Clangorous Soulblaze.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poisonium Z and Groundium Z Kommo-o can utilize their sets not being revealed as a lethal weapon, taking advantage of the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze to lure in and remove Fairy-types and Haze Toxapex, respectively. Kommonium Z Kommo-o, on the other hand, is best suited to late-game situations where opposing Fairy-types have either been removed or chipped into range of its other attacks. Kommo-o can use its typing to come in on Choice Specs Greninja to set up a Dragon Dance as Greninja switches out. It can also utilize its offensive presence to create setup opportunities, using both the fear of Close Combat that Fighting-weak Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Chansey may have and the fear of a potential Clangorous Soulblaze held by physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T. If there are no better targets, then Kommo-o can use its Z-Move against neutral targets such as Mega Medicham and Volcarona to net a KO it otherwise wouldn't. After Kommo-o's Z-Move is used up, its capability as a threat is reduced, so sacrificing it to get chip damage on defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W is a viable option. The Kommonium Z variant can take advantage of opponents attempting to sacrifice a Pokemon to Clangorous Soulblaze by using Dragon Dance first instead, with Kommo-o then outpacing the unboosted metagame, ready to use the anticipated Clangorous Soulblaze on the next turn and come away with an extra Attack and Speed boost, making it much harder to deal with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>These Kommo-o variants generally fit on offense and hyper offense teams that appreciate Kommo-o's ability to remove defensive Pokemon using an unanticipated Z-Move. Good teammate choices for Kommo-o depend on which Z-Crystal it is holding. Groundium Z Kommo-o can take out Assault Vest Magearna, benefitting special attackers like Choice Specs Greninja, Serperior, and Mega Alakazam. Poisonium Z provides Kommo-o a way to remove Unaware Clefable, which is invaluable for hyper offense teams containing Pokemon like Hawlucha that have an incredibly hard time against it. The Kommonium Z variant of Kommo-o appreciates Ash-Greninja for its ability to draw in and weaken Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Fini, as they fall into KO range of Kommo-o's boosted attacks from switching into repeated Choice Specs Hydro Pumps.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kommo-o is an effective Stealth Rock setter, as its defensive niche allows it to force some switches and it can pressure a lot of entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Excadrill with Toxic or Drain Punch. Toxic alongside Protect is fantastic for racking up chip damage on the likes of Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T that would otherwise get a free switch in on Kommo-o. Protect is multifaceted; aside from the above application, it also gives Kommo-o an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and allows it to block Z-Moves and scout Choice-locked Pokemon. Drain Punch provides Kommo-o with some extra recovery and pressures Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>140 Speed EVs are ran in order to outspeed the likes of Timid Magnezone and Adamant Tyranitar. Bulletproof is Kommo-o's most useful ability, immunizing it against a number of moves, with the most notable examples being Gyro Ball from Ferrothorn, Sludge Bomb from Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, and Shadow Ball from Blacephalon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this Kommo-o set to switch into Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Heatran, Rotom-W, and Magnezone, and use the free turn to set up Stealth Rock. Due to Kommo-o's lack of reliable recovery, it can be worn down throughout the game. Try to avoid scenarios that will exacerbate this issue, such as Kommo-o's Leftovers being removed by Knock Off and switching it into entry hazards, especially Spikes and Toxic Spikes, repeatedly. If the opponent has a Pokemon that totally shuts down Kommo-o, such as Gliscor or Tapu Fini, try not to let them in freely; you can double switch into a Pokemon that can take advantage of them. However, this isn't always needed—by getting up Stealth Rock, Tapu Fini and Defog Gliscor will often be forced to remove them, giving you a free switch into a Pokemon that can take advantage of them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Kommo-o fits best on bulky offense, as compressing a Stealth Rock setter, a Heatran check, and an Ash-Greninja check in into one teamslot is very beneficial for the archetype. Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor are good teammates, as they can check Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latias, and Tapu Lele and Fairy-types like Magearna and Clefable for Kommo-o. In return, Kommo-o can consistently switch into Heatran, arguably the biggest threat to Steel-types in the tier. Tyranitar also works well as an answer to both Flying-types like Tornadus-T and the aforementioned Psychic-types. Additionally, it has the extra benefit of being able to Pursuit trap and potentially remove these Pokemon. Rotom-W and Tangrowth are great teammates for Kommo-o, as they can take advantage of counters to it, particularly Gliscor and Tapu Fini.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is used over moves like Close Combat, as the extra power isn't needed, and the recovery is greatly appreciated, leaving Kommo-o less prone to being revenge killed. The HP reduction from Substitute and Belly Drum activates Kommo-o's Salac Berry, giving it a boost to its Speed. Substitute is also key in letting Kommo-o set up on common Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. Thunder Punch provides good coverage alongside Drain Punch, OHKOing Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini after a Belly Drum while still providing neutral coverage against most other Fighting-type checks, namely Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>52 HP EVs ensure that Choice Scarf Magnezone can't break Kommo-o's Substitute behind screens. It also allows Kommo-o to set up a Belly Drum on Magnezone while avoiding being 2HKOed by Flash Cannon. Finally, it leaves Kommo-o's HP divisible by 4, meaning Salac Berry will always be activated after Substitute and Belly Drum. Bulletproof grants Kommo-o an immunity to a large number of moves, allowing it to set up on attacks like Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball, Blacephalon's Shadow Ball, and Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is used on hyper offensive teams, so the majority of the time Kommo-o should be sent out to attempt to sweep when its checks have been weakened and revenge killers dealt with. It can also be used to weaken the opposing team in order to pave the way for one of its teammates to clean up. Kommo-o's typing and decent bulk mean it can be used to check certain threats like Heatran and Ash-Greninja. However, sometimes it can be better to not use it to check these Pokemon, as it can put Kommo-o in range of even resisted priority like Water Shuriken and Sucker Punch after a Belly Drum, or it can simply leave Kommo-o unable to set up a Belly Drum and render it mostly useless offensively. While Kommo-o can set up on numerous Pokemon, it is often not a good idea to switch into these Pokemon and try to set up, as they will often be able to harass Kommo-o if it doesn't have a Substitute up—for example, Ferrothorn can whittle it down with Leech Seed, and Rotom-W can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set's used on hyper offense teams due to its reliance on one-time setup, so it should be paired with teammates that would fit on this archetype. Even with +1 Speed, Kommo-o is outsped by Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Tapu Lele, meaning it can be revenge killed if Substitute is broken. Sticky Web helps to circumvent this, so setters like Ribombee and Araquanid can be used. Dual screens Tapu Koko is an exemplary partner, as it sets up both screens that give Kommo-o more setup opportunities, has U-turn to pivot Kommo-o in, and boosts the power of Thunder Punch, allowing Kommo-o to OHKO Pokemon like Clefable and Mew with minor chip damage. Hawlucha has great synergy with Kommo-o, as they pressure each other's checks, namely Clefable, Reuniclus, and Hippowdon, likely facilitating a sweep. Additionally, Hawlucha too appreciates Tapu Koko as a teammate, completing a good offensive core with it. Unaware walls such as Clefable, Pyukumuku, and Quagsire perpetually wall Kommo-o, so it should be paired with sweepers like Mega Gyarados and Manaphy that can overcome these walls.</p>"

  "Buzzwole": {
    "overview": "<p>Buzzwole's great physical bulk in conjunction with its rare defensive typing allows it to function as a blanket check on stall teams to many of the metagame's most dangerous physical attackers such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu. Having a Bulk Up-boosted Buzzwole can be a win condition for stall teams, potentially sweeping bulky offensive teams in the late-game after they've been whittled down by Buzzwole's team. Buzzwole's movepool gives it access to a wide variety of coverage options such as Ice Punch for Gliscor and Landorus-T, allowing it to effectively utilize its high Attack stat. On the other hand, Buzzwole's mediocre special bulk leaves it susceptible to being KOed by strong special attacks such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt and Greninja's Hydro Pump after prior damage. Buzzwole's defensive typing also leaves it easily preyed upon by common attacking types in Flying, Fairy, and Psychic, and Buzzwole is easy to KO due to its poor Speed tier, so Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Lele, and Clefable all force Buzzwole out with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Buzzwole can also run offensive sets that attempt to utilize its impressive offensive coverage, but these sets are oftentimes hard to justify over other breakers like Mega Heracross and Hoopa-U that can break through bulkier teams with much more ease.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon in general, particularly Clefable, are problematic for Buzzwole because they can easily take any move that it can throw at them and threaten it out with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Similarly to Fairy-types, Psychic-types are very problematic for Buzzwole. Offensive Psychic-types can threaten to OHKO Buzzwole with STAB Psychic, though they struggle to switch into Buzzwole, while Reuniclus can use Buzzwole as setup fodder and wall it infinitely, especially if it has Acid Armor.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir can switch into Buzzwole and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB attacks, but they have to be wary of switching into Ice Punch. Celesteela can comfortably take even a boosted Drain Punch and threaten out Buzzwole with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Buzzwole is very easy to wear down with residual damage between entry hazards and status conditions, so focusing on pressuring it and wearing it down throughout the game with residual damage is an effective way of dealing with it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a reliable STAB move that allows Buzzwole to amass recovery while taking on troublesome threats such as Kartana, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados. Ice Punch is a useful coverage move that allows Buzzwole to consistently check Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and non-Flyinium Z Landorus-T. Bulk Up allows Buzzwole to set up alongside setup sweepers such as Kartana in order to more reliably check them, and it makes Buzzwole an endgame sweeper capable of taking down weakened teams. Roost allows Buzzwole to stay healthy throughout the match so that it can reliably check the many physical attackers that pressure it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>112 Speed EVs allow Buzzwole to outspeed Tyranitar, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP and Defense in order to allow Buzzwole to check physical attackers such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Beast Boost is Buzzwole's only ability and boosts Buzzwole's Defense every time it KOes an opposing Pokemon. Leftovers provides passive recovery in conjunction with Drain Punch, preserving potentially valuable Roost PP for the late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Buzzwole should be switched primarily into physical attackers that it checks such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Avoid letting Buzzwole absorb status such as burn or poison, as status conditions limit its ability to effectively beat the aforementioned threats. Keep entry hazards off your side of the field so that Buzzwole can reliably beat Pokemon such as Corkscrew Crash Kartana. Additionally, analyze the opposing team and scout for lures such as Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T if Buzzwole is meant to check multiple Pokemon so it can avoid being KOed in the early-game. When utilizing Buzzwole as part of the team's win condition, wait for the opposing team to be worn down before setting up and attempting to win the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Buzzwole tends to fit better onto bulkier teams, usually stall or semi-stall, that need a consistent answer to Garchomp and Kartana. Buzzwole appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Mega Sableye and Zapdos to keep Spikes off the field, allowing Buzzwole to effectively check Pokemon such as Steelium Z Kartana. In a similar vein, Buzzwole appreciates teammates that provide cleric support such as Chansey and Unaware Clefable, as they can remove troublesome status ailments, primarily burn and poison. Specially defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Magearna and Celesteela have amazing defensive synergy with Buzzwole, checking potent special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam that threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks.</p>"

This set is still far preferred to the Z-Hypnosis one, as such a set is rarely sweeping even with Sticky Web support; for instance, Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a very common set that ignores Sticky Web and will revenge kill +1 Xurkitree. Furthermore, it's overreliant on Hypnosis actually hitting to get an opportunity to set up.</p>"}},

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela is a solid defensive Pokemon in the tier, with a fantastic typing, well-rounded stats, and a large movepool. Steel / Flying typing along with massive bulk allows Celesteela to check many threats in the tier such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T. Even though Celesteela lacks reliable recovery, access to Leech Seed allows it to sustain itself against non-Grass-types. However, Celesteela's defenses fail against common threats like Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja. It struggles to make progress against defensive builds featuring Regenerator walls like Toxapex and Tangrowth, and Gliscor, whose Poison Heal lets it break even with Leech Seed's draining. Lastly, its predictability when using Leech Seed and Protect makes it fairly easy to outplay by switching around with different Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Physically based Autotomize sets with Heavy Slam / Earthquake / Fire Blast as offensive moves can be used, but those are easier to shut down with Intimidate users such as Landorus-T. Celesteela can also opt to run Groundium Z on these sets to OHKO Toxapex after a boost, or Rockium Z with Stone Edge to lure Zapdos. Specially based Autotomize sets are also viable with Flyinium Z, but its inability to break Toxapex, Heatran, and Zapdos is very unfavorable. Earthquake can be used on Celesteela instead of Flamethrower, as an option to hit Heatran and deal more damage to Magnezone, but losing out on Kartana, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and opposing Celesteela is a huge deal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is one of few Pokemon that can wall Celesteela completely, as it takes negligible damage from all of Celesteela's common offensive options and can PP stall Leech Seed very easily. It also hits Celesteela super effectively with its Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types take little damage from most of Celesteela's options and can hit back with high-powered STAB moves. Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X and Y are all examples of Pokemon that can power through Celesteela with extreme ease or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Other Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Magnezone can apply heavy pressure to Celesteela because they can KO or trap it. However, they can struggle to deal with a boosted Celesteela, especially if they have been heavily weakened. They can also be massively annoyed by switching into Leech Seed often, especially if entry hazards have been set up.</p> <p><strong>Various Offensive Lures</strong>: Many Pokemon in OU often run lure Z-Moves in order to pick off Celesteela or weaken it to the point where it cannot do much. Some examples include Tapu Lele and Magearna, which can run Fightinium Z and Electrium Z respectively to obliterate Celesteela; Garchomp, which can run Firium Z; and Landorus-T, which commonly runs Gravity or Smack Down. Alternatively, the likes of Tornadus-T and Clefable can remove its Leftovers with Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed allows Celesteela to heal against non-Grass-types and annoy a lot of switch-ins that would be safe otherwise such as Heatran and Rotom-W. It's also the closest thing Celesteela has to reliable recovery. Protect allows Celesteela to scout Choice item users as well as potential Z-Move users while also letting it heal additional HP from Leftovers and Leech Seed. Heavy Slam is Celesteela's strongest STAB move and deals very solid damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. Flamethrower hits Steel-types that resist Heavy Slam such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Magnezone and hits Grass-types immune to Leech Seed such as Tangrowth and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>24 Defense EVs allow Celesteela to avoid the OHKO from Jolly Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick from full HP. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to help Celesteela tackle specially offensive threats such as Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Mega Latios. A Sassy nature is used to bolster Celesteela's bulk without cutting into the power of Heavy Slam and Flamethrower. Optionally, Celesteela can opt to use a spread of 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD with a Relaxed nature to better check physically offensive threats like Mega Scizor and Kartana while still being able to take two Hidden Power Fires from Choice Specs Tapu Lele after Stealth Rock and two rounds of Leftovers with the help of Protect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Celesteela should be sent out against Pokemon it can easily wall like Tapu Lele, Kartana, most variants of Protean Greninja, Landorus-T, and most Garchomp sets. Be wary of moves that can easily break down Celesteela or lure it such as Rockium Z Landorus-T. While Protect can be used to scout these, be careful your opponent doesn't take advantage of this by setting up further or preserving their Z-Move. Avoid letting Celesteela get too weak because a healthy Celesteela is one of the most annoying things to face in the entire tier. This includes avoiding Knock Off and using Leech Seed with Protect whenever necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxapex completes the well-known CelePex core, a very strong defensive core that mostly relies on passive damage to break down threats. Although they compound a weakness to Electric-types, Celesteela takes on many Psychic-types that threaten Toxapex while appreciating Toxic Spikes support from Toxapex. Tangrowth is another Regenerator user that fits very well with Celesteela because it helps take on Electric-types and serve as a sponge for powerful Water-type attacks from the likes of Ash-Greninja. Clefable is a solid option alongside Celesteela because it can switch into weaker Electric-types such as Rotom-W and takes on strong physical breakers such as Mega Medicham and Mega Heracross. It can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, heal up Celesteela with Wish, or remove items from threatening Pokemon such as Heatran with Knock Off. Bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss are useful to check Electric-types like Tapu Koko.</p>"

  "Kartana": {
    "overview": "<p>Kartana is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the metagame due to it having insanely high Attack and superb Speed, making Kartana incredibly hard to counter defensively. Unfortunately, low base HP and pitiful Special Defense make Kartana one of the most specially frail Pokemon in the tier. It is able to salvage its decent physical bulk thanks to a high Defense stat, however. Its Grass / Steel typing also assists Kartana defensively, as it resists many different types and only has two weaknesses, Fighting and Fire, which make it capable of checking Pokemon like Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mega Swampert in a pinch. Offensively, Kartana's typing is also appreciated, especially alongside the coverage move Sacred Sword. Finally, Beast Boost allows Kartana to boost its Attack every time it gets a KO and makes consistent defensive counterplay incredibly hard to come by.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alternative Z-Moves can be used on Swords Dance Kartana, namely Fightinium Z to give Kartana a better chance of breaking past bulky Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor. Grassium Z is also an option on teams with Tapu Bulu for incredible breaking power that can even overwhelm Grass-resistant Pokemon like Zapdos. Frustration can be used on the Choice Band set to muscle past checks like Zapdos and bulky Volcarona more easily. It's also a solid midground option against cores like Tornadus-T + Rotom-W and Toxapex + Mega Latias, especially since it can still threaten a potential 2HKO against them. Do note that these cores are often paired with a Steel-type, such as Heatran and Celesteela, so being locked into Frustration can still be punished easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory are capable of walling most Kartana, but a +2 All-Out Pummeling can still do enough damage to remove them after a couple of Stealth Rock switch-ins, so be wary. Also, Celesteela should watch out for Knock Off, because it relies a lot on Leftovers to consistently wall Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Anything that outruns Kartana and has a decent Special Attack, such as Tornadus-T, Mega Latias, and Greninja, essentially ensures a revenge kill due to Kartana's horrible special bulk. Tornadus-T and Mega Latias in particular can switch into it relatively safely too. Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken can even pick off Choice Scarf Kartana if it is weakend enough. Choice Scarf Magnezone can outspeed, trap, and swiftly remove Kartana with Hidden Power Fire; other variants can punish Kartana being locked into the wrong move too.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and physically defensive Tangrowth are able to wall certain Kartana sets.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Zapdos and Volcarona</strong>: With some investment into bulk on Zapdos, it is capable of walling non-niche variants of Kartana provided Stealth Rock isn't up on the field while the same can be said for Volcarona naturally due to the typing it has. However, offensive Volcarona must fear a boosted Z-Move from Kartana, even with All-Out Pummeling being able to reliably remove it when boosted.</p>",

      "Paper Cut (Swords Dance)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Blade is the preferred STAB attack and allows Kartana to break through Pokemon like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Garchomp without wasting its Z-Move. Sacred Sword provides valuable coverage against Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, which would otherwise wall this set. Giga Impact allows Kartana to break past some of its most common checks in Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Volcarona when used with Normalium Z. Smart Strike is an option that hits Fairy-types like Clefable and Magearna hard without having to utilize Kartana's Z-Move, while Knock Off can remove items from checks like Zapdos to make breaking through them easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is used over Adamant to outspeed all Pokemon with a base 108 Speed or lower, such as Garchomp, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham. Steelium Z is an option if Kartana is running Smart Strike.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be cautious about wasting Kartana's Z-Move, as without it, Kartana cannot break through its typical checks and is easily walled by Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Kartana's offensive prowess usually gives it at least one opportunity to set up on a foe that it threatens out during a match; thus, try to set up a Swords Dance against Pokemon that it can beat, such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor. Bulkier teams tend to have Pokemon faster than Kartana, such as Mega Latias and Mega Alakazam, that can easily revenge kill it. If your ultimate goal is to sweep, make it your primary task to eliminate these faster Pokemon before setting up; with these threats gone, Kartana can easily punch holes in these teams and pave the way for other teammates to sweep. Offensive teams tend to struggle switching into Kartana with the exception of glue Pokemon like Tornadus-T, but they can easily revenge kill it with faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko, so try to weaken the opposing team as much as possible to allow a teammate to sweep easier late-game. It is important to note that even without a Swords Dance Attack boost, Kartana can OHKO Tornadus-T if it tries to pivot into Kartana to scout for a Choice set. Use this to your advantage, as removing Tornadus-T from opposing teams can open up a big hole for Kartana to do some serious damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit from Tyranitar is extremely useful for Kartana because it eliminates this set's biggest revenge killers on bulky offense and balance builds: Mega Latias, Mega Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T. Offensive Pokemon that can simultaneously pressure Kartana's checks like Tangrowth and Zapdos, such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam, make for good partners. These Pokemon also have an easier time sweeping late-game after Kartana has weakened the opposing team. Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Magnezone can not only handle Celesteela and Mega Scizor, two of Kartana's best counters, but also draw in Pokemon that Kartana can potentially set up on such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Gliscor. Kartana is very frail and outsped by faster offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T, so having a Pokemon in the back to check these Pokemon is key; some good examples include Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Koko. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Assault Vest Magearna can bring Kartana into play safely without it having to risk taking big hits due to its poor bulk.</p>"

      "Paper Plane (Choice Scarf)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Blade is the Grass-type STAB move that hits quite hard for a move on a Choice Scarf user thanks to Kartana's high Attack stat, and Sacred Sword is the best complementary coverage move, hitting opposing Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Another potential move can be Smart Strike, which is a secondary STAB move that can knock out Fairy-types such as Clefable. Knock Off is a great utility move to cripple Pokemon that wall Choice Scarf Kartana such as Celesteela and Zapdos, ridding them of their Leftovers. On the utility front, Defog can be used in the final slot if you want a quick, convenient form of entry hazard removal to slap onto more offensively oriented teams. Finally, Giga Impact is viable to remove Volcarona, as teams with Choice Scarf Kartana often are more offensive, lack another revenge killer, and struggle to defensively check Volcarona to the necessary extent, giving Kartana an emergency button to remove it at the cost of Kartana giving up a free turn after use to recharge.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Kartana to have a high damage output and Speed stat, as it is meant to be threatening and quick. Jolly is also used in order to maximize Kartana's Speed, as many Pokemon have similar base Speed stats. Choice Scarf is present to let Kartana clean opposing teams and act as a revenge killer, letting it outrun everything that is unboosted and most setup sweepers at +1. In addition, Defog can let it act as an entry hazard remover for a team that is in need of one, essentially letting you have an emergency button in case of a situation that is getting out of hand due to the presence of entry hazards on the field.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Kartana is meant to clean teams later on in games with the assistance of its ability, Beast Boost. Beast Boost lets it snowball Attack boosts and run through weakened teams. In addition, Choice Scarf Kartana functions as a revenge killer earlier on in games, outrunning and defeating or forcing out most common offensive threats in the metagame such as Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. While locking into Defog is not particularly ideal, as Kartana has to switch out afterwards or become fodder, it is still convenient in some situations and should be used when entry hazards are proving to be problematic to your team during the early- to mid-game. Due to the fact that Swords Dance Kartana is the more common and threatening of the two sets, there are many occasions where you are facing an offensive team that lacks a true Kartana counter and you can take advantage of this via strategic utilization of this Kartana variant. Essentially, the opponent will often try to pivot to their faster, offensive checks that resist a certain move or predict you to use Swords Dance to break through a defensive pivot and Kartana can take advantage of this by hitting them with a strong attack right off the bat, making prediction easier to make, as you know it has to lock into a move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Kartana is primarily used to clean up later on in games, so it should be paired with an early-game wallbreaker that can poke holes and do significant damage to opposing defensive cores, such as Choice Band Tyranitar or Mega Medicham. Also, Spikes support is appreciated by Choice Scarf Kartana, as the residual damage does rack up on opposing teams over time, but it is worth noting that there is some awkward overlap with the fact that Kartana itself could have to use Defog to clear away its own Spikes depending upon the situation. Pursuit support is appreciated by this variant of Kartana as well, as Mega Latios and Mega Latias can get in the way of Kartana trying to sweep with Leaf Blade or Sacred Sword, which are its two most commonly used moves. Tapu Bulu is a great teammate, as Grassy Terrain lets you clean up late-game with Leaf Blade fairly often, and it also provides Kartana with a bit of recovery each turn. Finally, offensive teams often appreciate the presence of Choice Scarf Kartana much more than other archetypes, as it gives them a quick Defog user and compresses roles while also posing as a very valuable offensive Steel-type that happens to have a plethora of resistances.</p>"
      },
      "Paper Press (Choice Band)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Blade is a strong STAB move after Kartana's sky-high Attack and Choice Band are factored in, taking down the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable in two hits. The latter two are threatened by Smart Strike, but it just goes to show how risk-free Leaf Blade can be after Steel- and Flying-types are taken care of. Knock Off also hits very hard after a Choice Band boost, dealing big damage to Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Celesteela and removing Leftovers from walls, thus making Kartana's objective easier to accomplish. Knock Off notably allows Kartana to put defensive Landorus-T in the range of a 2HKO from Leaf Blade. Sacred Sword is an excellent tool for slashing through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and opposing Kartana. Finally, Smart Strike provides solid neutral coverage alongside Kartana's other moves and takes care of the likes of Magearna, Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread alongside a Jolly nature maximizes Kartana's Speed and Attack, the most important stats for such a wallbreaker. Choice Band allows Kartana to have an absurd amount of raw power at the cost of being unable to switch moves. Beast Boost is Kartana's only ability, but it's a great one nonetheless, allowing Kartana to become nigh unstoppable after it claims a knockout.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Choice Band locking Kartana into one move, it is important to predict your opponent's move to use Kartana to its fullest potential. Kartana has the tools to heavily threaten several balance and bulky offense teams, but good opponents will try to pivot around and circumvent its power, thus it's important to ponder risk and reward and keep up the prediction game to prevent your opponent from taking advantage of Kartana. Knock Off is usually a great move to spam early-game, as it does solid damage to most walls. Meanwhile, Leaf Blade is usually ideal to use later on, once Steel- and Flying-types are successfully weakened. Also, try to find opportunities to get Kartana in. It can be after one of your Pokemon has been knocked out, with the use of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or even on an expected switch from your opponent. For the latter, just be careful to not risk Kartana too much, as it will often be important to break your opponent's defensive core. For Kartana's success as a wallbreaker, try to keep entry hazards on your opponent's side of the field for as long as possible, since they really help Kartana's duty as a wallbreaker, allowing it to take down walls and enable teammates to seal the game down the line. Finally, Kartana shouldn't be used as a revenge killer, as even if it can outspeed and knock out a threat, it is still going to be locked into a move and taken advantage of, thus losing valuable momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is an excellent partner courtesy of its ability to trap and eliminate Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Tapu Bulu, despite stacking weaknesses with Kartana, provides Grassy Terrain, which makes Kartana's Leaf Blade, especially when enhanced by Choice Band, all the more threatening, achieving feats such as 2HKOing defensive Landorus-T, Timid Zapdos, Magearna, and Jirachi. Entry hazard setters are excellent teammates to help wear down Kartana's few checks. Heatran and both Greninja formes synergize very well with Kartana offensively and can set Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively. Other Stealth Rock setters, notably Clefable, Landorus-T, and Mega Tyranitar, also are great teammates for Kartana. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna, are great picks to give Kartana more opportunities to wallbreak, as Kartana is too frail to come in on most attacks. Balance archetypes featuring the likes of Clefable, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn can take advantage of Kartana being Choice-locked and pivot around it after the move it is locked into is known. Thus, breakers like Taunt Tornadus-T, Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham are great partners, all of which also appreciate Kartana taking down their checks. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Kartana's havoc are great picks as well; Hawlucha, Shift Gear Magearna, and Volcarona are all great options.</p>"

      "Paper Fan (Utility)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kartana utilizes its outstanding physical bulk and powerful offensive presence to act as a good Defogger against several common entry hazard setters in the tier, including Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. Notably, it's the only Defogger in the tier that can reliably switch into and challenge Z-Move Garchomp. It can also switch into and Defog on Ferrothorn, as it takes negligible damage from Knock Off and is immune to Leech Seed while whittling Ferrothorn down with its own Knock Off. However, its sky-high Attack stat and strong Bloom Doom make it an offensive threat in its own right. Grassium Z, alongside Leaf Blade, gives Kartana a powerful nuke against Ground-types while also helping it revenge kill weakened, slower threats like Reuniclus and Mega Mawile. Knock Off cripples Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Heatran by removing their Leftovers and punishing any attempts to pivot into Kartana. Synthesis gives Kartana the longevity to switch into Stealth Rock setters over the course of a game, as well as miscellaneous offensive Pokemon like Choice-locked Tapu Lele or Kartana, Tyranitar, or Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. Beast Boost can let it snowball late-game, giving it potential as a win condition.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>128 Attack EVs let Kartana OHKO Z-Move Garchomp with Bloom Doom. HP investment lets Kartana play more freely as a Defogger and pivot into physical or resisted special hits more easily. Notably, the added bulk guarantees that Kartana will survive Jolly Mega Swampert's Superpower after Stealth Rock from full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kartana can use its numerous resistances and decent physical bulk to aggressively pivot into moves like Tapu Fini's Moonblast, Mega Medicham's Fake Out, and Tapu Lele's Psyshock and exert immediate pressure with the threat of its Z-Move and Knock Off crippling any switch-in. Overall, Kartana is usually played reactively in matchups where it needs to Defog against an opponent's entry hazard setter, but it can serve as a dangerous offensive threat in its own right when played aggressively and free of this restriction.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog Kartana can be used on any team needing a check to Stealth Rock-setting Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T. This makes it an ideal fit on Mega Charizard Y sun teams, where it can cover Mega Charizard Y's Stealth Rock weakness while getting a boost to its Synthesis healing. It is also able to switch into or force damage on some of Mega Charizard Y's common checks, including Chansey and Tyranitar. Some stall teams also appreciate its ability to reliably stop Garchomp from setting Stealth Rock, as well as its Speed tier and strength that help it double as a revenge killer against threats to stall like Mega Medicham and Manaphy.</p>"

  "Magearna": {
    "overview": "<p>Magearna's incredible typing, well-rounded great stats, and deep movepool make it much more than just a cog in the metagame machine; rather, it is one of the most versatile and defining Pokemon in the tier. It has a wide array of coverage options like Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Focus Blast, and Energy Ball to hit nearly everything it wants to, with an offensive presence good enough to make it count. It's commonly seen wielding an Assault Vest, checking special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam while linking up with common VoltTurn partners Landorus-T and Rotom-W to provide a defensively solid momentum core on offense teams. It can use Heart Swap on defensive Leftovers sets to prevent Calm Mind sweepers like Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Mega Latias from getting out of control, as well as other general utility options like Heal Bell and Thunder Wave. It can even make use of Calm Mind itself, utilizing Pain Split to stay healthy and comfortably beat Chansey one-on-one. Its offensive bag of tricks does not stop there, however, as it can utilize Shift Gear to outspeed and clean up weakened teams, with its ability Soul-Heart being perfect for the role, letting it snowball out of control. It can also make use of Trick Room, freeing itself up to invest in bulk and preventing the possibility of faster Pokemon like Sand Rush Excadrill and Swift Swim Mega Swampert revenge killing it. It additionally can support slower teammates like Mega Mawile, which gives Magearna an instrumental role on dedicated Trick Room teams. Despite these massive upsides, Magearna struggles with its poor Speed and weaknesses to common offensive types in Fire and Ground. Additionally, Magearna can struggle to keep itself healthy between needing to rely on the often-unreliable Pain Split to heal itself and the prevalence of Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Confide has more PP than Heart Swap, meaning it can better go the distance against Calm Mind users and not be stalled out of PP. Normalium Z can be paired with Heal Bell or Confide to provide a consistent way for Magearna to heal itself to full. Explosion can be used on Assault Vest sets to take a chunk out of Volcarona and quickly get in another teammate. Shuca Berry can be used alongside Ice Beam to allow Magearna to remove Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor or let it get a turn of free setup. A spread of 248 HP / 176 SpA / 84 Spe can be used on Assault Vest sets to pose more of a threat in exchange for some of its bulk, with the Speed EVs allowing it to outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor and the rest dumped into HP and Special Attack. Choice Scarf is another option, allowing Magearna to lure Ground-types with Ice Beam and act as a revenge killer and somewhat fast pivot.  Substitute can be used with Calm Mind to block status attempts like Toxapex's Scald and Ferrothorn's Thunder Wave as well as Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Celesteela.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Both Mega Charizard formes, Heatran, Volcarona, and Victini are all immensely threatening to Magearna, with Mega Charizard X and Volcarona being able to set up on it. Heatran must be wary of Focus Blast and All-Out Pummeling variants of Magearna, and Mega Charizard formes can be bowled past by offensive Magearna variants once it gets going.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Seismitoad and Gastrodon can check most Magearna variants and block Volt Switch and threaten it with Earthquake; however, Energy Ball can turn the tables on them. Excadrill is similarly good at this, sporting a resistance to Fairy, though it should be wary of Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire. The rare Mega Camerupt is notable for its great matchup against Magearna, massively threatening it and not being threatened much at all upon switch-in; however, it comes with the unfortunate downside of having a Mega Camerupt on your team. Specially defensive Gliscor can take advantage of non-Ice Beam Magearna for setup with Swords Dance and can threaten it with Earthquake, and Landorus-T and Garchomp can threaten Magearna if they're able to get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Magearna is particularly vulnerable to Spikes due to its often-unreliable methods of recovery, compacting with chip damage from attacks and making it worn down much faster. Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Serperior is ruinous, whittling down Magearna and preventing it from making much progress. Burn from Toxapex and Slowbro's Scald and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp cancels out Magearna's Leftovers and cuts into its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor is threatened very little by Magearna variants lacking Hidden Power Fire and can set up on it with Swords Dance. Jirachi can defensively answer any Magearna set handily and threatens to chip it down while staying healthy. Ferrothorn can annoy Magearna with Leech Seed and Gyro Ball, though it needs to be careful of Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire variants. Offensive Magearna sets can be stopped by opposing defensive Magearna, with opposing Assault Vest variants being able to chip them down with Iron Head or Hidden Power Fire and opposing utility sets can handle them with Heart Swap and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey can take most of what Magearna can throw out with ease, chip it down with Seismic Toss and, it with Thunder Wave, though it doesn't have a consistent way to stop Calm Mind + Pain Split sets from bowling it over. Calm Mind Cresselia can set up in front of Magearna and batter it with Psyshock. Toxapex can handle defensive Magearna sets and Shift Gear variants lacking Electrium Z. Though not entirely mainstream, Mega Venusaur is a perfect defensive answer to Magearna that can threaten it with Leech Seed and Knock Off.</p>",

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fleur Cannon is a crucial, powerful STAB move that hits hard neutrally, catching all sorts of offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, Greninja, and Mega Medicham all in one slot. Ice Beam is a surefire way to OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor that also pressures the likes of Serperior and Zapdos. Energy Ball can be used to snipe the likes of Mega Swampert switching in as well as Seismitoad and Gastrodon. Iron Head is a good option for more efficiently trading damage with opposing Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Lele, as well as pressuring Calm Mind Clefable. Hidden Power Fire takes chunks out of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and OHKOes Kartana, while Focus Blast can do this as well as 2HKO Heatran at the cost of poor accuracy. Volt Switch allows Magearna to take a hit and safely bring in offensive teammates, additionally keeping up the pressure if it catches a switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The physical bulk investment allows Magearna to survive a +2 High Jump Kick from Hawlucha at full health, additionally being useful for taking Psyshock from Tapu Lele, with the rest of the EVs pooled into Special Defense to maximize its bulk. If running Iron Head, use a spread of 248 HP / 224 SpD / 36 Spe with a Sassy nature; the Speed allows it to get the jump on uninvested Clefable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magearna can be thrown into special attackers like Ash-Greninja and Mega Alakazam early-game, threatening them out and bringing in wallbreakers with Volt Switch. Magearna has a tendency to give free setup opportunities to the likes of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, especially so after using Fleur Cannon, so make sure not to leave it in and pivot out as much as possible if your answers to them have been taken out of commission. In certain other matchups, Magearna's great bulk gives it plenty of opportunities to favorably trade, surviving Earthquake from defensive Landorus-T from full and comfortably surviving Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. Watch out for Protean variants of Greninja, as they can use Tectonic Rage to remove Magearna immediately, Hidden Power Fire to weaken Fleur Cannon, and Spikes to block Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on fast-paced offense teams, acting as a short-term blanket check to special threats and providing safe pivoting. Landorus-T is the traditional complement to Assault Vest Magearna, as it's essentially Magearna's physical counterpart in that it temporarily checks physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Excadrill, also working together with Magearna to handle Mega Mawile and Choice Scarf Kartana and providing more momentum with U-turn. Frail attackers like Mega Medicham, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny are the prime beneficiaries of Magearna's slow pivoting, as they struggle to switch directly into attacks. Other pivots like Tapu Koko and Rotom-W are able to work with Magearna to keep up momentum, with Tapu Koko posing an offensive threat and both checking Ground-types for Magearna. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana act as an extra safety net against Mega Alakazam + Tapu Lele teams, ensuring that even when Magearna is overwhelmed, Mega Alakazam can still be revenge killed. Considering the amount of Pokemon that Magearna is tasked with handling, it can become overwhelmed quite quickly, so Victini makes for a good teammate because it shares key resistances, such as to Psychic, Ice, and Grass.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fleur Cannon is a great option to hit neutrally and compress different targets into one slot, also being an excellent candidate for a Z-Move to hit hard without the drawback. Ice Beam prevents specially defensive Gliscor from switching in and is better for dealing with Serperior and Tapu Bulu, with the downside of not being able to threaten Kyurem-B. Flash Cannon is good for Fairy-types like Mega Mawile and Clefable while still being a good, more spammable, neutral option. Pain Split is Magearna's method of recovery, allowing it to heal off chip damage and sit on the likes of Chansey. Heart Swap allows Magearna to flip the script on bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, Mega Latias, and Cresselia by stealing their boosts, threatening the opposing team with a boosted attack as they switch out. Heal Bell is a great support option to clear status from teammates, such as a paralyzed Tornadus-T and Rest Seismitoad. Thunder Wave irritates plenty of switch-ins like Heatran, Jirachi, and Volcarona and is especially potent against Mega Alakazam, essentially taking it out of commission in one turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The physical bulk investment allows Magearna to survive a +2 High Jump Kick from Hawlucha at full health, with the rest of the EVs pooled into Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful of Magearna's HP, as Pain Split is quite an unreliable method of recovery, and Magearna is liable to being chipped down easily by attacks. For the same reason, make sure to keep Spikes off of the field at all times. Heart Swap has half the PP of Calm Mind, so, if possible, it's optimal to use it after multiple opposing boosts to ensure that Magearna won't be stalled out of them. Pain Split can be essentially blocked if the opponent switches in a Pokemon at low health, so if they have a suitable candidate, it can be better to attack instead to finish it off or pivot out with Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is more tailored towards teams ranging from balance to stall, typically acting as a secondary check to Pokemon alongside its utility duties. Seismitoad has good defensive synergy with Magearna, as Seismitoad can check Heatran, and its Water Absorb works with Magearna's Dark resistance to handle Ash-Greninja as a team effort. Additionally, Heal Bell variants of Magearna can wake Seismitoad up from Rest. Wish support from the likes of Chansey and Clefable can decrease the burden on Magearna's Pain Split and prevent it from being worn down as easily. Toxapex and Kommo-o check the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and appreciate Magearna being able to handle Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele as well as Kyurem-B. Chansey takes the pressure off of Magearna when it comes to handling many special attackers, but it notably cannot safely handle Tapu Lele and can lose to bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus, which is why Heart Swap Magearna benefits it a lot as a teammate. Tornadus-T can add to the pivoting core with U-turn and helps to handle threats like Kartana and Mega Medicham. Gliscor has a helpful immunity to Ground and can check the hugely threatening Heatran for Magearna, with Magearna handling Ice-types like Kyurem-B and Weavile in return. Mega Latias complements Magearna perfectly, taking on Fire- and Ground-types like Victini and Gliscor while relying on Magearna for Dark- and Ice-types like Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Kyurem-B.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind turns Magearna into a threatening wallbreaker and a dangerous late-game cleaner and makes it more difficult for special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Mega Alakazam to take it down. Fleur Cannon hits neutral targets such as Landorus-T and Seismitoad hard and mows through Fighting- and Dragon-types like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Kommo-o, and Mega Latias. Ice Beam cleanly OHKOes the likes of Gliscor while still threatening Grass-types like Serperior and Tapu Bulu and Dragon-types like Kommo-o. Focus Blast pairs well with Fleur Cannon by hitting Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn for major damage. Aura Sphere has more PP and provides a more accurate Fighting-type coverage option to still hit the aforementioned Steel-types, at the expense of a significant drop in power, with Magearna no longer able to OHKO Excadrill without a boost. Finally, Thunderbolt allows Magearna to threaten the likes of Toxapex, Celesteela, and Mega Charizard Y super effectively, all of which can handle its other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread enables Magearna to survive a +2 High Jump Kick from Hawlucha and two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock, with Speed investment to outspeed Skarmory, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack. Aguav Berry can be used to gain back lost HP in a pinch after taking hits while setting up, more useful when faced with heavy hits like Landorus-T's Earthquake. Leftovers is another useful option in a similar manner to slowly regain health, making it harder for passive Pokemon like Chansey to meaningfully chip away at Magearna. If Magearna is knocked into low HP, Custap Berry allows it to net surprise damage against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Swampert after taking a hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Magearna fills a unique role as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaner, and a defensive stopgap that can take on monstrous special attackers like Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam, with Soul-Heart enabling it to nab a boost after a KO and mitigate the Special Attack drop from Fleur Cannon. It is highly recommended to ensure that Magearna stays as healthy as possible to handle Hawlucha and Kommo-o due to this set's limited longevity and, in the case of Hawlucha, the high amount of HP needed to survive one hit and revenge kill. Magearna often finds setup opportunities against Choice-locked Pokemon like Ash-Greninja locked into Dark Pulse and Kartana locked into Leaf Blade as well as passive Pokemon like non-Flamethrower Clefable, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Magearna can also use its bulk to trade against Pokemon like Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T, surviving their super effective hits and OHKOing them back with its boosted attacks. Magearna should avoid trying to set up if checks like Mega Swampert, Victini, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X are present and wait until they are dealt with before going for the sweep. Make sure to scout for any unexpected super effective coverage such as Fire Fang from Mega Mawile and Tectonic Rage from Protean Greninja. Despite being a solid answer to Weavile, Knock Off removes Magearna's Aguav Berry or Leftovers and reduces its longevity, especially if entry hazards are on the battlefield.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is geared towards offense and hyper offense teams, which value its defensive utility as a Steel-type and capability as a Calm Mind sweeper. Magearna appreciates wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B punching holes through opposing teams and breaking down the likes of Chansey, Heatran, and opposing Magearna. On hyper offense teams, a dedicated lead such as Mega Diancie, Taunt Mew, Landorus-T, or Excadrill is greatly appreciated, setting up entry hazards to help Magearna. Mega Diancie is especially notable, as it can bait in and use Substitute + Endeavor to potentially eliminate the likes of Heatran, Chansey, and defensive Magearna, all of which can take on Calm Mind Magearna. Serperior is a solid partner for Magearna, utilizing Taunt + Leaf Storm to beat Chansey one-on-one and Glare to cripple Pokemon faster than Magearna, such as Excadrill, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard Y, potentially sacrificing itself to do so. The chance of full paralysis also grants Magearna extra opportunities to set up Calm Mind, giving Magearna better chances to force through the likes of opposing Calm Mind Magearna and Heatran. Physical setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X are also solid partners, as they can force damage against shared checks like opposing Magearna and Toxapex for the other to clean up later in the game and take Fire-type attacks aimed at Magearna. Additionally, the former two, as well as Charizard before Mega Evolving, can set up against Choice Scarf Landorus-T locked into Earthquake thanks to their Ground immunity. In return, Magearna handles the likes of Weavile, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Alakazam. Mega Pinsir also enjoys partnering with Magearna, softening the likes of Celesteela and Ferrothorn while Magearna covers Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar and pressures Zapdos. Magearna also enjoys pairing with Volcarona, as it can threaten Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Celesteela. Additionally, they can pressure Chansey together, forcing it to burn through its Soft-Boiled PP, with Volcarona being able to potentially outplay it with Substitute + Swarm. Kommonium-Z Kommo-o is another solid teammate for Magearna and greatly appreciates the removal of Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Lele to clean up later in the game. Cresselia provides a safe switch-in against Ground-type moves aimed at Magearna as well as crucial support with Thunder Wave to cripple faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Lunar Dance to grant Magearna another chance to sweep.</p>"

      "Calm Mind + Pain Split": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Magearna to break past Tangrowth, Toxapex, and, in conjunction with Pain Split, Chansey, all of which it would otherwise struggle against. Pain Split allows Magearna to get some health back when it's low on HP and damage whatever is in front of it. Fleur Cannon with Fairium Z allows Magearna to annihilate bulky threats like Tangrowth, Chansey, and Ferrothorn when boosted enough. Thunderbolt is the best coverage move Magearna can use, as it hits Toxapex and Celesteela super effectively as well as Heatran for neutral damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs and 8 Special Defense EVs allow Magearna to survive two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock. 28 Defense EVs also allow Magearna to survive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Jolly Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick from full HP. While not always optimal, Magearna can use 96 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature to allow it to OHKO specially defensive Tapu Bulu with +1 Twinkle Tackle. With this spread, the rest of the EVs go into Defense or Special Defense to allow Magearna to more easily take Ground-type moves from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as attacks from Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Special Defense EVs can be used to sponge attacks from Mega Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele more easily. Shuca Berry is an alternative option that allows Magearna to effectively lure and remove Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp at the cost of some of its offensive potential. Wiki Berry is another option to improve Magearna's longevity and allow it to more reliably check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Magearna set works really well against defensive teams, as it can break through typical checks such as Chansey, Toxapex, and Gastrodon when boosted and can easily get multiple opportunities in a game to wallbreak thanks to Magearna's typing and the longevity Pain Split gives it. Magearna will usually find it impossible to sweep early- or mid-game against offensive teams, so in this matchup, it's usually best to use Magearna's fantastic defensive typing to sponge hits from threats like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T. Also, Twinkle Tackle hits incredibly hard even unboosted, which can allow Magearna to heavily damage or KO common switch-ins like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Excadrill. Be careful of using Calm Mind when the opponent has a threat that can outspeed and heavily damage or OHKO Magearna. These threats include Landorus-T, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Heatran, among others. Volcarona can even use Magearna as setup fodder. Pain Split is best used to keep Magearna healthy, and with consistent use you can usually keep it at fairly high HP throughout a game. Magearna can damage typical switch-ins like Chansey and Heatran and recover health against them if played smartly. When low on health, Magearna can usually find a way to gain some health back to put it in range of surviving an attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Gliscor and Rotom-W can check Heatran well while also pressuring Landorus-T, which are two of Magearna's most common checks. Threats like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Mawile that can heavily pressure Ground-types are appreciated, since Magearna can't really sweep with one of them still active. Entry hazard setters like Ash-Greninja, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie can really help with wearing down Heatran, which Magearna can struggle to break through. Mega Diancie is a particularly good partner, since it can wear down opposing Steel-types. Entry hazards can also help put Toxapex, opposing Magearna, and Ferrothorn into range of boosted Thunderbolt and Twinkle Tackle. Magearna hates Spikes and Stealth Rock, since they put it in range of moves like Landorus-T and Garchomp's Earthquake and Modest Heatran's Magma Storm. Defoggers like Gliscor and Rotom-W can check certain Landorus-T sets as well as Heatran, while Defog Tornadus-T helps wear down Heatran. Even though Magearna can take attacks from Garchomp and Landorus-T, it's generally not advised to do so. Thus, Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can at least switch into them and sponge hits. Tapu Bulu also summons Grassy Terrain, which weakens Earthquake and also gives Magearna another source of recovery. They also take some of the pressure off Magearna by being able to switch into Ash-Greninja and, in Tapu Bulu's case, Mega Alakazam, as this variant of Magearna struggles to switch into these threats consistently.</p>"

      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear gives Magearna a quick fix to its mediocre Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame as well as common Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Victini, with Soul-Heart then letting it quickly spiral out of control once it cannot be revenge killed. Focus Blast powered up into All-Out Pummeling allows Magearna to blow past Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn after they take even little chip damage. Fleur Cannon hits neutral targets hard and complements Focus Blast well. It can also be paired with Fairium Z to great effect, removing the Special Attack drop and allowing Magearna to start accruing Soul-Heart boosts. Thunderbolt allows Magearna to super effectively hit Toxapex and Celesteela, which are unbothered by Magearna's other moves, as well as hitting Pokemon like Victini and Mega Scizor neutrally. It can also be paired with Electrium Z to give Magearna an easier time versus the aforementioned Pokemon, especially when boosted by Electric Terrain. Ice Beam allows Magearna to safely dispatch Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp and heavily damage other Ice-weak Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Zapdos without needing to use Fleur Cannon or Twinkle Tackle. Calm Mind can be used alongside Shift Gear to make the most of any setup opportunity Magearna gets, letting it bypass its reliance on getting a KO to boost its power, usually utilizing a combination of Fleur Cannon and either Focus Blast to hit Ferrothorn or Thunderbolt to hit Toxapex.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Either Fightinium Z or Fairium Z can be used on Magearna variants featuring both Focus Blast and Fleur Cannon; if your team already has sufficient measures to deal with Steel-types, Fairium Z is the best option for taking on the wider metagame. Electrium Z eases Magearna's toughest matchups against Fire-types like Victini and Mega Charizard Y and synergizes well with Electric Terrain. Leftovers can be used to help Magearna weather hits while setting up, which is useful for the Calm Mind variant, though variants using three attacks prefer holding a Z-Crystal to maximize their power. Wiki Berry can be used in a similar fashion, being much more helpful if Magearna takes a big hit like Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, potentially putting it out of range of strong priority like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shift Gear Magearna is best used as an endgame cleaner, with its ability Soul-Heart making it the perfect fit for the role, as it punishes any sort of sacrifices the opponent makes, even when Magearna doesn't claim the KO itself. Because of this, and because of its complete lack of investment in bulk, it's unwise to allow Magearna to take hits throughout a game. It's often a better idea to conserve HP to afford Magearna more opportunities to set up late-game, additionally affording it comfort against priority attacks. Common Pokemon that can outspeed and revenge kill Magearna after a Shift Gear boost can be counted on one hand: Unburden-boosted Hawlucha, Sand Rush Excadrill in sand, Swift Swim Mega Swampert in rain, and Choice Scarf Kartana if Magearna has been chipped significantly prior. If any of these are present on the opposing team, it's wise to wait until they have been handled before going for a sweep. Magearna finds its ideal setup opportunities against Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Rotom-W that cannot immediately threaten it, although due to its good natural bulk and wonderful typing, it can find setup opportunities against the majority of the metagame if it needs to. Thunder Wave from would-be setup fodder like Ferrothorn and Clefable can hinder Magearna's sweep attempt, so it should be scouted prior.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is suited for offense and hyper offense teams that value its perfect toolkit as a cleaner. It's a good idea to pair Magearna with a defensive Steel-type, like Heatran or Ferrothorn, as it can't fulfill its typical duties as a defensive Steel-type when it has no bulk investment and needs to be preserved for later in the game. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham can soften up opposing teams, with the former being especially good at baiting in and weakening common switch-ins to Magearna, such as opposing defensive Magearna, Heatran, and Chansey. Rotom-W can check Mega Swampert and Sand Rush Excadrill, helping Magearna's team outlast them until it can boost and sweep. Ash-Greninja can chip away at Assault Vest Magearna and Ferrothorn as well as set Spikes, clearing the way for Magearna to sweep. Although niche, on hyper offense teams, Magearna appreciates dual screens and Aurora Veil support from the likes of Tapu Koko and Alolan Ninetales, respectively. Tapu Koko is another great hyper offense teammate, boosting the power of Magearna's Thunderbolt and Gigavolt Havoc and setting dual screens.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Twinkle Tackle allows for a one-time KO on many common neutral targets such as Gliscor, Clefable, Manaphy, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T. Once it is used up, Fleur Cannon can still be used as a powerful STAB move with no major drawback, as claiming a KO will give a Soul-Heart boost, which counteracts the Special Attack drop. Focus Blast is a solid coverage option that allows it to break through Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Thunderbolt deals good damage to Toxapex and Celesteela while also allowing Magearna to not waste its Fairium Z on Pokemon like Tornadus-T. If Magearna's teammates can cover the breaking of bulky Water- and Steel-types, other coverage moves can be looked at. Flash Cannon can be used as another solid neutral STAB option that doesn't lower Special Attack, while Ice Beam hits Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor, allowing Magearna to preserve its Z-Move against them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As this version of Magearna benefits from underspeeding opposing Pokemon, a Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs is preferable to become as slow as possible. Fairium Z allows Magearna to deal massive damage to neutral targets, which helps make use of the limited turns of Trick Room. Electrium Z can also be used to break past Toxapex and Celesteela, while Fightinium Z threatens Heatran and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trick Room Magearna typically forgoes its defensive duties in favor of becoming a dangerous late-game cleaner. It takes advantage of its solid bulk to help it set up Trick Room after the opposing team is weakened into range of its attacks. As a result, it doesn't really want to switch into hits early in the game, lest it become too chipped to sweep. Once Trick Room is set, you want to prioritize OHKOs on the opponent, as its turns are limited. This might entail using Magearna's Z-Move immediately in order to start stacking Soul-Heart boosts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Psychic- and Fairy-types are great partners for Magearna. Choice Specs Tapu Lele is great in this regard, as it deals solid damage to Steel-types that check Magearna, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and opposing Magearna, as well as providing Psychic Terrain to block priority such as Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Mega Medicham's and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out, with the latter being a way to stall Trick Room turns. Mega Mawile does similar things in regards to overwhelming shared checks and can potentially benefit from the Trick Room that Magearna can set. Spikes setters such as Greninja and Ferrothorn also make great teammates, as Spikes further chip the opponent's grounded Pokemon. Rotom-W is also a good fit alongside Magearna, as it checks Heatran and Ground-types like Landorus-T while spreading burn on Magearna answers such as Toxapex and opposing Magearna. Though uncommon, Magearna can also be used as a Trick Room setter on full Trick Room teams, as its defensive typing can allow it to set Trick Room multiple times; on these teams, it doesn’t need to preserve bulk to sweep because its teammates typically do the wallbreaking themselves.</p>"

  "Blacephalon": {
    "overview": "<p>Blacephalon is blessed with an outstanding Special Attack stat, which, coupled with its great offensive typing in Fire / Ghost, turns it into a deadly wallbreaker. Blacephalon sets itself apart from other special wallbreakers thanks to its high Speed stat, which lets it act as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf and outspeed a fair amount of the metagame without a boosting item. On top of that, Blacephalon's Beast Boost ability can boost its Special Attack by one stage after each KO or can be tuned to boost its Speed, further bolstering its late-game cleaning capabilities. However, Blacephalon has an annoying vulnerability to every entry hazard and a weakness to Stealth Rock. It is also weak to common priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, which allows these Pokemon to stop a late-game sweep from it and gain momentum by forcing it out. Finally, the presence of Tyranitar as a top-tier threat in the metagame hurts Blacephalon's viability, since it's unable to 2HKO Tyranitar on the switch without prior damage and falls prey to Pursuit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run to take advantage of Blacephalon's good STAB combination and potential to clean up against offensively oriented teams. However, it's incredibly awkward to fit onto teams. Knock Off on Choice Specs Blacephalon lets it get rid of items like Chansey's Eviolite and Mantine's Leftovers without losing the breaking power of Choice Specs, which allows it to even 2HKO Chansey on the switch with Fire Blast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Dark-types with access to Pursuit like Tyranitar and Weavile are a big nuisance for any Blacephalon set, since locking itself into a move they resist like Shadow Ball, or Flamethrower in Tyranitar's case, allows them to remove it from the game. Tyranitar in particular is quite troublesome because Blacephalon has no way to 2HKO it on the switch without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Kartana all outspeed and OHKO Choice Specs Blacephalon, while faster Choice Scarf users like Greninja can deal with Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Common priority moves like Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile and Bisharp, and Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt force out Blacephalon pretty reliably, since it's not bulky enough to take any of those hits.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Toxapex, Mantine, and Gastrodon resist Blacephalon's Fire STAB moves and aren't 2HKOed by Shadow Ball without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards, weather, and poison all stack up pretty quickly and can severely cripple Blacephalon, especially Stealth Rock, since it loses 25% of its HP every time it switches in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ground allows Blacephalon to potentially 2HKO Choice Band Tyranitar and is being a safe option against Heatran. Hidden Power Grass also nails Tyranitar after some prior damage, OHKOes Greninja on the switch, and deals with Gastrodon. Trick is meant to cripple Chansey on the switch in the stall matchup, which makes it easier for Blacephalon's teammates to break through it. Overheat is a stronger alternative to Fire Blast that guarantees an OHKO on some Pokemon like defensive Landorus-T and Clefable, but its Special Attack drop means that Blacephalon will be usually forced out after using it. Flamethrower is another alternative that can be run for more reliability, but the power drop from Fire Blast to Flamethrower is pretty noticeable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While Beast Boost isn't as useful for a Choice Specs set because Blacephalon is usually forced out by a revenge killer after KOing a foe, it still can be helpful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Blacephalon will be switching in several times during a game, so keeping entry hazards off the field is a priority. Blacephalon is very frail, so it's going to need to be brought into the field with the aid of VoltTurn users to start punching holes in the opposing team. Since few Pokemon resist Shadow Ball, it's a pretty safe move to use most of the time when facing a foe that Blacephalon forces out, though you have to watch out for Pursuit users like Weavile that could take advantage of Shadow Ball and trap it. Finally, don't throw out attacks recklessly if there's a Tyranitar on the opponent's team; play smart until you manage to weaken it for Blacephalon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog users like Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T take care of any entry hazards that would otherwise limit Blacephalon's switching opportunities. Pokemon with access to VoltTurn like Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W are great teammates because they can bring Blacephalon safely onto the field. Defensive pivots to fall back on when forced out by an offensive threat, like defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna, also make for great partners, especially if they are VoltTurn users that can get Blacephalon back onto the field easily. Teammates that pressure Tyranitar like Earthquake Mega Latios, All-Out Pummeling Tornadus-T, and Corkscrew Crash Heatran improve Blacephalon's matchup against Tyranitar teams by weakening or removing it from the game for Blacephalon to use its attacks safely. Finally, late-game cleaners that can capitalize on the holes Blacephalon punches, like Choice Scarf Kartana and Ash-Greninja, form a potent offensive core with it.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flamethrower is Blacephalon's most reliable Fire-type STAB move due to its perfect accuracy, and it is chosen over Fire Blast because the extra power isn't needed. Shadow Ball is Blacephalon's best Ghost-type STAB move and provides great coverage because it has only one resistance and one immunity. Substitute eases prediction on switches, makes Blacephalon harder to revenge kill, and gives it a number of setup opportunities, such as turning Chansey into setup fodder with avoidance of Toxic and immunity to Seismic Toss. Calm Mind boosts Blacephalon's Special Attack and Special Defense, meaning it can pose as more of a threat to bulkier Pokemon and, in some situations, take some hits despite its frailty.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment in conjunction with a Timid nature is used to maximize Blacephalon's Speed. 20 Special Attack EVs give Blacephalon as much firepower as possible while keeping its Special Attack one point lower than its Speed to ensure Beast Boost boosts Blacephalon's Speed. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to improve Blacephalon's poor bulk, and the last 4 EVs are put into Defense as opposed to HP to ensure Blacephalon can use Substitute four times instead of three while letting it always survive Hawlucha's Acrobatics from full HP. Alternatively, a simple spread with 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be run to boost Blacephalon's Special Attack, improving its matchup against bulkier teams. Ghostium Z turns Shadow Ball into a 160-Base Power Never-Ending Nightmare, allowing it to bust through Pokemon that can otherwise take a hit such as Heatran, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In situations where Blacephalon is forcing a switch, it is often the correct play to get up a Substitute in order to ease prediction and make it harder for your opponent to revenge kill Blacephalon. Be sure to use Blacephalon's Z-Move to break through bulkier Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from it in order to get a Speed boost and possibly sweep the opponent's team. Avoid letting foes afflict Blacephalon with paralysis or Toxic poison, as they severely hinder Blacephalon's offensive capabilities by making it very slow or putting it on a timer. It should be noted that this set lacks the power of other Blacephalon sets, so you'll need the opposing team to be weakened more than usual to attempt a sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Blacephalon set is used strictly on hyper offensive teams, as it has great matchups against both stall and offensive team archetypes, especially when it is behind dual screens. Entry hazard setters that fit on these offensive teams, such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Excadrill, are great partners, as they can weaken Pokemon and put them in range of Blacephalon's attacks. Excadrill's ability to use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards makes it a great partner, as Blacephalon is affected by every type of entry hazard. Pokemon such as Kartana and Mega Gyarados that can muscle past bulky Water-types, such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, Mantine, and Pyukumuku, are good assets to Blacephalon, as it struggles to break through these Pokemon, especially the former. Finally, Tapu Koko and Alolan Ninetales are wonderful teammates because they can set up either Light Screen and Reflect or Aurora Veil, respectively, for Blacephalon, making up for its poor bulk and giving it more setup opportunities.</p>"
