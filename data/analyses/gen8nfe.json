After a Growth and Stealth Rock damage, Solar Beam has a 93% chance to OHKO Eviolite Electabuzz, OHKOes a plethora of offensive Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Galarian Linoone, and 2HKOes every single Pokemon that does not resist Grass. While weaker, Giga Drain lets Ivysaur retain its bulk while sweeping, making it less likely to be revenge killed by Ice Shard Piloswine. Giga Drain is also able to be used after sun turns are over. Weather Ball gives Ivysaur a coverage move to hit Ferroseed and Klang, as well as other Steel-types for super effective damage, while also hitting Vullaby for significant damage. Sludge Bomb lets Iyvsaur do substantial amounts of damage outside of sun. Sleep Powder helps Iyvsaur set up on troublesome switch-ins like Galarian Corsola, and Rufflet, while Synthesis heals Iyvsaur, increasing its longevity without resorting to Giga Drain. The EV spread gives Iyvsaur enough speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame along with Choice Scarf Lampent under sun.</p> <p>Vulpix is Ivysaur's most important teammate, as it automatically sets up sun whenever it switches in. Additional sun sweepers are helpful, whether it's other Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Tangela or Fire-types like Lampent, Charmeleon, and Raboot. Ivysaur is especially vulnerable to Steel-types outside of sun, so the aforementioned Fire-types are useful for breaking past these threats. Some form of entry hazard removal is also recommended, as Ivysaur can be worn down by entry hazards rather quickly, so Hattrem or Wartortle is a good partner. Particularly, specially defensive Wartortle is a good partner, as it helps check Fire-types such as Lampent and Charmeleon while being able to pivot with Flip Turn. Shell Smash Wartortle with Weather Ball is a more offensive teammate option as well.</p>"

It can also utilise Weather Ball on sun teams to hit these targets. Nicher attacks like Water Spout and Zen Headbutt have some merit, but are generally too situational to justify over its better coverage or utility options. Instead of Toxic on defensive sets, Wartortle can opt for Yawn or Haze to either pair well with the slow Flip Turn, or check some setup sweepers like Combusken and Duosion. There's also the possibility for Wartortle to be specially defensive so that it may check Magmar and Lampent better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Thwackey can revenge kill Wartortle with a priority Grassy Glide, and Wartortle has a hard time breaking through defensive Grass-types like Roselia and Ferroseed without prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Shell Smash Wartortle won't be able to sweep when Mareanie and Ferroseed are still around, as they can wall its offensive attacks. They also discourage utility Wartortle by affecting it with residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Electabuzz uses super effective STAB attacks to break through defensive variants of Wartortle, and can pressure offensive ones before they have the chance to set up. Electabuzz is especially notable for being able to take a hit from Wartortle after a Shell Smash, although it must be wary of Surf boosted by Torrent.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Without reliable recovery, Wartortle can be quickly worn down by Toxic and entry hazards; the latter can be particularly damning, as Wartortle is unable to reliably keep hazards off the field against Ferroseed or Mareanie and can be worn down by continuously switching into Spikes or poison damage.</p>",

Shell Smash bolsters Wartortle's mediocre Special Attack to wallbreaking levels, with the Speed investment allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier in addition to a positive natured Combusken and Lampent at +1 Speed. Hydro Pump helps Wartortle clean up teams, albeit with shaky accuracy; after a Shell Smash, it also secures important 2HKOs on Pokemon like physically defensive Galarian Corsola and physically defensive Mareanie. Surf is a safer STAB option that, while not as strong, won't miss at a crucial moment. Ice Beam rounds out Wartortle's coverage, allowing it to hit Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Roselia and Fraxure. The last slot is adaptable to what a team needs. Substitute allows Wartortle to set up easily against passive Pokemon like Slowpoke and can put Wartortle in range of Torrent, providing it with access to a much stronger STAB move. Alternatively, Rapid Spin provides Wartortle with a form of entry hazard removal if the team needs it.</p> <p>Wartortle should be used mid- to late-game to sweep vulnerable teams. To this end, Pokemon that commonly counter Wartortle such as Ferroseed and Mareanie should be put in range of a KO before attempting to set up Shell Smash, lest they threaten Wartortle out with Bullet Seed or Haze respectively. Knock Off users such as Tangela and Gurdurr make for excellent partners, as they can often force the aforementioned Pokemon onto the field and remove their Eviolite with Knock Off. Similarly, Electric-types like Electabuzz and Pikachu pair nicely with Wartortle, as they can damage shared counters like Ferroseed and Roselia, and Wartortle in return pressures the Ground-types like Marshtomp that they might otherwise struggle to deal with. Wartortle is pressured by priority users, notably Pikachu and Thwackey, so Pokemon that can limit their switchin opportunities like Spikes Ferroseed and Toxic Spikes Koffing pair well with Wartortle. Lastly, it can often be difficult to set up Shell Smash multiple times throughout a battle, so Wish and Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Clefairy and Hattrem greatly benefit Wartortle in this regard.</p>"

Wartortle also acts as a pivot with Flip Turn when checking these attackers, allowing it to generate momentum against switch-ins. Scald also threatens to burn physical attackers Wartortle checks and deters spinblockers like Lampent, while Seismic Toss offers more pressure against bulkier Pokemon like Koffing, Hattrem, and Ferroseed. Toxic pressures opposing walls such as Galarian Corsola, Tangela, and Vullaby, with the former being notable as an ineffective spinblocker if it gets worn down by Toxic damage.</p> <p>It is often best to pair Wartortle with additional pivots that appreciate it as a switch-in to physical attackers and for removing entry hazards. To this end, offensive pivots like Thwackey, Raboot, and Electabuzz make for great partners. Special walls like Klang and Ferroseed check Kadabra and Gastly for Wartortle, while in return, Wartortle can switch into attacks from Magmar and Piloswine. These Steel-types also work as Toxic switch-ins for Wartortle, and partners like Koffing, Roselia, and Hattrem can either absorb or prevent opposing attempts to set Toxic Spikes. Both offensive and defensive Grass-types check Wartortle, as it has little to deter them, but it can at least avoid them by pivoting out into wallbreakers like Lampent, Choice Band Piloswine, and Raboot. Finally, support from Wish and Healing Wish users like Clefairy, Togetic, and Hattrem combat Wartortle's lack of recovery, allowing it function more effectively throughout the match.</p>"

Knock Off should be used often early-game to remove as many Eviolites as possible to help with cleaners like Gurdurr and Wartortle. Wallbreakers, such as Rufflet and Piloswine, also appreciate Knock Off support as well as Clefairy's ability to lower the speed of opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Specially defensive walls like Klang, Mareanie, and Ferroseed make for solid partners and are reliable switch-ins to Gastly so that Clefairy is not as easily revenge killed by it.

Pain Split keeps Koffing healthy and allows it to often outlast the opponent's hazard control to ensure that Toxic Spikes stay up in the long run. Thief is used to remove Eviolite from the opponent while simultaneously allowing Koffing to better check Knock Off users like Thwackey and Gurdurr, while Will-O-Wisp can alternatively be used to cripple physical attackers and walls like Piloswine, Ferroseed, and Mareanie. Neutralizing Gas provides a huge amount of utility for Koffing and makes it far more reliable as a Toxic Spikes setter, negating Hattrem's Magic Bounce. It also makes it far easier to wear down Regenerator and Magic Guard users like Tangela and Clefairy, respectively. Additionally, because it can nullify Guts, Neutralizing Gas Koffing is one of the very few Pokemon that can switch into Flame Orb variants of Gurdurr and Machoke.</p> <p>Koffing should be paired with teammates that can take full advantage of Toxic Spikes support. Pokemon with Protect or Substitute, like Substitute + Calm Mind Lampent and Wish + Protect Clefairy, become far more dangerous once their foes are poisoned. Piloswine is a particularly good beneficiary of Toxic Spikes, as it can dissuade opposing Poison-types like Roselia and Mareanie from switching in and most of its switch-ins are vulnerable to poison. Pivots like Electabuzz, Thwackey, and Galarian Linoone benefit from Koffing's ability to pressure Tangela thanks to Neutralizing Gas cancelling out Regenerator and can keep it low by pivoting into Koffing. Koffing's greatest enemies are grounded Poison-types like Roselia and Mareanie, which can absorb its Toxic Spikes. Hattrem can prevent these Pokemon from setting up hazards and force them out, and Future Sight Duosion can gain momentum to put out strong offensive pressure. Good defensive partners for Koffing are special walls like Ferroseed and Marshtomp, as they can defeat common special attackers like Wartortle and Electabuzz that force Koffing out.</p>"

Ferroseed can freely set up Spikes against Marshtomp.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Hattrem prevents Marshtomp from setting up Stealth Rock, reflects its status moves, and often carries Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Rufflet and Duosion can use Marshtomp as setup fodder. The former has Substitute to avoid Marshtomp's status moves, while Duosion is immune to Toxic but must be wary of Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Marshtomp is vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards and status moves due to its lack of reliable recovery, which limits its ability to check offensive threats.</p>",

Gabite does compete in these roles, and it may appear to outclass Marshtomp with its better Speed and even better defensive typing. However, Marshtomp beating Ice Punch Electabuzz and checking Fire-types better makes it plenty worthwhile. With RestTalk, it can afford to take repeated hits and chip damage. It only needs Earthquake as an attack because, while it cannot harm most Flying- and Grass-types, using Stealth Rock when they switch in suffices as punishment. In the event the team can afford another Stealth Rock user, then Marshtomp could opt for Scald or Yawn instead to pressure foes with status, though neither are as effective as Stealth Rock. A mixed defensive EV spread works best, as Marshtomp does not need much special bulk to counter Electabuzz, whereas extra physical bulk helps with Raboot.</p> <p>Defoggers and Rapid Spin users like Vullaby and Wartortle often switch into Marshtomp when it uses Stealth Rock. Switching to an offensive teammate like Electabuzz, Choice Band Raboot, and Fraxure as they clear Stealth Rock is a great way to bring them in safely and preserve momentum; if they don't go for removal, then Marshtomp at least secured Stealth Rock to punish them later on. As for Hattrem and its Magic Bounce, use Dark-types like Galarian Linoone, Vullaby, and Zweilous to beat it, as well as offensive partners like Lampent and Thwackey that can switch into Giga Drain with no problem.

Physical walls such as Koffing, Tangela, and Gurdurr benefit from Marshtomp checking special wallbreakers such as Gastly and Lampent; in return, they handle physical wallbreakers such as Thwackey and Gurdurr. Pokemon that provide entry hazard control like Gurdurr, Hattrem, and Vullaby keep Marshtomp from being quickly worn down by residual damage. As a wall that lacks reliable recovery, Marshtomp greatly appreciates support from Wish and Healing Wish users such as Clefairy and Hattrem.

Nonetheless, Drilbur has some issues in trying to get Stealth Rock up against fast Taunt users such as Electabuzz, Galarian Linoone, and Thwackey, with Electabuzz and Galarian Linoone switching out afterwards and Thwackey threatening it. Wartortle is the perfect counter to Drilbur, as it can deny Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and break Focus Sash. Piloswine and Thwackey can also limit Drilbur's utility with their respective STAB attacks, though they need first to break Focus Sash. Pokemon such as Electabuzz can switch in against Wartortle and gain momentum. Shell Smash Wartortle and Bulk Up Raboot can also take advantage of Piloswine and Thwackey, respectively, using them as setup fodder.</p>"

Knock Off is Gurdurr's best coverage move, hitting Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Hattrem for massive damage while also making it easier to break through other Pokemon like Clefairy and Mareanie by removing their Eviolite. Mach Punch rounds off the set, helping to take out weakened faster attackers like Electabuzz and Rufflet. Ice Punch can be used over either of the last two moves, reducing Gurdurr's offensive utility but in turn giving it a way to more immediately damage Roselia and still hit neutral targets for respectable damage. The Speed investment allows Gurdurr to outpace uninvested Piloswine and Hattrem, although this can be invested into bulk if preferred.</p> <p>Gurdurr can struggle to get past physically defensive walls like Tangela, Clefairy, and Galarian Corsola; other physical attackers like Galarian Linoone, Raboot, and Piloswine can assist in breaking down these shared answers while the latter two also greatly benefit from Gurdurr removing foe's items. Similarly, special attackers like Roselia and Duosion can increase Gurdurr's breaking potential with Spikes and Future Sight support, respectively, and can switch into the aforementioned walls with ease.

Knock Off further increases its utility by crippling switch-ins. Toxic shores up Gurdurr's otherwise poor matchup into Galarian Corsola, but Ice Punch and High Horsepower are alternatives that help against Poison-type entry hazard setters in Roselia, Koffing, and Mareanie. The defensive investment allows Gurdurr to take two hits from Choice Band Raboot's High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock while also avoiding a 3HKO from Piloswine and other variants of Raboot, with the rest invested into Attack to increase Gurdurr's damage output.</p> <p>Gurdurr's best teammates will vary depending on the fourth slot chosen; when using Toxic, Gurdurr will have a difficult time against the aforementioned Poison-types, so Pokemon that can pressure these or use them as setup fodder like Lampent, Ferroseed, and Duosion are fantastic partners.

Klang is strong, but not enough to take out most of the metagame with only one boost. For that reason, it greatly appreciates all forms of residual damage. Entry hazards are excellent support for Klang; Spikes support from Roselia and Ferroseed greatly increases Klang's chances of sweeping by notably whittling the HP of opposing Lampent and Electabuzz down. Excellent partners for Klang also include Knock Off users such as Tangela and Mareanie, which remove the Eviolite from Fighting-types as well as Galarian Corsola, rendering them all more susceptible to being swept by a boosted Klang.</p>"

Lampent's unique typing makes it difficult for many priority users to revenge kill it, as it is immune to Gurdurr's Mach Punch and resists Thwackey's Grassy Glide and Piloswine's Ice Shard. Trick cripples common defensive switch-ins like Mareanie and Clefairy, which Lampent cannot break past with attacks alone. Calm Mind lets Lampent function as a potent setup sweeper once it has given away its Choice Scarf. Energy Ball, which hits Marshtomp and Wartortle, and the more accurate Fire-type STAB move Flamethrower are also valid alternatives in the last slot.</p> <p>As a Choice Scarf user, Lampent should look to offensively check fast Pokemon such as Abra and Thwackey, and it should be primarily used for late-game cleaning and revenge killing purposes. Trick can cripple walls like Mareanie and Clefairy after the fast foes have been removed. Lampent should be paired with a Rapid Spin or Defogger such as Vullaby, Wartortle, or Gurdurr to overcome its weakness to entry hazards. Slow pivots like Clefairy, Slowpoke, and the aforementioned Wartortle help to bring Lampent in safely and have the added benefit of being able to cover for its Dark- and Water-type weaknesses. Knock Off support from Tangela, Vullaby, and Ferroseed, as well as entry hazard users like Metang and Roselia, help to weaken opposing Pokemon into Lampent's KO range.

        "description": "<p>Lampent is a powerful wallbreaker in the NFE metagame thanks to its great offensive typing and high Special Attack stat. Calm Mind is used to boost Lampent's Special Attack, making it a threat against passive teams. At +1 Lampent can 2HKO threats like Machoke and Piloswine amongst others. Flamethrower is used to take down Grass-, Steel-, and Bug-types such as Thwackey, Tangela, Ferroseed, and Charjabug. Shadow Ball is used against Ghost- and Psychic-types, namely Galarian Corsola, Hattrem, and Abra. With Substitute, Lampent can easily set up against Pokemon that can't damage it, particularly Raboot, Klang, and defensive Pokemon like Charjabug and Roselia, allowing it to set up for free or KO aforementioned Pokemon. Eviolite is the preferred item, as it enables Lampent's Substitute to stay up, while Heavy-Duty Boots allow it to reliably get on the field without taking chip from entry hazards. 252 Speed EVs allow Lampent to outspeed slower targets like Gurdurr, Piloswine, and Tangela. Timid, however, should always be used when paired with Sticky Web, as it allows Lampent to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <p>Lampent struggles against Dark-types like Vullaby and Galarian Linoone, which can easily switch in and force it out with Knock Off. Gurdurr, Machoke, and Charjabug are great partners, since they can deal with Dark-types and absorb Knock Off, while the former two can provide Knock Off support and Charjabug can set Sticky Web, making it easier for Lampent to sweep offensive teams. In return, Lampent can deal with Fire-types such as Raboot for Charjabug and can weaken walls, namely Tangela and Galarian Corsola for Gurdurr and Machoke. Lampent appreciates pivot support from Pokemon like Wartortle and Thwackey, as they can easily let Lampent in while also checking faster attackers like Raboot and Krokorok. If Lampent is not running Heavy-Duty Boots, then Defog and Rapid Spin users like Vullaby, Gurdurr, and Wartortle are greatly appreciated to circumvent Lampent's Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>For more immediate power, Lampent can opt for a Choice Specs set, which lets it 2HKO special walls such as Clefairy and Wartortle after their Eviolite has been removed, although it is at the cost of being very easy to revenge kill. Psychic allows Lampent to 2HKO Gurdurr and Mareanie after a Calm Mind boost or if holding a Choice Specs. Will-O-Wisp is a niche option to cripple physical attackers such as Vullaby and Marshtomp, which may try to switch in on it.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Many Ground-types have favorable match ups against Lampent, with Gabite and Krokorok outspeeding non-Choice Scarf variants and Marshtomp and Piloswine being bulky enough to withstand an attack and OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Wartortle, and Marshtomp threaten Lampent with their STAB attacks or Haze, preventing it from sweeping them. They have to watch out for Psychic or Energy Ball, though.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Knock Off</strong>: Vullaby and Galarian Linoone can switch into any of Lampent's attacks and force it out. Powerful attackers such as Thwackey are able to revenge kill non-Choice Scarf variants of Lampent with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Walls</strong>: While these examples are niche, it should be noted that Trace Porygon and Munchlax hard counter Lampent, although they all dislike switching into Trick.</p>"

Entry hazard setter like Galarian Corsola, Ferroseed, and Roselia are also good partners as they can help wear down threats with Stealth Rock or Spikes damage for threats to be in range of being KOed. Additionally, using Pokemon that can prevent hazards from being set like Hattrem is also encouraged, as Fraxure needs to be kept healthy to function properly. Hattrem can also heal Fraxure to full with Healing Wish to give it a second chance at sweeping. When running Swords Dance, Fraxure benefits from Sticky Web setters like Charjabug that can help lower the Speed of Choice Scarf users that may threaten Fraxure such as Krokorok and Lampent.

U-turn is Torracat's main pivoting attack, allowing it to inflict a small amount of chip damage on its foe; however, Parting Shot can be used instead, as it can weaken opposing damage output and allow for a partner to come in without risking too much damage. Taunt allows Torracat to prevent walls like Galarian Corsola, Mareanie, and Clefairy from recovering, setting entry hazards, and setting up. Overheat is Torracat's strongest attack, allowing it to hit Grass-, Bug-, and Steel-types like Tangela, Charjabug, and Ferroseed and OHKOing them after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower can also be an option when paired with Nasty Plot, allowing Torracat to stallbreak threats like Galarian Corsola and Clefairy. Will-O-Wisp enables Torracat to threaten physical attackers like Piloswine, while Toxic is also an option, as it cripples walls like Palpitoad and Gabite. Eviolite is prefered for the extra bulk for walling Thwackey, while Heavy-Duty Boots is an option so that Torract relies less on ant-entry hazard support.</p> <p>Torracat fits well on balance teams, as it can prolong momentum and offensive pressure. Torracat is great at applying pressure through U-turn or Parting Shot by luring in threats like Mareanie and Galarian Corsola; therefore, carrying Pokemon that can utilize that pressure like Electabuzz and Thwackey is helpful, as they can deal with these threats and keep up momentum. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are also one of Torracat's biggest weaknesses if it opts for Eviolite, thus having consistent entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Hattrem, Vullaby, and Wartortle is essential. In addition, carrying entry hazard setters like Piloswine, Ferroseed, and Marshtomp can help Torracat's role by luring in threats like Machoke and Hattrem, forcing their health to be chipped down. Torracat is also very susceptible to Fire- and Water-type checks like Lampent, Mareanie, and Wartortle; therefore, pairing it with Water- and Grass-types like specially defensive Palpitoad, Vullaby, and Roselia is encouraged. Furthermore, Knock Off users like Thwackey, Galarian Linoone, and Krokorok are good partners to wear down threats and revenge kill opposing Pokemon.</p>"

It's also blessed with a solid Defense stat and a resistance to Fighting, which lets it switch into Gurdurr and Machoke with relative ease. Skitter Smack is Charjabug's primary attack due to its ability to cripple special attackers that may switch in such as Lampent and Hattrem while also being powerful enough to 2HKO Choice Specs variants of the latter. Volt Switch lets Charjabug generate momentum and safely switch out of setup sweepers such as Combusken, Klang, and Fraxure, which all would otherwise use it as setup fodder. Lastly, Toxic allows Charjabug to cripple Defog users like Vullaby and Gurdurr in addition to opposing hazard setters like Galarian Corsola and Piloswine. Alternatively, Thunder Wave allows Charjabug to cripple Vullaby, and can lower the Speed of Pokemon that are unaffected by Sticky Web such as Drakloak and Klang.</p> <p>Charjabug should aim to set up Sticky Web as early in the game as possible, although it should be wary of Magic Bounce if Hattrem is present on the opponent's team. After Sticky Web has been set, Charjabug can freely spread status and use Volt Switch to pivot into strong breakers to take advantage. Wallbreakers like Machoke, Rufflet, and Gastly make great use of the speed control that Charjabug provides and benefit greatly from its ability to bring them in safely with a slow Volt Switch, the latter also being an offensive spinblocker. Charjabug has no reliable recovery and is very prone to being worn down, so pairing it with Wish users like Clefairy and Togetic can increase its longevity; the aforementioned Fairy-types also function as great physically defensive walls and can alleviate some pressure from Charjabug. Charjabug's weakness to entry hazards limits the number of times it is able to switch in, so Rapid Spin users like Wartortle can be beneficial. Spikes users such as Carkol, Roselia, and Ferroseed not only form solid entry hazard-stacking cores but can act as specially defensive walls covering Charjabug's mediocre special bulk.</p>"

Other bulky Pokemon like Gurdurr and Klang appreciate Mareanie scouting stronger attacks for them, as it can easily switch into Moonblast and Flamethrower from Clefairy and Lampent, respectively. While Mareanie has a weakness to Earthquake, it could be worthwhile to stay in and use Knock Off on tanks that use Earthquake, such as Piloswine and Marshtomp, if removing their Eviolite is essential for the team’s win condition; in these cases, pair Mareanie with offensive sweepers like Electabuzz and Raboot. Otherwise, Ground-type checks such as Thwackey and Galarian Corsola can help.

It can take advantage of these Pokemon to set up with Dragon Dance, which helps compensate for its middling Speed and Attack stats and allows it to sweep late-game. Substitute provides Hakamo-o with even more opportunities to set up, as it can set up a Substitute in front of Pokemon like Tangela, Shadow Ball Galarian Corsola, and Ferroseed to boost up without fear of getting statused or having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off. Dual Chop can be used in place of Dragon Claw to KO Focus Sash Abra after a Dragon Dance and damage foes like Lampent through a Substitute, but the imperfect accuracy and increased chance of triggering Galarian Corsola's Cursed Body make it a risky option. Drain Punch helps to compensate for the HP lost when setting up Substitute and makes it very difficult for Hakamo-o to be worn down low enough to be knocked out by a priority move. Alternatively, Iron Head can be used to KO weakened Fairy-types after a boost, especially if their Eviolite has been removed. Bulletproof makes Hakamo-o immune to Koffing's Sludge Bomb and Lampent's Shadow Ball, which makes it an effective check to both of those Pokemon and gives it more chances to set up.</p> <p>Hakamo-o struggles a lot against Fairy-types like Clefairy and Togetic, particularly if it isn't running Iron Head, and needs foes like Galarian Corsola and Haze Mareanie to be weakened before it can sweep. As such, Gurdurr, Tangela, and Machoke make for great teammates for Hakamo-o, as they use Knock Off to remove Eviolites from physical walls, and Machoke variants with Heavy Slam or Flame Orb + Facade can lure in and KO or heavily weaken Fairy-types. A Steel-type like Klang can check the aforementioned Fairy-types as well as Psychic-types like Duosion and Abra, which force Hakamo-o out. Choice Band Thwackey partners nicely with Hakamo-o, as it can bring it in safely via U-turn against Tangela, Koffing, and Ferroseed, which Hakamo-o can set up against, or wear them down shared checks like Galarian Corsola with Knock Off. The passive recovery from Grassy Terrain that Thwackey provides allows Hakamo-o to stay healthy as it cuts its HP for Substitute.

Mystical Fire targets Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Metang, and Klang and 2HKOes Charjabug. Dazzling Gleam helps take down Dark-types such as Vullaby, Galarian Linoone, and Krokorok. Healing Wish can be used to restore a teammate to full health when Hattrem's wallbreaking is no longer needed. Alternatively, Dark Pulse lets it beat Galarian Corsola and opposing Hattrem.</p> <p>Since Hattrem is a special wallbreaker, it should be paired with physical wallbreakers and setup sweepers that appreciate the removal of physical walls, like Raboot and Thwackey. Knock Off users such as Gurdurr and Tangela increase Hattrem's wallbreaking prowess while also absorbing Knock Off for it; in return, Hattrem beats Koffing and Galarian Corsola. Hattrem is relatively frail without Eviolite, so slow pivots such as Charjabug and Clefairy can bring it in safely. Hattrem also benefits from the former's Sticky Web, as it is not a fast wallbreaker. Faster Pokemon such as Gastly and Morgrem easily revenge kill Hattrem with their STAB attacks, so it is important to have switch-ins like Ferroseed and Klang to deal with these Pokemon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set is immediately powerful and utilizes Trick, although the Nasty Plot set tends to be more consistent at wallbreaking, and  has Sucker Punch to make it harder to revenge kill. Choice Scarf is effective at revenge killing fast Pokemon weak to Morgrem's STAB attacks like Abra and Galarian Linoone.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Roselia and Mareanie resist Morgrem's Fairy-type coverage, and are bulky enough to stop setup sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types like Ferroseed, Klang, and Metang pressure the frail Morgrem. However, Ferroseed and Metang are less reliable in stopping Nasty Plot sets that carry Mystical Fire and Dark Pulse.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Morgrem is commonly known for being the best screen setter in NFE. Its ability, Prankster, allows it to use a status move before usually fainting or being attacked. Light Screen and Reflect are moves used to support Morgrem's teammates and are also used to compensate for Morgrem's average bulk and lack of Eviolite. Thunder Wave is Morgrem's best status move, allowing it to target faster attackers that can otherwise be a threat such as Raboot and Shell Smash Wartortle. Morgrem can also use Taunt to shut down walls like Galarian Corsola and Ferroseed and prevent Vullaby and Togetic from clearing dual screens with Defog. Dazzling Gleam is Morgrem's best damaging move that hits common wallbreakers like Gurdurr, Fraxure, and Galarian Linoone. 192 SpA allows for Morgrem to OHKO Flame Orb Machoke after Stealth Rock damage while 128 Speed EVs allow Morgrem to outspeed Flame Orb Machoke.</p> <p>Morgrem best functions early- to late-game as a support to offensive teams and usually is best paired with wallbreakers and set up sweepers, as the provided longevity allows them to tank opposing attacks better. Pokemon like Raboot, Flame Orb Machoke, Choice Band Piloswine, Thwackey, and Wartortle are especially good under screen support. You should try to avoid bringing Morgrem in on Pokemon that commonly run Knock Off, as you want to have your dual screens last for longer; alternatively, if it can afford to, Morgrem's resistance to Knock Off helps it switch into Galarian Linoone and Gurdurr for teammates. Additionally, offensive entry hazard setters like Piloswine, Roselia, and Drilbur are good partners, as they can keep an offensive pressure up while also benefiting the rest of the team by putting threats in range of attacks.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Morgrem is one of NFE's best setup wallbreakers thanks to its access in to Nasty Plot and great STAB attacks allowing it to break down walls like Galarian Corsola, Tangela, and Vullaby. Morgrem's typing also allows it to set up on threats like Hattrem and Duosion, while its middling Speed takes advantage of slower threats like Machoke, Fraxure, and Lampent with its STAB attacks. Sucker Punch enables Morgrem to OHKO faster attackers like Abra and Gastly that otherwise easily get rid of Morgrem with their coverage. Burning Jealousy is also an option to better handle Steel- and Grass-types like Klang, Ferroseed, and Roselia. Morgrem's double resistance to Dark-type attacks allows it to be a good switch-in to Knock Off, which in turn offers an opportunity to steal the Eviolite off checks like Clefairy and Mareanie thanks to Pickpocket.</p> <p>While Morgrem can be a great wallbreaker, it is very reliant on Nasty Plot and therefore takes up a turn or two before fulfilling its role completely. Morgrem has trouble breaking specially defensive walls like Mareanie, Clefairy, and Klang, so use strong physical attackers like Piloswine and Raboot to prevent these walls from blocking Morgrem. Knock Off support from users like Gurdurr, Vullaby, and Thwackey is also recommended, as they enable Morgrem to sweep without depending as much on Nasty Plot. Entry hazard setters like Koffing, Ferroseed, and Piloswine are additionally great partners, as their hazards inflict status or chip down opposing Pokemon for Morgrem's sweep. Morgrem falls into a Speed tier where it gets easily get revenge killed by faster attackers that can tank Sucker Punch, so having a Sticky Web setter like Charjabug is appreciated; furthermore, Charjabug also safely switches Morgrem in with Volt Switch to punish Machoke and Hattrem.</p>"

  "Drakloak": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>By utilizing Hex and status options in Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, Drakloak functions as a check to mutliple offensive attackers like Thwackey and Raboot. Substitute sets may also take advantage of these status moves along with Disable to wall Pokemon that only have one worthwhile attack against Drakloak like Gurdurr. Physical sets take advantage of Drakloak's better Attack compared to its Special Attack at the cost of less utility and generally worse coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon with good special bulk like Clefairy, Roselia, and Togetic wall out Drakloak's attacks. Other special walls like Klang, Ferroseed, and Roselia can take most hits from Drakloak, but struggle switching into Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Vullaby and Morgrem use their bulk and resistances to take out Drakloak. Faster Dark-types like Toxic Orb Galarian Linoone and Choice Scarf Krokorok can OHKO Drakloak with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Tanks</strong>: Drakloak is generally weak, which makes it lose trades against tanks like Gurdurr, Machoke, and especially Piloswine with its priority in Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While Drakloak is naturally fast, it can be revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Gastly and Krokorok as well as priority from Piloswine.</p>",

      "Fast Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Hex Drakloak functions as an offensive pivot in the NFE metagame where its aim is to spread status in Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to threats like Thwackey and Raboot, crippling their damage output or Speed. Hex in combination with these allows walls like Galarian Corsola and Mareanie to be broken down easily, and U-turn gives Drakloak the opportunity to pivot out of the field to generate momentum or when threats are not yet in range of its attacks. Fire Blast enables Drakloak to force out Steel-types like Ferroseed that may try to switch into Drakloak and take advantage of it by setting hazards up. Draco Meteor, on the other hand, can be used to output strong damage against the general metagame as well as to hit Pokemon that resist Hex or are immune to the status of choice like Galarian Linoone, Electabuzz, and Piloswine. Infiltrator enables Drakloak to bypass Substitute users like Lampent whilst also ignoring Light Screen and Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Holding the second highest Speed in the metagame, Drakloak enjoys being paired with other pivots like Thwackey, Electabuzz, and Raboot that value momentum and take advantage of statused threats. Slow Pokemon like Gurdurr and Piloswine really benefit from this, as the spread of paralysis allows them to outspeed the general metagame and impose a better offensive presence. Drakloak's biggest downfall is its low damage output, especially against threats that have not been inflicted with status yet, so having multiple Knock Off and Toxic users like Ferroseed, Thwackey, and Mareanie is beneficial to Drakloak, as they allow it to click Hex more liberally. Drakloak isn't particularly bulky either and lacks recovery, which endorses entry hazard damage as one of its downfalls. As such, having Wish passers like Clefairy or Healing Wish users like Hattrem is a good way to keep Drakloak's longevity intact, especially as Hattrem can prevent entry hazards from being set and has a good matchup against Stealth Rock setters like Piloswine that can easily beat Drakloak. In return, Drakloak can paralyze Vullaby, which easily switches into Hattrem, and limit its ability to use Roost.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>The main appeal of Drakloak is its impressive Speed that puts it above the entire unboosted metagame barring Electabuzz. As a result, Drakloak will almost always be able to move first and thus can act as a revenge killer and wallbreaker at the same time. Choice Specs boosts its mediocre Special Attack to acceptable levels and turns Draco Meteor into a powerful attack able to take out weakened foes and punch holes through would-be switch-ins such as Piloswine, Galarian Linoone, and Machoke. Shadow Ball is a more spammable STAB move and targets notable threats including Galarian Corsola, Duosion, and Hattrem. Fire Blast is Drakloak's best option against Ferroseed and Klang, which otherwise fear little from it. Finally, U-turn eases prediction and allows Drakloak to generate momentum by pivoting into the appropriate teammate depending on the opponent's play. Infiltrator and Clear Body are both useful abilities and the choice between them depends on your preference. The former offers security against Substitute users such as Lampent and screens-based offense teams, whereas the latter improves Drakloak's match up against Sticky Web teams and allows it to play aggressively by switching in against a predicted Mystical Fire or Parting Shot from Hattrem or Galarian Linoone, respectively.</p> <p>Use Drakloak as a revenge killer. It is particularly recommended to choose it if your team desperately needs speed control, particularly from a Pokemon that can pressure faster Pokemon like Thwackey and Raboot. Take it into account if you also want a way of breaking past Galarian Corsola and Tangela. Drakloak appreciates being paired with ways of weakening opposing Pokemon so that it has an easier time revenge killing. For that reason, Knock Off support from the likes of Gurdurr, Mareanie, and Ferroseed is very useful to get rid of Eviolites. Ferroseed can also set up Spikes, which improves Drakloak's ability to break down walls in tandem with U-turn. Conversely, Drakloak is signifigantly vulnerable to Knock Off itself, and should have partners like Trick Clefairy and Covet Roselia that can switch into this attack. Since Drakloak's Special Attack is lackluster, having another wallbreaker is recommended; in this regard, Rufflet, Choice Specs Roselia, and Choice Band Raboot are excellent choices.</p>"
