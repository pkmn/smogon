  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>With a pure Water typing that gives it no physical weakness and a usable Defense stat, Milotic stands out as one of the main defensive Pokemon in the tier. Although it receives a lot of competition from fellow bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, as it has an inferior Defense stat and lacks advantages such as Swampert's resistance to Rock and Suicune's access to Calm Mind, there are solid reasons to use it. Its access to Recover makes it not as easily worn down by repeated damage, and its defensive stats make it one of the best answers to mixed attackers such as Tyranitar and Salamence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat is an interesting option to surprise Pokemon that may try to hit Milotic with a special attack, because it can survive most of them and heal itself with Recover later. An offensive, fast EV spread can be used, as it allows Milotic to heavily damage foes with attacking moves and have a greater chance to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep with Hypnosis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Celebi is the best counter to Milotic. It takes basically nothing from Surf, takes Ice Beam quite well, and has Natural Cure to mitigate status. It can also force Milotic out via Leech Seed or begin setting up on it with Calm Mind. Snorlax takes little damage from Milotic's attacks and can capitalize on it by setting up with Curse, especially if Milotic does not have Hypnosis or Sleep Clause has already been activated. Thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey doesn't care too much about anything Milotic does and can force it out with the threat of Toxic and the rare Sing. However, other variants of Blissey can't do much to Milotic except stalling it out for a bit. Other Pokemon with Natural Cure such as Starmie can stall out Milotic's PP. Rest and Substitute variants of Suicune can turn Milotic into setup fodder, though other variants don't appreciate being statused. Jirachi can also set up against Milotic, but it must be wary of switching in, as it does not brush off Milotic's attacks as easily as the previously mentioned Pokemon. With the significant damage output their STAB Thunderbolt provides against Milotic, Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos and Jolteon can force it out. However, they don't appreciate taking repeated attacks or status. Standard Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster can lay Spikes against Milotic if they are not put to sleep. Afterwards, the combination of sand and Spikes severely reduces Milotic's efficacy, because indirect damage puts it into 2HKO range of many attacks that otherwise 3HKO it, such as +1 Salamence's Hidden Power Flying, +1 Tyranitar's Rock Slide, Choice Band Metagross's Earthquake, Choice Band Flygon's Earthquake, and Gengar's Thunderbolt. Although Heracross can't take repeated damage, it can be especially troublesome for Milotic; once it is affected by Toxic, Guts makes it really dangerous.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Aerodactyl super effectively and has reliable damage output against a number of other Pokemon such as Metagross. Recover allows Milotic to stay healthy consistently and offsets its lacking Defense. Toxic lets Milotic outstall a number of Pokemon such as Salamence without Dragon Dance and makes it threatening to opposing Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune. Refresh is particularly useful against Pokemon on stall or balanced teams such as defensive Swampert and standard Skarmory that rely on Toxic to punish Milotic. Ice Beam makes Milotic an amazing counter to Salamence, does a lot of damage to Flygon, and hits Celebi and Zapdos relatively hard on the switch. Hypnosis gives Milotic chances to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, thus stopping Spikers such as Skarmory and Forretress or setup sweepers such as CurseLax from taking advantage of Milotic for entry hazards or boosts.</p> <p>Maximum physical bulk lets the physically defensive prowess of Milotic's pure Water typing shine. It is reasonable to creep a bit on Speed, as Milotic is in a fairly common Speed tier that includes most Tyranitar and slow variants of Metagross. However, it is not recommended to use under 224 Defense EVs, as this will give Adamant Salamence a chance to 2HKO Milotic with +1 Hidden Power Flying in sand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams with Milotic appreciate Pokemon that can take powerful Electric-type moves; as a special wall, Celebi resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks for Milotic, while Milotic resists Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Celebi. Although Milotic can act as a check to Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar and Choice Band Aerodactyl, unlike Swampert, it struggles to counter them because it lacks a Rock resistance, has a rather mediocre Defense stat, and faces the threat of flinches from their STAB Rock Slide. Therefore, Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross and Jirachi that resist Rock-type attacks can be good partners. However, if either of them is chosen as Milotic's teammate, it is also recommended to have an extra Tyranitar answer because Earthquake hits them hard. Ground-type Pokemon not only resist Rock-type attacks but also can pivot into Electric-type attacks. Firstly, Claydol and the rare Donphan are spinners that can let Milotic avoid being chipped by Spikes. Secondly, Dugtrio and Flygon can deal with physical Tyranitar rather effectively. Last but not least, it is not unheard of to run Swampert and Milotic on the same team because one can be sent out earlier, thus letting the other stay healthy for physical attackers late-game.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur has above-average bulk and a good support movepool; its offensive choices are somewhat limited, however. Still, the ability to spread status is always nice, and Venusaur can put opponents to sleep or poison them (with either Sludge Bomb or Toxic), so with the support of a counter to Celebi and Blissey, such as Hidden Power Bug Dugtrio, Venusaur can effectively cripple a wide range of threats and prove to be a general nuisance for the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can beat Salamence on switches, but Venusaur needs at least 270 Special Attack (136 EVs without a boosting nature) to even have a shot at OHKOing the standard 4/0 Choice Band Salamence; 319 Special Attack--216 EVs and a boosting nature--is needed for the guaranteed OHKO. With maximum Special Attack investment, Venusaur has a 67% chance to OHKO the standard 120/0 Dragon Dance Salamence. Hidden Power Grass is a bit stronger than Razor Leaf and has 100% accuracy, but it's not usually worth sacrificing the high critical hit rate and a Hidden Power slot. Body Slam can paralyze Salamence, among others. Don't even think about Sunny Day + Solar Beam, however; Venusaur is too slow to set it up, and is outclassed by other Chlorophyll Pokemon, such as Exeggutor. Similarly, Growth can be used to boost Venusaur's mediocre Special Attack, but such a set is better done by Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Light Screen can be used to help the whole team take special hits more easily. Roar can force out Substitute, Agility, or Baton Pass Zapdos, and is another alternative to stopping Calm Mind Raikou. It also defeats Ninjask, but watch out for Hidden Power Flying. Charm can annoy the likes of Salamence, Gyarados, Snorlax, and Swampert. Protect scouts Explosion and Choice Band moves, and, more importantly, gives Venusaur more Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery. Toxic is a decent move for stall-oriented teams, and can pair nicely with Leech Seed. Just make sure you have a way to stop Skarmory and Celebi--consider Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory walls any set that lacks Hidden Power Fire. Gyarados and Salamence can tank all Venusaur's attacks bar odd Hidden Powers. Celebi sops up Leech Seed nicely, resists Grass-type attacks, and laughs at anything offensive Venusaur throws at it, save Sludge Bomb. Nonetheless, all of the above have STAB super effective attacks to put a hurting on Venusaur. Gengar, Weezing, Forretress, and Metagross resist or are immune to both Venusaur's STAB moves, but Venusaur can still put them to sleep or stall them with Leech Seed; Metagross also needs to watch out for Earthquake and Hidden Power Fire. Tentacruel makes Venusaur's life hard with Liquid Ooze and Substitute to thwart Leech Seed, and packs either super effective Ice Beam or STAB Swords Dance-boosted Sludge Bomb; however, Earthquake can take it down.</p> <p>Blissey hates Leech Seed and Sleep Powder, but soaks up all special attacks and easily survives two Sludge Bombs. Snorlax beats Venusaur in a Curse war, unless the latter is carrying Leech Seed. Regice and Articuno don't particularly care for Hidden Power Fire and can fire off STAB Ice Beams, so Venusaur can't stay in to use Sludge Bomb is risky.</p> <p>Most counters need to be wary of switching into Venusaur, as Sleep Powder can put even the sturdiest foe out of commission if they are not prepared for it. However, Hypno and Banette don't take much damage from Venusaur's STAB attacks and are immune to Sleep Powder. The former can deal heavy damage with STAB Psychic, while the latter can burn Venusaur with Will-O-Wisp and remove its item with Knock Off. Heracross and Ursaring actually benefit from Venusaur's Sleep Powder thanks to Guts, and can take advantage of this with Sleep Talk and a powerful STAB move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Disabler": {
        "description": "<p>Sludge Bomb is the third option here for a reason--the aim of this set is not to sweep or deal heavy damage to opponents. Venusaur will probably be met straight up by Skarmory, if not Celebi, so Sleep Powder should be its first move, followed by Leech Seed. It can then wear down the opponent with Sludge Bomb, healing when necessary with Synthesis. You should note, however, that sandstorm reduces Synthesis's recovery from 50% to a measly 25%.</p> <p>The EV spread is not set in stone, but all variants should run 252 HP EVs for maximum tanking ability and a few EVs in Speed. The rest is split between Defense and Special Defense depending on the threats that you wish Venusaur to wall. Venusaur's Special Defense is quite a bit better than its Defense, and it has more special resistances too, so it works very well as a special tank. With a Careful nature and heavy investment in Special Defense, this set is good at walling even Hidden Power Ice variants of Zapdos and Raikou for quite a while. However, if you would rather Venusaur take on physical threats such as Fighting-types or Swampert, focus on Defense instead.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This might not really be a good idea with the ubiquity of Skarmory, but it can be surprisingly effective with Magneton support. Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's physical STAB and deals heavy damage after a boost or two. Earthquake covers Metagross and Tyranitar, and if you're afraid of Ghost-types, run Hidden Power Ghost over Sleep Powder in the last moveslot.</p> <p>108 Speed EVs enable Venusaur to outspeed neutral-natured Tyranitar, while the 208 HP EVs give it a healthy 353 HP to make setting up easier. The rest of the EVs are dumped in Attack, and in conjunction with an Adamant nature, this gives Venusaur sufficient firepower to pull off a sweep. If you're going with Curse, remove all Speed EVs, maximize HP, and put the leftover EVs into one of its defenses. Defense investment enables Venusaur to set up Curse boosts with ease on physical attackers such as Snorlax, while Special Defense EVs let Venusaur take special hits well while boosting itself on the physical side.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Venusaur can also run a specially based set to surprise counters such as Skarmory. This set can check SkarmBliss cores with ease--Skarmory is taken out by Hidden Power Fire, while Blissey is put to sleep and stalled out with Sleep Powder and Leech Seed. Venusaur is walled by threats such as Salamence, but once they are removed by a teammate, it can pick its way through the opponent's team.</p> <p>If Blissey is their only decent counter to Venusaur, you can put it to sleep with Sleep Powder with some prediction. Assume a situation in which Venusaur is facing down Blissey, and the opponent has Swampert and Skarmory waiting in the wings. If Venusaur puts Skarmory to sleep, Blissey can come in and stall Venusaur out of PP with Soft-Boiled, go for the freeze with Ice Beam, or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. If Blissey is put to sleep, however, it might switch out to heal off the status with Natural Cure, and then come right back in. In that case, reuse your sleep move, as Natural Cure means you won't be violating Sleep Clause. You can do the same thing to potentially beat Celebi, but you have to correctly predict Celebi switch-ins; otherwise, it can hurt Venusaur with a faster Psychic.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced many years ago and is currently being <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/charizard-qc-0-2.3663892/\">revamped</a>. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current ADV OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Using Charizard requires a lot of advance planning, but it's usually worth the effort. Thanks to Belly Drum, it can decimate teams after bulky Waters have been worn down and faster Pokemon such as Starmie and Gengar removed; Charizard can even run a Salac Berry to help with the latter problem. Another of Charizard's issues is its lack of moveslots: the more setup moves it runs, the fewer attacking options it gets. However, a smart player can always bluff, or even pair Charizard with Dugtrio, Magneton, or Explosion users to clear the way for it. To put it simply, Charizard is a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast on every set for people who prefer accuracy to power, and it comes in especially handy when your Belly Drum-boosted Charizard is facing down a half-health Skarmory. Fire Blast does more damage on average, though, and its extra power is helpful against Weezing and Celebi. Overheat is both accurate and powerful, but if your opponent packs two Pokemon you'll need to use a Fire move for, you're screwed.</p> <p>The other moves Charizard gets are rather novel, and usually too circumstantial to work. Sunny Day not only weakens the Water moves Charizard is weak to, but also boosts Charizard's Fire moves, and when combined with Blaze, lets it pack a punch. A Swords Dance-boosted Brick Break can bust up Snorlax, Tyranitar and Blissey, but Belly Drum or even Focus Punch are usually better options. Toxic can annoy Swampert, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl and some others; it isn't a bad option as Charizard can lure your opponent's main Water-type and help wear it down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune, Swampert, Milotic, and Vaporeon will always survive whatever an unboosted Charizard throws at them, falling only to a Belly Drum-boosted Double-Edge, or in Swampert's case, Hidden Power Grass. They can then counter with a Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos Speed ties with Charizard, switches in easily on Earthquake, Hidden Power Flying, and even Fire moves to an extent, and will OHKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Any user of Rock moves also threatens Charizard: Aerodactyl resists most of Charizard's moves, outspeeds it, and OHKOes it with Rock Slide. Tyranitar can take an unboosted Earthquake and either cripple it with Thunderbolt or KO it with STAB Rock Slide. Furthermore, Tyranitar's mere existence cripples Belly Drum variants, as sandstorm's residual damage greatly shortens Charizard's lifespan and limits its ability to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Recoil Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard can run a multitude of Belly Drum-related sets, but they have their distinguishing features: this one plays differently to the others before it sets up. The various Bellyzard sets face numerous problems: all variants have trouble with bulky Waters, sets lacking Substitute face difficulty in activating their Salac Berry, while sets that run Substitute forgo crucial coverage. Fortunately, this Charizard avoids all these issues.</p> <p>Double-Edge OHKOes Milotic, Swampert, Vaporeon, and even Suicune after some minor damage, and Charizard survives the recoil to enter Salac Berry range. After obtaining the boost, simply use Earthquake and Charizard's Blaze-boosted Fire move to sweep. Double-Edge can be used once more as a kamikaze move, but few teams have multiple Pokemon that resist both Fire and Ground. Nonetheless, it's best to wait until you know most of their team before trying to set up Charizard.</p> <p>As with every variant that uses Salac Berry or Dragon Dance, Charizard should hit a Speed stat of 270 to outspeed Adamant Heracross before a boost. The minimum Speed one should run is 264, while maximizing Speed lets Charizard tie with Salamence. Next, maximize its main offensive stat and put any spare EVs into the other attacking stat.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum + 3 Attacks": {"description": "<p>The strategy for a Belly Drum Charizard lacking Substitute is generally to switch into weak attacks, such as Skarmory's Drill Peck or Blissey's Seismic Toss, lowering its health enough that Salac Berry activates after Belly Drum. Alternatively, one could Belly Drum on a switch at full health, fire off attacks without the Salac boost, and switch out against faster foes. To switch in and Belly Drum a second time, however, you will have to switch Charizard in on a predicted Skarmory or Forretress switch, or on a Choice Band user locked into Earthquake.</p>"},
      "Substitute + Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Belly Drum Charizard that run Substitute play very differently to those that don't. You should look to switch this in on the likes of Skarmory using Spikes, and Substitute as your opponent switches to a Water-type not named Suicune. Then Belly Drum to get Salac Berry's boost, and sweep. While it isn't as effective, it's much easier to successfully set up.</p> <p>If using Hidden Power Flying, be sure to transfer 4 EVs from Special Attack to Speed. The 30 HP IV makes Charizard's HP divisible by 4, enabling it to activate Salac Berry after a Substitute and a Belly Drum.</p>"},
      "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>While this set has some surprise value, it is largely inferior to the Belly Drum ones. Substitute has two functions: firstly, it reduces the prediction needed to use Focus Punch, and secondly, it lets Charizard activate Petaya Berry. After boosts from Petaya Berry, Blaze, and Sunny Day, Charizard's Fire Blast is extremely strong and does a lot to anything that's not named Blissey or Snorlax.</p> <p>An Attack stat of 225 is needed to let Focus Punch always 2HKO Blissey; if using a Hidden Power that reduces Attack, move some Special Attack EVs to Attack to make up for it.</p>"},
      "Physical Attacker": {"description": "<p>While it is physically offensive, this Charizard is not as much of an all-out sweeper as the Belly Drum variant is. Rock Slide is the normal move in the third slot, but Earthquake can badly dent Tyranitar. Hidden Power Grass is nice for catching Ground- and Water-types on the switch, but Charizard will have to use the slightly weaker Aerial Ace instead of Hidden Power Flying.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is a more powerful alternative to Surf, but its 80% accuracy is less than ideal. Earthquake hits the aforementioned Raikou, but doesn't do much damage because Blastoise's Attack is average at best, and investing in it detracts from Blastoise's physical bulk. Hidden Power Electric 2HKOes Gyarados, while Hidden Power Grass helps against Swampert, but they won't really come in handy most of the time. Blastoise can use Substitute and Focus Punch, but this strategy is only effective against Blissey.</p> <p>Mirror Coat might work against Zapdos, but will only catch Raikou if Blastoise also has Earthquake, as otherwise it'll just Substitute. Counter works well if a physical attacker tries to beat Blastoise one-on-one, but it's generally better off using Surf or Ice Beam for coverage against Rock- and Ground-types. Haze and Roar work against Baton Pass users and Reversal / Flail Pokemon to an extent. Yawn is a fun move; lay down some Spikes beforehand for better results. Toxic is always fun to toy around with; Blastoise will likely be able to poison other Water-types, and its standard Electric switch-ins aren't fond of Toxic either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blastoise cannot really do much to Suicune. While Blastoise can Toxic and Haze or Roar away Calm Mind boosts, Suicune's Pressure ability and repeated Calm Mind-boosted Surfs will be Blastoise's demise. Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon hurt Blastoise with STAB Thunderbolt, but they have a rather difficult time coming in on STAB Surf, or in Zapdos's case, a super effective Ice Beam. Blissey and Snorlax wall Blastoise to no end, as does Regice if Blastoise cannot Mirror Coat its Thunderbolt. Ludicolo isn't hurt by any of Blastoise's moves except Toxic, while Venusaur just needs to avoid Ice Beam and it will be sitting pretty. Finally, Blastoise should beware of Exploding Metagross.</p>",

However, it gets worn down quite quickly as it has neither Swampert's good resistances nor Milotic's reliable recovery. Therefore, it shouldn't see much use in standard unless you're going for semi-useful novelty.</p> <p>Rest Blastoise should always be used with cleric support, as RestTalk Blastoise is greatly outclassed by the aforementioned bulky Waters. In general, try your best to keep Blastoise alive, and use it only times of dire need. In fact, if you can afford it, Wish support will go a long way.

However, Nidoqueen is much better at using Counter due to her greater bulk. Nidoqueen also more effectively takes advantage of her resistances, but you should still be wary of these nasty weaknesses to Earthquake, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Surf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is an awesome move on Nidoqueen as she can be EVed to survive even STAB Earthquakes. Charm can annoy physically based switch-ins, while Roar counters Baton Pass teams, as well as Ninjask and Scizor. Nidoqueen is defensive enough to pull off a RestTalk set, but it's better to capitalize on her outstanding versatility. Substitute helps against Weezing if it's not running Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying are options to destroy Heracross; in the same vein, Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Swampert. However, Nidoqueen must hit it on the switch or be KOed by one of Swampert's STAB moves. Crunch is an option for a specially based Nidoqueen to damage Gengar, but note that such a set is not recommended as it lacks STAB. Double Kick makes Nidoqueen a good Tyraniboah counter as it breaks Tyranitar's Substitute and damages it in the same turn; furthermore, Nidoqueen resists Focus Punch and is immune to Thunderbolt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Milotic, Slowbro, and Swampert, are failsafe switch-ins. Their high HP and Defense stats enable them to easily switch in on even Thunderbolt and Choice Band Earthquake. Swampert has more trouble with Hidden Power Grass variants, however. Nonetheless, all of the aforementioned Pokemon pack super effective STAB moves to take down Nidoqueen. Weezing is a good counter to Nidoqueen: in addition to possessing a high Defense stat, it is immune to Earthquake, resists Focus Punch, Superpower, and Sludge Bomb, and packs Will-O-Wisp to further lower Nidoqueen's attacking power. Substitute variants can be a hindrance, however, as Substitute protects Nidoqueen from Will-O-Wisp, and Nidoqueen's Substitutes survive one Sludge Bomb. While Focus Punch will put a dent in it, Skarmory takes most of Nidoqueen's physical attacks easily, thanks especially to its immunities to Sludge Bomb and Earthquake. As long as Nidoqueen doesn't pack a Fire or an Electric move, Skarmory can easily lay Spikes, phaze Nidoqueen away for some token damage, or wear it down with Drill Peck. Forretress isn't as easily killed by Thunderbolt or Thunder, but is OHKOed by Fire Blast. However, it can damage Nidoqueen more easily with super effective Earthquake, so it's something to watch out for.</p> <p>Flygon can come in on Earthquake, Rock Slide, Sludge Bomb, as well as Fire and Electric moves; in fact, it only really has to watch out for Ice Beam, which might not always OHKO. In return, it can badly damage Nidoqueen with Earthquake, which OHKOes if Flygon is equipped with a Choice Band. However, a fully defensive Nidoqueen can survive non-Choice Band Flygon's Earthquake and KO it with Counter. Specially defensive Claydol barely takes 30% from Ice Beam, and can eliminate Nidoqueen with an Ice Beam of its own. It also packs STAB Earthquake, but must watch out for Counter variants. Donphan is 2HKOed by Ice Beam and weakened variants should therefore not switch into Nidoqueen, but aside from that, it makes a nice counter due to its high Defense.</p> <p>Celebi resists Earthquake, but is weak to Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb. Nonetheless, it can shrug off most non-Choice Band-boosted attacks, especially with Recover, and hit Nidoqueen hard with STAB Psychic.

There are very few surefire counters to Nidoking, as it can always surprise you and KO one of the key elements of your team.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can take down Choice Band users, walls, and even Ground-types. While it is effective, Nidoking is usually better off straight-up attacking. Double Kick is a novelty move, but is notable for allowing Nidoking to entirely destroy Tyraniboah. Not only does Double Kick let Nidoking both break Tyranitar's Substitute and damage it, Nidoking also resists Focus Punch and is immune to Thunderbolt. Thunder does more damage to Water-types than Thunderbolt does, and has a higher paralysis chance to boot, but Thunderbolt's greater accuracy is preferred. Nidoking can use Roar to phaze away Scizor and Ninjask, as well as Zapdos and Jolteon that lack Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Grass is an interesting option to hit Swampert.</p> <p>Toxic and Thief can help wear down opponents, but once again, Nidoking is better off smashing in its opponents' faces instead of stalling them out. Rest + Sleep Talk is, as always, a nice combination on Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb sleep from Grass-types and surprise them with Sludge Bomb, but the loss of two moveslots does hurt his great versatility. Protect can be used to scout for Earthquake and Explosion, to reduce prediction against Choice Band users, and to gain some Leftovers recovery. Substitute can be used in combination with a powerful special move such as Fire Blast or Thunder to help Nidoking dispose of Weezing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune and Milotic can switch in on anything except Choice Band Earthquake as they shrug off even Thunderbolt, and then dispose of Nidoking with Surf. Swampert is further immune to Thunderbolt and packs STAB Earthquake, but it must watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Weezing makes an all-around good counter as it resists Sludge Bomb and Megahorn, is immune to Earthquake, and takes little damage from Rock Slide thanks to its high Defense. Aside from using Will-O-Wisp on Nidoking and wearing it down with Sludge Bomb, Weezing can also use Pain Split to restore HP. However, watch out for Substitute, which will block Will-O-Wisp, as well as special attack such as Fire Blast and Thunder. Skarmory can wall Nidoking and set up Spikes on it if Nidoking lacks a Fire or Electric move. Much the same goes for Forretress; while it lacks an Earthquake immunity, it is not weak to Electric, and its own Earthquake 2HKOes Nidoking.</p> <p>Flygon's typing and ability allow it to switch in on all of Earthquake, Rock Slide, Sludge Bomb, and Thunderbolt; it can then OHKO Nidoking with STAB Earthquake. However, it takes huge damage from Ice Beam and Choice Band Megahorn. Claydol can better sponge Ice Beam, but is slower and takes even more damage from Megahorn. Donphan's high Defense makes it an ideal counter to physical sets; however, Ice Beam will take out about half its health. Celebi can destroy Nidoking with Psychic, but it is OHKOed by Choice Band Megahorn and 2HKOed by non-Choice Band Megahorn and Sludge Bomb, so make sure to switch it in safely.</p>",

Rock Slide takes down Flying-types such as Zapdos, while Ice Beam catches Salamence.</p>"},
      "Mixed Sweeper": {"description": "<p>A great wallbreaker in standard play, this set takes care of just about all defensive Pokemon besides Water-types, in addition to a few offensive threats as well. Megahorn will nearly always OHKO Celebi, and does more than enough damage to Starmie and Claydol as well. Earthquake dents Metagross, and will also be Nidoking's best bet against Water-types if it picks Fire Blast in the third moveslot. Both slashed third moves 2HKO Skarmory; in addition, Thunderbolt hits Water-types, especially Gyarados, while Fire Blast has more power and eliminates Forretress and Steelix. Generally, Thunderbolt offers more versatility. Ice Beam beats Donphan and Salamence, and does good damage to Grass-types such as Breloom and Sceptile as well if you don't want to risk Megahorn's subpar accuracy.</p>"},
      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>This set hits everything in the game bar Shedinja for at least neutral damage, but it's severely limited in effectiveness because of lack of STAB. Once your opponent scouts out the set, Metagross, Swampert, and to a lesser extent Zapdos will easily wall it, and it cannot do much to Blissey, Snorlax, or Regice without a Substitute up either. STAB Earthquake usually does more damage than Focus Punch anyway. Fire Blast can be used over Substitute if you don't mind having to predict more when using Focus Punch.</p>"}

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written well over a decade ago. The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>With the ability to run a physically offensive SubPunch set, a specially attacking Calm Mind one, a defensive Counter one, and even several support sets, Clefable's unpredictability is its biggest strength; there are zero hard counters to it. However, once its set is revealed, its average stats across the board will give it difficulty damaging things effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charm greatly hinders Curse Snorlax and Swampert, and to a lesser extent Dragon Dance users as well. Fire Blast is a more powerful but less accurate option over Flamethrower. Hidden Power Grass puts a big dent into Swampert and also hurts Tyranitar; you might want to use Magical Leaf if you're afraid of Counter. Psychic dents Fighting-types, but Medicham and Heracross are neutral to it, and the latter takes more damage from Fire moves. Reflect is a great move to support your team with, and can work in tandem with Counter. Safeguard is another team support move, but is less useful. Sing can quickly incapacitate your opponent's Clefable counter and let Clefable set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch, though a novelty move, can get Clefable a Substitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Soft-Boiled, Aromatherapy, or Dragon Dance if you're good at predicting. Wish can be used over Soft-Boiled most of the time; Clefable is an above-average Wish user. It might be wise to use Protect as well, as it can scout Choice Band users, stall for Leftovers recovery, and protect Clefable from Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Clefable is difficult to counter due to its versatility and access to Sing; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokemon to beat it. The good news, though, is that it's relatively uncommon.</p> <p>Swampert walls most sets that don't use Hidden Power Grass or Magical Leaf. It can hit Clefable hard with Earthquake, but defensive variants can shrug it off with Soft-Boiled. Alternatively, Swampert can try to Curse up against it, but watch out for Encore, or worse, Counter. Milotic and Suicune can somewhat wall Clefable, but can't pose much of an offensive threat. If Clefable has Soft-Boiled, all they can do is poison it with Toxic, or in Milotic's case, put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Mirror Coat might work as well on Thunderbolt Clefable. Suicune can set up Calm Mind boosts and Roar Clefable away unless Clefable is running Encore; the Psych Up set, however, is Suicune's greatest nightmare. If Clefable doesn't have Thunderbolt or doesn't cause paralysis on the switch, Taunt Gyarados is a great counter. Zapdos can put a hurting on non-specially defensive Clefable.</p> <p>Jirachi can comfortably set up Calm Mind on Clefable while staying healthy with Wish, as it resists most of Clefable's moves, is immune to Toxic, and can even make 101 HP Substitutes. In fact, it only really fears switching into Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Choice Band Focus Punch, and Encore messes it up as well. Celebi functions similarly but is slightly inferior, as it is weak to Ice Beam and doesn't pack as many useful resistances to Choice Band or Belly Drum Clefable's moves. Leech Seed or Calm Mind Psychic takes care of Clefable quite easily, however. Additionally, Celebi can shrug off Thunder Wave and Toxic with Natural Cure.</p> <p>Metagross takes diddly squat from any Clefable lacking Fire Blast or Flamethrower, but it doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Thunder Wave or Body Slam, and will lose to Counter variants. Tyranitar can eliminate Clefable with Focus Punch, or boost with Dragon Dance and use Rock Slide. However, it is picked off by Brick Break or Focus Punch, hates paralysis, is troubled by Counter if Clefable actually lives to use it, and disrupted by Charm if it cannot Substitute or Taunt in time. Heracross must avoid a Fire attack, but can otherwise easily switch in on Clefable and OHKO it with Choice Band Brick Break or Focus Punch. It absorbs paralysis nicely, though, and even sleep if it has Sleep Talk. Just don't attack Clefable until you know it won't Counter, and avoid Charm as well. Machamp is in the same boat, except with Cross Chop. Medicham can OHKO Clefable as well, but has more problems dealing with paralysis or damaging attacks in general.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic stall set. Steel- and Poison-types work as well, though they should beware of Fire moves. Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It will often have to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a Pokemon safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Belly Drum Clefable is quite fun, though not too good as its Attack is only 1048 after a Belly Drum. Clefable's low Speed also makes it hard to sweep with, so make sure to paralyze faster foes beforehand, either with a teammate or by itself. Even if Clefable can't find an opportunity to use Belly Drum, it can still fish for Attack boosts with Meteor Mash.</p> <p>Cosmic Power is an option as well to make this set a better tank, and should be used as follows: Cosmic Power until it isn't taking much damage at all, then Soft-Boiled to heal up, set up Belly Drum, and start attacking. If Clefable runs into something it can't beat, such as a Ghost, it can Soft-Boiled to full HP, then switch out to come back later and try again.</p> <p>The listed EVs let Clefable outspeed Blissey and Weezing.</p>"},
      "Calm Mind": {"description": "<p>Access to recovery and good coverage lets Clefable pull off a decent Calm Mind set. The combination of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt is only resisted by Magneton, Lanturn, and Shedinja, but Clefable still can't break through good special sponges, such as Snorlax.</p> <p>You can toy around with its EVs: while the Defense investment gives greater all-around bulk, running more Special Defense lets Clefable set up more easily on special attackers. More Speed can help for Weezing and Skarmory, and more Special Attack grants Clefable more firepower.</p>"},
      "Counter": {"description": "<p>Counter is one of Clefable's coolest moves. Pokemon it can surprise and take down include Snorlax, Swampert, and Aerodactyl, as Clefable survives all of their attacks, and even Heracross's Choice Band Megahorn as well. Several other moves can be used in the first two moveslots: Ice Beam and Thunderbolt for great coverage, or even Calm Mind or Light Screen to better lure physical attacks. If using Calm Mind, make sure to use a special attack, a Bold nature, and Special Attack EVs. Thunder Wave isn't recommended, though; if the opponent is fully paralyzed on the turn Clefable uses Counter, its surprise will be given away.</p>"},
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Opponents that attempt to get rid of this Clefable with Tyranitar or Blissey will be in a world of pain, thanks to Focus Punch, and even after they wise up to Focus Punch, Clefable can still beat Skarmory with its third move. Specifically, Flamethrower also deals with Steel-types, while Thunderbolt takes down Water-and Flying-types. Shadow Ball messes up Ghost-types, and is generally the best choice as Fighting + Ghost isn't resisted by anything. Meteor Mash gives Clefable a more reliable way to bring down Rock-types, and strongly dent Ghost-types as well. Finally, Ice Beam solves any Salamence trouble your team might have had, and removes Flying-types too if you're not using Thunderbolt. All in all, this is a very diverse set that can feasibly run just about anything in the last moveslot.</p> <p>The Speed-hindering nature lets Clefable move after Blissey, allowing it to put up a Substitute and 2HKO with Focus Punch. With the given offensive EVs, Focus Punch will easily OHKO Tyranitar, and Ice Beam OHKO 4/0 Choice Band Salamence. Flamethrower will OHKO Forretress; both that and Thunderbolt will 2HKO Skarmory.</p>"
      },
      "Cosmic Power": {"description": "<p>This is a stall set and will take a long time to win with. After gaining a few boosts, use Encore on an attacking move and Seismic Toss opponents to death, or use Toxic to wear down your opponent while you set up or recover freely. It has issues with being phazed after using Rest, its inability to touch Gengar, and inevitable critical hits. Nevertheless, Rest is preferred as Soft-Boiled leaves Clefable vulnerable to status.</p> <p>With regard to alternative options, either Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be used to shut down Steel-types and Weezing.</p>"},
      "Anti-Sweeper": {"description": "<p>It is very hard for any sweeper to break through this as long as it maintains high health. Thunder Wave ruins speedy foes, and makes Encoring stat-boosting moves much easier. Encore can let Clefable set up a sweep for a teammate as well. For example, if Clefable uses Encore on a Curse Swampert's Earthquake, Swampert will likely stay in as Clefable cannot do anything to it and will eventually fall. This makes for a perfect opportunity to switch in your Belly Drum Charizard, set up, and sweep.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This is a more novel set, but is largely outclassed by the myriad other Normal-type Choice Band users. Clefable's only advantage over them is Meteor Mash, which isn't that great anyway. Feel free to also run a special move, such as Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, to hurt Skarmory. These EVs let Clefable outpace Metagross and about anything else with 200 Speed or lower.</p>"},
      "Psych Up": {"description": "<p>Created by Hipmonlee, this set is a rather roundabout Suicune counter. Hit away with Thunderbolt while it sets up with Calm Mind; when it has about three or four Calm Mind boosts (never get too greedy!), use Psych Up. Of course, Suicune will try to Roar Clefable away; that's when it should use Encore. Now your opponent will have to deal with a fully set-up Calm Mind user.</p>"}

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam has the most options of almost any special sweeper in the game. It is one of those Pokemon that can do anything on the special end, and do it well. In addition to strong moves with good coverage, as well as the highest non-Uber Special Attack stat in the game, it has awesome strategic choices such as Encore and Trick, which can completely screw over your opponent for the rest of the match. Alakazam is a force to be reckoned with, and should always be considered when making a team. It does suffer a little from four moveslot syndrome though: it could mess up everything in the game, if only it had more moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam also gets access to Barrier, and if you set it up correctly, Alakazam can survive physical attacks enough to make better use of Recover. It's rather risky, though, and needs to be executed flawlessly or it won't work. Thunder Wave can catch Metagross and Tyranitar on the switch and is a nice alternative. Safeguard + Recover enables Alakazam to always beat Blissey one-on-one, and Taunt works against Blissey as well as Celebi. With Knock Off, Alakazam can really hurt the tanking potential of Blissey and Snorlax, and if used on the switch-in, it gives away whether or not your opponent is using Choice Band Tyranitar. Toxic works on just about anything, especially Claydol and Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey, the best special wall in the game, is a good initial switch-in to also scout Alakazam's moveset, as she beats most Calm Mind variants--namely, those without Recover. However, watch out for unorthodox moves such as Focus Punch, Trick, and Knock Off, as these will be very annoying. Snorlax takes more damage from Psychic, and unlike Blissey cannot recover health with Soft-Boiled, but he doesn't mind being Tricked a Choice Band as much, and he can usually OHKO or 2HKO Alakazam. If Alakazam carries Recover, Blissey's only way to beat it is with damaging status moves. Thunder Wave will prevent Alakazam from sweeping, but Blissey still won't be able to beat Alakazam one-on-one unless she gets lucky with full paralysis. A badly poisoned Alakazam, however, will eventually faint, and one can always try for the freeze with Ice Beam. The problem with Ice Beam is that Alakazam carries Lum Berry more often than not, which means one will have to freeze it twice. On average, Ice Beam freezes once in 10 turns, and as Ice Beam has a maximum of 16 PP, Blissey will usually lose this matchup unless she has Serene Grace. Note that thanks to Synchronize, if Blissey paralyzes or poisons Alakazam, she will suffer from the same status condition until you switch her out or use Aromatherapy.</p> <p>Houndoom is immune to Psychic, and--depending on his ability--resists or is immune to Fire Punch. Additionally, he has both Crunch and Pursuit to OHKO Alakazam whether it stays in or switches out. However, if Alakazam has Hidden Power Water or Thunder Punch, Houndoom will be 2HKOed, or even OHKOed if Alakazam has a Calm Mind boost. Tyranitar can use Pursuit as well, and is generally a safer bet as he isn't OHKOed by anything Alakazam can throw at him, doesn't terribly mind being Tricked a Choice Band, and can Rock Slide Alakazam for the OHKO.</p> <p>Metagross 4x resists Psychic moves and can OHKO with any of Meteor Mash, Shadow Ball, and sometimes even Earthquake. However, he is weak to Fire Punch, making him a shaky counter. While he can survive a Calm Mind-boosted Fire Punch in a pinch, beware of being worn down, burned, or damaged by a critical hit. Jirachi boasts the same typing as Metagross does, and is more durable on the special side. He won't be able to OHKO Alakazam without a novelty move, though, such as Choice Band Shadow Ball or Doom Desire. Celebi resists Psychic, can Recover all day long, and annoy Alakazam with Leech Seed, but it will usually fall to Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Trick, Substitute, or Encore. Claydol makes a good check as long as he avoids a super effective Hidden Power or Ice Punch, as his Psychic resistance, nice Special Defense, and capability to 2HKO with Earthquake or Shadow Ball make him quite a reliable counter.</p> <p>Dusclops doesn't boast good resistances, but isn't OHKOed by any of Alakazam's moves either, and needs only about 36 Attack EVs to KO Alakazam with Shadow Ball. Sableye is immune to Psychic, can Recover off unboosted hits, and his STAB Shadow Ball KOes Alakazam more often than not. Beware, though, as a Calm Mind-boosted Fire Punch 2HKOes him.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Alakazam does well with a basic Calm Mind set; it has low defenses, but is fast enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Psychic grants it obvious powerful STAB, Fire Punch lets it deal with Metagross, and Thunder Punch helps remove Starmie, Slowbro, and Gyarados. Ice Punch can come in useful against Salamence and Flygon, but a Calm Mind-boosted Psychic takes care of them as well. It's handy for Claydol though. Hidden Power Water is good for the very same Claydol, as well as Houndoom and Tyranitar. Recover is another good move: Alakazam won't be able to use Recover against much, but with a few Calm Minds under its belt, it can handle Ice Beam Blissey, Milotic, and other weak special attackers. Leftovers provides Alakazam with passive recovery, but you might want to use a Lum Berry so freeze and paralysis don't stop Alakazam in its tracks.</p> <p>Alakazam should always run lots of Speed so it can outrun as many threats as possible and land crucial hits when it needs to. Specifically, maximum Speed lets Alakazam tie with Sceptile and Dugtrio. Other than that, its Special Attack should be maximized as well, because Alakazam's only defense is its offense: KO before it is KOed.</p>"
      },
      "Special Trick": {"description": "<p>Trick your Choice Band to the Blissey that will most likely switch in, and proceed to destroy it. If you have Recover, you can attack it with Psychic, eventually beating it even if it Seismic Tosses. Substitute lets Alakazam block status effects and Psychic foes until they faint. Furthermore, Substitute enables Alakazam to scout the move of the Choice Band Tyranitar, Snorlax, or Metagross that might come in on it. Macho Brace can be used to screw over fast Pokemon, but it slows down Alakazam before the Trick. You can even use a useless filler item, such as Amulet Coin, and it will work like Thief, but has the extra bonus of allowing Alakazam to swap items with another foe later.</p>"},
      "Encore": {"description": "<p>Substitute when you think Blissey will Thunder Wave or Snorlax will Curse, Encore the support move, and proceed to either set up with Calm Mind or attack away. Encore Alakazam is a pain, and it really ruins the likes of Umbreon, who typically has nothing with which to break its Substitute. This variant of Alakazam works well against Celebi too, as it is one of the very few consistently safe switch-ins to a Calm Mind Baton Pass Celebi. Use Recover to make it last longer in such situations.</p>"},
      "Physical Trick": {"description": "<p>This physically based Alakazam packs both Focus Punch for the likes of Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax, as well as Trick to cripple unsuspecting special Pokemon. It nearly always works, because these aforementioned Pokemon are the safest switch-ins to Alakazam. Psychic is there for after Alakazam has Tricked away its Choice Band, and it helps by not giving the surprise away too early.</p> <p>Physical Alakazam needs plenty of Attack investment to make its surprise Focus Punch hurt.</p>"}

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Golem shouldn't be considered for most serious teams, and when it should Rhydon should be considered first (and Metagross way before that). Golem does have two things going for it over Rhydon: slightly better Speed and access to Explosion. Explosion can be a game-changer when played correctly, but in most instances you'll want a more consistent Pokemon in Golem's place.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Block lets Golem trap something on the switch, but as Golem will likely trap its counter, the chance that Golem can beat the trapped Pokemon is slim. Toxic lets it wear a Pokemon down, but watch out for opposing clerics. Counter is a great surprise; thanks to its decent Defense stat, Golem can survive many Earthquakes and Fighting attacks to bounce them back for a quick KO. Roar is useful to catch out Baton Pass chains. If you manage to catch Ninjask with it, Rock Blast also ruins the standard Baton Pass chain, but it is generally inferior to Rock Slide. Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, then follow up with Rock Slide for a paraflinch combo. Focus Punch can hit certain threats hard on the switch, but it has the same power as Earthquake after accounting for STAB, so it is generally not that useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory not only walls Golem, but can also lay Spikes, use Toxic, and phaze Golem. Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock can 3HKO it, however. Forretress lacks an immunity to Earthquake and is similarly troubled by the Choice Band set, but it can use Spikes and Toxic as well. Also troublesome are defensive Water-types, such as Slowbro, Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert, all of whom can take an Earthquake or two and OHKO Golem with Surf or Hydro Pump. Swampert often carries Protect to thwart Explosion as well, but it might not always carry a Water-type move. Regardless, Ice Beam and Earthquake let it do severe damage to Golem.</p> <p>Claydol can sponge most of Golem's moves, and is only really threatened by Hidden Power Bug or Choice Band Double-Edge; it can then set up Reflect, or ruin Golem with any of Ice Beam, Earthquake, Psychic, or Toxic. Gengar can come in on anything that isn't a Rock move and use Giga Drain, Will-O-Wisp, or Ice Punch to beat Golem into submission. Flygon and Breloom will regret coming into Double-Edge, but they resist the SlideQuake combination and have super effective STAB moves to wield against Golem. Celebi can Recover off the little damage it takes from most of Golem's moves, especially a resisted Earthquake, and OHKO with a Grass move or 2HKO with Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Apart from its unfortunate weaknesses to Water and Ground, Golem is a pretty decent Pokemon. This set capitalizes on Golem's ability to hit hard and take blows from the opponent's Pokemon with relative ease. It's not the best Pokemon in the world, being partially outclassed by Rhydon and having pitiful Special Defense and abysmal Speed, but Golem can get the job done regardless. Earthquake is the first STAB move of choice, boasting solid power and great neutral coverage. Rock Slide serves as Golem's secondary STAB and has great coverage with Earthquake, hitting Salamence, Gyarados, and the like hard. Additionally, it has a 30% chance to flinch, which is useful for defeating Snorlax and Forretress. Golem's two STABs form the QuakeSlide combination, which has, at the very least, neutral coverage on pretty much everything not named Claydol, Flygon, or Breloom. Hidden Power Rock is an option over Rock Slide for its 100% accuracy, but the lack of a flinch chance makes it inferior to Rock Slide, not to mention that using it prevents the use of Hidden Power Bug. Speaking of Hidden Power Bug, it provides crucial coverage on Celebi, who could otherwise switch in with impunity. Double-Edge is another possible choice, boasting decent coverage and a lack of recoil thanks to Rock Head. Double-Edge is generally the safest move to go for in most scenarios as it prevents Salamence or Gyarados from switching in unscathed, unlike Earthquake. The last moveslot is occupied by Explosion, which enables Golem to KO most Pokemon that do not possess a Ghost typing and gives it a way to actually do some damage to Skarmory and Swampert.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Golem can survive an Earthquake from Choice Band Salamence or +1 Tyranitar and outspeed Blissey and Swampert. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack and supplemented by an Adamant nature for maximum damage output.</p> <p>Golem needs a lot of support from its teammates to function effectively. It can't do much damage to bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and Milotic, so Celebi is a great partner, as it has excellent type synergy with Golem. Zapdos is another option to beat bulky Water-types and has an immunity to Golem's Ground-type weakness, which Celebi lacks. Do note that Golem can damage bulky Water-types if it gets a chance to hit them multiple times, but it won't be able to survive the turns it needs to do so. Spikes support is helpful to wear down Golem's switch-ins, so Skarmory and Forretress make great partners. Skarmory can switch in on just about every attack that threatens Golem, which is very useful. Rapid Spin support from Forretress or Cloyster is recommended to prevent Golem from being worn down by Spikes, which is important because of how easily it is worn down without them. In a similar vein, Wish support is helpful, replenishing the HP Golem loses to residual damage such as status conditions and Leech Seed. Blissey and Jirachi are the best choices for Wish passing as they are both very bulky and can take on Celebi and the bulky Water-types that give Golem trouble; Blissey in particular is well-suited for this role. Lastly, Skarmory is a massive pain for Golem as it can set up the Spikes Golem dreads right in its face. For this reason, Pokemon such as Metagross with Hidden Power Fire or Thunder Punch, Fire Blast Snorlax, Hydro Pump Swampert, Choice Band Aerodactyl, Choice Band Tyranitar, Fire Blast Salamence, or a Choice Band Fighting-type is recommended to take on Skarmory. The support that Golem requires is fairly substantial, as you can see, but it can work to decent effect if you give it the support it desires.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While Articuno has a lot of counters, it is truly underrated. It can Roar away the feared Calm Mind Celebi, laughs at most Swampert, and can easily stall out Blissey and all sorts of Water-types. As Grass-types don't appreciate the threat of a STAB Ice Beam, Articuno does a great job at absorbing Sleep Powder and Spore, and even Milotic's Hypnosis. Additionally, Articuno nullifies Snorlax with Reflect and either Haze or Roar. It also scares away any Salamence without Rock Slide and keeps it from coming in regardless of the set. Finally, Articuno is not 2HKOed by most non-STAB Thunderbolts. It takes some prediction to do good damage with Articuno, though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The only reason to use Haze over Roar is because the former doesn't have negative priority, but Roar's ability to rack up Spikes damage is generally preferable. Hidden Power Fire lets Articuno take down Metagross, and Hidden Power Flying does a number on Heracross.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock Blast Octillery makes the best Articuno counter because it's immune to Roar and resists Ice Beam. On a more serious note, Metagross resists Ice Beam and can crush Articuno with STAB Meteor Mash. Tyranitar takes neutral damage from Ice Beam, but knocks out Articuno with Rock Slide. Raikou and Jolteon take light damage from Ice Beam and 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Rock Slide Swampert, though uncommon, is easy to bring in and will usually 2HKO Articuno. Any Fire-type with decent Special Attack puts the hurt on Articuno as well.</p> <p>Registeel does not threaten to OHKO, but can wall Articuno all day and can gradually wear it down with Rock Slide or Hidden Power Steel. Regice might not be able to KO Articuno quickly with Thunderbolt either, but doesn't take much damage from Ice Beam; the same applies to Lanturn, Lapras, and Starmie.</p> <p>Snorlax takes next to nothing from Ice Beam, can boost up with Curse, and hit Articuno with STAB Normal-type moves before it can Roar Snorlax away. Jirachi resists Ice Beam, can set up Calm Mind boosts, and hit Articuno with a super effective Fire Punch, Thunder, or Thunderbolt. Blissey can wall Articuno, but will not win a one-on-one stall war thanks to Pressure.</p> <p>In general, anything that can take an Ice Beam and use a Rock move is a great counter. However, it is worth noting that all of Articuno's counters are susceptible to Spikes.</p>",

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Articuno is a stall machine; with good HP and Defense, and marvelous Special Defense, it makes a premier Sleep Talk user. As the real strategy of this set is to rack up as much Spikes damage as possible, make sure you have that on your team when using Articuno.</p> <p>Articuno should mainly look to come in on Celebi and Swampert. If the latter lacks Rock Slide, neither can hurt Articuno much, and they will simply waste their PP to Pressure. Your opponent will probably realize this and switch out; this is where you outpredict and use Roar. Spikes will deal damage to both your opponent's counter of choice and the random Pokemon dragged in by Roar, provided they aren't Levitate users or Flying-types--most of whom are hit super effectively by Ice Beam. Additionally, because they would likely have switched to their counter, their active Pokemon will often not be their best answer to Articuno. The real draw to this set, though, is when Articuno is sleeping. If Sleep Talk selects Roar, and Articuno happens to be faster than its opponent, Articuno will Roar the foe away before it can do anything for free Spikes damage.</p> <p>In a nutshell, this set is pretty simple. Stall to eternity and back, come in on Water-types, Blissey, or the aforementioned Swampert and Celebi to safely Rest up, and make sure not to run out of Ice Beam PP (Sleep Talk helps with this).</p>"

        "description": "<p>Articuno gets Heal Bell via Pokemon XD, and it can be a decent cleric if it needs to. It's not as good in this role as Blissey, Celebi, or Miltank is, because it lacks a 50% recovery move, but it lasts long nonetheless. Again, one can choose a RestTalk strategy, which also helps conserve Heal Bell PP. Reflect supports the team and guards Articuno against Metagross and users of Rock Slide. Toxic cripples Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Suicune, but is useless against Steels and Blissey. Articuno can make use of Roar, of course, though not as effectively as it can in the first set.</p> <p>Always maximize Articuno's HP for optimum Leftovers recovery and maximum durability. Use a Calm nature, as Special Defense is Articuno's greatest stat and should be boosted. As Articuno has the same Speed stat as Suicune, it should run a small amount of Speed EVs to Roar Suicune out first; this also guarantees Articuno outruns Jolly Marowak. If you're not using Roar, this obviously becomes less important, but beating Marowak is still useful, and you might want to get in a Haze before being hit by Surf. The spare EVs can go into either Special Attack or Special Defense.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is the most versatile special threat in ADV OU. Its Special Attack is off the charts and supported by a good Speed tier and respectable bulk. By compressing coverage into two staple attacks, it utilizes its filler moveslots and customizable EV spreads to insert itself into a broad range of archetypes. Notably, Zapdos fits like a glove on Spikesless offense teams, but it also finds its way into several formulations of Spikes offense, Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes (TSS), sand-less Spikes stall, and bulky setup teams. As an offensive threat, Zapdos's greatest asset is its immediate power and speed. Its typing also allows it to pivot into bulky Water-types and Metagross with ease. With Agility and Baton Pass, Zapdos can also support powerful teammates or act as a late-game cleaner. Its decent Attack stat also allows it to be a mixed wallbreaker. As a defensive tank, Zapdos boasts being the only specially bulky Spikes-immune Pokemon, and its ability, Pressure, allows it to stall out Pokemon that wall it. However, while Zapdos is fast, there are still a number of Pokemon in the metagame like Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Starmie that outspeed it; though these Pokemon either lack consistent raw power, move flexibility, or opportunities to switch into battle that Zapdos does, respectively, Speed is frequently enough of a reason to choose these threats over it when offensive teams need a fast late-game sweeper. With room for only two coverage moves on special sets, Zapdos has to make a compromise when choosing its intended targets. Zapdos also frequently falls short of 2HKOing Tyranitar, which can exploit this fact to set up a Dragon Dance sweep. Finally, the decent-at-best bulk of the defensive set, which is just enough for walling special attacks, is really appealing in theory, but a single misstep or critical hit may put Zapdos into an endless Rest loop, rendering it useless and making it a momentum drain for the rest of the game. In spite of these shortfalls, Zapdos is still an amazing Pokemon to use and a prevalent threat that every team must have a good strategy against to be viable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metal Sound can be used to put opposing Celebi and Blissey under increasing pressure until the opponent gives in and switches out to something frail to have it eat a Thunderbolt. It also prevents Curse Snorlax from setting up indefinitely if it is the opponent's last Pokemon. Choice Band can be used to OHKO Tyranitar and 2HKO Blissey with Hidden Power Fighting and to 2HKO Celebi with Drill Peck. Thunder's high-Base Power and paralysis rate allow Zapdos to muscle through Suicune and Snorlax more quickly, assuming it hits; it is most reliable on Rest Zapdos, which can boost its accuracy with Rain Dance and even out the odds of it hitting over the course of a long battle. Pinch Berries like Salac Berry, Petaya Berry, and Liechi Berry can be used with Substitute + Baton Pass Zapdos to support teammates offensively in the face of Zapdos's checks. Lum Berry can be used on mixed Zapdos to tide through a single turn of status from Blissey as Zapdos wallbreaks. A physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to keep the team safe from Choice Band Metagross and deal with Salamence in a pinch on teams without a bulky Water-type. This defensive variant is useful on paralysis spam teams, for example, which otherwise try to use an awkward combination of Gyarados's Intimidate and Marowak to deal with Salamence, Metagross, and Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey and Celebi are the best Zapdos checks in a vacuum, as they both have great special bulk and Natural Cure. Blissey takes almost nothing from Zapdos's special attacks, and Zapdos's mixed sets cannot 2HKO Blissey without some prior chip damage. Celebi is more susceptible to getting worn down by repeated uses of Hidden Power Ice and Toxic but can regain the lost momentum with Leech Seed or Calm Mind + Baton Pass. In practice, however, Zapdos users often maintain pressure on these checks with Metagross or Dugtrio at the back. Blissey and Celebi must also beware of Rest Zapdos, which requires additional offensive support to take down, either with sand or hard-hitting physical threats like Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>Snorlax is the standard offensive check to special attackers on Spikesless teams; it has a limited lifetime, especially under sand and with Spikes on the field, due to its lack of access to instant recovery, but it can come in once or twice against Zapdos and threaten to paralyze or KO it with Body Slam or Self-Destruct. Curse Snorlax is a little bulkier, but it otherwise suffers from similar issues. Jolteon is frequently used as an offensive check to Zapdos on Spikes offense teams due to its ability Volt Absorb, but Thunder Wave from Zapdos neuters Jolteon's greatest asset: its Speed. Defensive Jirachi can tank Zapdos's attacks all day and pass Wish, yet it similarly does not appreciate getting paralyzed. Regice is a niche special wall that is amazing at forcing Zapdos out by threatening to paralyze or OHKO it, though it is very vulnerable to Toxic and Spikes damage.</p> <p>It should be noted that Zapdos hates to be statused. Paralysis takes away the speed that makes Zapdos so threatening and immediately opens it up to all sorts of strong physical or super effective attacks, even from Pokemon like Swampert it is meant to check; this is an important factor to consider when deciding whether to trade Thunder Wave in the mirror matchup. Even though Zapdos is a specially offensive Pokemon, early-game poison and burn will still accrue a lot of damage on it, as Zapdos is likely to come into play multiple times throughout a game.</p> <p>Finally, Zapdos has some unique situational pivots and checks. Tyranitar can absorb Thunderbolt and take Zapdos down in a pinch, although it usually wants to save its HP for better uses like a Dragon Dance sweep. Claydol can come in on Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave and potentially use Refresh to eliminate Toxic poison. The opponent can then pivot to a check like Curse Snorlax or Rest Zapdos on Hidden Power to prolong the target's longevity. Dugtrio can do likewise, despite being a much riskier switch-in. Similarly, Magneton can take a Thunderbolt and disable Zapdos with a status move; this maneuver may be used to prolong Snorlax's longevity, especially on offensive teams. Finally, the combination of Swampert and Flygon can be used to cover both of Zapdos's Hidden Power types, but the weakness of this core to Water-types renders it pretty rare.</p>",

      "Standard Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Zapdos looks deceptively linear and straightforward, but it is one of the most temporally versatile Pokemon in ADV OU. Unlike wallbreakers that are early-game one-trick ponies or sweepers that only become potent in the late-game, Zapdos can find a role to play at every stage of the game. As a lead, offensive Zapdos scores an advantage over other common leads with its ability to prevents Spikes by forcing out Skarmory. It also preserves frail offensive teammates by forcing out Choice Band or mixed Salamence leads or neutering opposing Zapdos leads with Thunder Wave. Spikesless offense teams are quite weak to opposing Zapdos, so using one's own Zapdos to paralyze the other in the mirror lead matchup is crucial for success a lot of the time. Zapdos's filler move can be particularly helpful in dealing with unfavorable lead matchups: Baton Pass allows one to anticipate Focus Punch from Tyranitar, while Protect scouts the move of Choice Band Metagross, notably neutering any immediate attempt at using Explosion. Mid-game, Zapdos performs very well at maintaining momentum. As Zapdos is very reliable at forcing out Water-types and drawing in special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, one can keep up the offensive pressure by double switching to a wallbreaker like Choice Band or mixed Metagross or mixed Tyranitar. Complementarily, Zapdos supports these wallbreakers very well, following up with a KO when, for instance, Tyranitar's Hidden Power Grass fails to finish off Swampert or Snorlax's Self-Destruct leaves Metagross or Tyranitar hanging by a thread; the opponent will frequently hesitate to switch lest the pivot eat a chunk from Thunderbolt. Notably, Zapdos is so feared because even two of the Pokemon that wall it can be worn down over the course of the game. As offensive Snorlax is 4HKOed by Zapdos under sand, it can only switch into Zapdos twice and may even struggle to do so with Spikes on the field. Zapdos can also put Celebi on a timer with Toxic, repeatedly chip it with Hidden Power Ice as Celebi uses Recover until Toxic's incremental damage is too high to contain, and then deal a heavy blow on the forced switch with Thunderbolt. Finally, while Zapdos is not known to exclusively be a late-game sweeper, its good Speed tier and decent bulk allow it to wipe out weakened teams after their fast Pokemon have been dealt with.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass threatens Swampert, and Hidden Power Ice chips Celebi; this comparison is emphasized because Swampert is strong against physical threats but weak against mixed threats, while for Celebi it is the other way around. Thus, on offensive teams, the Hidden Power type is frequently chosen to complement the type coverage of Zapdos's teammates. Another use of Hidden Power Grass is to minimize one's exposure to Swampert, especially on offensive TSS teams that have no good switch-ins against Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Ice has the added benefit of OHKOing Salamence and Flygon; this is helpful when one fits Zapdos on certain mid-paced TSS and bulky offense teams that would otherwise get destroyed by mixed Salamence. The choice of status move tends to depend on the pace of the team and the selected coverage move. Generally, Thunder Wave is favored when the pace is high to completely nullify Pokemon like Gengar and opposing Zapdos that use their Speed to threaten frail, offensive Zapdos teams. Toxic is useful on slower teams like TSS that have the bulk to drag the battle out and rack up Toxic damage. There is a tendency to pair Hidden Power Ice with Toxic to force Celebi to switch eventually and to pressure Swampert; this pairing is by no means exclusive, however.</p> <p>The filler move is more useful than it might seem at first glance, and some of its uses have been explained in the context of leading with Zapdos. On TSS teams, Roar can be used to rack up Spikes damage, but even without Spikes on the field, Roar reverses the momentum gained by Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi pivoting in and prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up on Zapdos. The latter benefit is particularly notable when Zapdos is used on offense teams with shaky Tyranitar checks like Metagross and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass maintains momentum by eliminating the need to read switches, complementing hyper offense teams without defensive backbones really well. It is particularly useful for eliminating the prediction needed bringing in strong but frail threats like Fighting-types. Protect gives Toxic more turns to do damage. One can even consider a dual status Zapdos set for versatility against offensive and defensive teams. Substitute can function like Protect, with the advantages of blocking status, activating pinch Berries, and being transferred to another Pokemon with Baton Pass.</p> <p>Timid is generally the preferred nature, as there are a number of noteworthy threats that Zapdos can shut down by outspeeding or attempting to win the Speed tie. Timid Zapdos scores the Speed advantage against standard mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence, Timid Moltres, defensive Gengar, and the rare Jynx while Speed tying with opposing Zapdos, Timid Jirachi, Jolly Choice Band Salamence, Timid Celebi, and Charizard. A Modest nature can be considered, however; it greatly improves the odds of 2HKOing offensive Tyranitar and defensive Suicune after the latter has used Calm Mind, as well as scoring certain OHKOs on Dugtrio and offensive Swampert. A spread of 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe with a Calm nature can alternatively be used to provide as many opportunities as possible for Zapdos to pivot into Water-types and generate momentum; it is also helpful when the team is shaky against opposing Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Zapdos is most notably a staple on Spikesless offense teams, but it can also fit on comfortably on Spikes offense and TSS teams. On offensive teams, Metagross is perhaps its most commonly seen partner, as it comes in comfortably on all of Zapdos's counters—Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi—and threatens to punch through common defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Swampert either with Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash, a special attack, or just an unboosted attack if Spikes are down. Metagross also offensively checks Rock-types that Zapdos cannot hold its ground against, while Zapdos, in return, gets opportunities to switch in on Metagross's checks. In a similar vein, Tyranitar with Focus Punch also appreciates Zapdos's ability to lure in special walls. Other aggressive partners of offensive Zapdos that can exploit its momentum maintaining capabilities are Snorlax, and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass Zapdos in particular benefits from Gengar, which takes no damage from Tyranitar or Snorlax's Focus Punch and can fire off Will-O-Wisp to cripple Tyranitar or Snorlax. It also eases the entry of powerful but frail threats like Heracross, Breloom, Hariyama, and Medicham. Dugtrio and offensive Zapdos support each other well on Spikesless offense teams; several Pokemon that either counter Zapdos or give it some trouble like Celebi, Blissey, Tyranitar, and Heracross can be removed by Dugtrio, and Baton Pass provides a means by which Dugtrio can come in safely to perform the trap. Another partner most frequently seen on Spikesless offense teams is Dragon Dance Salamence, which complements Zapdos as a sweeper. Zapdos can exert a lot of pressure on bulky Pokemon with average Speed tiers but struggles to maintain supremacy over faster but frail threats like Starmie, Gengar, Jolteon, and even opposing Zapdos. Salamence appreciates bulky Pokemon weakened, and with some chip damage, it annihilates all fast threats after a Dragon Dance. On Spikes offense, the partner used to threaten opposing fast threats is commonly Jolteon, which can come in at multiple points in the game to force switches and accumulate Spikes damage. The synergy of two Electric-types enables complementary Hidden Power type coverage, and one Electric-type can trade Thunder Wave with opposing Electric-types to protect the other from status.</p>"
      },
      "Rest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rest Zapdos is notable as the only common specially bulky Spikes-immune Pokemon. On top of this, Pressure allows it to stall out walls over time. Thus, when physical threats have been removed, barring critical hits, Rest Zapdos can seem absolutely impossible to take down. Rest Zapdos generally appears on two archetypes: Spikes stall and bulky setup. On Spikes stall, Zapdos acts as a reliable phazer that has really good longevity and cannot be trapped. To underscore this point, compare Zapdos with Skarmory in their role as a phazer. With a single misprediction, Skarmory can easily be eliminated by Magneton. Even if the opponent does not have Magneton, it is nearly impossible to find a blanket solution that eliminates Skarmory's checks—Zapdos, Jolteon, Starmie, Moltres, and Gengar—to allow Skarmory to rack up Spikes damage. Furthermore, many of these checks are immune to Spikes and can come in repeatedly without a care. The Pokemon that can mount a significant offensive against Zapdos, however, including Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Metagross with the threat of Explosion, are all damaged by Spikes, and with some chip damage they can be trapped and eliminated by Dugtrio. Another function of Rest + Roar Zapdos is that it never allows Calm Mind users such as Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune to take advantage of the team. This is an important point because Spikes stall tends to rely on Blissey and Celebi as special walls; these Pokemon are too passive to inflict enough damage before an unstoppable number of boosts have been accumulated by the foe. On Spikesless bulky setup teams, Zapdos has three main roles. First, these teams tend to rely on Claydol to remove Spikes, but as Claydol has no real offensive presence, Skarmory can continue to come in indefinitely against it; Zapdos provides the pressure needed to keep Skarmory off the field. Second, Zapdos functions as a mid-game pivot that can protect Snorlax, Suicune, or Jirachi from taking too much chip damage before they start their Curse or Calm Mind sweep. Mid-game maneuvers may include pivoting in on Celebi's Leech Seed, Gengar's and Moltres's Will-O-Wisp, bulky Water-types, opposing Zapdos, Jolteon, Metagross, mixed Salamence, Heracross, and Gyarados. Note that even with all the defensive investment, Zapdos is particularly susceptible to damage, so care should be taken to get Zapdos in on relatively benign moves. Third, Zapdos eliminates sand via Rain Dance to promote the longevity of the aforementioned setup sweepers. As a word of caution, note that Rest Zapdos is extremely vulnerable to super effective damage taken while switching in and critical hits, as it frequently has just enough bulk to survive Rest loops but not any more than that. Having to use Rest prematurely is a huge momentum sink that allows setup threats like Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Curse Snorlax as well as Choice Band-wielding threats Tyranitar and Salamence to come in freely. Even assuming one is successful at navigating around these threats, getting Zapdos to wake up once it gets into a bad Rest situation requires quite a bit of skillful maneuvering. For example, carelessly sending Rest Zapdos into Modest Blissey's Ice Beam under sand and being forced to use Rest as a result means Zapdos will start off with two sleep turns at around 60% of its HP, and it becomes an uphill task to even keep Zapdos alive from there.</p> <p>Toxic lets Zapdos attempt to damage or force out everything that Thunderbolt cannot damage significantly, including Blissey, Celebi, Swampert, Flygon, and Claydol. As mentioned earlier, Roar goes well with Spikes, and Rain Dance supports Curse Snorlax and Suicune. Rain Dance also markedly improves Zapdos's longevity by removing sand, ensuring that it is almost never 3HKOed by Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt, defensive Gengar's Ice Punch, or Modest Blissey's Ice Beam. Light Screen can be used on teams that wish to protect Skarmory and Forretress from Magneton and KO it back with Dugtrio or Forretress's Earthquake; it also provides much-needed additional longevity for Zapdos, especially when one wants to keep sand around for indirect damage. It is possible to use both Light Screen and Roar without Toxic, especially when many Claydol and Swampert run Refresh, or if one still needs to patch up the weakness to Calm Mind users, but such a set's inability to hit offensive Swampert is a huge momentum loss. Alternative options in the fourth moveslot are Hidden Power Ice for extra pressure on Celebi and Hidden Power Grass for tackling Refresh Swampert. Thunder Wave can be used to inflict status on Jirachi, Snorlax, and Leftovers Tyranitar. Paralyzing opposing fast Zapdos and Jolteon also allows Rest Zapdos to exploit full paralysis to burn sleep turns. The EVs are selected for maximum special bulk, but one can also run 32 Speed EVs to outspeed all Tyranitar variants. 32 Defense EVs can be used to always survive Dragon Dance Salamence's boosted Rock Slide. It is inadvisable, however, to take too much away from Zapdos's special bulk because Zapdos frequently sits just below the threshold of getting 3HKOed by strong super effective special attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rest Zapdos is expected to come into play frequently over a long battle, so it is imperative that all of its physical checks be dealt with reliably. Tyranitar is best removed using Dugtrio, but an early-game check to it is also necessary to tide through periods of physical punishment, and Claydol is perfect for this. Claydol's Rapid Spin is also very useful for reducing Spikes damage for teammates over the course of a long battle, and Zapdos helps to cover the Water-types that Claydol attracts. In the rare instance that one decides not to use Dugtrio as a partner, another Rock-type answer such as Metagross is almost imperative. By virtue of using a slow Zapdos variant without Thunder Wave, Rest Zapdos teams are frequently weak to offensive Suicune and usually have to go out of their way to provide some mitigating measures for it. Blissey is the best answer to Suicune, but when it does not fit the style of the team, one can tweak Celebi to outspeed Suicune or attempt to wear Suicune down with Jirachi.</p> <p>On Spikes stall teams, Skarmory is the canonical Spiker, and it also checks Snorlax. A spinblocker in Gengar is especially useful, since Rest Zapdos has no direct way of damaging Claydol, many of which carry Refresh. Blissey with Aromatherapy can save Zapdos from dire circumstances when it gets forced into a Rest loop. Heal Bell Celebi provides similar support, and the combination of Zapdos and Celebi shields the team from most special threats that are either Water- or Electric-types. On bulky setup teams, Rest Zapdos supports Curse Snorlax, Rest Suicune, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi.</p>"
      },
      "Agility + Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is a variant of offensive Zapdos that performs a dual role as an offense supporter and late-game sweeper. Agility lets Zapdos outspeed every conceivable foe and pass the boost to a powerful threat to tackle bulky opposing Pokemon or directly wipe out frail offense teams itself. Zapdos excels at the Speed passing role because of its ability to pressure the common phazers Skarmory, Suicune, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Its versatility in being able to directly do damage ensures that it does not become deadweight in the event that Speed passing is unnecessary. A Modest nature is used not only because Agility makes up for the Speed lost, but also since after taking a hit to set up Agility, Zapdos can't really afford to take any more damage from Swampert or Dugtrio and would like them cleanly KOed. Furthermore, Baton Pass teams tend to make sacrifices defensively in favor of offensive momentum, so threatening the 2HKO may be essential to avoid a sweep from +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar. The EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Heracross while always surviving Modest Suicune's Calm Mind-boosted Ice Beam under sand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is an amazing partner for Zapdos. Not only does Celebi set up its own boosts and maintain the Baton Pass chain, it also has the right tools to stop Zapdos's checks from ruining the chain. For example, its ability Natural Cure lets it absorb Thunder Wave from Blissey and, with its reduced Speed, pass the boosts to the intended recipient, which can come in without taking a single hit. Celebi's Grass typing and boosted Hidden Power Fire also prevent opposing Celebi from trying to foil the plan with Leech Seed. Slow but powerful threats make great Baton Pass recipients. Especially when combined with Calm Mind boosts from Celebi, mixed recipients like offensive Swampert, Metagross, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Charizard appreciate Zapdos's Speed boosts to outspeed and threaten to KO their usual checks like Gengar, Zapdos, and Starmie. Alternatively, the Speed boost can be passed to physical threats, most notably Marowak, which has the advantage of being immune to Thunder Wave and can OHKO almost everything after a Swords Dance boost. Metagross, Machamp, and Rhydon are other possible physical Baton Pass recipients. Building along the same physically offensive path, one can also consider passing boosts with Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi with Magneton support.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Zapdos is a variant of offensive Zapdos with three attacking moves that hit almost everything for solid damage but usually fall short of scoring the OHKO. This shortfall is made up for by Spikes damage, where on Spikes offense teams, Zapdos performs the role of a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. Less commonly, mixed Zapdos gets its power boost passed from Swords Dance Celebi. Drill Peck's main function is to take a chunk off of Pokemon that normally wall Zapdos, such as Celebi and Blissey, while providing the auxiliary benefit of OHKOing Heracross. The sweeper set tends to use Hidden Power Grass + Agility for maximum type coverage with the listed EV spread to outspeed Heracross and to maximize the odds of OHKOing Swampert and Dugtrio. The latter point is especially important, as Zapdos is not expected to be able to survive another hit after already taking damage while using Agility. The wallbreaker set tends to run an EV spread of 252 Atk / 12 SpA / 244 Spe with a Lonely nature to exert maximum pressure on Celebi and Blissey, and Hidden Power Fighting on this set allows Zapdos to 2HKO Blissey under sand with three layers of Spikes on the field. Hidden Power Fighting also prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from getting two boosts on Zapdos and annihilating the entire team. As the Hidden Power Fighting set does not get past Swampert, it tends to be more useful to use a status move in the last slot if it is run. The last slot can also be used for a move that synergizes with the rest of the team, such as Roar or Baton Pass. On TSS teams, Roar can be used to rack up Spikes damage, but even without Spikes on the field, Roar reverses the momentum gained by Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi pivoting in and prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up on Zapdos. The latter benefit is particularly notable when Zapdos is used on offense teams with shaky Tyranitar checks like Metagross and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass generally maintains momentum by eliminating the need to read switches, but it notably synergizes with Swords Dance Celebi by helping to maintain the Baton Pass chain. Note that the roles of wallbreaker and sweeper are not entirely exclusive and are matchup dependent, for Zapdos's excellent all-around offensive stats allow its roles to intersect regardless of its EV spread. In its wallbreaking role, Drill Peck and Hidden Power Fighting are best used as surprises when the opponent inadvertently or inevitably lets Celebi or Blissey get chipped into 2HKO range of these moves over the course of a game, although with the alternate EV spread, an observant player might get suspicious the moment lower-than-expected damage from Thunderbolt is revealed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Zapdos is most frequently used on teams with an offensive slant. If Spikes is the method chosen to support mixed Zapdos, the Spiker can be Skarmory—the golden standard—but it can also be Cloyster, which is immune to trapping and uses Explosion and Surf to hold its ground against the premier Rapid Spin user, Claydol. Spikesless offensive support is also possible, albeit less common. Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi can also provide Zapdos with the firepower needed to muscle through its counters. Explosion from Gengar, Regice, and Weezing or forcing a trade with Dugtrio can also bring Zapdos's checks within KO range of its physical attacks without losing momentum.</p> <p>To fulfill its roles effectively, mixed Zapdos differs from standard offensive Zapdos in two ways. First, it relinquishes early-game utility, as it wants to stay damage and status free, leaving the team potentially vulnerable to status from opposing lead Zapdos. Second, its relatively low Speed allows it to be exploited by opposing Zapdos or even Moltres. Making up for the first point is not easy for Spikes teams, for Swampert and Metagross are risky pivots into status moves. Using Tyranitar as a pivot is perhaps the lesser of evils, as it is relatively slow to begin with and can force Zapdos out. Celebi can also be used as a pivot into status moves, but it can be exploited by dangerous threats like Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Tyranitar, so matching the low pace of Celebi to an offensive team will require some thought. Just like the standard offensive set, Pokemon that put pressure on Blissey and Snorlax like offensive Swampert and Metagross are good partners for mixed Zapdos, as Drill Peck lacks the power to muscle through them early-game. It's also important to emphasize the synergy of faster secondary sweepers as partners, not only to cover mixed Zapdos's lack of speed but also to benefit from its wallbreaking abilities. Jolteon, in particular, gets a special mention for its ability to check opposing Zapdos by trading Thunder Wave and to offer complementary Hidden Power type coverage. Jolteon also supports the team through discouraging opposing Zapdos' use of Thunderbolt with Volt Absorb, letting Tyranitar come in to absorb status with less fear of getting chipped too much.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres's position as an offensive Fire-type with a solid Speed tier and a Spikes immunity gives it quite the niche in ADV OU. Its access to STAB Flamethrower and Fire Blast allows it to pressure passive Pokemon like Skarmory and Celebi while offensively checking Metagross, Jirachi, Heracross, and Gengar. Moltres's ability to answer Metagross is particularly crucial, as it can deny Metagross momentum with the threat of a STAB Fire move, which helps protect a team's Skarmory or defensive Water-type from a potential Explosion. Furthermore, Moltres can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp for the purpose of crippling certain physical attackers, inflicting chip damage on Blissey, and forcing Snorlax and Suicune to Rest and become sitting ducks. Moltres's Speed tier of base 90 gets the jump on most of ADV's mid-ranged Speed tiers, beating out neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as the deadly Jolly Heracross with maximum investment, but it falls short of some of the tier's faster threats like Starmie and Jolteon. Moltres's weaknesses to Rock, Electric, and Water make it easy to force out after a KO, and thoughtlessly slapping it onto a team can exacerbate weaknesses to Pokemon like Zapdos, Starmie, and Aerodactyl. Moltres is a Pokemon that demands certain support structures to function at its best, but it serves those structures remarkably well and counters major threats that they would otherwise struggle against.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sunny Day can be used with Will-O-Wisp on defensive teams, with the idea being that a burned Tyranitar will eventually get whittled down and faint or be picked off by Dugtrio, allowing Moltres to dispel its sand with Sunny Day, making threats like CurseLax and Suicune much more difficult to deal with. Morning Sun works well with Sunny Day or an alternative weather removal option, as it provides a way to keep Moltres healthy throughout the game.</p> <p>Substitute can be used on sets intended for early-game use, taking the pressure off choosing between Will-O-Wisp or the Fire-type attack when you don't know your opponent's switch-in. However, such sets lack longevity and generally flounder against defensive answers to Moltres like Blissey and Suicune. In a different vein, Agility can be used to boost Moltres's Speed and allow it to clean against weakened teams. However, Moltres's Fire + Grass coverage is walled by certain common Pokemon—Salamence in particular—and thus it requires stringent support to be consistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Refresh Milotic is arguably the best check to Moltres that exists, being able to heal burns with Refresh and taking Hidden Power Grass with aplomb thanks to naturally high Special Defense and access to Recover. However, with prior chip damage as well as sand and Spikes support, Moltres can threaten to break through Milotic in a one-on-one situation; keep in mind that Milotic threatens to 2HKO Moltres with STAB Surf. Blissey easily takes all of Moltres's moves; however, it is annoyed by burn damage and can be chipped by phazing it on the switch with Spikes down. Suicune has prodigious natural special bulk combined with Calm Mind as well as Pressure to burn through Moltres' PP and Rest to heal off burns. Curse Snorlax poses a similar threat with its naturally high Special Defense, but both Pokemon cannot switch in repeatedly with sand and Spikes up and are vulnerable to being phazed if they are forced to Rest.</p> <p>Tyranitar of course threatens to destroy Moltres with Rock Slide or use it to set up Dragon Dances; however, the dino gets chipped by Spikes, particularly if running a Lum Berry—without which Will-O-Wisp becomes painful to deal with—and doesn't serve as a reliable long-term check. Furthermore, a cautious Moltres player can click Roar on a predicted Dragon Dance and deny Tyranitar the boost. The primary threat is ironically enough Pursuit Tyranitar, which, while not having Rock Slide, is less affected by Will-O-Wisp due to its usually all-special moveset, and it can use Pursuit to do up to 50% to Moltres as it switches out, setting it up to be KOed at a later point in the game.</p> <p>Zapdos has the special bulk to switch in once against any of Moltres's attacks, is unaffected by Spikes, and forces out Moltres with its STAB Thunderbolt. Starmie and Jolteon both outrun Moltres comfortably and threaten to dispatch it with their STAB attacks, and both can be EVed to switch in safely once. The above are primarily offensive checks though and are sometimes better used to force Moltres out after a KO rather than trading large amounts of HP to provide a one-time switchin. In a similar vein, Rock Slide Salamence and Aerodactyl can also be used to revenge kill Moltres, but they cannot switch in safely due to the risk of being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the standard offensive Moltres, wielding a STAB Fire-type move in conjunction with Hidden Power Grass to cover the majority of the metagame. The Fire-type move is dependent on choice—Fire Blast does more damage, securing the OHKOs against defensive Metagross and specially defensive Skarmory, whereas Flamethrower only gives favorable rolls with a Modest nature. At the same time, Flamethrower's greater PP and accuracy are hard to pass up, and it makes for a more consistent option on defensive teams. Hidden Power Grass destroys Swampert while doing decent damage to Suicune and Milotic and 3HKOing Tyranitar, warding the dinosaur off. Will-O-Wisp covers the handful of checks to Fire + Grass coverage—Salamence in particular—as well as bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax and Tyranitar that may attempt to switch in by crippling their offensive ability. The value of the chip damage that Will-O-Wisp can force onto Pokemon such as Blissey, Suicune, and Milotic cannot be overstated, especially in conjunction with sand and Spikes.</p> <p>Roar is generally the preferred fourth move, phazing bulkier Water-types and Blissey that otherwise switch in freely and forcing them to repeatedly take damage from Spikes. It also interrupts semi-Baton Pass chains that rely on Celebi to set up Calm Minds freely, stops Lum Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up for free unless it is the last Pokemon on the field, and generally takes advantage of the free turns Moltres is good at creating. Overheat can be paired with Flamethrower as an alternate Fire-type STAB attack, and with a Modest nature it threatens certain OHKOs that Fire Blast doesn't; primarily a 25% chance to put specially defensive Gengar into range of sand, and a 75% chance to OHKO uninvested Celebi and Jirachi after they've used Calm Mind once, forcing an opponent to think twice about staying in. Having two Fire-type STAB attacks allows Moltres to chip certain Pokemon like Zapdos and weakened Blissey and lull them into a false sense of security before blasting through them with Overheat, but all of the above comes at the cost of the momentum loss due to Overheat's stat drops. Protect is another option for a fourth move that allows you to rack up burn damage and scout against Choice Band users like Salamence and Aerodactyl that may be used to force Moltres out.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Moltres Speed tie opposing Moltres while providing as much power as possible. A Modest or Timid nature can be used depending on priorities; Timid allows Moltres to outrun neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and Jolly Heracross, while Modest's power can be particularly helpful in conjunction with Fire Blast or Overheat. The choice is generally up to the player. Moltres is usually best wielded as an early-game attacker, switching into Skarmory and Metagross and threatening to fire off attacks at will, but it must wary of a potential Toxic when switching in, as Toxic ruins Moltres's longevity. Moltres can also pivot well into Will-O-Wisps from Gengar early-game to take pressure off Blissey and Tyranitar without losing momentum.</p> <p>Moltres naturally draws comparisons to Charizard, which fills a similar niche but with a higher Speed tier and greater offensive presence. Charizard's access to Focus Punch allows it to single-handedly muscle through Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Blissey, all of which Moltres needs time and support to break through. Furthermore, its ability Blaze allows it to trade HP to boost Fire Blast's damage and wallbreaking power in a way Moltres can't, and its ability to Speed tie positive-natured base 100s like Zapdos and Jirachi can come in clutch. However, Charizard lacks the support options that Moltres has, and it lacks Special Attack compared to Moltres, being forced to rely on the more inaccurate Fire Blast for damage. In general, Moltres's defensive utility allows it to carve out a spot on Spikes teams, while Charizard fits better as a breaker on non-Spikes offense, although neither Pokemon is necessarily limited to said archetype.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support is hugely valued considering how this set's best switch-ins are Blissey, Suicune, and Milotic, followed by Rest Snorlax and Lum Berry Tyranitar. Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster all work well as partners and can somewhat act as checks to physical attackers while appreciating Moltres's ability to handle Calm Mind Celebi and Jirachi and OHKO Attack-boosted Metagross. Tyranitar's sand also goes a long way towards punishing Blissey and Suicune by denying them the passive recovery of Leftovers.</p> <p>Having a dedicated special wall is also hugely appreciated considering the threat that Pokemon like Zapdos, Starmie, and Jolteon pose to Moltres. All of Blissey, Snorlax, and Wish Jirachi can fill this role reasonably well. A dedicated Rock-type answer and physical defender like Swampert or Metagross, both of which can switch into Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, is just about required alongside Moltres given its severe weakness to Rock Slide users—Swampert tends to fit on more defensive lineups and also is a better overall Salamence check, while Metagross works on offense and can still thwart most of Choice Band Salamence's attacks. Additionally, Metagross can be used to demolish Blissey, which Moltres hugely appreciates. Defensive Flygon answers Tyranitar and Aerodactyl while being Spikes immune and checking Hidden Power Grass Electric-types in the short term, and it appreciates Moltres's ability to flambé Metagross, which Flygon struggles to switch into. Their shared Spikes immunity makes for a good defensive backbone for Superman-style teams, which are characterized by forgoing a Rapid Spin user or Magneton in favor of running multiple Pokemon immune to Spikes.</p> <p>Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon can slam defensive Water-types like Milotic and enjoy Moltres's ability to bully defensive Celebi and Wish + Protect Jirachi. Celebi's defensive and offensive sets provide a more consistent check and switch-in to said Water-types while appreciating Moltres's ability to destroy Steel-types and opposing Celebi. Furthermore, Celebi's Leech Seed in conjunction with Moltres's Will-O-Wisp and the sand and Spikes that usually partner with Moltres makes for a vicious slow burn that gradually wears opposing teams down to nothing, while offensive Celebi can pass Calm Mind boosts that make Moltres even more devastating offensively.</p>"

While Charizard--who has the same exact base stats as Typhlosion--can do a few more things than it, Typhlosion's main advantage is its access to Thunder Punch and lack of weakness to Electric.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Typhlosion is inferior to Blaziken at running a Reversal set, as it lacks STAB on the move and has lower Attack. Counter can surprise Earthquake users, but Typhlosion has to survive the hit first. Typhlosion can itself use Earthquake to dent other Fire-types and the rare Tentacruel. Overheat works as a last-ditch effort to deal heavy damage to a threatening opponent, but it'll have to switch right back out after using it due to the Special Attack drop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic, Suicune, and Vaporeon can take Fire-type attacks easily and deal heavy damage in return with STAB Surf. Swampert must watch out for Hidden Power Grass, but also has the option of hitting Typhlosion with Earthquake under Sunny Day. Gyarados can take anything Typhlosion throws at it bar Thunder Punch and OHKO with Earthquake. Salamence and Flygon resist Flamethrower and can take Typhlosion down with Earthquake; they fear only the rare Hidden Power Ice. Snorlax and Blissey wall purely special sets, but take 50-60% from Focus Punch.</p>",

      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Typhlosion hits quite hard off the bat, but once it Substitutes down to 25% HP or lower, both Blaze and Petaya Berry will activate, and together with STAB and Sunny Day, Flamethrower will rip through anything. Fire Blast is an inferior option in this case, because nothing is worse than missing when Typhlosion is about to sweep. This set works best as a late-game sweeper when counters to Typhlosion have been weakened enough for it to finish them off with Flamethrower. Hidden Power Grass deals with Swampert and the rare Quagsire, but Thunder Punch will OHKO Gyarados while getting a slightly harder hit on other Water-types. After boosts from Sunny Day and Blaze, however, Typhlosion's secondary move has to be 4x effective and the foe will have to resist Flamethrower for it to be weaker than Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Grass. Thunder Punch is also Typhlosion's only option against Flash Fire Pokemon such as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Houndoom.</p> <p>60 HP EVs give Typhlosion a HP stat of 312, which is exactly divisible by four; this ensures that the Petaya Berry activates at exactly 25%, or after three Substitutes. The Speed EVs let Typhlosion hit 310 Speed, which beats out neutral-natured Salamence and Zapdos. Maximize Special Attack, and dump the rest in Special Defense.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {"description": "<p>While not as scary as the previous set, this mixed attacking set can tear holes in offensive teams with some prediction. It is admittedly somewhat difficult to use properly, but a good player can reap rich rewards. Gyarados needs to be somewhat weakened for Typhlosion to finish it off with Thunder Punch. The same goes for Swampert with Hidden Power Grass or Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. If you predict a switch to Regice, Blissey, or Snorlax, use Focus Punch. Substitute is usable over Thunder Punch to ease up prediction and block status.</p> <p>Rash and Mild are the preferred natures, as this is a mixed set. The EV spread is relatively simple; Special Attack is maximized, 16 Attack EVs enable Typhlosion to lay the smack down on special walls with Focus Punch, 208 EVs are invested in Speed--if using Hidden Power Ice, use 4 extra Speed EVs--and the rest is put in HP.</p>"}

Icy Wind slows down opponents; while Azumarill might not be able to take full advantage of the Speed drops, its teammates might appreciate it.

Azumarill is too slow to use Belly Drum effectively, but it's there.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Azumarill is flat-out walled by Weezing, and possibly by Claydol too, though Hidden Power Ghost and Hidden Power Water will hurt. Skarmory can take a few Focus Punches or Hydro Pumps. Gyarados and Salamence also wall Azumarill decently as they resist Focus Punch and can Intimidate it. Gengar is annoying if you don't use Hidden Power Ghost or Substitute on the switch, as he's immune to Normal and Fighting and often packs Thunderbolt. Lastly, if Azumarill doesn't have a Substitute up, Dugtrio can revenge kill it.</p>",

Hidden Power Ghost grants it coverage on Gengar and other Ghosts, and should 3HKO most Dusclops. Sing and Encore can both buy Azumarill some extra time to use Substitute or Focus Punch.</p> <p>24 Speed EVs enable Azumarill to outspeed Swampert. HP investment should be maximized for 101 HP Substitutes, which will survive Night Shade and Seismic Toss, but if forgoing Substitute, hitting a stat of 401 HP is fine.

If your team really needs spin support, it's a good filler though. Triple Kick makes Hitmontop one of the best counters to Substitute Tyranitar in the game; it resists Crunch, has nice Special Defense to buffer Thunderbolt, and can weaken Rock Slide and Focus Punch with Intimidate. As Triple Kick will hit Tyranitar twice after breaking its Substitute, the only way Hitmontop will eat a Focus Punch is on the switch. Toxic and Thief are always decent filler options as well, while Substitute isn't bad on Bulk Up sets to protect against status. Revenge is amped up to a massive 120 Base Power if Hitmontop is hit first, and can be used instead of Counter to beat up special attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As previously alluded to, Hitmontop has a lot of trouble with standard Fighting resists. Zapdos, Salamence, and Gyarados all come in relatively easily on just about any move and really put a hurting on Hitmontop. Weezing can neuter Hitmontop with Will-O-Wisp and doesn't take much damage at all from any of its attacks. Skarmory can lay Spikes and hit it with super effective STAB Flying-type moves. It, along with Salamence and Gyarados, has to be wary of Counter, though. The same applies to Heracross: it can shrug off most of Hitmontop's hits and hurt it with even a resisted Megahorn, but Counter is deadly. Gengar fares well against Hitmontop as long as it doesn't take repeated Rock Slides and stays away from Hidden Power Ghost, while Dusclops can basically shrug off anything.</p>",

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double Kick can be used to break the Substitutes of Tyranitar and other threats, so it deserves a mention. Fire Blast can be replaced for Flamethrower, Overheat, or Blaze Kick: Flamethrower has reliable accuracy but less power. Overheat has both more accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but gives Blaziken a nasty Special Attack drop afterwards. Nonetheless, Blaziken doesn't mind this much as it's switching in and out all the time anyway. While not as strong as the other attacks, Blaze Kick has a higher critical hit rate that can be helpful in some situations. Brick Break can be substituted for Sky Uppercut anywhere it's listed if you hate missing; they both do roughly the same amount of damage in the long run.</p> <p>A Salac Berry is always a good alternative to Leftovers, because Blaziken isn't going to be taking many hits anyway, and the main purpose of Leftovers is to counteract Sand Stream. Many hits from OU Pokemon, such as Zapdos's Thunderbolt and Suicune's Surf, will just barely leave Blaziken alive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gyarados and Salamence resist both of Blaziken's STAB moves, and have Intimidate to further weaken its physical attacks. To add insult to injury, they almost always carry STAB Hidden Power Flying, which is a guaranteed OHKO, and Blaziken can't even Endure the hit and sweep with Reversal, as they resist the move and inflict an Attack drop on Blaziken.

For this reason, a Salac Berry isn't such a bad idea. Special Attack is given preference to Attack. As for Speed, maximum investment is an option to surprise Salamence that don't maximize Speed, and is especially handy if running Hidden Power Ice.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {
        "description": "<p>Blaziken has one major advantage over other users of Reversal: special STAB, which allows it to OHKO threats such as Weezing, Skarmory, and Gengar thanks to Blaze. Swords Dance is good if you can predict your opponent switching to a Pokemon such as Swampert; Blaziken can then Endure the super effective hit and OHKO with Reversal. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice nabs a surprise OHKO on Salamence that think they can Intimidate Blaziken and survive Reversal. Just be very careful using this, as Tyranitar runs rampant everywhere.</p> <p>Don't ever use Rock Slide on this set, as 1 HP Reversal is just as strong against Flying-types, and has no chance of missing. Focus Punch is an option if using Substitute in case your opponent tries to set up before Blaziken gets to 1 HP. Overheat has higher accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but you can only use it once; conversely, though, Blaziken will normally only need to use it once. Flamethrower doesn't have the power to OHKO Weezing.</p> <p>This set must hit 264 Speed; in fact, 270 isn't such a bad idea. It beats out Adamant Heracross and makes Blaziken faster than all Pokemon bar Electrode and Ninjask after a Salac boost.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Believe it or not, Blaziken makes a surprisingly decent Choice Band user. If you are good at prediction, this set is just as good as the specially based Blaziken set, or maybe even a tad better. It is probably one of the best ways Blaziken can take down the bulky Water-types that tend to switch in on it. The EVs are straightforward: maximum Attack and Speed let Blaziken hit as hard and as fast as possible.</p>"},
      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>Predict a switch, get a Substitute up, and have fun smiting the switch-in. Focus Punch does loads of damage, Hidden Power Ice takes care of Salamence, while Thunder Punch destroys Gyarados and weakened Water-types. Salac Berry is a nice option for when you get on low health; it might even fool opponents into believing Blaziken has Reversal. Again, Hidden Power Ice variants should go for maximum Speed to catch slower Salamence off-guard.</p>"}

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>As the premier answer to some of the tier's most feared physical attackers and offense in general, Swampert is truly a leviathan of ADV OU. Defensively, Swampert's solid bulk and resistances to Rock and Steel allow it to answer Tyranitar, Metagross, and Aerodactyl; its access to Ice Beam allows it to counter physical Salamence and Flygon; and its immunity to Electric allows it to stop Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon that run Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, Swampert's immunity to sand and access to Refresh and Roar give it both longevity and the ability to check setup sweepers on balanced and defensive teams, especially in conjunction with Protect to scout offensive Pokemon and gain passive healing from Leftovers. Swampert's defensive prominence is such that it has encouraged both Electric-types and mixed attackers to run Hidden Power Grass as a standard move for the sole purpose of beating it, a testament to its ubiquity and value. Offensively, Swampert's durability and solid Special Attack, as well as Torrent, give it the ability to fire off strong Hydro Pumps at defensive cores, and it can wield Earthquake and Focus Punch to dismantle Blissey, the tier's answer to special moves. Swampert can also run a Substitute + Endeavor set, whose potent Hydro Pump and immunity to sand make it a threatening wallbreaker or cleaner. On offensive sets, the characteristics that make Swampert's defense so stifling can be used to develop momentum and exploit mismatches and free turns with ease. Despite all this, Swampert struggles to break through the tier's other bulky Water-types, Milotic and Suicune, and it is walled cold by Celebi, which can outright use it as setup fodder. Furthermore, Spikes and attackers running Hidden Power Grass threaten to take huge chunks out of Swampert's HP, and its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers can make it difficult for it to last throughout a game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse Swampert is a threatening sweeper with longevity through Rest, but the ubiquity of Ground-immune Pokemon and mixed attackers running Hidden Power Grass tends to hamper its sweeping prospects. An all-physical or even Choice Band Swampert would do better at pushing through defensive Water-types and could potentially lure in Celebi and KO it with Hidden Power Bug, but it would be required to drop Hydro Pump and thus require Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar to avoid becoming bait for Skarmory and Gengar. In a similar vein, a Substitute + Focus Punch set similar to non-Salac Berry offensive Swampert could work, brutalizing Blissey and Snorlax much harder at the cost of requiring the same support an all-physical Swampert would and struggling even more against other Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-types are the biggest threats to Swampert, as they hit it super effectively and target its only weakness. Celebi's natural defenses and access to Recover render Swampert almost deadweight, as it can come in repeatedly for free and create free turns, while Swampert can do little to dissuade it short of freezing it with Ice Beam. Venusaur, while lacking recovery, can still come in on Surfs and Hydro Pumps and threaten to land Sleep Powder on something. Opposing Water-types also give Swampert trouble, as they resist Hydro Pump, have the bulk to take Earthquakes, and can usually win the slugfests. Milotic and Rest Suicune are the primary examples of this, although Recover Starmie also deserves a mention. Cloyster, while not having recovery, can set Spikes against Swampert with impunity or threaten to use Explosion on it. Specially defensive Skarmory threatens to poison</p> <p>Skarmory with Toxic and lay down Spikes against it, cutting into its longevity, and with its heavy Special Defense investment, it can shrug off Swampert's Hydro Pumps. Heracross is an interesting example of a check, as it resists Earthquake and Focus Punch while having the natural bulk to switch into Hydro Pump once, and the sheer physical threat it poses can force Swampert to retreat rather than take a STAB Megahorn. However, Heracross lacks recovery and is worn down quickly by sand and Spikes, so it prefers to come in on pivots wherever possible. Gyarados's primary niche is its ability to handle defensive Water-types in a way that Tyranitar and Salamence cannot; it can potentially run Taunt to shut down Swampert's utility options and threatens to set up Dragon Dance while shrugging off resisted Surfs and weak Ice Beams. However, it has poor longevity and is more of an exploiter than a counter.</p> <p>In a different vein, Swampert's towering status over the metagame almost mandates the heavy use of Hidden Power Grass, and Swampert must always be wary of its specter. Gengar, Zapdos, and Salamence all threaten to land Hidden Power Grass while being able to switch in on predicted Earthquakes, and even a Tyranitar or Jolteon may reveal it to blow through a weakened Swampert. Furthermore, Swampert's heavy reliance on Protect for recovery and scouting can allow a skilled player room to create free switches and bring in offensive threats for free, so while none of these Pokemon are switch-ins, the threat they pose must be accounted for by the Swampert's player.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is Swampert's bread and butter, maximizing its ability to act as a team's defensive backbone against the tier's physical behemoths. Ice Beam and Earthquake are both attacks with a defensive purpose; Ice Beam covers Salamence and Flygon, as well as 2HKOing Aerodactyl, while Earthquake beats Tyranitar and Metagross. Protect is the primary ingredient to this set's longevity; while Swampert has only Rest for instant recovery, it is immune to sand and carries Leftovers, so it can use Protect to heal by constant increments for free and work around attempts to wear it down. Hydro Pump is an offensive move meant primarily to cover Skarmory and Gengar and deny them the ability to switch in for free. Hydro Pump also does higher damage than Earthquake or Ice Beam against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, OHKOing the latter with 36 Special Attack EVs and OHKOing both if Torrent is activated, which can mean avoiding a sweep in close games. However, a more defensive Swampert has other options to use: Roar keeps defensive setup sweepers like Suicune, Snorlax, and Jirachi from setting up for free and racks up Spikes damage against grounded Pokemon, while Refresh allows Swampert to shrug off poison and burn, keeping it from being worn down by status.</p> <p>The given spread maximizes Swampert's ability to take hits—248 HP EVs and 44 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Swampert survives Hidden Power Grass from Modest Zapdos from full, while the rest of the EVs go into Defense. As an alternative, 36 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Swampert's Hydro Pump will OHKO uninvested Aerodactyl. Running 96 Special Attack EVs with a Quiet nature threatens higher damage against Skarmory and Gengar, which certain teams may desire. Overall, Swampert's EVs can be reallocated in a variety of ways depending on priorities.</p> <p>This Swampert generally serves as the first line of defense against physical threats early-game, yet it requires an element of caution as well. Protect should be used early-game to scout for Hidden Power Grass from Tyranitar, Zapdos, or Salamence as well as a potential Explosion from Metagross, and a player should be willing to use pivots and double switches to protect Swampert from being hit by these. Damage rolls are important for identifying a Choice Band attacker. When given free turns, Hydro Pump is usually the best move to use, or Roar if dropping Hydro Pump. If lacking Refresh, be wary of taking Toxic from Skarmory or Zapdos so Swampert can check Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Choice Band Aerodactyl late-game. Protect gains value mid- and late-game for regaining health so a sustained physical assault doesn't wear your Swampert down, though you should be wary of overusing the move and giving up free turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert works well as a standalone wall, but it requires certain support to function at its best. In particular, Swampert wants switch-ins that can pressure Suicune, Milotic, and Celebi, all of which it struggles to touch, as well as a counter to Hidden Power Grass Electric-types and mixed attackers in general. Celebi and Flygon counter Hidden Power Grass Electric-types while appreciating Swampert's ability to deal with Hidden Power Ice Electric-types, while Blissey's ability to stonewall special attackers complements Swampert beautifully. Faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Starmie, and Jolteon can be used as one-time switch-ins against mixed attackers to force them out and make Swampert's life easier. Zapdos can check both Metagross and mixed Salamence while heavily pressuring Skarmory and defensive Water-types, which Swampert appreciates immensely. In a similar vein, Moltres's ability to cover Swampert against Metagross and destroy Celebi is extremely valuable.</p> <p>Due to its lack of immediate offense, Swampert appreciates Spikes and sand support to punish more defensive teams that it can be deadweight versus. Both Skarmory and Tyranitar cover Snorlax, a major physical threat that Swampert doesn't beat on its own, and can back it up against physical threats in general. In addition, Swampert lacking Hydro Pump struggles against Skarmory, Forretress, and Gengar, so it appreciates Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar's support, and even with Hydro Pump it tends to appreciate Skarmory and Gengar's removal from the game. Lastly, Salamence and Metagross make phenomenal partners for Swampert; Salamence can weaken physical attackers with Intimidate and tempt the opponent to use Rock Slide so Swampert can easily switch in, while Metagross serves as a backup Rock-type answer and check to physical attackers. Both Pokemon also provide the instant offense that this Swampert lacks, which helps to round out a team.</p>"
      },
      "Surf Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set constitutes a variant on the above defensive set that sacrifices self-sufficiency for certain utilities and a more intuitive playstyle.  STAB Surf allows Swampert to cover the metagame in a similar way that Hydro Pump does, allowing it to guarantee neutral damage on switch-ins like Skarmory and Gengar. Toxic complements Surf, targeting Water-resistant Pokemon like Celebi, Suicune, and Salamence and passive Pokemon like Blissey, keeping them from staying in with impunity. Protect can be used to rack up Toxic damage against aggressive attackers like Salamence and stay healthy in slugfests against Blissey, as well as letting Swampert heal up through Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Refresh completes this set utility-wise, making it impossible to wear down via status. Roar usually fits better on teams that need a phazer, as denying free setup to Dragon Dance Salamence and defensive Calm Mind Jirachi can be quite important considering that this set forgoes Earthquake and Ice Beam. The choice between these moves comes down to team-based necessity. The given EVs maximize Defense while letting Swampert outspeed uninvested Tyranitar and Quiet Metagross and guaranteeing survival against Hidden Power Grass from Modest Zapdos. Note that forgoing Earthquake allows Swampert to run a Bold nature to outrun standard defensive Swampert.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forgoing Earthquake and Ice Beam means that Choice Band Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence pose great threats to this particular Swampert set, as its lack of a super effective attack grants them more turns to attack and more chances to potentially break through. Skarmory's support helps cover both of these Pokemon, while setting Spikes to help compensate for Swampert's lack of instant offense and punish grounded Pokemon like Milotic, Suicune, Celebi, and Snorlax that would otherwise switch in for comparatively free. Tyranitar's sand also inconveniences these Pokemon, and it can cover Swampert's back against Pokemon like Gengar, Jirachi, Snorlax, and physical Salamence. As Surf does less damage to Skarmory than Hydro Pump does, Magneton support is much appreciated with this Swampert to prevent Skarmory from freely laying Spikes down. It also helps that Magneton brutalizes Milotic while removing weakened Metagross, both of which this Swampert struggles against. Lastly, a consistent switch-in to Celebi, such as Salamence, Moltres, or Aerodactyl, generally partners well with this Swampert. Moltres in particular can destroy Skarmory and check Metagross, both of which this Swampert appreciates</p>"
      },
      "Standard Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>As a contrast to the above sets, this is an offensive Swampert set that relies on its mixed attacking power to break common defensive archetypes and punish some of its standard checks. Hydro Pump threatens to 2HKO or 3HKO virtually any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Focus Punch works to get a guaranteed hit on predicted switches and, more importantly, prevents Blissey from freely recovering with Soft-Boiled, which keeps it from being a reliable check. Ice Beam primarily nails specially defensive Zapdos as well as Salamence and Grass-types. Earthquake gives Swampert mixed attacking coverage, which helps wear down Blissey, pressures specially defensive Jirachi, and guarantees the KO on Tyranitar and Metagross at certain ranges rather than risking a Hydro Pump miss.  However, as all these Pokemon are covered to some extent by Hydro Pump and Focus Punch, Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth slot on more offensive teams, where luring in and removing opposing Swampert and clobbering Cloyster might be higher priorities.</p> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Rash nature maximize Swampert's damage output, while the Speed investment allows it to outrun Adamant Claydol as well as Blissey, specially defensive Skarmory, and slower variants of Metagross and Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs go into Defense as opposed to HP to maximize Swampert's ability to take physical hits, which this spread takes noticeably worse than usual. 28 Attack EVs ensure that a Focus Punch followed by an Earthquake from Swampert will always KO Blissey from full with sand up, thereby ensuring that using Focus Punch against Blissey on the switch will pay off. Bulkier spreads are of course possible, as is maximizing Speed for the purpose of outrunning Jolly Marowak and negative-natured Wish + Protect Jirachi.</p> <p>This set is meant to be played aggressively, relying on Swampert's natural ability to force switches and Hydro Pump's damage output for offensive momentum. It's generally better to bring this Swampert in on predicted switches and resisted moves like Rock Slide than to take massive damage from Choice Band Metagross or mixed Tyranitar. The player should be willing to trade Swampert's health for potential KOs or preserve it so it can hold off an expected Dragon Dance Tyranitar or Aerodactyl in the back. Prediction is key when using this Swampert. Keep in mind that despite the offensive spread, this Swampert cannot break through Milotic, Rest Suicune, or Celebi without significant luck, and thus it should always avoid those matchups. As always, be wary of Hidden Power Grass, as the lack of HP investment leaves Swampert vulnerable to being outright KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross is absolutely integral as a partner, as this Swampert cannot be relied on defensively and thus requires the support of a backup Rock-type check and check to physical attackers. Metagross and Swampert together form a dual status pivot core against Blissey; Metagross is immune to Toxic, and Swampert is immune to Thunder Wave. Thus, they exert massive pressure on it for an offensive team while playing around potential status attempts. Metagross tends to appreciate Swampert's targeting of Skarmory and opposing Swampert while threatening to use Explosion on Milotic and Suicune and thereby open up Swampert as a threat. Salamence draws Rock Slides that give Swampert an opportunity to switch in, and its Intimidate cushions physical blows for Swampert to come in on, while it appreciates the offense this set brings. Salamence pairs extremely well with both Metagross and Jirachi as well, providing offense and an immunity to Earthquake. Offensive Celebi and Zapdos threaten to blow through Milotic, Rest Suicune, and Recover Starmie, all of which this Swampert struggles to touch.  Furthermore, they can potentially Baton Pass Calm Mind or Agility boosts to Swampert, making it much more of an offensive threat. Hidden Power Grass Swampert particularly appreciates these boosts, as at +1 or +2, it can push through Milotic and Suicune on its own.</p> <p>As always, Spikes are helpful to punish Grass-types and bulky Water-types, which tend to switch into Hydro Pump with impunity. Skarmory and Cloyster can also back Swampert up against physical attackers that threaten it. Lastly, faster Pokemon like Starmie and Jolteon appreciate this Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities while threatening mixed attackers like Salamence that can give it trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Salac Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute + Salac Berry Swampert is, if anything, an even more all-in approach to offensive Swampert. This set relies on many of Swampert's useful characteristics: Torrent, an immunity to sand, and access to Endeavor, which make it a frightening sweeper.</p> <p>Substitute lets Swampert reduce its HP to active Torrent and its Berry, while Endeavor capitalizes on that loss of HP to beat defensive Pokemon. Hydro Pump is the usual Water-type STAB attack, which does frightening damage when boosted by Torrent, but Surf's accuracy is appreciated on certain teams, particularly with Magneton support to nullify Skarmory. Roar constitutes a surprisingly innovative option for a fourth move, capitalizing on Endeavor. As many potential answers to this set—Milotic, Celebi, and Blissey,—have instant recovery moves and can thus stall out Endeavor, Roar's negative priority guarantees them to be forced out and puts your opponent into an uncomfortable situation. If they switch back to their counter as you use Endeavor, they've lost their counter; if they leave whatever Roar forced in to take a Hydro Pump, they're a Pokemon down. In addition, Roar provides defensive utility in denying Calm Mind users such as Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, which tend to threaten the teams this Swampert usually finds itself on.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option to cover Celebi and drops Salamence, the latter of which might be important for a team to cover, but the fact that both of Ice Beam's targets are affected by sand and technically covered by Endeavor is another mark in favor of Roar's viability. Swagger constitutes an additional option, as the confusion chance forces a similar coinflip for the opponent, but unlike Roar it has no utility and can potentially backfire.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward: maximum Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. Note that even after the Salac Berry boost, Swampert is outrun by Starmie, Jolly Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon. This Swampert is fairly intuitive as far as play goes—use Substitute when given free turns, use Hydro Pump against passive Pokemon or phazers, and start using Endeavor once Salac Berry activates. Generally, one should try to bring this set in on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence, as their hits will force Swampert into Salac Berry range quicker and reverse an attacker's momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Swampert is completely unreliable defensively and must be paired with other offensive checks to physical attackers so its team won't be overwhelmed. Metagross's support is virtually obligatory to check Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, as well as Dragon Dance Salamence should this set not run Ice Beam. In addition, Metagross's Choice Band-boosted Earthquake utterly destroys Thunderbolt + Ice Punch Jirachi, which this Swampert cannot check without Roar and cannot beat outright. Magneton's support is surprisingly helpful, as it offers an additional Rock-type resistance while trapping Skarmory, whose Spikes and Whirlwind can interfere with Swampert's attempts to sweep, and allows Swampert to use the more accurate Surf with fewer risks.</p> <p>This Swampert tends to target defensive cores and thereby open them up for offensive Pokemon; Zapdos and Suicune appreciate Swampert removing Celebi and Blissey, while Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence appreciate the removal of opposing Suicune and Milotic as well as Skarmory being weakened. Offensive Suicune is an interesting partner for this Swampert set, as it can also serve as a one-off check to physical threats and backs up Swampert while exerting massive pressure on Pokemon such as Skarmory and Snorlax.  These two form a double Water-type core that can ground a team offensively and defensively. Lastly, sand is a helpful complement to Swampert's offense to finish off defensive Pokemon weakened by Endeavor. Dragon Dance Tyranitar also tends to appreciate this Swampert's ability to break defensive cores and open up sweeping opportunities. As an alternate option, however, Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Gengar, which can be quite the annoyance to Swampert with its immunity to Endeavor, and it can run Ice Beam to cover Roar variants against Dragon Dance Salamence.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir has an immense movepool, and this is the key to keeping it from being outclassed by other Psychics. However, it has severe Speed problems, so it will not often sweep teams unless it has a Salac Berry to back it up. Nonetheless, it can mess with common Psychic counters, such as Metagross and Snorlax, and is an excellent team supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gardevoir's movepool is humungous, to say the least, and it is very versatile: you can vary its moveset to fit your team, mixing and matching moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, and Wish as you find appropriate. Fire Punch is good for Grass- and Steel-types, such as Celebi and Metagross, respectively. As with its fellow Psychic-types, Gardevoir can make use of Hidden Power Grass to hurt Tyranitar and Claydol, and of course to OHKO Swampert. Psych Up lets it steal boosts from the likes of Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, and then proceed to beat them up: Suicune will fall to Thunderbolt, Jirachi to Fire Punch, and Celebi to either Fire Punch or Ice Punch. The paralysis provided by Thunder Wave is always appreciated, as are the defensive boosts from Light Screen and Reflect. Gardevoir can also sacrifice itself with Memento to set up a sweep for a Belly Drum or Focus Punch user, but beware of Metagross's Clear Body. Snatch is another way of wrecking opposing Calm Mind users.</p> <p>It should be noted that while Trace is a fun ability and the more useful one as well, Synchronize can be neat as it lets Gardevoir switch into Will-O-Wisp from Dusclops or Weezing and burn them in return. Gardevoir detests being burned, though, so be sure to pack cleric support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey sponges any special attack, but she cannot beat Gardevoir on her own if Gardevoir has Wish or Rest, and Gardevoir might trap her with Mean Look. Snorlax hates being hit by Will-O-Wisp, but it can Curse up and Rest it off if it so desires, and pounds Gardevoir on its low Defense. Calm Mind-boosted Psychic will hurt Snorlax though, so be careful. Metagross resists Psychic and Ice Punch and can Meteor Mash Gardevoir into oblivion; just avoid Will-O-Wisp and Fire Punch. Tyranitar is immune to Psychic and can dent Gardevoir with STAB Rock Slide or Crunch, but again, beware of Will-O-Wisp. Celebi and Jirachi both resist Psychic and can engage Gardevoir in a Psychic war; if Gardevoir isn't packing Calm Mind, they will likely pose problems. Claydol can attack Gardevoir with Earthquake, but if Gardevoir switches in, it will Trace Levitate. Psych Up Regice can go toe-to-toe with Calm Mind variants, but it might need a critical hit or a freeze to emerge victorious. Without Calm Mind, Gardevoir isn't getting past Regice anytime soon, though.</p> <p>Generally, Gardevoir cannot stand up to strong physical hits. While they cannot effectively switch into Gardevoir's powerful special attacks, Tauros, Aerodactyl, Dodrio, and Salamence are all faster and can put the hurt on Gardevoir. Heracross works as well; while it has the advantage of being able to absorb Will-O-Wisp, it must be wary of Psychic. Also, note that Timid Gardevoir is faster than Adamant Heracross. Choice Band Swellow too will easily OHKO Gardevoir with a Guts-boosted Return, Double-Edge, or Facade.</p>",

Once it's on the field, proceed to boost up with Calm Mind and smite opponents with powerful attacks off that mighty Special Attack stat. If Snorlax is ruining your fun, Will-O-Wisp will teach it a lesson; alternatively, Gardevoir can also use Destiny Bond to take a foe down along with it. A Salac Berry isn't a bad idea here, but note that it might give away the surprise. Note that the options in the last two moveslots can all be used interchangeably, and with just about any alternative in the Other Options section as well.</p> <p>Offensive variants of Gardevoir, like this one, should mostly invest in Speed and Special Attack.

Imprison can prevent opponents from using Rest or a status move, while Snatch grabs useful support effects such as Blissey's Soft-Boiled. Counter can let Dusclops catch some threats, such as Curse Snorlax and Choice Band Guts Heracross, off-guard. Hidden Power Flying can be used if you desperately need a Heracross counter, and it also helps against Breloom and Machamp.</p> <p>There are two main advantages to using Rest over Pain Split: in addition to healing it fully, Rest also cures Dusclops of status. Pain Split, on the other hand, heals Dusclops without putting it to sleep, and will also lower the opponent's health. It can even bring the likes of Blissey and Snorlax to well below 50%, and almost fully heal Dusclops when used against most healthy enemies. However, Pain Split will not be as effective against weakened opponents. With Pain Split, Dusclops will also find it difficult to actually KO its opponents, because it will be worn down alongside them, and its low Speed leaves it unable to deal a fast final blow. Rest is also the better move for PP stalling, which Dusclops does very well with its high defenses, access to Will-O-Wisp, and Pressure ability. Additionally, Pain Split doesn't remove status. Some Claydol carry Toxic, so Dusclops will likely need Rest or cleric support to reliably block Rapid Spin for long. Even if using Rest, though, Dusclops appreciates cleric support, as it removes the biggest problem of Rest: the two turns of sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Houndoom can come in on Will-O-Wisp or Shadow Ball easily and has both Crunch and Pursuit; the former hurts Dusclops if it stays in and the latter if it switches out. Tyranitar has to avoid Will-O-Wisp at all costs, but he can Substitute or Taunt, Crunch for a load of damage, or set up Dragon Dance boosts. Both of these are taken care of by a swift Focus Punch, however.</p> <p>Skarmory doesn't take much damage from physical assaults, and is not 3HKOed by Seismic Toss or Night Shade. A burn reduces Skarmory's damage output, but most of the time he will handle the damage just fine, and can set up Spikes in the meantime. Suicune survives five Seismic Tosses, and can Calm Mind up and KO with Surf. Milotic can switch in on Will-O-Wisp to activate Marvel Scale, and use either Toxic or Hypnosis to cripple Dusclops. Milotic cannot outright KO Dusclops, though.</p> <p>Guts Pokemon, namely Heracross, Ursaring, Swellow, Hariyama, and Machamp, can take advantage of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Although their best STAB attacks won't work well--or at all--on Dusclops, their coverage moves nonetheless do a number on Dusclops; they can then proceed to clean up the rest of your team.</p>",

It is one of the reasons people run Magneton instead of a hardy spinner, and forgo Claydol for Donphan, who can hit Dusclops hard on the switch with a STAB Earthquake off base 120 Attack.</p> <p>Anyway, the premise is simple: block Rapid Spin, burn opponents, and when low on health, Pain Split or Rest. Dusclops even beats Blissey flat with Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and repeated Focus Punches. Even if Blissey attacks with Ice Beam, the burn will force it to recover eventually, and Dusclops will land a Focus Punch.</p> <p>36 Attack EVs guarantee Shadow Ball will OHKO Alakazam, while maximum HP is a must due to Dusclops's low HP stat. The remaining EVs can be split between Defense and Special Defense depending on what Dusclops needs it for. Defense EVs help a lot against Donphan, Heracross, Medicham, and Snorlax, while Special Defense investment buffers hits from special attackers such as Blaziken, Starmie, and Alakazam. Finally, one can run use 48 Speed EVs to outspeed Snorlax.</p>"

However, if Sleep Clause has already been activated, Dusclops can Calm Mind up to take less damage from Surf, and then Pressure stall it with Rest.</p> <p>Thunder Punch and Fire Punch are alternative attacks worth considering on this set. Maximum HP is still a must, and EVs should be concentrated in Defense as Calm Mind will boost Dusclops's Special Defense anyway.</p>"},

It's also a great sleep absorber and switch-in to Pokemon such as Breloom and Jynx.</p> <p>As with the first set, 36 Attack EVs make Shadow Ball a guaranteed OHKO on Alakazam. 252 HP EVs maximize Dusclops's low HP stat, and the rest balance its defenses.</p>"}

This does not hamper it as much as you might believe, however, as even an uninvested Regirock can survive Adamant Choice Band Medicham's High Jump Kick. Furthermore, it has crucial resistances to Normal and Flying, while Regice does not have any special resistances save Ice. With decent coverage between a STAB Rock attack and Superpower, Regirock can counter Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Gyarados--though watch out for Hydro Pump. Finally, if there is an enemy Pokemon your team can't handle, Regirock always has a trump card in Explosion to blast that opposing Pokemon out of the way.</p>",

Counter is a great move with Focus Punch, however, as it forces opponents into guessing games as to whether to attack, set up, or switch.</p> <p>Thunder Wave should usually be the first move Regirock uses, because paralysis is always handy. Remember, Regirock's massive Defense allows it to take even STAB Earthquake and retaliate with Counter for the KO. If it lacks Counter, though, this set faces obvious problems with Claydol and Flygon, as all it will be able to do is use Explosion. Considering Regirock's nice Attack stat, it can blow up many threats.</p> <p>The spread is simple and straightforward: maximize HP and Attack. An Adamant nature is recommended, but Impish is also viable thanks to its massive Defense.

Rock Slide can help flinch a Skarmory using Whirlwind.</p> <p>As usual, focus on HP and Attack for bulk and power. However, emphasis should be placed on Special Defense as Curse will boost Regirock's Defense to the point where, after a few Curse boosts, non-STAB Earthquakes will do a pittance to it. Do keep in mind that Regirock has decent Special Defense and can survive attacks such as unboosted Suicune's Surf and Zapdos's Thunderbolt.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>While Regirock's stats might seem more defense-oriented, it does have some great attacking moves. Superpower works much like Focus Punch, but requires less prediction and can be used several times before Regirock is forced to switch out.</p> <p>Hidden Power Rock is superior to Rock Slide on this set as it does more damage; Regirock is too slow to take advantage of the latter's flinch chance. In fact, the only notable Pokemon it outspeeds is Snorlax, who is hit harder by Superpower. The only reason to use Rock Slide would be to run Hidden Power Bug, which OHKOes Celebi, surprises other Grass-types, and does decent damage to Claydol. However, it is mostly inferior to the other moves.</p> <p>Again, maximize HP and Attack, and go with Adamant for a further Attack boost.</p>"},

Psych Up also works perfectly alongside Superpower by getting rid of Superpower's stat drops.</p> <p>This set must be used with Spikes support; otherwise, opponents will simply switch out of Swagger at no cost and leave Regirock with nothing to Psych Up. With Spikes on the field, opponents will think twice about switching, especially as Flying-types such as Gyarados, who are immune to Spikes, face the threat of a super effective STAB Rock Slide.</p>"}

  },
  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice holds a niche as the only special wall in ADV OU that has both a specially offensive slant and a way to remove opposing special walls through Explosion. Its powerful Ice + Electric coverage together with the threat of Thunder Wave reliably forces out fast, frail special threats like Zapdos and draws in a whole host of bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Snorlax, Metagross, and Tyranitar. As a result, Regice does not only possess the role of breaking special walls, but it also serves as a key pivot to other offensive threats like Choice Band Metagross and Moltres. A downside, however, of the variety of Regice checks is that Explosion cannot reliably target the opposing team's special wall; Metagross and Tyranitar can switch in to absorb Explosion or even any other move at a small cost.</p> <p>Despite Regice's strengths, Snorlax finds its way into offensive teams much more frequently for several reasons. First, Snorlax's Self-Destruct is extremely threatening, for even a failed attempt at taking out a special threat can result in a check like Tyranitar or Metagross being put into KO range of a sweeper like Zapdos, never allowing them to lay another hit. Second, Snorlax has solid neutral coverage for all of its checks, including Focus Punch for Tyranitar, while Regice has to deal with its checks by employing the support of teammates or giving up its walling abilities with Explosion. Regice's Explosion too is unfortunately weak and requires chip damage for the KO or momentum to be maintained for the damage to stick. Third, Snorlax's ability Immunity prevents Toxic from wearing it down when it already has limited longevity due to sand and Spikes. Regice, however, hits Skarmory really hard, and it is more effective at preventing Spikes from accumulating to an uncomfortable level. In spite of these challenges, Regice's ability of luring in and KOing Blissey and Curse Snorlax with Explosion may well be good enough of a reason to use it instead of Snorlax as a special check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch and Superpower can spring some surprises on Tyranitar and can be used to chunk Blissey and Snorlax and eventually take them out with Explosion. Their power, however, is really dismal, as Focus Punch does not even score a guaranteed OHKO on bulkless Tyranitar. Psych Up is especially effective against Calm Mind users like Raikou, Baton Pass Celebi, and Suicune without Roar. However, using Psych Up against Roar Suicune can go terribly wrong if Regice is phazed just as it boosts, losing a vital turn and momentum. Defensive Regice variants with Rest can also be considered, though such a set is usually outclassed by Blissey and Celebi.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross in particular is the best Regice check in a vacuum, taking almost no damage from all of its moves, not suffering too much from the Speed drop of Thunder Wave, and exerting the offensive pressure necessary to force Regice out. It, however, must be wary of pivots into Dugtrio or other powerful offensive Pokemon such Fire-types, Choice Band users, and Endeavor Swampert. Forretress can threaten to set Spikes indefinitely on Regice without Fire coverage. Calm Mind Jirachi does not appreciate Thunder Wave but can optionally block it with Substitute and set up on Regice. The dislike of paralysis also applies to defensive Jirachi, but it can otherwise switch in freely and pass Wishes to teammates indefinitely.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Snorlax have the special bulk to take every special attack Regice can throw at them but must be careful not to let a well-timed Explosion take them out.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can easily force Regice out with the threat of Rock Slide or even Brick Break and Fire Blast on mixed or special variants. Unfortunately, it cannot take repeated Ice Beams. The threat of Tyranitar lies not only in the ability to directly deal damage but also the ability to set up with Dragon Dance under the status protection of Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hariyama's ability Thick Fat allows it to come in on Regice's Ice Beam without too much of a burden and hit it for super effective Fighting-type damage. While Machamp and Heracross do not switch in as easily, their ability Guts can be used to exploit Thunder Wave for extra damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: With a little chip damage, Moltres, Charizard, and Houndoom can take out Regice with their Fire-type attacks. Navigating them in, however, is not an easy task, as Thunder Wave completely strips them of the speed that earns them their place in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Indirect Damage</strong>: With a susceptibility to sand, lack of instant recovery, and lack of a method for removing status, Regice can easily be worn down with chip damage from Spikes, Toxic, and Leech Seed. For example, Toxic + Protect Skarmory or Zapdos can force Regice in and whittle it down slowly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ice Beam forces Zapdos out by threatening to OHKO it under sand. It also allows Regice to turn the tables on Celebi, which is usually used to gain momentum on special walls. Other auxiliary uses of Ice Beam are providing a weak Salamence and Flygon check, especially on offensive teams that don't have good answers to physical threats; hitting Tyranitar and Swampert hard; and forcing Claydol out. Notably, Ice Beam puts Tyranitar into the KO range of Dugtrio's Earthquake and Swampert's Hydro Pump. Deterring Swampert's repeated entry into Regice as a sacrificial check is helpful if an astute opponent deduces that Regice is supporting a specially offensive team that Swampert is ineffective against anyway.</p> <p>The Electric coverage move primarily hits Skarmory to deny too many layers of Spikes, places Suicune in range of Explosion with the possibility of a Dugtrio follow-up, and forces Starmie out. It also allows Regice to be a weak check to Gyarados on the frail, specially offensive teams it frequently ends up on. Thunderbolt is by far more consistent, and its accuracy may be vital when facing key threats like Gyarados and Starmie, but Thunder pressures Skarmory more with the certain 2HKO, assuming it hits. When using Hidden Power Fire, the paralysis rate of Thunder can also serve to compress Electric coverage and Thunder Wave into one move.</p> <p>Explosion severely damages special walls like Blissey that switch into Regice. Additionally, it limits the setup opportunities of Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Jirachi by getting a check like Swampert or Dugtrio in without taking any damage and denting them just enough for a follow-up KO. Explosion with 104 Attack EVs allows Dugtrio to follow up on most Curse Snorlax under sand with a guaranteed KO.</p> <p>Note that Explosion on teams without Dugtrio can be pretty dismal, so Hidden Power Fire can be used over Explosion to pressure offensive teams more readily, as long as one plans to exert offensive pressure on Blissey or Snorlax through some other means. Hidden Power Fire also reduces Metagross's ease of switching in and makes quick work of Magneton, which can potentially nullify Regice with Toxic + Protect. It also prevents Forretress from setting Spikes indefinitely.</p> <p>Thunder Wave reliably forces Jolteon and non-Substitute offensive variants of Jirachi out while paralyzing checks with average Speed like Tyranitar, Metagross, and defensive Jirachi. While paralyzing these bulky Pokemon may seem innocuous at first glance, the Speed drop gives one's own Metagross and Tyranitar the assurance of outspeeding the foe and maintains offensive momentum. Finally, Hidden Power Fire can also be an option over Thunder Wave for reasons above.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Regice has two roles: a lure for special walls and pivot into special threats and out of bulky Pokemon. In its role as a lure, it appreciates Dugtrio finishing off the weakened wall after Explosion. Regice, however, can still function perfectly fine without Dugtrio if the team can maintain momentum on the walls. Note that without Dugtrio, these frail offensive teams that Regice tends to end up on need a way to prevent Dragon Dance Tyranitar from running amok. Regice paves the way for either fast special sweepers like Ludicolo and Starmie or Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune, Raikou, and Jirachi. In its role as an offensive pivot, Regice can easily switch or double switch to Choice Band Metagross upon the entrance of Blissey, Snorlax, or Tyranitar. It can also pivot to Moltres or Charizard in anticipation of Metagross. Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is particularly synergistic with Regice; Celebi acts as a secondary special check against Zapdos, Starmie, and Suicune and can pass boosts to Regice to really press Blissey or Snorlax to come in. Giga Drain and Hidden Power Fire are also great for chunking Tyranitar and Metagross, and it helps that these Pokemon are frequently very willing to stay in on Celebi to hit it back with Hidden Power Bug or Meteor Mash.</p>"

The real reason to use Earthquake is in fact to let Registeel take on Substitute Jirachi; with about 100 Attack EVs, Earthquake can break defensive Jirachi's Substitute. Earthquake also takes down Raikou more effectively, 2HKOing it with the aforementioned investment and sandstorm damage. Finally, Earthquake stops Magneton as well.

  },
  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio is the most prominent trapper in ADV. Almost every team has trap targets, such as physically bulky Pokemon, Calm Mind users, special walls, Fighting-types, bulky setup tanks, and even other trappers. This lets it support a variety of offensive and defensive teamstyles. Dugtrio's high Speed also makes it a great revenge killer against many offensive Pokemon such as Endeavor Swampert and Starmie. These properties make it a common sight on specially offensive teams, Spikes teams, and teams dedicated to supporting bulky setup tanks.</p> <p>Dugtrio's biggest weakness is its frailty. If it fails to KO the trap target, it is very likely to be OHKOed in return. Dugtrio also can be exploited when Choice locked, giving sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence free setup turns. Ironically, being Choice locked also lets opposing Dugtrio countertrap Dugtrio; likewise, Porygon2 can trap it by copying Arena Trap with Trace. Both foes can punish teams for relying on Dugtrio to trap multiple Pokemon, its biggest strength: the first target can bait Dugtrio in for either countertrapper to revenge kill it, letting the second target wreak havoc.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dugtrio's last moveslot is usually disposable. As a result, a variety of different moves can be run at almost no cost. Substitute or Protect can be used in conjunction with Perish Song Gengar to provide the additional turns needed for Perish Song to take effect. Screech can be used to defeat defensive Suicune and Snorlax; one can force them to use Rest, then go to Dugtrio and use Screech. Dugtrio can take them out the next time Rest is used, or it can just be sacrificed to apply a -4 Defense drop so that a physically offensive Pokemon can follow up and break through. Rock Tomb is an alternative to Rock Slide to be used while sacrificing Dugtrio. It can help a slow Pokemon to come in next and prevents Dugtrio from being setup bait for Dragon Dance Salamence; its poor accuracy makes it unreliable, though. Toxic can be used as a catch-all against a variety of Pokemon like Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Flygon, and Swampert.</p> <p>Dugtrio can also carry other items. The most prominent alternative is Salac Berry, which, when used with Endure, allows Dugtrio to reliably trap other Dugtrio. This also lets it run considerably less Speed investment in favor of bulk to trap Blissey and remove it with Beat Up. Occasionally, Endure and Salac Berry also turn the tides against Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Jolteon, and Starmie, which the opponent may bring in with the intent of outspeeding Dugtrio, especially after noticing the bulky EVs. Soft Sand can be used on Jolly bulky Dugtrio in conjunction with Timid Zapdos, letting Dugtrio still have enough power to revenge kill Tyranitar after Zapdos sacrifices itself to Tyranitar by using Thunderbolt. When Soft Sand is used in conjunction with Toxic, Dugtrio can lure in opposing Zapdos, prevent Salamence from setting up freely, and also weaken Porygon2 trying to countertrap it. King's Rock gives Beat Up an appreciable chance to flinch, but not quite enough for it to be reliable at removing Blissey without Dugtrio taking damage. These alternative items, while offering the flexibility of move choice, pale greatly in comparison to Choice Band because Dugtrio's power is greatly reduced when trapping anything apart from Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Dugtrio is a trapper, it has no true checks. However, it can be countertrapped or exploited in the following ways.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is the universal answer to Dugtrio, as it can safely come in on any of its moves, copy Arena Trap with Trace, and take Dugtrio out with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can be countertrapped by opposing Dugtrio should it be slow or use a move other than Earthquake. This usually occurs after Dugtrio traps Celebi, Heracross, or Breloom. Opposing Celebi is able to use Baton Pass, should it survive Hidden Power Bug, to bring opposing Dugtrio in safely.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Tyranitar</strong>: If Dugtrio is chipped, Pursuit Tyranitar can trap Dugtrio locked onto any move other than Earthquake. This usually occurs when Spikes are present or when Breloom fires off a Mach Punch before Dugtrio KOes it.</p> <p><strong>Speed-boosting Setup Sweepers</strong>: After a KO, Dugtrio is very vulnerable to getting set up on. Dragon Dance Salamence and Agility Zapdos get a free boost; Salamence can proceed to sweep frail teams that rely on Dugtrio too much for checking physical threats, while Agility Zapdos can pass the boost to a slow teammate that then outspeeds Dugtrio and cannot be revenge killed by it anymore. Even Agility Metagross and Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up on Dugtrio locked into any move other than Earthquake. Ninjask, while rare, is one of the biggest threats to Dugtrio teams without a phazer, as it can pass both Speed and Attack boosts to a sweeper with merely a single setup turn.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Many Flying-types like mixed and Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Zapdos, and Moltres have the immediate firepower to be particularly threatening after Dugtrio removes a foe. Even Skarmory can exploit the free turn to lay Spikes, and Gengar, while not a Flying-type, is immune to Earthquake and can fire off a devastating Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake's primary targets are Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, Magneton, Blissey, and Starmie. Bulky Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Starmie fall after a tiny amount of chip damage, Magneton gets OHKOed, and Blissey gets 2HKOed in sand. Earthquake also hits Snorlax and Suicune hard, allowing Dugtrio to revenge kill offensive variants and sometimes take out defensive variants by coming in on a Rest turn. Hidden Power Bug takes out Celebi with some chip damage. Aerial Ace OHKOes Heracross and Breloom. Rock Slide is the generic option in the last moveslot for hitting threatening Flying-types like Zapdos, Salamence, Moltres; this especially strengthens Dugtrio as an emergency pivot into Zapdos. Sunny Day is a common move alongside tanks that are affected by sand, namely defensive Suicune and Snorlax.</p> <p>Beat Up is a niche option on specially offensive teams. It has several advantages over Earthquake in dealing with Blissey. First, many specially offensive partners like Zapdos, Celebi, Suicune, and Raikou have high base Attack, and Beat Up does damage based on the base Attack stats of all team members, so it more often than not does massive damage to Blissey, 2HKOing it comfortably even without sand. Alternatively, a specially offensive Pokemon can lure Blissey in, apply Toxic poison, and switch to Beat Up Dugtrio, which deals enough damage that Blissey won't ever be able to heal. Second, as Beat Up damage is independent of natures and EVs, Dugtrio is free to drop Attack investment in favor of bulk and Speed; the bulk helps Dugtrio survive Blissey's Ice Beam, Jirachi's Ice Punch, and Celebi's Grass-type attacks, increasing its reliability in trapping special walls; the Speed helps it revenge kill offensive Jirachi, offensive Celebi, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Third, Counter fails on Beat Up, so Blissey has no way to OHKO bulky Dugtrio back. Note that Beat Up does not necessarily have to be used with a bulky EV spread.</p> <p>Dugtrio usually wants all the Attack it can get to reduce the amount of chip damage needed to KO its targets. Maximum Speed is useful for tying other Dugtrio that might try to revenge kill Dugtrio itself; otherwise, an EV spread of 8 HP / 252 Atk / 20 SpD / 228 Spe with IVs of 30 SpD / 30 Spe lets Adamant / Jolly Dugtrio outspeed neutral / positive nature +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, respectively. The extra bulk gives Dugtrio greater odds of surviving attacks like Hidden Power Ice or Grass from specially offensive Pokemon and super effective coverage from Blissey, Celebi, and Jirachi. One should avoid placing the remaining 4 EVs into HP, though it may seem inconsequential, as Dugtrio otherwise faints from four times of switching into three layers of Spikes. This may occur if Skarmory continuously forces Dugtrio in.</p> <p>Note that the above EV spreads more often than not do not apply to Beat Up Dugtrio, which frequently runs bulky spreads to survive Blissey's Ice Beam under various conditions. The most common spread is 80 HP / 252 Atk / 172 SpD / 4 Spe for surviving Blissey's Ice Beam after one layer of Spikes. With a Jolly nature, Dugtrio still outspeeds base 100 neutral-natured Pokemon.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Dugtrio to outspeed all +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Starmie, and Salac Berry-boosted Endeavor Swampert. This is the better nature for revenge killing. An Adamant nature, however, ensures the OHKO on uninvested Tyranitar, requires less chip damage to KO many targets, and also gives Dugtrio a good chance to 3HKO defensive Suicune and defensive Snorlax after a Curse. Adamant is really helpful on defensive Suicune teams, where Dugtrio can eliminate bulky Tyranitar as fast as possible before Suicune takes too much damage to set up, and defensive Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams, where Dugtrio provides the sole offensive pressure needed against a late-game Suicune or Snorlax. Occasionally, maximizing the odds of revenge killing a full HP Tyranitar is also useful, such as when Tyranitar OHKOes Jynx after it misses Lovely Kiss and when Charizard uses Focus Punch to stop Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up but gets OHKOed by Rock Slide.</p> <p>When using balance teams where every Pokemon fulfills mostly an indispensable role and cannot easily be sacrificed, Dugtrio is best brought in on a predicted switch into the trap target after it has been chipped. On offensive teams, however, in addition to trapping special walls, Dugtrio can be used more as a revenge killer, performing one-for-one trades. Frequently, Baton Pass users like Zapdos and Celebi help ease predictions and guide Dugtrio into Blissey and Tyranitar, for example.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio's targets can generally be categorized into physically bulky Pokemon, Calm Mind users, special walls, Fighting-types, bulky setup tanks, and trappers. Dugtrio teams can be broadly categorized into specially offensive teams, Skarmory or Forretress + Dugtrio stall teams, and teams dedicated to setting up bulky tanks.</p> <p>Specially offensive teams with offensive Calm Mind users like Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune, or special sweepers like Starmie and Rain Dance users Kingdra and Ludicolo, all appreciate special walls removed. A great way of luring in special walls, particularly Blissey, is through using Zapdos, which can use Baton Pass to eliminate prediction involved in safely bringing Dugtrio in. A niche Pokemon that also does the job is lead Jynx, which frequently forces the opponent to go to Blissey right after having a Pokemon slept. As physically bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax are checks to Calm Mind users, Dugtrio removing, or at least weakening, these checks also helps them. Removing Tyranitar also allows Kingdra and Ludicolo to use Rain Dance unimpeded. Sometimes, specially offensive teams carry Gengar, which not only can use Explosion with Dugtrio as follow-up to remove special walls, but can also lure in and eliminate Pursuit Tyranitar to help these Rain Dance users keep rain up. As specially offensive teams frequently use frail Zapdos as a Fighting-type check, Dugtrio helps to revenge kill Heracross and Breloom.</p> <p>One common theme in offensive Dugtrio teams is using two Pokemon that are weak to Dugtrio: one lures in opposing Dugtrio to be counter-trapped, which enables the other. Most prominently, Celebi luring in Dugtrio allows Jirachi free rein. Heracross and Breloom act similarly; although they are not specially offensive, some offensive Dugtrio teams appreciate them pressuring Blissey and hurting Skarmory decently. Breloom also appreciates Dugtrio's trades reducing the game to a small number of Pokemon, making Spore much more devastating. Mixed and Choice Band Tyranitar are also physically offensive presences with good Dugtrio synergy. Mixed Tyranitar has the coverage to nail the Pokemon that Dugtrio cannot trap and eliminate easily—Swampert and Flying-types—and Dugtrio can trap those that it has trouble with—Metagross, Jirachi, and Celebi. Choice Band Tyranitar similarly deters Flying-types with Rock Slide and has Focus Punch to hit Water-types hard; should it mistakenly lock itself with Rock Slide or Double-Edge into Metagross or Jirachi, Dugtrio can revenge kill them. Like Zapdos, the uncommon offensive Vaporeon can lure in special walls and guide Dugtrio safely in, especially against Blissey, with Baton Pass and its 101 HP Substitutes. However, one must be keenly aware of the possible physical weaknesses that come with using both offensive Vaporeon and Dugtrio on the same team. Finally, as a general point, specially offensive teams frequently lack phazers, so they can run into serious trouble should opposing offensive Calm Mind users set up first. In this scenario, having Dugtrio as a revenge killer is very useful too.</p> <p>Skarmory and Dugtrio have amazing synergy on stall teams. Skarmory's Spikes provide the chip damage necessary for Dugtrio to remove Tyranitar, Metagross, Celebi, and Jirachi. In turn, Dugtrio traps Magneton, as well as offensive Starmie after chip damage from Spikes or Toxic to prevent it from spinning. Taking down physical wallbreakers like Tyranitar and Metagross, and letting Skarmory handle them for longer against Magneton teams, protects Water-types that are vulnerable to sand and Spikes like Suicune and Milotic from being overwhelmed or eating an Explosion. Removing Tyranitar also allows one to clear sand, possibly with Sunny Day, extending Suicune's longevity. Dugtrio also mitigates the propensity of these Water-types to be set up on or neutered with Leech Seed by Jirachi and Celebi. Defensive Gengar forms a fantastic core with Skarmory and Dugtrio, as it can spinblock and have Dugtrio severely weaken or remove Pursuit Tyranitar. Spinners are good Dugtrio partners on stall teams, as opposing Skarmory gets to set Spikes freely after a revenge kill, and stall teams frequently lack offensive pressure against Skarmory. Claydol, apart from removing Spikes to ease the pressure on Suicune, Milotic, and Blissey, works with Dugtrio to strengthen the team's defenses against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Claydol can also be sacrificed to Heracross for Dugtrio to revenge kill it, since Heracross rarely comes with Spikes. Forretress is another Spiker and spinner that synergizes with Dugtrio. Even though Forretress, unlike Skarmory, can run Earthquake to address Magneton switch-ins, Dugtrio trapping Magneton allows Forretress to use Hidden Power Bug and Explosion simultaneously. Dugtrio also makes up for Forretress's inability to threaten Fighting-types, trapping Heracross and Breloom, or phaze like Skarmory. Dugtrio prevents the opponent from exploiting Forretress's passivity by trapping Calm Mind Celebi and Jirachi, as well as safeguarding against Metagross, which can easily run through Forretress if it has Choice Band, gets a boost from Meteor Mash, or Forretress is previously chipped significantly. Although it is common to overlook the offensive properties of Claydol and Forretress on stall teams, in many cases, their Explosions guarantee a trade when Dugtrio is available for revenge killing. Trading with Tyranitar eases the pressure on Blissey and Suicune and allows sand to be cleared permanently, while trading with Metagross eliminates the potential threat of Explosion to Suicune and Milotic. Finally, there is a small but noteworthy fraction of Skarmory + Dugtrio teams that use Swampert. These are usually Toxic, Spikes and Sandstorm (TSS) teams that don't do well against defensive Suicune if Skarmory is trapped and Spikes are removed; in this case, having Dugtrio to beat Rest Suicune can be important.</p> <p>Teams dedicated to supporting setup tanks like defensive Suicune, defensive Curse Snorlax, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi form the remainder of Dugtrio-based teams. Suicune has been explained above, and the arguments pertaining to Snorlax and Jirachi are similar. Once again, Tyranitar, Metagross, Celebi, and Jirachi are prime trap targets. Tyranitar's sand hurts Snorlax's longevity, and Tyranitar walls Snorlax and Jirachi. Metagross also walls Snorlax and can hit it with Explosion, and Jirachi without Fire Punch finds it difficult to get past Metagross. Leech Seed Celebi makes it very difficult for these tanks to set up, while Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi can exploit the lack of early-game pressure from these teams to pass boosts to threatening offensive Pokemon. Opposing Calm Mind Jirachi can set up on Snorlax, and it is never good to get your Jirachi into a Calm Mind war with opposing Jirachi; even if one's Jirachi wins the tussle, there is a good chance that it will be crippled by burn or paralysis. Removing opposing trappers can also be a benefit in rather subtle ways. Opposing Magneton and Dugtrio can keep forcing Snorlax to use Rest until they score a critical hit, and Magneton can also paralyze Jirachi in a pinch, whereas Dugtrio can trap and severely weaken, if not remove, Jirachi. These setup-based teams tend to be weak to Fighting-types, so removing Heracross and Breloom is also important. Finally, if one does not use Spikes, then one needs an alternative way to chip trap targets into range. Defensive Celebi's Leech Seed and Blissey's Toxic are prominent methods of inducing chip damage on stall teams lacking Spikes. Celebi can also lure in Tyranitar and Metagross and use Baton Pass to safely switch to Dugtrio, eliminating the need for prediction.</p> <p>Occasionally, Dugtrio appears on balance teams that do not necessarily use Spikes, but use Pokemon mentioned above and follow similar logic. These include Choice Band Tyranitar, Wish Jirachi, and Claydol.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dodrio is an excellent Pokemon when it comes to physical sweeping, whether it's using a Choice Band or a Flail set. Thanks to its awesome STAB Drill Peck, Dodrio can be a true monster if its teammates can take out physical walls that stop it short. However, it's really fragile and won't be switching in on much.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baton Pass is a great option as Dodrio can pass along a Substitute or some Speed to really help a teammate set up. It can also use Baton Pass on the first turn to scout out your opponent's Dodrio counter; if it is Skarmory, bring in Magneton for an instant KO. Similarly, passing to Dugtrio can end a weakened Tyranitar or Metagross switch-in. Endeavor can be used in conjunction with Quick Attack to make short work of opposing Pokemon, but Tyranitar's Sand Stream can prove troublesome. Haze can remove an opponent's boosts, but it is fairly useless overall because Dodrio is fragile. In general, Dodrio's base 110 Attack and base 100 Speed stats mean it's best off with an offensive moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory and Forretress, two of the most common physical walls, can handle Dodrio with relative ease--watch out for Magneton, however. Tyranitar's Sand Stream wears down Dodrio, and Tyranitar himself resists both Dodrio's STAB moves. However, Choice Band Hidden Power Ground can 2HKO it, and Hidden Power Fighting will OHKO. Metagross can shrug off nearly everything Dodrio throws at it; even Choice Band Hidden Power Ground might not 2HKO him. Regirock is one of the best counters as well, because neither Hidden Power will do much damage. The latter three can easily OHKO Dodrio with their STAB moves.</p> <p>Gengar can come in on Normal attacks and either Thunderbolt Dodrio into oblivion or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Choice Band Drill Peck will OHKO him more often than not, though, and Flail sets usually pack Hidden Power Ghost. Dusclops is slower but more defensive, and has the same immunity to Normal attacks; he can burn Dodrio and heal off damage with Pain Split or Rest. Just about any hit, especially STAB or super effective ones, will cripple--if not KO--Dodrio, as its defenses are abysmal at best.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Dodrio has excellent Speed and Attack, which makes it an ideal Choice Band user. However, as it is fairly fragile, it will have difficulty switching in. It is a fairly good lead, but is at its best late-game, when it can quickly fire off powerful attacks. Dodrio is a pretty mean physical sweeper, as it gets STAB on three of its attacks. Hidden Power Ground hurts Magneton, Jirachi, and Metagross on the switch-in, but Dodrio should not stay in unless it will surely OHKO the foe. Hidden Power Fighting is stronger against Tyranitar, but is inferior as Hidden Power Ground will do just fine while maintaining a perfect Speed IV.</p> <p>Maximize Attack and Speed because Dodrio will not stay in for long anyway. A Jolly nature is useful to surprise opponents expecting to outrun Adamant variants, and the Choice Band somewhat makes up for the drop in power.</p>"},
      "Flail": {"description": "<p>As it gets STAB on Flail, Dodrio can easily sweep a team if used correctly. This variant of Dodrio is powerful, but is a bit harder to use than the standard Choice Band set. Liechi Berry boosts Dodrio's attack power, but Agility is a must in order to ensure a sweep. Alternately, Dodrio could use a Salac Berry, run at least 112 EVs, and drop Agility for another move. Quick Attack is its best choice to help against enemy Flail users.</p> <p>Similarly, use maximum Attack, and dump the rest of the EVs in HP for greater overall bulk. If using Agility, run minimum Speed, but more Speed is a possibility. Salac Berry variants should aim to hit a Speed stat of 264 after a boost; this requires 16 EVs if using a Jolly nature, and 112 with an Adamant one.</p>"}
    }

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a centralizing threat in ADV OU with amazing versatility. It boasts high Special Attack and Speed, which are both integral to its utility and offensive roles. In addition, one would be mistaken to assume that it is a glass cannon based on its poor defensive stats. It has immunities to Normal-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks and a resistance to Bug-type attacks, providing it with an abundance of opportunities to pivot in on mixed and physical variants of Salamence, Heracross, Snorlax, Swampert, Flygon, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Body Slam Jirachi. It even gets opportunities to pivot in on Toxic. Gengar also has very few weaknesses that aren't widely distributed, making its selection of checks highly specific.</p> <p>One of Gengar's greatest assets is its ability to spinblock allowing Spikes to remain on the field. Another major boon to Gengar is its unique set of utility moves, which almost no Pokemon is completely able to shrug off; in particular, Will-O-Wisp severely threatens every non-Fire-type without Natural Cure, and even those that do get their recovery shut down by Taunt, making Gengar highly effective at pressuring passive Pokemon like Blissey and Milotic too. Offensively, Gengar's selection of coverage moves allows it to be an effective sweeper with Spikes support. As a dedicated Blissey lure, Gengar can even use Mean Look + Perish Song or Explosion in conjunction with Dugtrio, allowing specially offensive pokemon to sweep.</p> <p>While Gengar has many strengths, its propensity to be trapped, lack of STAB moves, and slight frailty hold it back. Pursuit Tyranitar OHKOes any Gengar that isn't properly EV trained to survive it. The lack of STAB moves but an abundance of coverage means that Gengar is not suited for consistently firing off strong neutral hits early-game, although it gets exponentially better with Spikes. Its low defensive stats can somewhat be compensated for through EV investment, but at the expense of a crucial amount of Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dynamic Punch is a risky move that has huge upsides when Gengar is facing Pursuit Tyranitar, but its accuracy makes it highly unreliable. Thief can be used to slowly chip at special walls, but the constant pressure of Will-O-Wisp + Taunt or the immediacy of Explosion makes it hard to justify its use. Focus Punch can be a choice on the all-out attacker set to take down an unsuspecting Blissey or Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are very few definite checks and counters to Gengar, and the most prevalent Gengar checks are defensive Pokemon. However, offensive teams can try their best to trade humongous amounts of damage in return for taking Will-O-Wisp from Gengar, use Lum Berry on the Pokemon that are weakest to burn like Metagross and Tyranitar, and try not to let Gengar in at all.</p> <p><strong>Natural Cure</strong>: Blissey and Celebi both pivot into Will-O-Wisp with the intention of encouraging Gengar to switch out by chipping it with Ice Beam or threatening it with a potential Psychic, respectively, and healing the status away with Natural Cure. Of the lot, Blissey is the most robust; its Normal typing does not allow Gengar to take any advantage of it with its elemental coverage. Celebi is more susceptible to Gengar's coverage, but it is usually able to survive Will-O-Wisp and two Ice Punches if it's using the defensive set to 2HKO back with Psychic. Making the right reads, however, is crucial to prevent too many exploits by physical threats that follow up from Gengar. Starmie gets 2HKOed by Thunderbolt and only OHKOes Gengar after some chip damage, but it can still act as a one-time pivot. Refresh users are less reliable against Taunt Gengar but also act similarly if push comes to shove. Swampert can deal with Gengar lacking Grass-type coverage moves, and Milotic can try to wrestle against Gengar lacking Electric-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar is the bane of Gengar's existence, forcing the Gengar user to make the decision between staying in to wrestle Tyranitar or switching out and taking a huge chunk of damage or possibly getting KOed. Pursuit Tyranitar is best at taking out defensive Gengar. It is not a reliable trapper, however, as it does not OHKO defensive Gengar, and Dugtrio might be waiting behind. Gengar may also end up on the winning end by inflicting a burn and hitting Tyranitar with a Grass-type coverage move, if Tyranitar chooses to use Pursuit while Gengar stays in. Offensive Gengar might also be able to beat Tyranitar by using Hidden Power Grass or Hypnosis on the switch and outplaying Tyranitar. Pursuit Umbreon has a little more longevity with Wish and can burn Gengar back with Synchronize, but it is rarely used because its passivity allows Metagross and Skarmory to come in freely. Pursuit Houndoom is able to OHKO Gengar with good odds, but it is rather frail, susceptible to the Dugtrio trap, and offers almost no defensive utility otherwise. Metagross can scare the opponent with Psychic and catch Gengar with Pursuit on the switch while retaining the wallbreaking properties of mixed Metagross, but it needs a one-time Will-O-Wisp pivot on the team, as it too is not anywhere close to OHKOing Gengar with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types can threaten Gengar with Thunder Wave or a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Jolteon is by far the most reliable Gengar check among the Electric-types, as it does not suffer a weakness against any of Gengar's coverage moves, and, since it's a fast specially offensive Pokemon that relies more on its Speed rather than its bulk to win games, it does not fear Will-O-Wisp too much. However, it will still be worn down by the burn over time. Magneton can deal with Gengar lacking Fire Punch and notably resists Explosion. Zapdos can reliably deal with Gengar lacking Ice Punch, but short of that, it will require pivoting in on a move other than Ice Punch and will have to rely on its Speed or good reads to neuter Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Unrevealed Moltres and Charizard serve as offensive checks to Gengar by pivoting into Will-O-Wisp. Moltres can then threaten to OHKO Gengar with Overheat. Charizard either outspeeds Gengar and hits it hard with Fire Blast or survives Thunderbolt to OHKO it with a Blaze-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Guts</strong>: Guts users like Heracross—especially the Hidden Power Ghost variant—and Machamp can act as one-time pivots into Gengar's Will-O-Wisp or simply come out in the game before Gengar in an attempt to trade it down.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Special Checks</strong>: Snorlax and Regice can take a few hits from offensive Gengar's coverage moves. Snorlax, however, does not appreciate getting burned. Regice's Special Attack stat is unaffected by the burn, but sending Regice in to take the burn is still not ideal, as Explosion is going to do a miserable amount of damage as a result.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Gengar is most commonly used on teams that use indirect damage from sand and Spikes, and they are canonically referred to as Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams. This set maintains pressure on both defensive and offensive Pokemon with a well-balanced combination of utility and coverage moves. Will-O-Wisp stings everything bar Fire-types and Natural Cure Pokemon. On the anti-offense side, it completely invalidates physical threats like Metagross, Tyranitar, and Snorlax. On the stallbreaking side, it turns the long game from an asset into a liability by ensuring that defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Swampert, and Jirachi lose HP the more turns they stay in. Even Natural Cure Pokemon like Blissey and Celebi don't exactly gain momentum on Gengar, as the added Spikes damage frequently forces them to make an attempt at recovering.</p> <p>Taunt makes this possible, providing additional pressure by preventing Blissey and, if you're daring, Celebi from healing up, keeping them at low HP throughout the game. Taunt also maintains pressure on passive Pokemon by denying Swampert, Milotic, and Claydol from using Refresh and Suicune and Snorlax from using Rest. Taunt also allows Gengar's teammates to come in without fear of status effects. Defensively, Taunt is also an emergency measure that prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Calm Mind Jirachi from setting up and sweeping. Explosion is a slightly riskier and more targeted option than Taunt. Instead of playing the patient game with Taunt, Explosion seeks to blow through Blissey when the time is right for a sweeper at the back like Starmie, Zapdos, offensive Suicune, or offensive Jirachi. Explosion also helps to hammer through Zapdos + Celebi specially defensive cores, take out Claydol after an Ice Punch, thereby retaining Spikes for the rest of the game, and ending the turn to prevent the foe from setting up just like Taunt and enabling a Dugtrio trap. Although a rare choice, Destiny Bond can be used to lure in and remove Claydol more reliably, and also to remove key offensive threats.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Ice Punch provide neutral coverage for most of the metagame. In particular, Thunderbolt helps Gengar deal with the likes of Starmie trying to muscle through it to get a Rapid Spin off, allows it to beat Moltres and defensive Suicune one-on-one, and lets it check Gyarados. Ice Punch deals with Spikes-immune threats, namely Zapdos, Salamence, and Flygon, while providing extra pressure against Celebi. Note that with Ice Punch, Gengar is one of the rare mixed Salamence pivots and can even offensively check Dragon Dance Salamence with the right EVs. Occasionally, Explosion can be used over Thunderbolt or Ice Punch as a sacrificial stop against spinners and special walls.</p> <p>Fire Punch and Giga Drain are alternatives coverage moves. They are, however, less commonly seen, as Gengar would then be completely walled by Moltres and Charizard, it couldn't serve as a reliable check against Salamence, and it would be forced out by Zapdos. Notably, though, Giga Drain provides Gengar with an opportunity to wrestle Pursuit Tyranitar one-on-one, especially with the aid of Will-O-Wisp and Spikes, and it improves the matchup against Claydol by healing off the damage from Psychic, turning it into a 3HKO instead. While the inability to hit Zapdos and Moltres hard may be seen as a weakness, this coverage combination may instead be used as a way to lure in and remove them through Explosion.</p> <p>The listed EV spread allows Gengar to switch out in the face of Tyranitar's Pursuit without getting KOed in sand and to survive Salamence's and Gyarados's boosted Hidden Power Flying in sand, all while outspeeding Timid Moltres. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 60 SpD / 200 Spe allows Gengar to survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, which equates to about a half chance of surviving it in sand, and boosted Hidden Power Flying from Salamence half the time in addition to outspeeding Timid Zapdos, Jolly Salamence, maximum Speed Tyranitar with a neutral nature after a Dragon Dance, and even some Adamant Dugtrio that forgo Speed investment. Don't underestimate the value of a Gengar kept around only to get KOed by sand as it comes in; it provides an extra turn to spinblock and can be used sacrificially to bring a threatening sweeper like Aerodactyl in. A spread of 168 HP / 164 SpD / 176 Spe guarantees surviving Tyranitar's Pursuit in sand while offering virtually no protection against Salamence, yet maintaining the Speed advantage over Timid Zapdos and Jolly Salamence. This spread also allows it to survive Aerodactyl's Rock Slide under sand. Preserving Gengar under sand even after taking Pursuit can be extremely helpful when one has Dugtrio to trap Tyranitar, and especially if one faces Forretress.</p> <p>Against stall teams, defensive Gengar should be used to play a patient game of constant pressure by keeping the opponent's special walls in a perpetual recover loop through Spikes, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. This creates multiple opportunities for a physical threat like Tyranitar to exert pressure and eventually force either the physical or special walls to crumble, allowing one's sweeper to take over. Against offensive teams, defensive Gengar can pivot in by exploiting its plethora of immunities and resistances to fire off Will-O-Wisp and punish their lack of status removal options, and keeping Gengar healthy might be all that is needed to stave off a late-game threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Gengar mostly belongs on TSS teams. A Spiker is almost mandatory to exploit Gengar's ability to spinblock and force switches. The Spiker of choice is Skarmory most of the time, but on more offensive teams it can be Cloyster. To help the Spikes damage stick, Tyranitar is also frequently used as a partner. In particular, bulky physical Tyranitar is the best set at exploiting Spikes, as it easily comes in on Blissey and forces it to switch after Gengar has prevented Blissey from recovering. Other mid-game attackers that appreciate Spikes and that benefit from Gengar's spinblocking support are Moltres and perhaps even Zapdos. Finally, Gengar enables generic late-game sweepers like Starmie and Aerodactyl to sweep.</p> <p>This Gengar set generally intends to play the long game and does not immediately threaten special threats like Jolteon, Zapdos, and Moltres, so robust special walls that also act as status absorbers like Blissey and Celebi are good partners. Defensive Jirachi can also act as a special wall that keeps Gengar healthy with Wish. Occasionally, Gengar is used with Jolteon for its ability to keep Blissey pressured in the absence of a more oppressive check like Metagross, and it makes the best use of its defensive abilities against Salamence on a team where a defensive backbone is lacking. Swampert is a staple in TSS style teams due to its immunity to sand, but Explosion Gengar can easily enable a Suicune sweep instead, where defensive Jirachi is the Rock resistance.</p> <p>Sometimes, this Gengar is paired with Dugtrio, where Gengar brings the special walls and status absorbers to such a low HP that Dugtrio can essentially remove them or it simply dents them with Explosion for Dugtrio to finish them. There are two ways to proceed from here; with a standard Tyranitar lineup, the remaining team can be outstalled by TSS due to the elimination of the status absorber. Alternatively, this Gengar can also be used on a team that drops Tyranitar in favor of a special threat, which has now been allowed free rein by the elimination of the special wall. Dugtrio can also potentially remove Pursuit Tyranitar or at least weaken it to a point where it is no longer a threat to Gengar.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Gengar is intended to be a mid- or late-game sweeper. With its vast coverage options, it can easily take out teams that have been weakened by Spikes with its super effective hits. The first move is the coverage for Skarmory. Thunderbolt is generally Gengar's strongest move, hitting most grounded targets neutrally, and it gives Gengar a way to hit Suicune, Starmie, Moltres, Charizard, and Gyarados really hard. The ability to threaten offensive Starmie with an almost assured OHKO under sand is notable, because it allows Gengar to switch in on an anticipated Rapid Spin and force Starmie out. Fire Punch is an alternative option that helps to take out metagame staples such as Metagross and Jirachi while also hitting Magneton and Heracross, which may wall Gengar in spite of their frailty. However, using Fire Punch comes at the cost of being walled by Fire-types and Gyarados.</p> <p>As Spikes only affects grounded Pokemon, Gengar needs Ice Punch to exert pressure on all non-grounded threats. Ice Punch OHKOes Salamence, allowing Gengar to pivot into the mixed variant safely and prevent the Dragon Dance variant from sweeping. Ice Punch 2HKOes Zapdos but usually simply threatens to OHKO it after taking a hit from Swampert, Suicune, Zapdos, or Metagross mid-game. Celebi can also be brought into 2HKO range should it take any residual damage. Offensive Gengar is therefore great at tearing up Zapdos + Celebi specially defensive cores. Ice Punch is also very important for putting pressure on Claydol, as it scores a clean 3HKO on 252 HP / 0 SpD Claydol; while Claydol is unable to 2HKO Gengar, catching it with Ice Punch on the switch guarantees that Claydol will not get the opportunity to force Gengar out and use Rapid Spin. Finally, Ice Punch also allows Gengar to OHKO Dugtrio and Flygon.</p> <p>A Grass-type move, most commonly Hidden Power Grass, is necessary to stop two of the tier's most common Pokemon, Swampert and Tyranitar, from completely walling Gengar. It comes very close to OHKOing Swampert and 2HKOing Tyranitar, and this again is where Spikes really helps. Pursuit Tyranitar is heavily pressured once it is put in 2HKO range because it loses if it tries to use Pursuit while Gengar boldly stays in to attack. Giga Drain can sometimes be used in place of Hidden Power Grass for healing Gengar.</p> <p>The last slot is usually dedicated to a move that helps Gengar maintain momentum. Explosion takes out Pokemon that Gengar is just short of KOing with a coverage move, notably Claydol, Zapdos, Celebi, and Starmie, and it does a chunk to Blissey and Snorlax. It also chips and ends the turn on Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Calm Mind Jirachi, denying their opportunity of setting up with the prospect of a follow-up KO. Hypnosis invalidates Gengar's checks, and many teams have only one of them. It can turn the tables on Claydol and Pursuit Tyranitar, whose teams are already weak to Spikes and Gengar. Landing Hypnosis can be a complete disaster for the opponent, but missing it can also be tragic, as offensive Gengar is very frail. Hypnosis is thus best used on an expected switch.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to minimize the amount of chip damage needed before Gengar starts wreaking havoc. Maximum Speed investment is never a bad idea on offensive Pokemon to force Speed ties, but technically, only 216 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed the next fastest Pokemon, Adamant Dugtrio. If that is chosen, investing the remaining EVs in HP gives Gengar better odds to survive defensive Swampert's Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump, defensive Starmie's Psychic, and Heracross's attacks in general, but one could also just put them into Attack for the extra sting on Explosion.</p> <p>Bring Gengar in on free turns after Spikes has been laid and when it can force a switch, especially when the opponent's team has been chipped across the board. The best situation either forces the opponent to sacrifice the Pokemon on the field or induces chip from Spikes and the first hit on the incoming Pokemon, putting the pivot into range of another coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes is pretty much mandatory with this set, as Gengar's lack of a STAB attack forbids it from hitting hard early-game, yet its versatile coverage becomes immensely more threatening when the opponent's team is uniformly chipped and unable to safely pivot around. Therefore, Cloyster and Skarmory are prime candidates as partners. Cloyster in particular deserves a mention because its offensive pace is better suited for offensive Gengar, and its Explosion or Surf can put a severe dent into Metagross or Tyranitar, bringing them further into Gengar's KO range. Naturally, fast phazers like Jolteon and Zapdos go well on offensive Spikes teams for racking up Spikes damage early-game on grounded bulky Pokemon. As offensive Gengar has no immediate answers to Blissey, Metagross could be an important pivot, especially if one is not using bulky physical Tyranitar. To set up for the sweep, Gengar appreciates other offensive partners that chip Zapdos mid-game such as offensive Swampert and Suicune. Finally, Gengar can also pave the way for an offensive Starmie, Jirachi, or Suicune to sweep, all of which take delight in bringing down the Pokemon that Gengar has already chipped or, in the case of Blissey and Snorlax, damaged with Explosion. Aerodactyl is also a great physically offensive partner, as desperate opponents are frequently very willing to trade away their bulky pivots to Aerodactyl, like Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Suicune, to remove Gengar.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is used mostly as a lead or early-game Pokemon on non-Spikes specially offensive teams to harass the opponent as much as possible with status moves before attempting to sacrifice itself to take out a special wall. If the set looks like a mess, it's because this Gengar's moves are truly versatile and, to some extent, team dependent. This Gengar works best in a position where it keeps its opponent guessing its moveset and eventually springs some surprises.</p> <p>Hypnosis fits nicely on the specially offensive teams. Due to their fast pace, it is highly likely that a Pokemon put to sleep never wakes up throughout the game, and even if a Natural Cure Pokemon is put to sleep, the opponent is still highly pressured to switch out to avoid Explosion. Regardless of the opponent's choice, sleep also provides an opportunity for a partner like Choice Band Metagross to get a free switch in. Will-O-Wisp threatens to burn Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi, allowing Gengar to more easily lure out the special walls. Note that nothing is stopping the use of Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp together; it is well and valid. Mean Look is a good option for teams that are highly reliant on Gengar to nail the Blissey trap, eliminating the risk of using Explosion on an irrelevant target.</p> <p>The second move is generally the move Gengar uses to force a trade.  Explosion is the most common choice; unlike Destiny Bond, it eliminates any uncertainty of getting into a follow-up Dugtrio's KO range and doesn't risk critical hits or secondary effects. Destiny Bond, however, allows Gengar to take out a range of offensive threats and act as a secondary measure to completely remove the special wall if Dugtrio has been taken out. It also removes Pursuit Tyranitar, giving rain users free rein. Again, nothing is stopping one from using both Explosion and Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Taunt has a variety of applications. It stops Skarmory from laying Spikes, and Skarmory is frequently willing to do so on the assumption that this Gengar in a lead position indicates a specially offensive team, against which Skarmory is not necessarily helpful and would gladly absorb Hypnosis. Furthermore, It prevents Refresh users from healing away the burn and keeps the momentum on one's side by preventing Blissey from firing off Thunder Wave. Having this momentum also allows Gengar to play more safely and time Explosion at a moment when the opponent is more highly pressured. Finally, Taunt also prevents the opponent from setting up and stops Suicune and Snorlax from using Rest.</p> <p>Ice Punch and Thunderbolt are coverage moves that hit most of the metagame neutrally. However, they are not mandatory, as this Gengar tends not to be used to sweep but create problems with its utility moves and force early-game exchanges. In fact, since the opponent is also usually going to assume that an unrevealed Gengar moveset is going to contain attacking moves, having a third utility move can sometimes be a nasty surprise. Focus Punch can catch Blissey and Pursuit Tyranitar off guard. It also encourages Blissey to stay in and recover, making the use of Mean Look and Explosion more reliable, and puts Tyranitar in range of Gengar's coverage move.</p> <p>There are multiple appropriate EV spreads for Gengar. The given spread allows it to put Bold Blissey into range of Dugtrio's Earthquake with Explosion while letting it survive Tyranitar's Pursuit in sand and outspeeding all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Zapdos and Salamence with Speed investment. Alternatively, one could go for an even more offensive spread of 96 Atk / 160 SpA / 252 Spe not just to do generally more damage but also to put most Snorlax into range of Dugtrio's Earthquake. Focus Punch sets might prefer the even more physically aggressive spread of 184 Atk / 124 SpA / 200 Spe to ensure that maximum HP Tyranitar gets KOed with the follow-up coverage move. One could go for the more physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 52 Atk / 112 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature for an almost similar benchmark on Blissey, except this set is only fast enough to outspeed Timid Moltres. If one is willing to accept the small probability of a maximum HP Blissey surviving both Dugtrio and Gengar or is using Destiny Bond instead of Explosion, then using a Timid nature with any of the EV spreads in the defensive set is also fine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio is the most common partner to this Gengar. It follows up after Gengar's Explosion to KO special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, Celebi, and Jirachi while also removing Pursuit Tyranitar for Gengar, or together with Gengar, for the sake of setting up rain. This combination opens the door for a whole host of special threats, including offensive Calm Mind users like Suicune, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou and rain users like Kingdra and Ludicolo. Apart from providing special support, Gengar's Hypnosis also allows hard-hitting physical threats like Heracross and Choice Band Metagross to come in for free.</p>"
      },
      "Perish Trap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set intends to trap special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi through the surprise use of Mean Look + Perish Song. The generic idea is to trap the wall with Mean Look, use Perish Song, wait it out or switch to Dugtrio to continue the trap, and then switch out for the KO. If Gengar is kept around, one can even use Perish Song a second time as Gengar is KOed and use Substitute Dugtrio for a second follow-up KO.</p> <p>Taunt prevents the opponent from phazing or using status moves and should be used with Destiny Bond to force the opponent into using an attacking move. Substitute tends to be used with Protect to retain as much HP as possible while the Perish Song counter is running. Destiny Bond is supposed to be used as a last resort when Gengar has taken out something and lacks the HP for another trap.  Hypnosis is a high-risk high-reward option that has general utility; it can also turn the tides against a check if it hits, but it can lead to Gengar being KOed if it misses.</p> <p>The EVs are tailored to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon like Timid Zapdos and Jolly Choice Band Salamence with maximum Speed investment in order to nail them with Taunt and Destiny Bond, while maximum HP investment helps to survive attacks like defensive Celebi's Psychic and minimize damage from Blissey's Ice Beam, Snorlax's Shadow Ball, and Heracross's Rock Slide. Gengar's EVs are versatile here. One could go for a spread that guarantees surviving Pursuit from Tyranitar under sand so that Destiny Bond is not ruined by sand at the expense of physical bulk that is helpful in taking Snorlax's Shadow Ball or Speed. A spread that satisfies the former condition is 168 HP / 164 SpD / 176 Spe, while one that provides for the latter is 248 HP / 44 Def / 112 SpD / 104 Spe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Substitute Dugtrio is an important partner to this Gengar, as Substitute allows Dugtrio to take over from Gengar in extending trap turns for Perish Song to take effect. Note that Dugtrio can still carry Choice Band and replace Rock Slide with Substitute, since everything Dugtrio traps is hit hard by its other moves. Offensive Calm Mind users like Suicune, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou as well as rain users like Kingdra and Ludicolo all benefit from the removal of special walls.</p>"

Giga Drain is good for Swampert and Tyranitar, though watch out for Crunch and Ice Beam. Adamant might seem like a weird choice of nature, but it can power up Explosion. With regard to EVs, Exeggutor should invest less in Speed and more in its defenses as it will be taking hits.</p>"}

    "sets": {"Haze": {"description": "<p>Thanks to its massive base 140 Special Defense, Mantine can shrug off any special attack not named Thunderbolt. In fact, it can even somewhat take one of those; 307 Special Attack is needed to guarantee the OHKO on this Mantine with STAB Thunderbolt, and 466 is needed without STAB. Switch it in on anything you are sure won't use Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Electric, then fire off an attack or Toxic; Surf and Ice Beam is its entire usable special movepool. Haze is mainly for Suicune, as Mantine obviously cannot switch into the likes of Salamence and Tyranitar to remove their Dragon Dance boosts.</p>"}, "RestTalk": {"description": "<p>This set is decent; it prolongs Mantine's lifespan at the cost of a bit of utility. Mantine's movepool is so poor that it doesn't much mind the loss of two moveslots. Its ability to wall most users of sleep moves gives it an advantage as a sleep absorber.</p>"}}

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Being one of the best special sweepers in the game, Raikou is a Pokemon that forces people to use standards. It is fast, has great STAB attacks, and can set up on many Pokemon in OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect works well alongside Pressure to quickly stall out Blissey's PP. Thunder Wave is viable because paralysis is always nice, but it isn't the best choice for Raikou. With Psych Up, Raikou can copy Calm Mind boosts from Suicune. Crunch can be used over Hidden Power Ice or Grass for better all-around neutral coverage and to hit Celebi a little harder, but this usually just renders Raikou unable to KO both Swampert and Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has difficulties switching in, but it can trap and OHKO Raikou. Furthermore, with 44 Special Defense EVs or 48 with Hidden Power Bug, Dugtrio can survive a super effective Hidden Power from Timid Raikou, then switch into Thunderbolt and not be KOed the next turn when running Adamant, while Jolly Dugtrio can safely switch into any of Timid Raikou's attacks and proceed to OHKO it with Earthquake. Of course, if there are Spikes on Dugtrio's side of the field, it will have a bit more trouble.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Snorlax can take repeated hits from Raikou and KO it with ease. With Psych Up or Seismic Toss, Regice beats non-Rest Raikou one-on-one by virtue of its high Special Defense. If Regice lacks those two moves, however, Raikou can set up with Calm Mind to the point where its Substitute is unbreakable. Celebi with Perish Song can easily force out Raikou and can set up Calm Mind alongside it while taking very little from its common attacks. Flygon and Venusaur with physical moves, such as Sludge Bomb, can beat Hidden Power Grass Raikou variants.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Electric-immune Foes</strong>: Swampert is OHKOed by +1 Hidden Power Grass and 2HKOed otherwise, but it can switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO Raikou with Earthquake, and it easily beats the less common Hidden Power Ice variants. Steelix and Camerupt are immune to Thunderbolt, take neutral damage from both Hidden Power Ice and Grass, and can hit Raikou back with STAB Earthquake. Claydol has a high Special Defense stat, +1 Timid Raikou 2HKOes it. With Roar or Thunder Wave, Jolteon matches up well against Raikou.</p>",

      "Calm Mind Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most common Raikou set and by far the most immediately dangerous one. After a Calm Mind boost, Raikou can severely dent almost anything switching in. Substitute is the usual option, allowing Raikou to set up in the face of special attackers that can't break its Substitute. It also blocks status and provides a buffer against critical hits. Roar is a decent option as well though, allowing Raikou to beat any Calm Mind user, scout, and rack up Spikes damage on its most common counters: Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi. Hidden Power Grass gives Raikou an edge against Swampert, while Hidden Power Ice deals with the less common Flygon and hits Celebi for good damage.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment gives Raikou the jump on Adamant Aerodactyl and lets Raikou, at worst, Speed tie opposing Raikou and Starmie. When using Roar, being able to phaze opposing Raikou first can be devastating.</p> <p>A Modest nature is a viable alternative to Timid, as it still outspeeds maximum Speed base 100 Pokemon and only loses out to Adamant Dugtrio, Adamant Aerodactyl, Gengar, and +1 Tyranitar. A major selling point is that Modest Raikou has a 56% chance to OHKO standard Dugtrio, something Timid sets fail to ever accomplish. Reflect is an option in the last slot, boosting up Raikou's defenses in order to take on Pokemon like Snorlax and Dugtrio more efficiently. The loss of Substitute or Roar is too significant to make this a recommended option, though.</p>"

This Raikou acts as a superb special wall and attacker, but it is not able to force itself through Ground-types without assistance.</p> <p>This set should run 136 Speed EVs for neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. 252 HP EVs grant maximum bulk; the remaining EVs are put in Special Attack for a bit more punch.</p>"

Additionally, he's nothing special; Suicune and Jirachi are better Substitute + Calm Mind users, and Blaziken and Houndoom are better Fire-types in standard play. Nonetheless, Entei is less fragile than the latter two and can get past Blissey in an unorthodox and sometimes unexpected way.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a decent move on Fire-types, as Water-types generally hate being poisoned, as do Salamence, Tyranitar, and Gyarados. Reflect supports your team against Snorlax and other physical threats. Roar is iffy on a Pokemon with few good resistances and such low Special Defense; nevertheless, it might be able to mess up Celebi that carry a Grass move instead of Psychic. Psych Up lets Entei steal Calm Mind boosts from others, but the most common Calm Mind user, Suicune, isn't going to care much. It will be priceless if used on a Regice that stole Calm Mind boosts from another of your Pokemon though, and it always works on Celebi.</p> <p>Entei learns several physical filler moves, such as Body Slam, and has a decent Attack stat as well. However, he should generally stick to special attacking because of his special STAB and access to Calm Mind. You could try a novelty Leer + Hidden Power Fighting set to take down Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Blissey, but don't expect too much of it--even Arcanine will do it better with Howl.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>First of all, Water-types: Suicune and Milotic don't take much damage from Fire-attacks and can hit back with a STAB super effective Surf, while Swampert can do the same with Earthquake. However, Swampert has to beware of Hidden Power Grass, which OHKOes him after a Calm Mind. Other, lesser used Waters will do fine, but these three are the most common.</p> <p>In addition, Entei has a lot of trouble with Dragon Dance users. Tyranitar, Salamence, and Gyarados all resist Fire and can hit him hard with Earthquake--or, in Tyranitar's case, Rock Slide. None of these Pokemon are very fond of Toxic though. Finally, Blissey and Snorlax are decent counters. Blissey can wall the Sunnybeam set and sometimes even the SubCM one, while Snorlax has Thick Fat and can hurt Entei with STAB Normal moves or Earthquake.</p>",

Entei's Special Attack stat is rather low though, so Milotic and Suicune might still be able to stall him out. Calm Mind can help with that, but Hidden Power Ice messes up Salamence and Flygon very nicely. Beware of Tyranitar switching into a Solar Beam, however, as Entei will be forced to stay in and be crushed by Tyranitar's Rock Slide. This moveset is probably better done by Houndoom, who is slightly slower, but has more Special Attack.</p> <p>401 HP lets Entei survive five Seismic Tosses or Night Shades with Leftovers intact; the magic Speed numbers to consider are as listed on the previous set.</p>"}
    }
  },
  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune's viability in ADV OU comes from its status as a bulky Water-type with Calm Mind, allowing it to check some of the tier's most dangerous physical threats while providing an offensive presence that other bulky Water-types lack. Defensively, Suicune's defenses outstrip Milotic's and Swampert's, giving it the heft to shrug off physical heavy hits and surprise special attacks from the tier's primary threats, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Metagross. Rest further bolsters its defensive prowess and boosting potential by giving it total recovery, making it much harder to stop. Combine that with Pressure, and Suicune's ability to PP stall special walls makes it a ticking time bomb. Offensively, Suicune's Calm Mind and natural bulk allow it to both dish out tons of damage and act as an emergency check to physical threats. Its offensive prowess is bolstered by its ability to run a variety of moves to work past potential counters, such as Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, Substitute, Roar, and Toxic. Suicune's versatility lies not only in its moves but also in its EVs, where modifications change the way Suicune is played altogether; RestTalk Suicune with offensive EVs becomes a potent early-game wallbreaker unlike defensive Rest Suicune's typical use as a late-game sweeper, while offensive Substitute sets with maximum HP are able to completely turn the tides against Blissey.</p> <p>Suicune's most pressing flaw is its grounded status and pure Water typing, which render it vulnerable to Spikes and sand damage. Suicune's lack of recovery outside of Rest is also an issue—Suicune lacking Rest will be even more vulnerable to being worn down and will struggle to push through special walls like Blissey, but with Rest comes the danger that Suicune will be used as setup fodder by Spikes users and other sweepers while asleep. Suicune struggles to set up and sweep against teams containing an Electric-type or Celebi, the former of which threaten it with powerful STAB moves, while the latter resists its primary attack in Surf and can beat it with Leech Seed, Calm Mind, or the rare Perish Song to deny it safe setup and guarantee its KO if it's the last Pokemon standing. Suicune is also vulnerable to attackers wielding Self-Destruct or Explosion such as Metagross, Snorlax, Cloyster, and Gengar, which can KO it outright or weaken it to the point of uselessness. Suicune's lack of a resistance to Rock like Swampert or a recovery move without drawbacks like Milotic renders it vulnerable to being taken down by flinches in late-game scenarios against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Choice Band Aerodactyl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect is an option that bolsters Suicune's already absurd physical bulk while providing team support; for example, it prevents Celebi from getting trapped by Dugtrio as easily. It is a viable option on Rest Suicune for weakening Explosion, especially while sleeping, and helps Suicune take down Snorlax. It also can be used on Substitute Suicune, where it helps to prevent Snorlax from breaking Substitute. Of course, dropping Roar or Ice Beam coverage requires the rest of the team to deal with opposing Suicune, Celebi, and Salamence.</p> <p>Mirror Coat can be used as a lure to Electric-types, as Suicune's natural bulk allows it to take Zapdos's Thunderbolt and return the damage. The most convincing way to execute this tactic is using Calm Mind as Zapdos switches in. However, this can backfire if Zapdos uses a status-inducing move expecting a switch or to compensate for it running lower Speed than Suicune.</p> <p>Substitute + Rest has several uses. First, as Blissey must use Seismic Toss twice to break Suicune's Substitute, Suicune is at full HP on the first turn of sleep, providing increased longevity. Second, Substitute is a safe play that guards against phazers that attempt to come in on the predicted Rest turn to restrict Suicune to burning only one turn of sleep. Third, Substitute guards Suicune against critical hits and getting trapped by Dugtrio, and Explosion while sleeping. Fourth, Substitute helps Rest Suicune PP stall Blissey. However, Substitute ultimately comes at the expense of Roar, which many Suicune teams need to avoid being set up on.</p> <p>Rain Dance can be used even on non-Substitute sets, increasing Suicune's longevity and power while supporting teammates. Protect can be used for Leftovers recovery outside of sand and to play around Explosion from threats like Metagross, Snorlax, and Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune's versatility makes it difficult to pinpoint blanket checks and counters. How one plays against Suicune is highly dependent on its set and the game scenario.</p> <p>Defensive Suicune is usually only dangerous when it gets several boosts and survives using Rest with a turn to spare. Offensive teams can frequently defeat Suicune by attacking, especially with sand and Spikes, such that Suicune does not have time to boost nor escape from using Rest constantly. Even sacrificing a Pokemon like Dragon Dance Tyranitar to bring Suicune down to low HP can frequently be enough to render Suicune useless. Defensive teams can wall Suicune, force it to use Rest, and phaze it out while attempting to set Spikes to wear Suicune down. In the late-game, a Taunt Gengar or Explosion user with a strong follow-up Pokemon like Dugtrio or a sweeper can deliver the final blow.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune is a lot more straightforward to wall because it mostly lacks recovery and acts like any other special sweeper. As Suicune is relatively slow, general offensive pressure can take it down even if one lacks solid checks. Substitute Suicune can be trickier for defensive teams because it masquerades as offensive Suicune, but Substitute turns its checks into setup fodder. One should look out for signs like weather changers or Ice-type coverage on a teammate, and preserve Tyranitar or other generic Suicune counters like Zapdos where possible.</p> <p>RestTalk Suicune may be mistaken for generic offensive Suicune or defensive Suicune. While general offensive pressure is just as effective in dealing with RestTalk Suicune, defensive teams with Blissey have to be careful not to simply get steamrolled. Again, one should look out for telltale signs, such as a powerful Surf, the presence of Tyranitar suggesting a Suicune set that doesn't mind sand much, lacking maximum HP, or aggressively setting up early-game. The priorities should then shift towards immediate phazing, setting Spikes, and putting oneself in offensive positions that avoid Suicune getting a free setup turn.</p> <p>The following is a summary of strategic methods of dealing with Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Indirect Damage</strong>: Suicune is adversely affected by sand and Spikes; to prevent Suicune from recovering from the passive damage endlessly via Rest, offensive pressure, Explosion, or Taunt forces Suicune to give up using Rest or never wake up healthy again. Teams without sand and Spikes are more pressed to use dedicated Suicune counters like Snorlax and Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion users such as Gengar, Metagross, Cloyster, Forretress, and Claydol can take a chunk out of Suicune to limit its setup and break its Rest loops. This is even more potent if the Explosion user is faster, as Explosion ends the turn before Suicune can act. Explosion also mitigates offensive Suicune's onslaught.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Phazers can delay defensive Suicune while it's sleeping, but will not make progress alone. Using phazers with Spikes provides the chip damage needed to force Rest uses and withers away the rest of the team such that when Suicune is the last Pokemon standing, it can be dealt with using offensive pressure, Taunt, or Explosion. The best phazers are those that cannot be trapped, as defensive Suicune often comes with Dugtrio or Magneton; hence, while Tyranitar and Skarmory can do the job, they aren't as reliable as Zapdos, Swampert, and Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops defensive Suicune from setting up and using Rest. The most prominent Taunt user is Gengar, which also has the luxury of threatening Suicune with Will-O-Wisp, Thunderbolt, and sometimes Explosion. It cannot easily switch into Suicune, however, and is better used to beat it in the late-game. Another Taunt user is Gyarados, which is able to set up on Suicune. Gyarados is highly favored to beat defensive Suicune and can heavily chip offensive Suicune, though it has some trouble getting past the latter due to Ice Beam.</p> <p>The following are Pokemon that can deal with Suicune directly.</p> <p><strong>Celebi</strong>: Leech Seed Celebi is the best answer to defensive Suicune. It has naturally high bulk, a resistance to Suicune's STAB attacks, Leech Seed to wear away at Suicune's health, and STAB Grass-type attacks to prevent Suicune from attempting to stall it out via Rest. Some Celebi may even carry Perish Song or Calm Mind to boost up with non-Roar Suicune. Faster Celebi can even use Leech Seed on offensive Suicune and attempt to stall it out with Recover, though Celebi is likely to get frozen or receive a critical hit eventually. Celebi is very unreliable against faster Suicune though, as they can threaten to 2HKO Celebi with boosted Ice Beam or simply wall its Leech Seed via Substitute and set up on it for free.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is the best offensive answer to defensive Suicune, as threatens it with STAB Thunderbolt, can phase it with Roar, and has naturally high Special Defense. Note that Zapdos needs to be healthy to check Suicune. Offensive sets can be chipped and worn down while switching in, while defensive sets can be forced to use Rest. Zapdos is a lot less resilient against offensive Suicune. There is a good chance that bulkless Zapdos gets OHKOed by +1 offensive Suicune's Ice Beam, and defensive Zapdos is frequently in a losing position if Suicune outspeeds it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: The tier's premier answer to special attackers, Blissey does extremely well against offensive Suicune, threatening to inflict status on it with Toxic or Thunder Wave and gradually wear it down while walling its attacks. However, it cannot beat Rest Suicune, becoming a short-term wall that forces Suicune to use Rest while relying on teammates to make progress. Blissey can be exploited by a healthy Substitute Suicune or RestTalk Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's high natural Special Defense allows it to switch into Suicune and set up or simply lay into it with powerful attacks. However, Suicune's high physical bulk presents a challenge. Defensive Snorlax struggles to push through defensive Rest Suicune, and can be worn down by offensive variants. Offensive Snorlax is usually forced to use Self-Destruct to try and take Suicune down.</p> <p><strong>Milotic</strong>: Milotic can stop offensive Suicune, especially non-Hidden Power Grass variants, in its tracks with Toxic and Recover. It can also wall defensive Suicune and force it to use Rest. Just like Blissey, it is setup fodder for Substitute Suicune and RestTalk Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Salamence</strong>: Choice Band Salamence makes for an interesting answer, as it resists Surf and can switch into Suicune without Ice Beam, threatening a roll to 3HKO defensive variants with Hidden Power Flying in sand or a critical hit while Suicune continuously uses Rest. Additionally, Salamence's Speed allows it to revenge kill worn-down offensive Suicune in certain scenarios. Its vulnerability to Ice Beam renders it imperfect as a check.</p> <p><strong>Regice</strong>: Regice combines high Special Defense with solid Special Attack to pressure Suicune with any of Thunderbolt, the rare Psych Up, and Explosion followed by Dugtrio. However, it has no longevity whatsoever, can be set up on, and can be outlasted by defensive Suicune in most scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi can use Calm Mind alongside Suicune variants lacking Roar, and pound them with Electric-type coverage. Jirachi's particular vulnerability to one of the most common moves in particular—Roar — renders it imperfect as a check.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur resists Surf, uses Leech Seed, and can disrupt offensive Suicune variants with Sleep Powder. However, it lacks Celebi's bulk and recovery and is more prone to being worn down.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Vaporeon is technically a perfect counter to Suicune, as its Water Absorb renders it immune to Surf and it can threaten to remove Suicune's boosts via Roar or Haze, but it is vulnerable to Toxic, Hidden Power Grass, and PP stalling, as it cannot harm Suicune outside of Toxic.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind, Surf, and Rest maximize Suicune's longevity and ability to sweep against virtually any sort of opposition.</p> <p>The last move is mostly a matter of what the team needs. Roar is the preferred option to phaze other setup sweepers such as Suicune, Curse Snorlax, and Dragon Dance Salamence, and it tends to provide the best general utility by complementing Spikes or covering for a weak defensive backbone. Ice beam nails Salamence and Grass-types that resist Surf as well as hitting Zapdos super effectively. Sleep Talk counteracts one of Rest's primary detriments by allowing Suicune to move while sleeping, which helps to exploit defensive teams that answer Suicune by forcing it to use Rest and then phazing with a Pokemon like Whirlwind Skarmory, which dislikes Surf; it also gives Suicune the potential to hold its ground against Zapdos and Starmie with continuous boosts. Keep in mind that this momentum comes at the cost of Suicune relying entirely on Surf to take out its checks and thus being more exploitable by Water-resistant threats.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Suicune's ability to take physical hits while outspeeding fully invested base 55 Speed Pokemon, including lesser-seen but dangerous threats like Marowak. The defensive EVs give Suicune 401 HP, ensuring that it survives 4 uses of Seismic Toss in sand and 5 outside of it, which can be important if Blissey tries to fish for full paralysis on a Suicune paralyzed by Thunder Wave. The Defense investment avoids a guaranteed 3HKO from threats like Choice Band Aerodactyl and Choice Band Metagross even in sand. An alternative is to run around 68 Speed EVs to outrun maximum invested neutral Speed Tyranitar as well as slower Pokemon around that range, such as offensive Swampert and Body Slam Jirachi.</p> <p>As Suicune needs several boosts to become a threat, many teams check it by whittling it down with offensive pressure or walling it, forcing it to use Rest, and phazing it with Spikes up. Thus, this Suicune is generally meant to be played carefully until its impediments are identified and the appropriate lines of play become clear. Blissey and Celebi should be PP stalled to set up an eventual sweep, while offensive counters should be worn down and removed. Using weather-clearing moves to remove sandstorm or spinners to remove Spikes throughout the game is also critical to keep Suicune from accumulating chip damage and being forced to use Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune has a number of compromising issues that it appreciates teammates' abilities to handle. Spikes are a consistent thorn in Suicune's side, whittling away at it on the switch and making it difficult for it to stand up to physical attackers such as Salamence and Metagross. Claydol's Rapid Spin removes Spikes, while its solid bulk and resistance to Rock allow it to fend off Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Magneton, on the other hand, can trap Skarmory, limiting the layers of Spikes it can put down and destroying a phazer that can disrupt Suicune's attempts at sweeping, as well as switch into Aerodactyl's Rock Slide and potentially trap Choice Band Metagross. Beyond the Spikes weakness, pairing Rock-resistant Pokemon with Suicune is generally prudent to keep it from being exploited by sand and Rock Slide flinches— Metagross and Jirachi are other such Pokemon. Despite sharing a dislike of Skarmory, Metagross threatens Blissey, Snorlax, and other special walls that switch into Suicune with its powerful Meteor Mash and fends off Tyranitar and Aerodactyl consistently. Jirachi can form a Calm Mind core with Suicune, where they weaken special walls in tandem. Jirachi can also spread paralysis via Body Slam or Thunder and pass Wish to help Suicune's longevity.</p> <p>As far as mitigating Suicune's weaknesses and counters go, support is generally easy to come by. Suicune's weakness to Electric-types—primarily Zapdos, as well as Jolteon to a lesser degree—can be covered by partnering it with Blissey or Celebi. Like Jirachi, Blissey can run Wish or spread paralysis for Suicune, while Celebi can support Suicune with Leech Seed and Baton Pass. Spikers like Skarmory and Forretress act as backup physical walls, switch into Celebi, and help non-Ice Beam Suicune take advantage of Roar and rack up Spikes damage on its counters. With some chip damage, Dugtrio can trap and remove Celebi, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Metagross, which Suicune generally appreciates. As an additional support option, Dugtrio can run Sunny Day, threatening to trap Tyranitar and clear its sand to give Suicune free rein. Choice Band Salamence is a strong pivot against physically based threats, and its Intimidate can help ease Suicune's entry or cover its back when weakened. Gengar's disruptive abilities are generally appreciated by Suicune, and its Will-O-Wisp can compromise special walls and open a window for Suicune to go to town.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Suicune is an omnipresent threat defined by its versatility, having a number of move choices that can ease certain matchups and bypass particular checks while being consistently threatening to standard bulky offense. This set focuses on the variant without Substitute, which is devastating to all but Blissey and Milotic.</p> <p>Calm Mind gives Suicune a way to push through defensive checks such as Zapdos, Celebi, and Snorlax, . Hydro Pump is the preferred STAB option, as its higher damage is critical in OHKOing uninvested Tyranitar and wearing down Pokemon like Snorlax. One can run Surf if concerned about Hydro Pump's low accuracy and PP, though.</p> <p>Ice Beam hits Pokemon that resist Water like Celebi and Salamence. While defensive Celebi can theoretically switch into slower Suicune and attempt to hold it off with Leech Seed and Recover, Suicune frequently has the upper hand; the odds of Suicune landing a critical hit or freeze in four turns is about 50%. Ice Beam also gives Suicune a reliable way of hitting Zapdos and knocking out weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>Roar's primary purpose is to maintain momentum. It prevents other Calm Mind users like Celebi and Jirachi from checking Suicune by boosting alongside it and phazes opposing slower Suicune. This can be important on teams with multiple offensive Calm Mind users that favor momentum over a defensive backbone; these teams can be crushed if the opponent sets up earlier or in a favorable position. Roar also occasionally allows Suicune to rack up Spikes damage, given that offensive Suicune is pretty good at forcing switches against some common Pokemon like Tyranitar, Salamence, and Swampert.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used in place of Roar to inflict heavy damage on opposing Suicune before it gets a chance to set up or phaze. It also crushes Swampert and helps Suicune get past Milotic and Vaporeon. It is a good choice when one has Calm Mind checks like Snorlax and other phazers.</p> <p>Offensive Roar and three-attacks Suicune tend to require support against checks like Blissey and Zapdos. Toxic provides another interesting support alternative, compromising Zapdos and opposing Suicune while either forcing Blissey and Celebi to switch or wearing them down to the point that one-on-one battles are feasible. Toxic is particularly deadly when paired with Dugtrio, which can switch in to pick off the weakened Blissey or Celebi. Rest is an option to shrugs off status that would otherwise put Suicune on a timer and gain longevity against checks like Seismic Toss Blissey, allowing Suicune to boost with impunity and burn through their PP.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune's EVs vary widely, as there are a number of tradeoffs to be made in Speed, power, and bulk. Relevant Speed benchmarks are 16 EVs for Marowak and some Milotic, 68 EVs for neutral Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Swampert, and Body Slam Jirachi, 152 EVs for all Tyranitar, Adamant Metagross, Modest Magneton, and slower Celebi and Jirachi, and 228 EVs for Jolly Metagross and Breloom, Timid Magneton, Cloyster, and a larger proportion of Celebi and Jirachi, which have a wide variance in Speed. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Heracross, Modest Moltres, and some Zapdos and Salamence, but this sacrifices a significant amount of Special Attack.</p> <p>Every EV taken out of Special Attack and HP is a compromise. The yardstick of any Water-type in ADV is its ability to deal with Tyranitar. Even with maximum Special Attack investment, Suicune's Hydro Pump has a slim chance of leaving bulkless Tyranitar standing. To make matters worse, even maximum HP Suicune has a decent chance of getting 2HKOed by Adamant Dragon Dance Tyranitar should it miss Hydro Pump or get flinched by Rock Slide. Considering the complexities of Suicune's interactions, EV spreads for Suicune are extremely subjective. Some helpful concrete benchmarks, however, include 56 HP and 128 HP EVs to survive Aerodactyl's Double-Edge with and without getting KOed by sand and 120 HP EVs to survive Modest Zapdos's Thunderbolt in sand.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune has potential utility in all phases of the game, depending on the particular variant being used and the matchup. Traditionally, Roar, three-attacks, and Toxic variants shine as leads or early- to mid-game threats, creating immediate pressure against most leads, threatening to punch through shakier checks like Snorlax, Celebi and Skarmory from the get-go, and easily switching out of passive counters like Milotic and Blissey. Suicune switch into offensive threats like Metagross and Tyranitar early-game to wrest back momentum, if its team lacks a sturdier switch-in. However, Suicune can also be used late-game to clean up teams that are weak to offensive Water-types, such as offensive teams that try to use Aerodactyl, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Salamence as late-game sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Suicune fits best on offensive teams; it features most prominently in special offense, especially teams with multiple offensive Calm Mind users, namely Celebi, Jirachi, and sometimes Raikou.</p> <p>Dugtrio synergizes extremely well with Suicune. It is almost always required on Spikesless specially offensive teams for its ability to remove weakened Blissey or, if it runs a specially defensive spread, 2HKO it while surviving Ice Beam in a one-on-one situation. Common methods of weakening Blissey are sacrificing a Calm Mind-boosted Pokemon like Jirachi, Celebi, or the occasional Jynx and luring it with Gengar or Regice and using Explosion. Gengar has the added benefit of being a switch-in to Snorlax, which is often the special tank that threatens specially offensive teams the most; Regice switches into Zapdos and Starmie and can also use Explosion on lured Snorlax. One does not necessarily need to weaken Blissey— even passing multiple Calm Mind boosts from Celebi to Dugtrio so that it is 3HKOed by Blissey's Ice Beam is a possible strategy for removing it. Dugtrio removes weakened Celebi and Jirachi too, which are much easier for Suicune to handle but can still be impediments due to their Leech Seed and status moves. Defensively, Dugtrio serves as a check and revenge killer to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which is a weakness generated from using offensive Suicune instead of a bulkier Water-type like Swampert.</p> <p>Suicune does not have to be confined to specially offensive teams. It generally synergizes well with physically offensive Pokemon — Metagross, Snorlax, and Tyranitar all exert massive pressure on special walls that check Suicune. Metagross's Rock resistance helps cover Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, while Snorlax can switch into Zapdos and Jolteon, and Tyranitar's sand helps pressure Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi. Heracross is another dangerous physical attacker that can switch into Blissey and Celebi and threaten to cleave defensive teams open, aiding Suicune immensely. Pairing Suicune with Spikes is also a viable option— Skarmory can take over switching into Metagross early-game, and Spikes can chip away at Suicune's checks, particularly in conjunction with Roar. Offensive Swampert sets pair extremely well with Suicune in a double Water-type core, as Swampert and Suicune can pressure their shared answers while improving a team's defense against dangerous physical threats. Jirachi provides a Rock-type resistance to back up Suicune against Aerodactyl; defensive sets offer Wish support, while offensive sets can help to overload shared counters. Together with Dugtrio, Suicune and Jirachi provide not only significant offensive potency but also a decent defensive backbone against Aerodactyl and Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute Suicune is a variant of offensive Suicune that generally has more utility in the late-game. This analysis primarily explores maximum HP Substitute Suicune, which can beat Blissey one-on-one outside of sand thanks to its 101 HP Substitute withstanding Seismic Toss. Substitute also provides protection against status from Milotic, Leech Seed from Celebi, and Explosion from slower Pokemon like Metagross and Snorlax, turning what would ordinarily be checks into setup fodder. The downside to Substitute Suicune is that unlike standard offensive Suicune, it cannot phaze or take out opposing Suicune, and maximum HP versions need to drop coverage or rely on partners for sand removal.</p> <p>Ideally, Substitute Suicune obtains enough Calm Mind boosts to overwhelm the opponent, so the extra power Hydro Pump offers over Surf is unnecessary. This is by far the dominant preference. However, Surf Suicune usually needs to be at full HP to beat Blissey. Where that condition is a challenge, using Hydro Pump instead gives Suicune the possibility of taking out Blissey with one less boost. Also, Hydro Pump with high Special Attack investment gives Suicune the possibility of OHKOing Dragon Dance Tyranitar should Suicune need to be used defensively.</p> <p>Ice Beam hits Celebi and Salamence, and provides Suicune a reliable way of hitting Zapdos hard. It is mostly used when the team has a Rain Dance or Sunny Day user to remove sand. Without a weather changer, Rain Dance becomes a key move of the set. Rain Dance Suicune is a potent weather changer, as it can clear sand in time to beat Blissey even in the face of Tyranitar by forcing Tyranitar out. Note that rain multiplies damage on top of Calm Mind boosts, making it easier to take out Blissey too.</p> <p>While Substitute Suicune is known for its late-game prowess, Toxic makes it a good lead that can immediately provide pressure as the opponent switches to Blissey or Celebi. It also helps take out these special walls in the late-game. As Toxic takes several turns to accumulate damage, this set is sometimes better used mid-game, especially when Pokemon like Salamence or Zapdos remain.</p> <p>There are a couple of fringe sets that require heavy support to function. Roar in the last slot prevents Suicune from being walled by opposing Suicune, but dropping Ice Beam makes dealing with Celebi tricky. The ability to set up on opposing Suicune and Milotic unimpeded is a huge asset on rain-based teams, which naturally have a weather changer already; there, the most straightforward way to deal with Celebi is to lure it with Explosion Gengar and follow up with Dugtrio. Short of entirely removing Celebi, Spikes with Speed investment on Suicune to block Leech Seed is an interesting way of mitigating those issues; after six boosts, Suicune can phaze Celebi. The opponent is then forced to give up the Pokemon brought in or switch back to Celebi, which takes Spikes damage and then gets 2HKOed. The same can be done to Milotic, which does not get 2HKOed without significant Special Attack investment. Protect is another viable option on rain-based teams. Protect increases Suicune's longevity significantly in the absence of sand and allows Suicune to set up on Blissey and Swampert more comfortably; in the right circumstances, it even allows Suicune to set up on Snorlax, Starmie and mixed Salamence.</p> <p>As far as EVs go, Substitute Suicune by and large uses maximum HP to ensure that Blissey's Seismic Toss does not break Substitute. This unfortunately starves Suicune of offensive investment, and subjective tradeoffs have to be made. 172 and 96 Special Attack EVs are needed to 2HKO Blissey with 252 and 44 HP EVs, respectively. Unfortunately, the former only leaves enough Speed to outrun Body Slam Jirachi and neutral Dragon Dance Tyranitar; strictly speaking, only 64 Speed EVs are needed, leaving a spread of 192 SpA / 64 Spe. The latter, which outspeeds all Tyranitar, Adamant Metagross, Modest Magneton, and slower Celebi and Jirachi, frequently lacks in power against Blissey and other checks Suicune can potentially break through like Celebi, Zapdos, Snorlax, and Heracross; again, only 152 Speed EVs are needed, leaving a spread of 104 SpA / 152 Spe. Given these massive tradeoffs, a minority of Substitute Suicune simply forgo HP in favor of Speed and Special Attack. This is a good option on teams that are comfortable facing Blissey but not Celebi, such as those with Snorlax or mixed Metagross.</p> <p>Note that Suicune usually needs to be a turn ahead to reach +6 and beat Blissey convincingly. This requires Blissey to switch into Suicune as it starts setting up, or, less preferably, trick Blissey into using a status move as Suicune uses Substitute. Careful planning is paramount to getting Substitute Suicune to work.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Suicune works best on offensive teams, though in a somewhat distinct manner from standard offensive Suicune. Its ability to set up on Blissey comes with a set of hurdles that usually have to be supported by teammates.</p> <p>Removing sand is necessary for non-Rain Dance Suicune to beat Blissey. Ideal weather changing teammates should have relatively disposable moveslots, be difficult to trap, and be fast or bulky enough to clear the weather before they get KOed. Such partners include Rain Dance Zapdos, Sunny Day Dugtrio, Sunny Day Moltres, and possibly Kingdra on rain teams. Rain Dance Magneton is easily trapped, but has two disposable moveslots and can run an Endure + Salac Berry set if one is really desperate. Note that Dugtrio is helpful for permanently removing Tyranitar but is not necessary.</p> <p>As Suicune usually needs to be near full HP to beat Blissey, mitigating Spikes is important. Magneton traps Skarmory and Forretress in an attempt to limit them to one layer of Spikes and makes sure Skarmory does not continuously accumulate damage on Suicune by phazing. Alternatively, one can use a spinner like offensive Claydol, whose Explosion has a myriad of uses like removing Zapdos and Celebi and weakening Tyranitar for a Dugtrio trap, which enables permanent sand removal later. Choice Band Metagross and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax can also lure and remove Skarmory and Forretress.</p> <p>As Suicune needs to preserve its HP if it wants to beat Blissey, it prefers not to act as the bulky Water-type early-game and so appreciates partners that can check or at least trade with physical threats like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence. These include offensive or Endeavor Swampert, Dugtrio, and mixed Metagross. This division of labor is highly efficient, because it's more likely that the teams that can overwhelm these teammates and require your Suicune to be used defensively are physically offensive and lack passive Pokemon that require Suicune's Substitute. Kingdra performs a slightly similar function on rain teams, though a more accurate description of its role is to conquer offensive teams, while Substitute Suicune dominates defensive teams.</p> <p>Another way to keep Suicune's HP up is Wish, which eliminates damage that Suicune takes from being used defensively, using Substitute, and switching into Spikes. The best Wish users for supporting Substitute Suicune are reasonably fast because they can use Wish right before sacrificing themselves so that Suicune gets the Wish without getting hit. These include Salamence, Jirachi, and Jolteon.</p> <p>Removing and pressuring Suicune's checks is always appreciated. Mixed Explosion Metagross lures in Zapdos and Celebi; it can also use Pursuit to chip Gengar into KO range of Suicune's Surf. Snorlax can switch into opposing Suicune and threaten to use Self-Destruct. If Suicune does not have Ice Beam, then having other sources of Ice-type coverage and switch-ins to Salamence like Porygon2 and, again, offensive or Endeavor Swampert is immensely useful. Suicune without Ice Beam will also need to remove Celebi, in which case Dugtrio, with its added utility of changing weather and revenge killing physical threats, becomes a prime partner. Pokemon that appreciate sand removal like Salac Berry Heracross and Snorlax make for natural partners to Rain Dance Suicune.</p>"
      },
      "Modest RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Modest RestTalk Suicune is an offensive Suicune variant designed to combine longevity with consistent damage and offensive pressure. Its premise is simple: RestTalk affords it both recovery and the ability to continuously boost and attack, rendering it practically immune to status and a threat to phazers. Its simplicity belies its effectiveness, however, as it can easily accumulate boosts against unsuspecting checks and snowball its way through a team. This Suicune is, in particular, a stallbreaker that attempts to exploit the single turn of Sleep Talk by threatening to hit phazers with Sleep Talk Surf for massive damage as they switch in, all without the opponent making any progress. The result is a sweeper that can find early-game setup opportunities and exert constant pressure until a window emerges for it to sweep.</p> <p>An important factor in understanding Suicune's use involves the mechanics behind Sleep Talk; if Suicune switches out immediately after using Sleep Talk, then the turns spent sleeping are reset to zero, thereby giving it two further sleep turns. However, if Sleep Talk is not used on Suicune's next turn of sleep before switching, Suicune wakes up as normal. Suicune can thus use Sleep Talk while the phazer comes in and simply continue sleeping on the turn it is phazed. When all is said and done, Suicune awakens quickly and the phazer has had no opportunity to do damage or, in the case of Skarmory, lay Spikes. Furthermore, when combined with teammates that provide consistent and constant pressure on Skarmory, the phaze rarely brings in Pokemon that Skarmory can set Spikes on without being punished.</p> <p>This Suicune is particularly threatening to teams with Skarmory + Swampert + Blissey cores, as it can switch in easily throughout the game and accumulate boosts, use Rest at opportune moments, and then let loose with Surf against the lineup of Pokemon that don't resist Water. The EV spread tends towards power and bulk, with a little Speed to ensure that Suicune outruns slower wallbreakers like Marowak. Other Speed benchmarks like 68 or 152 EVs to outrun Adamant or Jolly Dragon Dance Tyranitar can also be used. Taking out EVs from either HP or Special Attack can be reasonable; surviving an extra Seismic Toss isn't that important when Suicune can boost while sleeping anyway.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As potent as RestTalk Suicune is, its reliance on Surf leaves it slowed down by Pokemon that resist Water such as other Suicune, Celebi, Salamence, and Vaporeon. Thus, this Suicune set partners well with offensive threats that appreciate its ability to switch into Swampert and Blissey consistently and constantly pressure TSS teams. In particular, offensive Explosion users like Metagross and Snorlax can switch into some of Suicune's answers while luring opposing Suicune and Celebi, easing Suicune's path to a sweep. Mixed Metagross in particular is another Pokemon that targets TSS cores while luring Zapdos and Celebi, while Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax tends to lure Explosion, which could stop Suicune, from opposing Metagross. Endeavor Swampert is an interesting partner, threatening to remove RestTalk Suicune counters in opposing Suicune and Celebi via Endeavor and providing Ice Beam coverage for Salamence. Most of these offensive threats not only prepare Suicune's sweep but also maintain the pressure on Skarmory should it phaze Suicune, preventing it from setting Spikes freely. Should one want a Spikes setter, Taunt Skarmory or Forretress can fulfill that role and prevent opposing Skarmory from setting Spikes as well.</p> <p>With regard to defensive synergies, Porygon2 can switch into mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence indefinitely and trap Dugtrio before it gets a chance to remove Suicune while sleeping. Claydol provides a Thunderbolt switch-in, a Rock resistance, and the ability to remove Spikes to facilitate Suicune's entrance. While not as common, Flygon is a good partner, as it is a Spikes-immune Pokemon that can check Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and non-Hidden Power Ice Zapdos while appreciating Suicune's ability to carve up Swampert + Skarmory + Blissey cores. Wish users like Salamence, Blissey, and Jirachi can assist Suicune by easing its entry while sleeping. Celebi can support Suicune against Electric-type attacks while checking opposing Suicune, and it can support Suicune's longevity and offensive pressure with Leech Seed and Baton Pass.</p>"

However, it does have a wonderful base 125 Speed that allows it to outspeed most threats in the metagame. To highlight Swellow's incredible power with Guts and Choice Band, even Metagross can get 2HKOed by it with a layer or two of Spikes down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ghost can be used to stop Ghost-types that think they can wall Swellow. Sleep Talk makes Swellow a nice sleep absorber, though most most users of sleep-inducing moves can hit it quite hard; Swellow can still surprise them with Guts-boosted attacks while sleeping, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory and Forretress can come in, take virtually no damage from Swellow's moves, set up Spikes, Rest off the damage, and then take it out with repeated attacks. Even if Forretress's only attacks are Earthquake and Rapid Spin, it can often stall the Choice Band set out of PP while slowly whittling it down with Rapid Spin. Steelix, Metagross, Rhydon, and Golem take virtually no damage from Swellow even from sets packing Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting and can OHKO with Rock Slide. Aerodactyl has to be wary of switching in on Facade, but it outspeeds and OHKOes Swellow with Rock Slide. Ghost-types such as Gengar and Dusclops can switch into Swellow's STAB Normal attacks and KO it, but if Dusclops's only attack is Shadow Ball or Night Shade, it won't do anything back. In short, anything that can take a hit and strike back with a super effective move checks Swellow pretty well, as it is frail.</p>",

Facade is to take advantage of Guts, making a burned Swellow a definite force to be reckoned with, while Return / Double-Edge allow Swellow to do damage without being statused. This set works very well in tandem with Medicham, as the latter takes out Rock- and Steel-types and resists Rock-type attacks (although it can only take one or two hits before going down, anyway). Medicham also lures out Weezing and Dusclops like no other, and Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp to activate Guts and sweep their team, though it will probably have to switch out of Dusclops and come back for a sweep late-game when the latter has been weakened sufficiently. Quick Attack can go over one of the Normal-type moves for taking out users of Salac + Flail / Reversal. Hidden Power Fighting is primarily for OHKOing Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Ground hits Metagross hard. Skarmory and Normal-types are hit harder by Return no matter which Hidden Power you choose, however. Sleep Talk can be used over one of the other moves, but since Facade is not boosted by sleep, you are better off not using this. A simple 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature works best; using Adamant is not advised, as this leaves Swellow outsped by Jolly Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance and Timid Raikou.</p>"

      "Endeavor": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute down to low HP, Endeavor the enemy, and then KO with Quick Attack or Return. Return is better for general sweeping purposes, but Quick Attack works as a way of finishing off Salac Berry users and helps against Ninjask. Swellow can set up a Substitute safely if it switches into something it forces out, such as Heracross or Blissey. Once you see what they switch to, you can decide if you want Swellow to attack them or Baton Pass your Substitute to a teammate that will survive the foe's hit. If Swellow gets down to low health and is ready to Endeavor, but you know that the opponent will KO next turn, it can always Baton Pass the Liechi Berry boost out to a sweeper to soften up their team and switch in late-game to clean up. This is the advantage of Swellow's Speed--it doesn't need a Salac boost to be fast enough to Endeavor properly. You can just keep Swellow in the wings, threatening to Endeavor whatever late-game enemy is blocking a member of your team or simply take out weakened enemies along the way. Swellow also doesn't need to use Endeavor immediately after Substituting down to low HP.</p> <p>Other options for the item are Salac Berry and Petaya Berry depending on your team, but Liechi is guaranteed to at least help Swellow (especially if you have Return). Starf is a real option, though; no boost is useless when Swellow can pass it to the appropriate team. For example, Choice Band Salamence is nigh-unbeatable when their counter takes 50% damage from it and can no longer OHKO with Ice Beam thanks to +2 Special Defense. Similarly, Heracross can survive Aerial Ace from Dugtrio with +2 Defense and KO back with Megahorn.</p>"

  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>With resistances to both Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, as well as an immense Defense stat, Weezing is an ideal Heracross counter; it can survive even the most powerful Focus Punches from the likes of Machamp and Medicham as well. It can ruin boosting physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and Haze, so it is a great switch-in to Snorlax too. Finally, it gives Baton Pass chains a hard time as long as it isn't put to sleep or trapped and outstalled.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder are alternate attacking options that give Gyarados trouble while simultaneously hitting Skarmory. Shadow Ball can hit Dusclops and Gengar a bit harder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic is a great counter to Weezing as it can take advantage of poison or burn from Sludge Bomb and Will-O-Wisp with Marvel Scale. Other counters include Fire-types, who are immune to Will-O-Wisp; Houndoom in particular can hit Weezing with Pursuit as it switches out. Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Gengar stop Weezing cold as well. Skarmory can absorb Will-O-Wisp, set up Spikes, and Rest off the damage or be healed by Blissey or Celebi afterwards, but it needs to watch out for Flamethrower and Thunderbolt. Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp, activate Guts, and OHKO Weezing with a Choice Band Facade and some prior damage; Ursaring is even worse news with its huge base 130 Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {"description": "<p>Weezing is the best Fighting-type counter and Haze user in the game. This is a simple set: burn physical threats with Will-O-Wisp, Haze if they set up, and wear them down with Sludge Bomb or Flamethrower. Steel- and Rock-types with Substitute might give Weezing problems here, but Flamethrower can deal with the former.</p> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Weezing's HP and Defense to give it optimum physical bulk. Due to its low HP stat, Weezing gets more physical bulk by maximizing HP than by putting EVs into Defense. Thus, if you don't wish to maximize Defense, just use a lot of Defense EVs with a Defense-boosting nature, and put the rest in Attack or Special Attack.</p>"},
      "Offensive": {"description": "<p>A more offensive take on Weezing, this set is surprisingly effective and can put a dent in stall-based teams. The only things it needs to look out for are Dusclops and Gengar.</p> <p>The EV spread is somewhat complex; invest heavily in Attack, put 68 EVs in Special Attack to KO Skarmory and Heracross more easily, and dump the rest in HP so that Weezing can still take a few hits here and there.</p>"}
    }

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is a decent Pokemon thanks to its offensive and defensive traits that suit the metagame well. For one, its incredible typing and ability provide a resistance to Rock and immunities to sand, Spikes, and Electric- and Ground-type attacks. These traits improve longevity and make it one of, if not the, best counter to Dragon Dance Tyranitar in the entire tier and a good check to Hidden Power Grass Zapdos lacking Toxic, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Its offenses are also quite good, as its Earthquake is strong enough to hit offensive Pokemon quite hard, and its coverage makes the majority of the offensive metagame think twice before coming in. This offensive prowess is furthered by Flygon's very good base 100 Speed, which lets it outspeed common Pokemon like Heracross, Metagross, some Zapdos variants, and bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar at +1. However, Flygon has some major shortcomings that prevent it from being considered a top-tier threat. While it has great defensive merit, its typing leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type coverage from the likes of Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, Blissey, and offensive Water-types. It also often relies on trapping support from Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar, as Skarmory and Gengar are unfazed by Flygon and can use it to generate free turns. While it's quite strong, Pokemon like defensive Swampert, Skarmory, and Milotic are able to take Flygon's attacks and recover them off. Its matchup against most common Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes teams featuring SkarmBliss cores requires quite a bit of support from Spikes and trapping due to those teams being able to take Flygon's hits easily and even use it for free turns. Flygon also faces stiff competition from Swampert; despite Flygon being Spikes immune and not having to worry about being lured in and removed by sets like Hidden Power Grass Zapdos and Jolteon, Swampert's typing and greater bulk let it answer a lot more of the overall metagame and make it easier to fit on teams. As a result, Flygon is a more specialized, matchup-based pick in comparison.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ghost can be used to hit Gengar harder than any other move and does decent damage to Celebi, which makes Flygon less reliant on a Pursuit Tyranitar partner. However, this is all it does, and it's a more situational move than Hidden Power Bug on sets that run it. Hidden Power Flying can be used on teams that have issues dealing with Heracross. However, this is all it does, and Heracross can be pressured in other ways, usually via overloading it with offense. Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain can be run on a special attacking set to lure in and take a large chunk out of Swampert and do more to Skarmory with fully invested Fire Blast. However, this usually isn't very effective because Flygon's Special Attack stat is quite mediocre, Swampert can heal off Giga Drain over time anyway, and having a weaker Earthquake hurts the Tyranitar and Metagross matchups. A pinch Berry set utilizing Liechi Berry with Substitute or Salac Berry with Endure can be used to help give Flygon some extra cleaning ability late-game; a Salac Berry + Endure set can also act as a failsafe against fast Pokemon and setup sweepers, giving Flygon an extra hit before going down. However, this comes at the cost of the increased longevity granted by Leftovers, making Flygon a less reliable check to Rock-types. Pinch berry sets are hence most appropriate for short games.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert are able to take Flygon's hits well and threaten it out with strong Water- or Ice-type coverage. Defensive Swampert in particular is a fantastic answer, as, in tandem with being able to heal in sand with Leftovers and use Protect, it also isn't too bothered by Toxic due to Refresh. However, Suicune and Milotic are both vulnerable to sand, so Flygon's damage is going to stick, and Suicune lacks any recovery outside of Rest. Choice Band sets can also pressure all of these Pokemon if they directly switch in, especially in sand for the former two and if Spikes are down for all three of them. Offensive Swampert also takes a lot from Earthquake and is completely crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Earthquake, isn't hit that hard by any of Leftovers Flygon's moves depending on its physical bulk investment, and can OHKO Flygon with Ice Punch. It can also use Will-O-Wisp, crippling either Flygon or whatever switches into Gengar as Flygon gives Gengar a free turn. However, multiple Rock Slide in sand can start to sting from Leftovers Flygon, and Choice Band sets do a ton of damage, leaving Gengar unable to fulfill other potential defensive duties throughout the game. Gengar is also very vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar, a common Flygon partner.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon Flygon is typically meant to counter or at least check, like Tyranitar, Zapdos, and Jolteon, are all able to potentially lure it in and take it out with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice. However, these moves can be scouted with smart play. Ice-type coverage can also be seen on other Pokemon like Jirachi, Porygon2, Starmie, and Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is able to come into Flygon thanks to copying Levitate with Trace, taking little damage from Flygon's coverage options, and having longevity thanks to Recover. It's also able to use Ice Beam on Flygon to take it out and can cripple potential switch-ins with Thunder Wave. While Toxic is a good stop to it in most cases, Porygon2 can trace a Natural Cure user to heal the poison. However, Porygon2 gives free turns to common Flygon partners, namely Spikers, especially when Porygon2 has to recover.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp on Pokemon like Moltres and especially Gengar makes Flygon have to switch out, as burns remove any offensive threat it may have while chipping it beyond what Leftovers heals. Toxic poison ruins Flygon, as it forces Flygon out more often and makes it take constant chip damage so it can't counter or check what it's meant to. This is compounded on when Protect users are on the opposing team, which they very often are. Paralysis from Body Slam Jirachi means Flygon is outsped by the entire metagame.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory doesn't take much from any attack Flygon has besides Fire Blast, and if it lacks said move, Skarmory is free to lay up Spikes in Flygon's face and take its attacks with ease. However, Fire Blast will sting Skarmory, and Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide can do some noticeable damage. It also doesn't help Magneton can easily be employed to remove it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Flygon sports a unique combination of speed, power, and defensive utility. Its unique typing, Spikes immunity, and decent bulk allow it to pivot into threatening attacks like Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Zapdos's Thunderbolt at any point in the game, making Flygon one of the few Pokemon that can turn the momentum around against offensive teams. It can be difficult to pivot into, because it punishes physical walls with its powerful Earthquake especially with Spikes on the field and has the appropriate coverage moves for hovering checks. As Flygon outspeeds most of the metagame and can hold its ground against several faster Pokemon like Hidden Power Grass Jolteon and Aerodactyl, it can frequently sweep weakened teams too.</p> <p>Earthquake can take out most Tyranitar and Metagross variants with a little bit of chip damage. Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Gyarados hard while also doing relatively solid damage to Gengar as it switches in. Hidden Power Bug does a lot of damage to Celebi and hits Claydol quite hard, preventing these common switch-ins from being totally safe, and also preventing Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi from freely passing boosts. Substitute is preferred in the fourth moveslot, as it punishes switches and certain Choiced-locked Pokemon, lets Flygon evade status from status spreaders like Zapdos and Milotic, and allows it to fire off at least one free attack. Fire Blast can be run over Substitute if Skarmory and Forretress are a bigger concern and denies them from setting up Spikes, which helps against Spikes-centric builds and makes Flygon less reliant on a potential Magneton partner while also doing decent damage to Gengar and Celebi on the switch. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Timid Moltres and offensive Celebi and at worst Speed tie with Zapdos and Jirachi rather than risk being outsped. An Adamant nature lets Flygon threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to more effectively but makes it unable to outspeed a large fraction of offensive Celebi and tie with offensive Jirachi, making it an overall inferior choice on most teams. When using Fire Blast, Naive and Naughty should be used over Jolly and Adamant to preserve the much needed power on Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is a fantastic partner because it brings sand to wear down Pokemon like Zapdos, Snorlax, Suicune, Celebi, and Gengar so Flygon's damage sticks while also trapping the aforementioned Gengar, which is a massive nuisance to this set, and it can even slam Swampert with Hidden Power Grass so Flygon can more easily take it out. Magneton is another good partner, as it traps Skarmory, Forretress, and Choice Band Metagross not locked into Earthquake, which is a move that Flygon can dissuade thanks to Levitate, so Flygon can more easily threaten teams that rely on Skarmory for handling Ground-types and drop Fire Blast for Substitute more reliably. In return, Flygon can force Skarmory and Forretress to come in so Magneton can come in on a double switch to trap them, as well as handle Tyranitar and come in on many Choice Band Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to take out Magneton, like Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Spikes setters like Skarmory and Forretress are great to have, as they make Flygon's attacks sting even more, especially since some of Flygon's best answers, namely Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey, are very vulnerable to Spikes and Spikes synergize well in tandem with the sand likely to be up. These two also bring some much-needed defensive stops to Pokemon like non-Hidden Power Fire Metagross and physical Salamence. This Flygon is also able to threaten spinners like Claydol and opposing Forretress if it has Fire Blast, keeping the Spikes up and letting the Spikes setter on Flygon's team come in less often, helping it stay healthy to check what it needs to. Flygon is also able to wall Pokemon like Aerodactyl and physical Tyranitar in tandem with these Pokemon because they bait Rock Slide from these and let Flygon get safely in, compensating for its lack of bulk. Flygon can even force in a potential Porygon2 so the Spiker can set Spikes on it. Gengar makes for a good partner, since it can spread residual damage through Will-O-Wisp burns and check Salamence, Heracross, and Snorlax while taking advantage of Flygon checking Pursuit Tyranitar lacking Ice Beam. It can even take advantage of the holes Flygon breaks in the opposing team to sweep late-game, and it even fits on many of the same Spikes-based teams that this Flygon is meant to be on. They can also both pivot around many Pokemon with their defensive synergy, namely Choice Band users and weakened Hidden Power Grass Zapdos.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert are able to switch into physical attackers like Metagross, MixMence, and Swampert and potentially even spread status for residual damage, while Flygon can break down their checks with its powerful attacks, namely Celebi, Zapdos, Snorlax, and Jolteon. Defensive Swampert, in particular, is a good partner because it can take the pressure off Flygon to handle physical Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, which can often overwhelm this Flygon set due to its lack of bulk investment and Protect. It also helps that all three of these Water-types fit on the same Spikes-based builds Flygon does. Zapdos is able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, Heracross, and spread status so Flygon can have an easier time making damage stick while even having the potential to run Baton Pass to get Flygon in safely. Flygon can also switch into Rock Slides for Zapdos to gain offensive momentum and potentially do a lot of damage to Pokemon like Snorlax and Celebi so Zapdos has an easier time spamming Thunderbolt late-game while also acting as backup Ground-type check so Zapdos isn't as pressured to come into them. Metagross is a great partner for this Flygon because it can elect to run a mixed or bulky physical attacker Leftovers set if Flygon is running Fire Blast, which can help to lure in and remove Skarmory, and more bulk on Metagross means Flygon is relied on less to take on Rock-types. Meanwhile, Choice Band sets can use Explosion on Skarmory or Swampert and wallbreak so Flygon can clean through weakened walls.</p> <p>Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while piling on the residual damage to get Pokemon in range of Flygon's attacks with Leech Seed (which can also give Flygon extra longevity that it wouldn't have), while Flygon can offensively handle Metagross and pivot into Rock Slide, Earthquake, or Hidden Power Bug from Aerodactyl or Tyranitar well. Blissey can pivot into many special attackers, including Zapdos, Jolteon, Jirachi, Moltres, certain Gengar variants, and Water-types, while even potentially passing Wishes to keep Flygon healthy so it can threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to. Meanwhile, Flygon can offensively handle Pokemon that wall and use Blissey for free turns, like Tyranitar, as well as come in on some resisted hits that are often targeted at Blissey, namely Rock Slide and Earthquake, to get a chance to fire off a free hit. Moltres can roast Skarmory, Celebi, and Forretress and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp for residual damage so Flygon's damage sticks better, while Flygon can switch into physical Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and Salamence and start wallbreaking on top of wearing down Water-types with its powerful Earthquake so they're more hesitant to come into Moltres. Moltres also improves the Metagross matchup quite a bit, which teams featuring Flygon over Swampert can often struggle switching into due to Flygon's lack of a Meteor Mash resistance.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Flygon is a good Spikes-immune check to common threats like physical Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and Electric-types lacking Hidden Power Ice or Toxic. It also bolsters the team's resilience against Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence.</p> <p>Protect allows Flygon to receive a free turn of Leftovers recovery, scout Choice Band users, and rack up potential poison and sand damage. Rock Slide gives nearly perfect coverage in tandem with Earthquake and hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, and Aerodactyl hard while also not giving Gengar entirely free entry, wearing it down over time. Fire Blast can be used if getting good damage on Skarmory and Forretress and relying less on Magneton to handle them is preferred, but it's usually better to just pair this set with Magneton because Rock Slide's coverage is too valuable to pass up on a lot of the time. Toxic cripples Pokemon like non-Refresh Swampert, Zapdos, Porygon2, Suicune, non-Refresh Claydol, and opposing Flygon. It also forces Celebi to switch at some point to remove poison, which can give you a free turn as it switches. The EVs let Flygon outspeed maximum Speed positive-natured Tyranitar, allow it to survive two hits from Metagross, help it take Tyranitar's uninvested Ice Beam, and help it handle physical attackers as well as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as its sand is important to negate Leftovers from many foes, namely defensive Zapdos, Gengar, Celebi, and Suicune. Pursuit trapping Gengar and Celebi so Flygon can more effectively spread poison with Toxic is absolutely crucial as well, and Tyranitar can even lure in and destroy Swampert, Skarmory, Forretress, and Claydol with the appropriate coverage. Physical sets are able to check and take out Blissey, Ice Punch Jirachi, and Hidden Power Ice Zapdos. In return, Flygon can pivot into Earthquakes from Pokemon like Claydol and Tyranitar while also being able to pivot around Electric-types and Aerodactyl in tandem with Tyranitar, as they can wall Zapdos and Jolteon when played properly.</p> <p>Gengar makes for a good partner, as it can spread residual damage through Will-O-Wisp burns and threaten bulkier teams that Flygon struggles with via Taunt + Will-O-Wisp sets while also taking out Skarmory and taking advantage of Flygon checking Pursuit Tyranitar lacking Ice Beam. They can also both pivot around many Pokemon with their defensive synergy, namely Choice Band users and weakened Hidden Power Grass Zapdos and are both Spikes immune, making them fit on similar structures. Skarmory can set Spikes to help Flygon get lasting damage on the opposing team as a lot of Flygon's defensive answers, like Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey, are very vulnerable to Spikes and will likely be taking damage from sand and Toxic poison from Flygon too. Skarmory also provides a switch-in to Pokemon like Snorlax lacking Fire Blast and defensive Swampert. In return, Flygon can take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon as well as scout Fire-type coverage from Pokemon that run it, namely Metagross, Salamence, and Tyranitar. Flygon even poisons Spikes-immune Pokemon like Claydol, Zapdos, and Moltres with Toxic.</p> <p>Flygon fits very well on teams that have many Spikes-immune Pokemon to minimize the control Spikes have on the game, reducing the need for Magneton support in the process. With these things in mind, Zapdos is a great partner because it's able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, and Heracross and spread its own status in tandem with Flygon while contributing to the anti-Spikes idea this Flygon often fits on so well. Moltres improves the Metagross matchup quite a bit, which these teams can often struggle switching into due to Flygon's lack of a Meteor Mash resistance, while Flygon can spread poison with Toxic on bulky Water-types and pivot into Rock- and Electric-types well. Specially defensive Jirachi can take Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Gengar, opposing Jirachi, and Suicune, which these teams can sometimes struggle to take, and passes Flygon and its other teammates Wish to keep sustain throughout the game. This is especially important given many Pokemon on these teams can't recover with Leftovers due to being vulnerable to sand. It can even potentially spread paralysis or Toxic poison of its own to suffocate the opposing team in tandem with Flygon. In return, Flygon switches into Earthquakes and strong physical attackers that may overwhelm Jirachi on its own. Plus, most synergistic specially defensive cores in ADV cover Electric-types and Water-types, so the combination of Flygon + Zapdos + Jirachi makes a good specially defensive core without having a dedicated special wall. They can also wall Zapdos completely in tandem with each other because Jirachi handles Hidden Power Ice variants and Flygon stonewalls Thunder Wave variants, as they run Hidden Power Grass. Aerodactyl takes advantage of the residual damage Flygon spreads to make late-game sweeps more easily accomplished while providing these teams with a good form of speed control and even being Spikes and sand immune, making it fit on these structures even better.</p> <p>Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while piling on the residual damage in tandem with Flygon with Leech Seed, while Flygon can handle weakened Metagross and pivot into Aerodactyl. Blissey can pivot into many special attackers, including Zapdos, Jolteon, Jirachi, Moltres, certain Gengar variants, and Water-types, in a similar way to Celebi. It can even potentially pass Wishes to keep Flygon healthy. Meanwhile, Flygon can pressure and potentially force out physical attackers that scare Blissey, like Metagross, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. Zapdos is able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, Heracross, and spread its own status in tandem with Flygon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Flygon is a wallbreaker that can easily get onto the field due to its unique typing and its immunity to Spikes and Sand. It boasts the strongest Earthquake in the metagame, severely threatening even the most resilient physical walls.</p> <p>Earthquake OHKOes some Tyranitar and Metagross variants from full thanks to Choice Band, takes out pretty much all of them after a layer of Spikes, and gets good damage on Suicune and Milotic, especially if sand is up. Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Gengar, and Gyarados really hard. Hidden Power Bug smashes Celebi and hits Claydol really hard, preventing these common switch-ins from being safe with proper prediction. Gust takes out Heracross and Breloom, which teams with this Flygon set often have a very rough matchup against. Alternatively, Toxic cripples Porygon2, offensive Swampert, Zapdos, and Moltres and makes them incapable of coming in as safely or staying in for long periods of time. Fire Blast can also be run to hit Skarmory and Forretress and denies them from setting up Spikes; it also does decent damage to Gengar and forces Celebi to use Recover. A Jolly nature is preferred because it lets Flygon outspeed Timid Moltres and offensive Celebi and at worst Speed tie with Zapdos and Jirachi rather than risk being outsped. However, Adamant is better for some teams, as it allows Flygon to threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to more effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is an essential partner, as it brings sand to wear down Pokemon like Zapdos, Snorlax, Suicune, Celebi, and Gengar so Flygon's damage sticks while also trapping Gengar and Celebi and even threatening Zapdos with a potential Ice Beam so Flygon can begin to more freely throw around Earthquakes. It can even slam Swampert with Hidden Power Grass so Flygon can more easily take it out later in the game with Earthquake. Magneton is another almost mandatory partner, as it traps Skarmory and Forretress, two Pokemon that can take Flygon's attacks with ease and use it for free turns. Flygon can force Skarmory and Forretress to come in so Magneton can come in on a double switch to trap them. Conversely, Flygon can come in on many Choice Band Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to take out Magneton like Metagross, Aerodactyl, Salamence, and Tyranitar. If Magneton is not used as a partner, other measures of dealing with Skarmory's Spikes will be necessary. Forretress is great partner in this regard not only because of its ability to spin and lay its own Spikes, but also because it synergizes with Pursuit Tyranitar.</p> <p>Skarmory acts as a more reliable answer to Rock-types, Salamence, and Celebi while also setting Spikes so Flygon can wallbreak even more effectively. It's often worth running Drill Peck on the types of teams this Flygon fits on, as they're often weak to Heracross, which Flygon can sometimes have a tendency to let come in. Flygon is able to take on Electric-types relatively well in return while even doing a ton of damage to the spinners of the tier, so Spikes are likelier to stay up. Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while netting residual damage to get Pokemon in range of Flygon's attacks with Leech Seed, which can also give Flygon extra longevity that it wouldn't have, while Flygon can offensively handle Metagross and pivot into Rock Slide, Earthquake, or Hidden Power Bug from Aerodactyl or Tyranitar well. It also fits on many of the Spikes-based builds this set does.</p> <p>Metagross is able to run a bulkier Protect set to handle Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, as Flygon is unable to handle these Pokemon reliably due to lacking Leftovers. Milotic works well on the same builds this Flygon can, stops non-Choice Band Salamence, Claydol, Tyranitar, and Skarmory, and forces Suicune to use Rest, while Flygon threatens Snorlax, Celebi, and Zapdos for it. It can even come in on Rock Slide from Tyranitar, which Milotic often encourages it to do for free damage. Suicune can do largely the same thing as Milotic except it gives up reliability in countering threats in the long run for more initial bulk and more of an offensive presence. Defensive Swampert is a particularly good partner, as it can take the pressure off Flygon to handle Rock-types, which can overwhelm this Flygon set due to its lack of bulk investment and Leftovers; it can even wall Electric-types in tandem with Flygon, as they can take the Hidden Power the other can't. Because of this more reliable backbone and decreased offensive pressure, Flygon is able to come in more sparingly throughout games and keep healthy so it can be a threat in the long run.</p>"

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>While Ninetales is fragile, it does have its uses, specifically in providing team support in the form of sleep, burn, and Grudge. For example, it can help Raikou beat a team with Blissey in this way: Substitute down to low HP to avoid Thunder Wave, then use Grudge to remove all Blissey's Seismic Toss PP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast, but the latter is recommended as Ninetales's Special Attack is quite low. Confuse Ray makes Ninetales hard to hit, but can work against it if it uses Grudge while its opponents hit themselves in confusion. Hypnosis is a gamble, though a very rewarding one; it can be used alongside Will-O-Wisp if you wish. Toxic is another alternative status ailment; however, burn is better on physical attackers. Hidden Power Ice takes a chunk of health out of Salamence and Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Starmie is the best counter to Ninetales in the game as it does not care about status, resists Fire, and is fast enough to pick Ninetales off with Surf before Ninetales can use Grudge. Most Water-types do well too; examples include Gyarados, Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, and Lanturn. However, note that the former two don't like being burned. Snorlax, Blissey, Salamence, and Flygon deserve mentions as well, but aside from Blissey, they won't like being hit by Will-O-Wisp on the switch. Houndoom is itself immune to Fire moves, and can KO Ninetales with Crunch.</p>",
    "sets": {"Grudge": {"description": "<p>With some prediction, Ninetales can badly screw its opponents over. Ninetales's base 100 Special Defense is excellent, so you can expect your opponent to bring in a physical attacker, which Ninetales can burn with Will-O-Wisp. When Ninetales's end is near, Grudge is its big contribution to the team. If Ninetales uses Grudge on the turn it is KOed, the move that KOed it will be stripped of all its PP. With some smart strategizing, this can help pave the way for another Pokemon to sweep: for example, an Earthquake-less Donphan can no longer stop Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>The slowest Ninetales should go is a stat of 300 Speed, which requires a Timid nature and 148 Speed EVs; maximum Speed is a good option as well. Spread the rest over HP and Special Attack.</p>"}}

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>In standard, Golduck looks good on paper. Firstly, it isn't affected by Tyranitar's Sand Stream, which often ruins Pokemon that try to pull off a Substitute set. Golduck can also can get rid of special walls thanks to its Fighting-type moves and still attack decently. However, Golduck is KOed quickly by standard sweepers and stopped by a lot of walls, which makes it hard to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is an option over Surf for more power. Toxic cripples other Water-types and forces Regice and Thick Fat Snorlax to Rest. Refresh can let Golduck heal itself of status, but one is better off preventing it altogether. Psych Up enables Golduck to snatch Calm Mind boosts, but Golduck isn't likely to win a Calm Mind war because its stats are so mediocre. Light Screen is in itself a good support option, but Golduck isn't the best user of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos is one of the best counters to Golduck. In addition to packing a super effective STAB Thunderbolt, the common RestTalk Zapdos doesn't mind Hypnosis, while most defensive sets can take several hits--even the super effective Ice Beam. Raikou can do the same, but while it lacks a weakness to Ice Beam, it rarely has Sleep Talk.</p> <p>Blissey, Snorlax, and Regice are good Golduck counters as long as they avoid Focus Punch and Cross Chop; in particular, they counter Calm Mind sets pretty easily. Additionally, Regice and Snorlax can both 2HKO Golduck, the former with Thunderbolt and the latter with any STAB Normal-type attack.</p> <p>Celebi takes less than 50% from an unboosted Ice Beam and can use Leech Seed or set up Calm Mind boosts, then hit Golduck super effectively with a STAB Grass-type move. Suicune can also Calm Mind up, as well as phaze or poison Golduck without taking much damage. Milotic takes little damage from any of its moves as well and can use Hypnosis or Toxic on Golduck or set up Light Screen.</p>",

Psychic 2HKOes Heracross and possibly OHKOes Gengar, while Hidden Power Electric hits enemy Water-types, especially Gyarados.</p> <p>Some Attack investment is needed to hurt the standard special walls, but Golduck doesn't usually need more than 220 Attack.

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>Arcanine finds itself in the unfortunate limbo that is BL. It isn't a bad Pokemon by any means, but it has significant issues with Pokemon that are on nearly every standard team. Its great stats and Intimidate help it a little if you're willing to use it in standard play, but Arcanine's main problem is its small movepool and lack of useful STAB to complement its great Attack stat. One of the main reasons to use Arcanine is its access to Extreme Speed, which helps against Alakazam, Ninjask, and users of Flail and Reversal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam's paralysis chance is always a nice attribute, especially if Arcanine is paired with other slower sweepers. Toxic is a generally great move, as it greatly handicaps bulky Water-types and helps against Salamence, Gyarados, Solrock, and quite a few other threats. Thief can remove the Leftovers from bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Blastoise, and Safeguard can be used to prevent status conditions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard play, all Water-types work, as they fear only the rare Toxic. Slowbro, Suicune, and Milotic shrug off Arcanine's attacks and can retaliate with super effective STAB Surfs. Swampert has Earthquake as well, but should beware of Hidden Power Grass. Salamence and Gyarados also resist Fire and pack Earthquake, which will 2HKO Arcanine or OHKO it if backed by a Dragon Dance or Choice Band boost. As Intimidate lowers Arcanine's Attack, even Choice Band Extreme Speed will do pitiable damage. Tyranitar should avoid Hidden Power Fighting variants, but its STAB Rock Slide will shut down Arcanine. Blissey and Snorlax wall the special attacking variants.</p> <p>If Arcanine is allowed in UU play, Water-types still pose an issue. Blastoise, Walrein and other Water-types that pack defensive spreads work well for the same reasons Milotic and friends do in standard. Poliwrath doesn't always pack Water moves or Earthquake, but if it does, it can be counted on as well. Slowking is weak to Crunch, but has great Special Defense and can Surf or Thunder Wave Arcanine before it falls; the same goes for Hypno with Thunder Wave. Solrock and Lunatone resist both Extreme Speed and Arcanine's Fire STAB of choice, but they are weak to Hidden Power Grass and Crunch, so beware of that.</p>",

Overheat is useful if you intend to play Arcanine as a hit-and-run Pokemon; though it has a high damage output the first time it is used, it becomes successively weaker.</p> <p>In terms of EVs, focus on Attack and HP; Speed isn't really important, as Arcanine will be using Extreme Speed a lot.</p>"},

Overheat lets Arcanine dispatch Skarmory, which would otherwise wall this set, while Double-Edge is Arcanine's most powerful physical move. As Arcanine's movepool is so limited, it can use Hidden Power Grass over Iron Tail to OHKO Golem, and run Double-Edge in the third slot. However, Arcanine would then lose a lot of power against Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <p>Again, maximize Attack, and run some Speed as well. 244 is a good Speed stat to hit, as it beats all Tyranitar; 263 beats all Magneton, Skarmory, and Solrock, and 265 beats most Gyarados.

This Arcanine is perfect as a late-game sweeper, as it has the potential to finish off unsuspecting, weakened teams. In standard play, though, you'll find that it gets walled by bulky Water-types and special walls, namely Snorlax and Blissey, way too easily, making Toxic or Hidden Power Fighting options worth considering. Even then, however, it won't be too effective.</p> <p>Give Arcanine as much Special Attack as possible and a few Speed EVs to outrun Tyranitar; the rest optimizes Arcanine's bulk.</p>"}

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>Machamp's ability to OHKO Salamence and Skarmory--if it gets lucky with critical hits and Cross Chop's miss rate--is quite a plus. However, Cross Chop's low PP and subpar accuracy hinder Machamp significantly. While it is an easy switch-in to many Pokemon, Machamp is so slow that it can't really sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It can Encore boosting moves such as Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, which is very helpful alongside Substitute. Also of note is Light Screen, which can help Machamp gain a few Bulk Up boosts. Counter nabs a quick OHKO on Skarmory and non-Choice Band Salamence. Hidden Power Bug is handy for getting rid of Celebi on the switch, but Machamp will need a Choice Band or some other kind of Attack boost to OHKO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Machamp has no surefire counters. Your best bet is prediction, and to hit it hard before it hits you, which is doable since Machamp is rather slow and has only average defenses. Gengar can come in on any Fighting move nicely, but will be 2HKOed by Rock Slide and usually OHKOed by Hidden Power Ghost. Dusclops is sturdier, but unlike Gengar, he cannot really hit back that well. Note that both these Ghosts should not Will-O-Wisp Machamp, as this will only make it more powerful. The same goes for Weezing; it must beware of inflicting status on Machamp with Sludge Bomb or Will-O-Wisp. If Machamp packs Facade, Weezing is dead, but it can otherwise take hits well and Pain Split off damage. Celebi makes a good counter overall, as Machamp cannot 2HKO it without Hidden Power Bug or a boosted Hidden Power Ghost; Celebi can use Recover or Leech Seed to heal, or attack with STAB Psychic. Salamence and Gyarados have Intimidate to lower Machamp Attack, and resist Fighting moves as well. Rock Slide can 3HKO them even after Intimidate, though. Finally, Skarmory is generally a reliable switch-in to Machamp, but note that a Choice Band-boosted critical hit Cross Chop will OHKO both it and Salamence.</p> <p>Basically, your safest bet is switching around with common sense, and not giving Machamp too many opportunities to come in. Sand Stream ruins Machamp's durability even more.</p>",

Facade can seriously damage Weezing if you have trouble with it, while Hidden Power Ghost eliminates Gengar and Psychic-types.</p> <p>Choice Band variants can run more Speed to beat Skarmory; Machamp will need about 128 EVs.

Sleep Talk also gives Machamp on average five to six more uses of Cross Chop, which is useful with its low PP.</p>"}

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro can work very well in the standard metagame as a bulky Water-type. It is a fairly safe switch-in to Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Salamence, can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, or be a true tank with Calm Mind. However, it is inferior to standard bulky Water-types, namely Milotic, Swampert, and Suicune, for a few reasons. Unlike Swampert, it isn't immune to sandstorm and lacks a resistance to Rock; unlike Milotic, it has neither Marvel Scale nor Recover, and has to rely on Rest. Finally, Slowbro's Psychic typing renders it weak to Shadow Ball and Crunch, the former of which is on some Metagross, while the latter leaves it open to Tyranitar. All in all, while Slowbro isn't the best bulky Water-type out there, it definitely has its uses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast and Flamethrower are nice surprises for Steel-types such as Skarmory. Belly Drum is a novelty move, but is generally not recommended. Counter is amazing, however, as Slowbro can survive most unboosted physical attacks not named Heracross's Megahorn. Psych Up is handy against opponents that boost their Speed or defenses, while Yawn forces switches effectively. Sleep Talk is an option on the Calm Mind set; it makes Slowbro an even better tank. Growl is a fun option that further boosts Slowbro's walling capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Snorlax, Blissey, and Suicune are hands down the biggest threats to Slowbro. Snorlax and Blissey have large HP and Special Defense stats that let them shrug off attacks easily, while Suicune can quickly reduce the PP of Slowbro's attacking moves due to Pressure. Lanturn and Ludicolo can also tank Slowbro's Water- and Ice-type attacks easily, while Celebi resists both its STAB moves. Electric-types such as Zapdos and Raikou can hit Slowbro hard with STAB Thunderbolt.</p>",

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnet Pull Magneton plays a unique role in ADV OU by trapping prominent Steel-type Pokemon like Skarmory, Forretress, Metagross, Jirachi, and opposing Magneton. Skarmory and Forretress are Magneton's primary targets, as they are potentially OHKOed by Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire and they give Magneton a free switch in when they are setting Spikes.</p> <p>Magneton can do much more in a battle than trap Steel-types. For example, it can defensively check some threats, including Choice Band Salamence locked into Hidden Power Flying; Choice Band Metagross locked into Meteor Mash; Snorlax in sand lacking Earthquake or Fire Blast; and Choice Band Aerodactyl, Zapdos, and non-Fire Punch Gengar, albeit only once, with its many resistances. Additionally, Magneton can pressure some defensive teams with its sheer power combined with the threat of status: Thunderbolt threatens Suicune and Milotic, while Toxic forces out Blissey and Celebi, and the switch-in either takes a chunk from Thunderbolt or gets hit by a nasty status ailment.</p> <p>Magneton's overall good defensive typing often gets overshadowed by its 4x weakness to one of the most common attacks in ADV OU: Earthquake. This weakness means that it will be OHKOed by most physical attackers, including Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Swampert, Snorlax, Flygon, and Claydol. The weakness is especially exploited by Arena Trap Dugtrio, which can switch into Magneton's Thunderbolt and trap Magneton; to make things worse, Dugtrio is commonly used alongside Magneton's primary trap target, Skarmory, turning the trap into a one-for-one trade at best. Furthermore, offensive Skarmory can potentially outspeed and OHKO Magneton with Hidden Power Ground, while Forretress can sometimes survive Hidden Power Fire and OHKO back with Earthquake, which makes trapping these foes more difficult. Metagross and Jirachi at full health also generally win one-on-one against Magneton, meaning Magneton can't trap them without prior chip damage. Magneton's Fire- and Fighting-type weaknesses are also very relevant drawbacks, as they turn Moltres, mixed Salamence, and mixed Tyranitar into effective revenge killers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magneton only needs Thunderbolt + Hidden Power to function, which leaves it two free slots for some interesting options; Endure allows Magneton to activate Salac Berry. After the boost, Timid Magneton can outrun the entire OU metagame barring Jolteon and Aerodactyl, and it critically becomes faster than Dugtrio, meaning it cannot be successfully trapped. Additionally, it becomes faster than offensive Starmie and can check it in a pinch, and it can be used as a surprise weapon to check Flygon and Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. Alternatively, or in conjunction with Endure, Magneton can be an effective weather clearer with Rain Dance or Sunny Day; removing sand is used to great advantage when it is partnered with sand-weak Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Celebi. Metal Sound allows Magneton to scare off special walls like Blissey and Celebi and can potentially enable it to trap specially defensive Wish Jirachi from full HP; Metal Sound can also prevent last Pokemon Snorlax from sweeping your team. Swagger is an effective alternative when paired with Thunder Wave to generate key free turns for setup sweepers, Substitute users, and stat passers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Substitute Heracross, Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, and Ninjask. Charcoal is an alternative to Magnet, as it drastically increases the chances to OHKO Forretress and opposing Magneton with Hidden Power Fire; for this reason, it is sometimes seen on Skarm-Mag builds. Magneton can run the admittedly unreliable Thunder to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory when using a set without Magnet.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is a very effective counter to Magneton, trapping and OHKOing it. Dugtrio can also switch in on Thunderbolt and revenge kill Magneton after it has successfully trapped Skarmory. It is frequently possible to infer the presence of Magneton on a team and double switch Dugtrio in as Magneton tries to trap Skarmory; this is often a game-winning play. The only things Dugtrio has to fear from Magneton are potential Hidden Power Grass on the switch and the Endure + Salac Berry set.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Celebi</strong>: Blissey and Celebi can switch into Magneton and negate the Thunderbolt damage with their recovery moves, but they are forced out by Toxic, especially when it's paired with Protect or Substitute; for this reason, teams that rely on Blissey or Celebi to sponge Magneton are often troubled by the combination of Thunderbolt + Toxic. The occasional Metal Sound or Screech might also give Blissey and Celebi issues.</p> <p><strong>Claydol</strong>: Claydol is a decent check to Magneton because it can switch into Thunderbolt and threaten an OHKO with Earthquake, although it doesn't enjoy switching into Toxic or Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Flygon</strong>: Flygon is effective at punishing Magneton, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt or for a revenge kill after Skarmory was trapped to get a free Substitute as Magneton switches out or stays in to use Toxic; since Magneton rarely runs Hidden Power Ice, Flygon only has to fear for Toxic on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While not many Pokemon can take Magneton's powerful Thunderbolt, many are just fast enough to OHKO it before it can do anything, including Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, Charizard, and Brick Break Heracross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Magneton's offensive movepool consists mainly of Thunderbolt, which hits everything in the metagame except for Ground-types and dedicated special walls like Blissey and Celebi for solid damage. Thunderbolt can OHKO specially defensive Skarmory, 2HKO maximum HP Metagross, and 4HKO Snorlax in sand. Hidden Power Fire covers Forretress and opposing Magneton, but Hidden Power Grass is very common to cover Ground-types such as Swampert and Claydol as well as catch Dugtrio on the switch. With Hidden Power Grass, Magneton can run 31 Speed EVs, guaranteeing at least a Speed tie with Jolly offensive Skarmory.</p> <p>Magneton is often packing a status move, either Thunder Wave or Toxic; the former is very effective at crippling Jirachi as well as annoying Metagross and opposing Magneton, while the latter cripples Ground-types like Swampert, Claydol, and Flygon on the switch. Toxic also forces out Blissey and Celebi so that the incoming Pokemon has to take a powerful Thunderbolt. Since Hidden Power Grass covers Ground-types, it gets usually paired with Thunder Wave, while Hidden Power Fire is most often paired with Toxic.</p> <p>Protect is commonly paired with Toxic to increase the rate of poison damage, and it scouts foes' attacks, especially Choice Band users such as Salamence and Aerodactyl. Substitute can pair with both Toxic and Thunder Wave; the former helps in forcing out Blissey and Celebi, while the latter can generate a free turn with a timely full paralysis, allowing Magneton to safely stay behind the Substitute. Substitute also has nice synergy with Leech Seed, allowing Magneton to wall slower threats like Suicune and Snorlax as well as guaranteeing Metagross traps by weakening it into KO range.</p> <p>Magnet critically gives Magneton a much better chance to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory. The difference between OHKOing and 2HKOing Skarmory is huge, as it often translates to an extra layer of Spikes for your team to deal with but could also translate to Skarmory phazing Magneton, giving it a chance to make a comeback in later stages of the game, especially if paired with Dugtrio or a Wish user such as Blissey. Magneton can alternatively use Leftovers considering it's immune to sand, and when paired with Protect or Substitute, it can become much more annoying to deal with via repeated chip damage. Leftovers makes Magneton a lot more robust against Aerodactyl, Blissey, and Electric-types.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Magneton's offensive potential and guarantees Speed tying with opposing Magneton with the same Hidden Power type. A Modest nature maximizes the odds of OHKOing Skarmory and is sufficient for outspeeding most Metagross, but it leaves Magneton slower than or Speed tying with Adamant offensive Skarmory, which can OHKO Magneton with Hidden Power Ground. A Timid nature allows Magneton to trap Adamant Skarmory and opposing Modest Magneton but gives up the favorable roll to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory. Timid is frequently used when the team has a spinner such as Claydol and thus does not mind Skarmory sticking around for a little longer or when it is beneficial for Magneton to trap opposing Magneton, most notably with Skarmory as a partner. For the latter purpose, a good benchmark is having 32 Special Defense EVs to survive opposing Magneton's Hidden Power Fire. An alternative bulky spread is 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature; this is designed to always survive Adamant Skarmory's Hidden Power Ground while retaining the Speed for standard specially defensive Skarmory. However, if Magneton seeks to survive Forretress's Earthquake, it needs to use 252 HP / 84 Def / 156 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is a key component in physical offense teams by virtue of removing Skarmory, which is the premier physical wall in ADV OU. Physical attackers like Gyarados, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Flygon greatly benefit from the absence of Skarmory, while other threats like Metagross, Heracross, and Snorlax also appreciate the removal of Skarmory as a Spiker and phazer. On physical offense squads, Gyarados and Salamence often run a sweeper set with Dragon Dance, while Metagross can run a cleaner set with Agility, a luring set for Swampert with Hidden Power Grass, or a physically defensive set with Protect. Heracross uses Substitute + Salac Berry to sweep late-game, while Snorlax can run a lure set with Self-Destruct to get rid of a key wall or be a late-game sweeper with Curse + Rest. Physical offense tends to be weak against Gengar, so Pursuit Tyranitar, or sometimes Houndoom, is a nice fit; Pursuit support also enables Curse + Earthquake Snorlax as well as a niche Pokemon like Steelix. A bulky Water-type like Swampert or Suicune often rounds out the team by giving it a check to physical attackers.</p> <p>Magneton is also a cornerstone on defensive teams that aim to get rid of Skarmory and Forretress to contain Spikes. Since these teams are generally weak to Spikes, they always pack a spinner with Magneton to make sure the entry hazard pressure is totally negated. The most common spinners paired with Magneton are Claydol and Starmie; a less common one but still seen in OU is Donphan. A defensive Celebi with Leech Seed is a common sight on these teams, since it's a set that struggles with both Skarmory and Forretress, and Leech Seed synergizes well with Substitute Magneton. Milotic and Suicune are also very common on these teams, most often paired with Claydol to form a defensive core that is resilient to offensive pressure as well as entry hazards. A bulky Metagross with Protect can be an alternative defensive backbone for the team, especially when paired with a bulky Rapid Spin Starmie. These teams often rely on a bulky setup sweeper like Curse + Rest Snorlax or Calm Mind + Rest Suicune as the late-game sweeper; since they really hate Spikes and getting phazed by Skarmory when they go through Rest cycles, Magneton is a clear necessity on these teams. Pursuit support from Tyranitar and the rare Umbreon can facilitate the use of Rapid Spin, enable Donphan, and support CurseLax sets without Shadow Ball. A Ground-immune or Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Choice Band Salamence, Zapdos, or Moltres often rounds out the team.</p> <p>Magneton is also commonly seen paired with Skarmory, forming the popular Skarm-Mag core. Magneton not only can trap opposing Skarmory and Forretress, ensuring your Skarmory will win the Spikes war, but it can also trap opposing Magneton, saving your Skarmory from getting trapped. These teams often feature a sturdy special wall, like Blissey or Celebi, in combination with a powerful wallbreaker like Choice Band Salamence to provide offensive pressure paired with Spikes. Alternatively, a fast sweeper like Aerodactyl is used in combination with a soft Zapdos check like Venusaur or Jirachi to keep up offensive momentum. A physical wall like Swampert, Metagross, or Flygon rounds out the team, together with the ever present Tyranitar for sand support. Tyranitar can also provide Pursuit support for Flygon and Skarmory, which really hate Gengar. Additionally, Pursuit can be used to chip Forretress into Magneton's Hidden Power Fire KO range.</p> <p>Magneton is also featured on Baton Pass teams, since they are weak to being phazed by Skarmory's Whirlwind. Physical Baton Pass teams feature either Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi or Swords Dance + Baton Pass Ninjask, rarely both. The most common recipients of the boosts are Dragon Dance users like Salamence, Gyarados, and, less frequently, Tyranitar, as well as Agility Metagross and Substitute + Liechi Berry Aerodactyl; paired with Ninjask, slow sweepers like Marowak and Medicham are also common. Alternatively, specially based Baton Pass teams featuring Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi are sometimes seen with Magneton, as Skarmory would be able to safely switch on Celebi and phaze it, thus ruining the chain; additionally, these teams don't generally pack a spinner and therefore don't appreciate Skarmory setting multiple layers of Spikes.</p>"

Imprison is unorthodox and might work in rare circumstances, but it is recommended that you stay away from it until you've tried out more standard variants. Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless and set up a sweep for a Belly Drum user; Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Flamethrower and Thunderbolt are alternative options to hurt Skarmory, but their more powerful variants are generally superior. Rest--with or without Sleep Talk--extends Muk's lifespan; however, it provides Muk's counters with an easy switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types, particularly Jirachi, Skarmory, and Metagross, are immune to Sludge Bomb. They tend to take quite some damage from either Focus Punch or Fire Blast, but with Earthquake, or in Jirachi's case, Psychic, most of them should be able to best Muk one-on-one.</p> <p>Ground-types such as Claydol, Rhydon, Swampert, Donphan, and Golem can pick Muk off with STAB Earthquake; furthermore, they resist Sludge Bomb and pack enough Defense to shrug off most of Muk's other attacks. Focus Punch might hurt Rhydon and Golem, though, and the rarely-seen Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass can shut them down for good.</p> <p>As for Rock-types, Regirock also packs Earthquake while resisting Sludge Bomb and Explosion, and has such high Defense that it doesn't much care about Focus Punch. While Tyranitar can't take Fighting attacks, it resists Sludge Bomb and Fire moves, and often packs Earthquake.</p> <p>Suicune can take most of Muk's physical assaults, Roar away Curse boosts, Calm Mind up, then Surf Muk into oblivion. Gengar 4x resists Sludge Bomb and is immune to Explosion and any Fighting or Ground moves Muk might be packing, so unless Muk carries Hidden Power Ghost or a move such as Thunderbolt or Fire Blast, Gengar will beat it one-on-one, especially if Gengar carries Psychic. Weezing can cripple Muk with Will-O-Wisp unless it puts up a Substitute in time.</p>",

      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>Thanks to its low Speed, high HP, and great Attack, Muk is a fantastic user of the SubPunch strategy. Fire Blast hurts common Steel-type switch-ins, such as Metagross and Skarmory, while Hidden Power Ghost makes it one of the best Gengar counters in the game.</p> <p>The HP investment lets Muk make 101 HP Substitutes, and the Attack investment and choice of nature increase its power output. Muk needs a Special Attack stat of 182 to 2HKO Skarmory with Fire Blast or Thunder; a stat of 197 is needed if using their less powerful alternatives, Flame thrower orThunderbolt. Be sure to use a Speed-lowering nature instead of a Special Attack-hindering one if running one of these special moves.</p>"},
      "Curse": {"description": "<p>With great Special Defense and Attack, like Snorlax, Muk makes a decent Curse user. A Curse-boosted Explosion is powerful, but Rest lets it keep on tanking. Watch out for Psychic and Earthquake, however.</p> <p>Aside from Attack, this set should focus on Special Defense as Curse will make it bulkier on the physical side. Again, 182 Special Attack is needed to 2HKO Skarmory with Fire Blast or Thunder, and 197 to do so with Flamethrower or Thunderbolt.</p>"},

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster has a solid niche in ADV OU because it is a Spiker with unique traits. Being a Water-type means that it naturally matches up well against opposing Water-types by freely setting Spikes against the likes of Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic, and not being a Steel-type means that it isn't trapped by Magneton unlike Skarmory and Forretress. However, it misses out on the immunities to sand and Toxic that the Steel typing provides and the many useful resistances to common attacking types.</p> <p>Compared to the other Spikers in the tier, Cloyster is not only a better choice against Magneton but also a much more threatening attacker with its good Speed combined with the coverage of its STAB Water- and Ice-type attacks that can threaten most foes. Notably, it threatens a very common spinner in Claydol but fails to threaten another common one in Starmie. Additionally, its Explosion can be used to create a hole in the enemy team by severely damaging a wall, preventing the opponent from setting up with their sweeper, or ending the turn and giving your own sweeper a free opportunity to set up.</p> <p>Despite all this, Cloyster has many shortcomings that hold it back from seeing more usage as a Spiker in OU. First, it struggles to make progress against Rapid Spin Starmie; second, its Water / Ice typing sports many weaknesses to common attacking types such as Rock, Electric, and Grass and, paired with its low Special Defense, means it is threatened by the majority of the tier; third, it's easily worn down by residual damage because it lacks access to a recovery move and is weak to sand, Spikes, and Toxic, which is why it isn't seen much on teams that want to simply outlast the opposition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cloyster doesn't have a lot of other options, as its movepool is limited, and its niche in the metagame is very defined. Sometimes it can run a surprising Hidden Power in the third moveslot to catch certain threats off guard; for example, Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO Forretress, Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO Swampert, and Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Gyarados. Toxic can also replace Rapid Spin or Ice Beam to cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Jolteon; however, it does nothing against Steel-types, Gengar is immune to it, and Starmie shrugs it off with its ability Natural Cure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Cloyster's weakness to Thunderbolt combined with its awful Special Defense stat means that it is threatened by most special attackers in the tier. Zapdos and Jolteon outspeed it and threaten to OHKO it, and although Magneton can outspeed Cloyster only with a beneficial nature, it can switch in safely because it resists both Ice Beam and Explosion; however, it is worth noting that Surf can 2HKO non-bulky variants. Gengar is a very annoying offensive check because it can spinblock in addition to threatening Cloyster with its powerful special attacks. Offensive variants of Jirachi can also threaten Cloyster with Thunderbolt, Thunder, and Hidden Power Grass while resisting Ice Beam and Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Unfortunately, Cloyster is weak to every type of residual damage: sand, Spikes, and status. As Cloyster can't afford to run Rest, it can't shrug off Toxic, and, combined with Spikes and sand, this means its longevity is very poor.</p> <p><strong>Spinners</strong>: Despite Cloyster's very good matchup against Claydol, the other spinners are quite annoying to deal with. Forretress resists both Ice Beam and Explosion and is only 5HKOed by Surf, meaning it has plenty of time to use Rapid Spin but must be really careful of letting Gengar switch in for free. Starmie is the most difficult spinner for Cloyster to deal with; the defensive variants take little damage from both of Cloyster's STAB attacks and can regain health with Recover, as well as threatening a 2HKO in sand with Psychic, while the offensive variants can threaten Cloyster with a vicious Thunderbolt that can OHKO in sand. One can perform a risky pivot into an Electric-type or Gengar on a Rapid Spin; however, blowing up on Starmie with Explosion is occasionally reasonable, but keep in mind that Cloyster's teammates frequently lack the offensive prowess to punch through the opposing walls without the presence of Spikes on the field.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spiker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Cloyster can switch safely into bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic or physical threats like Snorlax and Flygon and proceed to set up Spikes for its teammates; then, it can explode for big damage and simultaneously let a sweeper come in at full health.</p> <p>Surf allows Cloyster to 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar and dent Steel-types. Rapid Spin can be very useful in situations when a Skarmory or Forretress is trying to set Spikes alongside you, giving you the option to deny theirs and keep yours up; due to its decent Speed, Cloyster can also switch in against slow threats to sacrifice itself in order to spin away three layers of Spikes in a situation where its team really needs it. However, keep in mind that Cloyster is not the world's best spinner, as it has poor longevity and is weak to Gengar, the only spinblocker in OU. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to 2HKO Zapdos and OHKO Flygon while hitting Celebi for meaningful damage.</p> <p>Coming off a nice base 95 Attack, Explosion does a lot of damage to every threat that doesn't resist it, even with no Attack investment and a hindering nature; this means that if Cloyster blows up on a predicted switch, it can trade with all its offensive checks except Gengar and Jirachi. Additionally, blowing up on a wall like Blissey, Snorlax, Celebi, or a bulky Water-type enables a follow-up threat to come in safely and set up for a sweep.</p> <p>Cloyster's high Speed investment allows it to set Spikes against the likes of Tyranitar and Metagross and outspeed slow Water-types like Swampert, Milotic, and most Suicune;  notably, this benchmark guarantees Cloyster to outspeed all variants of Tyranitar and Swampert. 72 HP and 244 Special Defense EVs allow Cloyster to always survive Timid Starmie's Thunderbolt outside of sand; this is crucial, as Starmie is Cloyster's best check. The Special Defense investment also means that Cloyster will survive two Hydro Pumps from maximum Special Attack Suicune and Swampert, while 8 Special Attack EVs are to always 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar with Surf.</p> <p>Keep in mind that Cloyster has poor longevity because of the lack of a recovery move combined with its weak defensive typing and weakness to Spikes, sand, and status. In fact, most of the time Cloyster won't have the opportunity to set all three layers of Spikes because it is so easily threatened by a large majority of the metagame; as such, Cloyster commonly sets up one layer of Spikes and explodes immediately after. However, Cloyster can be punished if it's too eager to blow up early-game when it is facing a team with a spinner; if Cloyster has exploded too early and the spinner manages to get a Rapid Spin off, Cloyster's partners will very much struggle to sweep without the necessary chip damage provided by Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster is featured on offensive teams that make use of the presence of Spikes and its fast Explosion enabling offensive setup; the games tend to be quick, as Cloyster has poor longevity and doesn't transition well in the long game.</p> <p>Since Cloyster's partners rely on Spikes chip damage to boost their offensive prowess, it is natural to team up with a spinblocker to prevent opposing spinners from ruining your day; therefore, Gengar, the only spinblocker in OU, is an excellent addition to every Cloyster team. The most common set that Gengar runs on Cloyster teams is Explosion + three attacks; this set has three coverage moves to hurt most of the metagame with Spikes up, as well as having the option to lure in and blow up a special wall like Blissey to clear the way for special sweepers like Jolteon and Starmie. Alternatively, Hypnosis or Will-O-Wisp + Taunt can force a Natural Cure Pokemon to keep switching out, taking even more Spikes damage as a result.</p> <p>Fast sweepers like Jolteon, offensive Starmie, and Aerodactyl fit well on Cloyster's Spikes teams because they can clean up late-game once their grounded checks have been weakened from Spikes; additionally, the momentum generated by Cloyster getting a quick layer and then exploding is very well exploited by Speed-boosting sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, and even Agility mixed Zapdos. Jolteon, Zapdos, and Moltres can wear down opposing special walls with Roar and rack up Spikes damage on the entire enemy team; alternatively, Jolteon and Zapdos can use Baton Pass to generate momentum by letting a powerful wallbreaker like Metagross or Tyranitar get in safely, and Jolteon can also act as a pseudo special check thanks to Volt Absorb. Offensive Starmie cannot phaze or generate momentum with Baton Pass, but if the opposing special wall has been weakened or removed it is one of the most threatening sweepers in the game with Spikes up due to the combination of its flawless coverage, speed, and power.</p> <p>Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Tyranitar are popular late-game cleaners on this archetype; they love the chip damage on Swampert and Metagross and the dissuading of easy switches that Cloyster's Spikes provide. Additionally, Explosion on the right target can give Tyranitar the crucial setup turn. Due to its amazing Speed, Aerodactyl can also act as a revenge killer and defensive insurance against opposing sweepers like Super Celebi, Super Jirachi, and offensive Starmie.</p> <p>Cloyster pairs well with mixed attackers and wallbreakers like mixed Salamence, mixed Metagross, mixed Tyranitar, and mixed Swampert; all these threats benefit greatly from Spikes making it even harder for the opponent to pivot around their coverage. Mixed Tyranitar deserves a special mention, as it is a great lead that can set sand, which is crucial to chip opposing walls like Celebi, Suicune, Milotic, Blissey, and Snorlax. Additionally, Explosion users such as Metagross, Snorlax, Gengar, Claydol, Weezing, and Regice fit nicely with Cloyster alongside a last Pokemon sweeper like Calm Mind Suicune.</p> <p>Cloyster is sometimes featured on more conventional TSS (Toxic, Sandstorm, Spikes) builds because it's a Spiker that is not trapped by Magneton; to make up for its frailty and lack of a recovery move it is often paired with a Wish user such as Blissey or Jirachi, but remember that poison still ruins it. Pursuit Tyranitar is sometimes used to trap Gengar, allowing Cloyster to be a more reliable spinner.</p>"

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>Marowak is a hard hitter, but its lack of recovery can be a serious pain. The fact that Marowak does not have to set up to hit hard is a notable feature; with maximum investment and an Adamant nature, it can reach an Attack stat of 568. It is a great sweeper, but that's about it. The fact that it gets Sing also gives it some versatility, but sweeping is your best bet with such a Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Belly Drum raises Marowak's Attack to such a high level that it will KO anything in the game not named Skarmory, but Marowak is too slow and fragile to set it up. It also desperately needs Thick Club, which leaves it no place for a Salac Berry. Perish Song can force switches but doesn't help against any notable threats; nonetheless, Bonemerang + Perish Song can ruin Baton Pass teams. Hidden Power Bug is another option to hit Grass-types in general and Celebi in particular, but Double-Edge does plenty to those.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Several Pokemon can come in on Marowak's main attacks, but most of them cannot stay in for long if they are slower and are hit hard on the switch. Weezing is easily the best counter but needs to watch out for boosted Double-Edge, while Celebi is a counter if it comes in on a move it resists. Ludicolo can come in more effectively because of its dual typing, but it is still susceptible to Marowak's strong hits. Skarmory is also tough, but a Marowak user with good prediction can still take it down. Claydol can come in on a couple of attacks as well, but it too needs to watch out for boosted Double-Edge and Hidden Power Bug.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Bonemerang is an option to let Marowak defeat Substitute Pokemon and thwart Focus Punch users; it also enables Marowak to take on Substitute Raikou as a last resort, as Marowak can survive even Modest Raikou's Hidden Power. Specifically, with 252 HP EVs and 12 Special Defense EVs, Marowak will survive Modest Raikou's Calm Mind-boosted Hidden Power. However, note that Bonemerang's subpar accuracy can hurt a sweep.</p> <p>With 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Marowak outspeeds most Water-types, such as the occasional uninvested Suicune, as well as almost all Milotic. Another plus is the ability to outpace both Skarmory and Weezing. However, the difference in power might mean the difference between KOing a foe and being KOed itself. With an Adamant nature and Thick Club, Marowak hits a stat of 568 Attack, which lets it 2HKO 252/252+ Milotic and 252/252+ Swampert, as well as 2HKO or 3HKO 252/252+ Suicune, with an unboosted Earthquake. Regardless of which nature you use, however, Marowak should always run maximum Attack.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {"description": "<p>Thick Club gives Marowak the power of a Choice Band user, along with the ability to switch moves. Nonetheless, it needs good prediction to be effective. Focus Punch dents Skarmory on the switch, while Sing--which is an XD move--can put it or any other physical wall out of commission. Adamant is the recommended nature as this Marowak does not aim to set up, so Speed isn't as much of an issue as prediction is.</p> <p>Maximum HP lets Marowak better wall Dragon Dance Tyranitar and stop Tyraniboah, but Marowak can only take so many predicted Crunches before going down. This is probably the spread you should use with paralysis support, or if you plan on passing Marowak some Speed.</p>"}

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon is hard to use, but can prove effective. While it does have several glaring weaknesses, it also possesses awesome attacking potential and crucial resistances to Normal, Rock, and Flying. It does a great job at countering Normal-types and can work around Skarmory and Weezing; it's even immune to Thunder Wave. However, it has trouble against the common bulky Water-types. Rhydon greatly appreciates paralysis support from the likes of Body Slam Snorlax and Thunder Wave Blissey, as this allows the Choice Band set to stay in and 2HKO the Water-types that can otherwise take it out, and enables the Substitute variant to fish for full paralysis and set up safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar works against Snorlax to an extent, as does Curse, but Swords Dance is preferred as Rhydon's typing is so poor defensively that it needs to take down opponents as quickly as it can. Counter is great against users of Fighting- and Ground-type moves as Rhydon can usually survive at least one of these. However, this strategy won't work against opponents that play it safe and switch to a special attacker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert are probably the best counters to Rhydon. If it doesn't have Megahorn, Celebi and Claydol trump it. Weezing and Skarmory also do well in general. Prediction is your best bet, as Rhydon can do more than 40% to any Pokemon. However, conversely, Rhydon is easily taken down by any special attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>While hard to use, this Rhydon has the potential to be amazing. With accurate prediction, it will do a lot of damage.

Hidden Power Rock can reliably take down Flying-types; it actually does more damage on average than either Rock Blast or Rock Slide do. Furthermore, Rhydon can't take much advantage of Rock Slide's flinch chance due to its low Speed; it doesn't even much mind being phazed out by Skarmory, so even that benefit is lost.</p> <p>Choice Band is a good item for Rhydon because most of its switch-ins are Pokemon such as Suicune and Zapdos, who are faster and can easily OHKO it. Rhydon therefore often plays as a hit-and-run Pokemon, so it rarely notices the locking effect of the Choice Band.</p>"},

Megahorn destroys Claydol and Celebi, but Swords Dance boosts Rock Slide to the point where it 2HKOes Skarmory.</p>"}

  },
  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie is a formidable late-game threat and a reliable Rapid Spin user thanks to its blazing Speed, powerful Hydro Pump, and useful coverage. The only common threats that can outspeed it are Jolly Dugtrio, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Starmie's presence forces faster-paced teams to carry revenge killers or checks that can withstand two hits, while slower teams are forced on the back foot as Starmie removes their Spikes on a forced switch to a passive special wall. This cements Starmie's placement on Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams as a spinner and late-game cleaner.</p> <p>Thanks to Recover and Natural Cure, Starmie can also run a bulky Rapid Spin set to repeatedly remove Spikes throughout the game. Starmie's main competitors as a spinner -- Claydol and Forretress -- struggle against status, residual damage, and Skarmory, although Starmie still dislikes Toxic. A bulky Starmie can also check common Pokemon such as offensive Swampert, Metagross, Cloyster, Breloom, Moltres, and Charizard. Additionally, Starmie can pair with other Natural Cure users like Blissey and Celebi to absorb status, pressuring status-reliant walls like Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey.</p> <p>Starmie is held back by its inability to play offense and defense simultaneously. Offensive variants cannot switch directly into attacks; are easily revenge killed by Aerodactyl and Jolly Dugtrio; must land the imperfectly accurate Hydro Pump against dangerous foes such as Magneton, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Swampert; and struggle to muscle through defensive answers such as Snorlax, Celebi, Jirachi, and especially Blissey without sand and Spikes. On the other hand, defensive Starmie is quite passive and setup fodder for Pokemon such as Celebi, Snorlax, Suicune, Heracross, Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, and Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados. Starmie's bulk and defensive typing are poor, forcing even bulky variants to use Recover often, and it is easily put into KO range of Pursuit Tyranitar’s Crunch and Cloyster’s Explosion through chip damage like sand and Spikes. Starmie's competition as a spinner in Claydol and Forretress have much higher bulk and utility; both are immune to sand and Claydol is immune to Spikes. Starmie is also vulnerable to mind games against teams with Gengar and Toxic + Protect Skarmory, which can spinblock while Toxic wears it down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Starmie has other niche options for its last moveslot. Hidden Power Grass guarantees a 2HKO on Swampert without having to use Hydro Pump while also hitting the rare Lanturn. Surf can be run alongside Hydro Pump to accurately hit Pokemon that will KO Starmie if Hydro Pump misses, such as weakened Metagross, Magneton, or Aerodactyl. Thunder over Thunderbolt can be used to hit Skarmory much harder and 2HKO Milotic in sand, which will otherwise stall out Starmie with Toxic and Recover, but beware of its low accuracy. It also generally hits Electric-weak threats like Skarmory much harder than Thunderbolt. On the defensive set, the most prominent alternative option is Toxic. Its forced damage is sometimes more valuable than Thunder Wave, helping beat Swampert more easily and eventually forcing Blissey out. However, Skarmory, Gengar, and Forretress are immune to it, making Toxic Starmie worse as a spinner. Starmie also has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, which can assist teammates and let it withstand Explosion or Pursuit from Tyranitar. However, Starmie can only fit one screen without getting too passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Even offensive Starmie will make little progress against special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, defensive Jirachi, specially defensive Celebi, and even Regice and Registeel. Blissey is the best Starmie counter. Snorlax and Regice are less bulky but can take multiple hits and respond with powerful attacks. Jirachi and Celebi can heal and 2HKO back with Electric-type coverage or Hidden Power Grass. However, Celebi needs to be careful, as Ice Beam forces repeated Recover uses. Registeel takes little damage from anything Starmie can do. While these Pokemon wall the defensive set easily, they allow Starmie to spin for free, while some such as Blissey and Registeel are quite passive and invite in dangerous physical Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, and Fighting-types.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon, Zapdos, Lanturn, and Raikou can tank a hit from offensive Starmie and easily remove both variants with Thunderbolt. Jolteon outspeeds all Starmie variants, whereas Raikou can Speed tie with Starmie. Both are bulky enough to take one hit after three Spikes layers, while Raikou can sometimes take Hydro Pump twice from full HP. Lanturn easily takes on Starmie's coverage. Zapdos is the only prominent Starmie check immune to Spikes, but it can't outspeed offensive Starmie; bulky sets can take Ice Beam twice, while offensive sets can take any attack once and remove Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Offensive Starmie's damage output often makes switching in quite hard, but upon sacrificing a Pokemon, a healthy or faster check can switch in and remove Starmie. Jolly Dugtrio and Aerodactyl only need a small amount of chip damage to remove Starmie without bulk investment, whereas Swampert and Metagross can survive Hydro Pump at reasonable health and hit hard in return. In desperate situations, maximum HP Tyranitar can take Timid offensive Starmie's Hydro Pump and hit hard with Hidden Power Bug or OHKO back with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gengar and Dusclops can spinblock Starmie. Gengar can also hit Starmie hard with Thunderbolt, OHKOing offensive Starmie if Gengar has significant Special Attack investment. However, both Starmie sets can greatly threaten Gengar; if Gengar switches in on anything but Rapid Spin, it will be KOed by the ensuing Hydro Pump or Psychic from offensive Starmie, whereas the defensive set can cripple it with Thunder Wave or hit it with Psychic. Dusclops is rare but is much bulkier than Gengar, not weak to Psychic, and able to retaliate with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup Pokemon that can shrug off status and Surf can use defensive Starmie as setup fodder. Examples include Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, Curse Snorlax, Taunt or Rest + Dragon Dance Gyarados if Starmie lacks Thunderbolt, and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi. These Pokemon, especially Calm Mind Jirachi, Curse Snorlax, and Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune, often heavily threaten teams Starmie finds itself on.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Checks</strong>: Defensive Starmie can do little damage to bulky Water answers such as Milotic and Celebi and is completely walled by Vaporeon. Against offensive Starmie, these checks can bait out a weaker coverage move like Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to switch into a teammate that can't take Hydro Pump twice.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar can KO defensive Starmie after some damage and is commonly found on teams with Forretress lacking Hidden Power Bug, but it is 2HKOed by Surf and takes heavy damage from offensive Starmie's Hydro Pump. Umbreon can more reliably Pursuit trap Starmie thanks to its high special bulk and Toxic, but it cannot KO a healthy Starmie with Pursuit. It is also exploited by much of the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross can easily OHKO Starmie and only needs a small amount of bulk to take any Psychic. Heracross can also set up Substitute and Swords Dance on defensive Starmie, while Guts Heracross does not mind taking Thunder Wave to become even more powerful.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a must despite its unreliability, as it can potentially OHKO Claydol, can OHKO Tyranitar that don't invest heavily in bulk, has a chance to 2HKO Forretress, and always 2HKOes Gengar. With Spikes, Starmie becomes even harder to check, wearing down defensive Jirachi; threatening a 2HKO on Metagross and a 3HKO on Snorlax; and guaranteeing an OHKO on Tyranitar. Ice Beam hits Salamence, Zapdos, and Venusaur hard while forcing Celebi to repeatedly use Recover, whereas Thunderbolt nails Skarmory and Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, Gyarados, Vaporeon, and opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie has multiple options for its last move. Rapid Spin works as an emergency removal for Spikes on a forced switch. It is also quite effective in faster paced games such as those against Jolteon Spikes, as Starmie only needs to spin once. Since this Starmie is offensive, do not expect it to spin multiple times. Additionally, it can't afford to be spinblocked, as Gengar will take Hydro Pump and potentially KO back with Thunderbolt. Psychic is a nice option for Gengar and Venusaur as well as Fighting-types such as Heracross, Hariyama, and Breloom. Specifically, it can KO specially bulky Gengar with some prior damage and gives Starmie reason to switch into Gengar's Ice Punch, Taunt, or Will-O-Wisp. It also lets Starmie threaten an OHKO on Breloom and chipped Heracross without bulk investment and a 2HKO on bulky Heracross and Hariyama. Recover negates chip damage if the team already has a spinner or does not value Psychic's coverage. It allows Starmie to absorb status with Natural Cure and repeatedly force out Moltres, mixed Salamence, and Charizard. Starmie can also drop one of its coverage moves to run both Recover and Rapid Spin to give it more reliability as a spinner. It switches into Blissey early-game, as it doesn't give up momentum and shrugs off Blissey's attacks barring Thunderbolt. Offensive Starmie almost always have maximum Speed to outpace everything up to Salac Berry-boosted Swampert. Starmie can run a Modest nature to OHKO maximum HP Tyranitar and more likely 2HKO Skarmory. This is often done if using Starmie without Spikes or alongside support for removing Gengar.</p> <p>Starmie should be brought in only at opportune moments such as predicted switches, when a Pokemon faints, or resisted moves from something it threatens out, like Moltres, Gengar, or Claydol. Beware of trying to use it to check Skarmory and Forretress early-game, especially if Skarmory has Toxic and Protect or Forretress has Hidden Power Bug; this often leads to a situation where one layer of Spikes is still up and Starmie is too low on HP to perform properly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie needs specific support to cleave through teams. First and foremost, Tyranitar's sand helps make residual damage stick for easier sweeping, and Starmie can threaten out sand-immune Rock- and Ground-types with Hydro Pump and 2HKO most Steel-types bar defensive Jirachi and Registeel. Tyranitar is also a fantastic switch-in to Blissey, Snorlax, and defensive Jirachi without Hidden Power Fighting or Toxic. It can also use Focus Punch on Swampert and Metagross, weakening them for Starmie's Hydro Pump. Other strong attackers can fill this niche as well, such as Metagross, Focus Punch Swampert, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Another way to use Starmie is to control the Spikes game: keep up more Spikes than the opponent. Good Spikes users include Skarmory and Forretress, although Cloyster and Smeargle are niche options for faster paced teams. Skarmory is the most common choice thanks to its defensive utility. Gengar is also nice on these teams, as it is the best spinblocker and can help remove special walls with Explosion or use Taunt + Will-O-Wisp to prevent them from healing. Another option to keep the Spikes advantage is to use Claydol alongside Starmie, which frees Starmie up to run Psychic or Recover, provides a Rock resistance, and threatens special walls with Explosion. Due to Starmie's defensive liabilities, it commonly prefers defensive teammates on Spikes teams, such as strong special walls like Blissey and Jirachi and good physical walls such as Swampert, defensive Metagross, and Flygon. These options often make up the core of common Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams alongside Tyranitar, Gengar, and Skarmory.</p> <p>To further support Starmie, Explosion users like Gengar, Weezing, and Regice can lure in Blissey and often weaken it enough so that Dugtrio or residual damage can finish it off. Even without Explosion, Dugtrio is a fantastic partner with a good Blissey lure like Baton Pass Zapdos; Beat Up Dugtrio can easily remove it, defensive Jirachi, and Celebi. Additionally, other staples of special offense such as Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, offensive Swampert, mixed Metagross, Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar weaken special checks for a Starmie sweep. Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is particularly synergetic, as it can pass Calm Mind to Starmie to more easily muscle past its checks.</p> <p>Strong Fighting-types like Hariyama, Heracross, Breloom, Machamp, and Medicham are especially good alongside Starmie, as they help punch through bulky Normal-types like Blissey and Snorlax. They work especially well alongside Recover + Rapid Spin Starmie, as they can repeatedly fire off Focus Punch into Toxic + Protect Skarmory, while Starmie beats Drill Peck versions. Starmie is also a nice check to Salamence, a common Fighting answer.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Starmie is one of OU's three consistent spinners and checks many dangerous threats with its speed, Recover, and Water / Psychic typing.</p> <p>With maximum HP investment and Recover, Starmie is bulky enough to repeatedly remove Spikes. Running 40 Special Attack EVs guarantees a 2HKO on maximum HP Tyranitar with Surf, while 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature beat Gengar, only falling short of opposing Starmie, Salac Berry-boosted Swampert, and Raikou. In the last moveslot, Starmie has several options. The most prominent of these is Thunder Wave; Thunder Wave paralyzes dangerous setup threats not bothered by Starmie's weak Surf, like Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Gyarados without Taunt, and Calm Mind Jirachi. It also cripples bulky Pokemon like Toxic + Protect Skarmory and slows down Speed-reliant Pokemon like Zapdos and Gengar, making them easier to revenge kill if they KO Starmie and weaker in general. For other options, Psychic is fantastic against Gengar trying to spinblock and Fighting-types. Thunderbolt assists Starmie against Gyarados, Cloyster, and Skarmory. Ice Beam allows Starmie to be a strong Salamence, Flygon, and Breloom answer while being less passive against Zapdos and defensive Celebi. The best coverage choice generally depends on the team's major weaknesses, whereas Thunder Wave is the best for general purposes.</p> <p>Defensive Starmie generally competes with Claydol, as Forretress typically requires Pursuit support to handle Gengar. In comparison to Claydol, Starmie is easily chipped by sand and Spikes, lacks a Rock resistance, cannot directly remove threats such as Celebi, Suicune, and Salamence with Explosion, and struggles against Toxic Skarmory without Refresh. On the other hand, Starmie has good speed control, stronger coverage, Natural Cure, and Recover while beating all non-Toxic variants of Skarmory. These traits allow Starmie to survive throughout the game and even PP stall with its large amount of PP. Since Starmie is easily chipped by sand and Spikes, it is very vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar. Starmie isn't especially bulky either, often being forced into Recover loops against the various threats it checks with some chip damage, making it harder to spin should it be too cavalier with its health early-game.</p> <p>Starmie can run 32 Special Defense EVs to avoid an OHKO after sand damage from Pursuit Tyranitar. Additionally, Starmie can forgo the extra Special Attack EVs for maximum Speed investment to outrun Salac Berry-boosted Endeavor Swampert instead of spamming Recover as it uses Endeavor. Starmie can also run considerably less Speed depending on the team's needs, such as 176 Speed EVs to outrun Adamant Dugtrio; 136 Speed EVs for Salamence, Zapdos, and Charizard; 56 Speed EVs for Moltres; or even a Bold nature with heavy Defense investment to better check physical Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, and Aerodactyl. Starmie should run a minimum of 16 Speed EVs to outspeed Pokemon like Heracross and Suicune. How Starmie is played changes with different Speed investment; slower Starmie sets often are played similarly to Milotic, whereas faster Starmie sets are better against Spikes teams due to outspeeding Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Starmie typically fits on balanced teams that need Spikes removal and can afford its passivity. Due to Starmie's ability to defeat Spikes users other than Toxic + Protect Skarmory and Hidden Power Bug Forretress, Starmie teams typically beat Skarmory down with threats such as mixed Tyranitar and Salamence with Fire Blast instead of using Magneton. However, to afford Starmie's passivity, it commonly needs to be paired with strong physical and special switch-ins. Physically defensive Metagross with Protect can handle Snorlax and most Jirachi while generally tanking boosted threats such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, whereas Blissey or specially defensive Celebi deals with Suicune along with forming status pivots with Starmie for stalling out Milotic and defensive Jirachi. Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Gengar once Starmie has paralyzed it. Balanced teams struggle with Heracross and commonly carry Salamence or Gengar to switch into Megahorn. Starmie also fits well alongside Fighting-types like Medicham and especially well with those with Guts such as Hariyama, Heracross, and Machamp, as they can beat Toxic + Protect Skarmory and repeatedly fire off Focus Punch for free because such Skarmory will typically lack Drill Peck.</p> <p>Starmie can also pair with general Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes teammates such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Gengar, Blissey, and Skarmory; however, make sure that the team isn't too passive due to lacking a strong cleaner. These types of teams sometimes run Dugtrio for removing foes weakened by Spikes in longer games and prominent Starmie answers such as Calm Mind Celebi, Pursuit Tyranitar, and even paralyzed Blissey and Jirachi. Dugtrio can also trap Heracross, the one Fighting-type Starmie struggles against, and Starmie deals with Pokemon immune to Ground for Dugtrio such as Salamence, Gyarados, Charizard, and Moltres.</p> <p>As a niche option, defensive Starmie can work on paralysis focused teams with Pokemon such as Porygon2, defensive Jirachi, Thunder Wave Zapdos, and Snorlax. These types of teams commonly struggle with Spikes and benefit from the unique array of Pokemon Starmie can check, such as Moltres, Charizard, Swampert, and Metagross. However, Starmie should not be the only check to these Pokemon, as it can be easily overwhelmed. Still, this allows them to use more offensive lures to Skarmory, such as Choice Band Metagross and Guts Hariyama, Heracross, and Machamp. In addition, slow and powerful Pokemon such as Marowak, Substitute Tyranitar, Curse Swampert, and Rhydon fit well here. Marowak is especially nice, as it can provide a passable Rock resistance while heavily threatening most of the metagame.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced many years ago. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current ADV OU metagame. The first set, however, has aged well.</p> <hr /> <p>Jynx can really damage a team, but can't switch into anything or take any sort of hit; it is the definition of a glass cannon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can hurt Metagross and Jirachi, do a little more to Regice, and also screw up the uncommon Scizor and Registeel switch-ins. Jynx can also learn cool support moves, such as Wish, Reflect and Light Screen, but many other Pokemon are more durable and are much more effective in a support role. There's nothing noteworthy in the rest of Jynx's movepool: it learns a few physical moves, but it does not have the Attack stat to use them effectively; this would also require taking EVs out of Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metagross and Jirachi resist Ice Beam and Psychic, and have high defensive stats to take a few hits. Sleep Talk Metagross is particularly threatening, while Jirachi can set up with Calm Mind alongside Jynx. Houndoom's Early Bird makes Lovely Kiss hard to use; it also resists Ice Beam, is immune to Psychic, and can decimate Jynx with both STAB Flamethrower and Pursuit. Blissey takes very little from anything Jynx can do, but will just be setup bait unless something else has already been put to sleep. Snorlax has Thick Fat and often runs a Sleep Talk set, which really screws over Jynx. Registeel and Regice take little from Jynx's Ice Beam, but without Psych Up, Seismic Toss, or Earthquake, Regice can't beat Calm Mind Jynx.</p>",

If you tried dual coverage, such as Psychic over Substitute, Pokemon that wake up unexpectedly early can hit Jynx with a strong physical attack. With a Substitute, though, after the opponent wakes up and breaks the Substitute, Jynx will have the next turn to safely try and put them back to sleep.

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Electabuzz has very good stats and an excellent movepool to boot. In addition to being a top-notch UU Pokemon, it is also a definite Skarmory / Blissey counter, and can certainly be used effectively in the OU metagame. However, be careful not to let it take too many hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Barrier could help Electabuzz survive a little longer, or even live a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is an awesome move; steal Leftovers from the most annoying stall Pokemon you can find, and laugh.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Few things can really safely switch into Electabuzz without the risk of getting hit by a super effective move. However, it often doesn't hit hard enough. Raikou is probably your best bet, Celebi is also able to Recover off damage from any of Electabuzz's super effective attacks, and Blissey and Snorlax will wreck havoc barring Cross Chop. Dugtrio can easily come in and KO it as Electabuzz has a very small chance to OHKO it even with a Modest Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set works rather well as it requires no setup. With Electabuzz's bad Defense, it functions much like a Choice Band Pokemon: just hit and run. It can switch it in on almost anything, even Blissey, with the exception of Earthquake.</p> <p>Cross Chop is recommended over Focus Punch as two hits do more damage than one Focus Punch. If Focus Punch comes just short of killing the foe, Electabuzz will be forced to switch out for fear of Earthquake from Tyranitar, Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss from Blissey, or anything from Snorlax. If running Cross Chop, however, Electabuzz will be able to hit the opponent once as it switches in, and then immediately deal the finishing blow. Cross Chop's high critical hit rate might also prove handy against the likes of Snorlax, who is 2HKOed by Cross Chop if one of them is a critical hit.</p> <p>Electabuzz should run at least 216 EVs to reach 300 Speed minimum, or 108 EVs and a Speed-boosting nature. With more investment and a Speed-boosting nature, Electabuzz can also outpace neutral-natured Gengar, but this is largely unnecessary.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>Thunderbolt is Electabuzz's most consistent move. Aside from that, it can pull off the SubPunch strategy: set up a Substitute on a foe that will likely switch out--such as any slow Water-type that isn't Milotic or Suicune--and then Focus Punch anything that resists Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis, which works well alongside Substitute to scout for full paralysis. Alternatively, Electabuzz can run a special attack for additional type coverage; Fire Punch and Ice Punch both dent Grass-types that can mess it up. Ice Punch has the advantage of hitting Grounds, but Fire Punch stops Steelix from ruining Electabuzz's fun.</p>"},
      "Support": {"description": "<p>Thunderbolt is mandatory for reliable, powerful STAB. Next, pick a status of your choice, set up a Light Screen, and either switch out to the Pokemon that needs to Light Screen or stay in and Counter the incoming physical attacker. A Bold nature helps Electabuzz survive attacks for Counter. Note never to try and Counter a STAB or Choice Band Earthquake; Electabuzz will die. You could use a Focus Band for this if you want, but don't.</p> <p>Again, 216 Speed EVs let Electabuzz hit a Speed stat of 300. This Electabuzz should run an Attack-hindering nature as it isn't going mixed. A Speed-boosting nature is an option to let Electabuzz outrun neutral-natured Gengar.</p>"}

  "Magmar": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written well over a decade ago. The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Magmar is inferior to Typhlosion in almost every way; its only advantages are some fairly useless moves in Barrier, Cross Chop, and Confuse Ray. While it is a good option for a UU team, don't expect it to achieve much of anything in OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief and Toxic can slow down Water-types. Sunny Day also helps Magmar against the aforementioned Water-types, but is not really worth a moveslot as most Water-types still beat it without Solar Beam. The combination of Barrier + Counter can be used to surprise and KO Pokemon with Earthquake; such variants should invest heavily in HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune, Starmie, and Milotic, are its main counters. Swampert is problematic if Magmar lacks Hidden Power Grass, Gyarados if it forgoes Thunder Punch, and Salamence and Flygon if it does not go with Hidden Power Ice.</p>",
    "sets": {"Mixed Sweeper": {"description": "<p>Cross Chop will only 2HKO Blissey and Snorlax if it lands a critical hit or is backed up with lots of Spikes support, but it can at least negate Curse boosts and finish off weakened ones.</p> <p>The recommended spread beats out Adamant Heracross, but if running Hidden Power Ice, use 204 Speed EVs and a Hasty nature to outspeed Salamence. Good Speed numbers to hit are 270 and 300. Aside from this, maximize Special Attack, then put the rest into Attack to power up Cross Chop or Focus Punch.</p>"}}
  },
  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>Although not as devastating as it was in RBY, Tauros is still a threat to be reckoned with in ADV. With a good Attack stat and a great Speed stat, Tauros functions extremely well as a late-game cleaner on offensive teams. Intimidate, an excellent ability on any sweeper, gives Tauros more opportunities to switch in and ravage the opponent's teams. Unfortunately, Tauros's pros end here. Skarmory and Forretress, both common Pokemon in ADV, completely wall Tauros and can set up entry hazards while taking little damage from any of its moves. Additionally, Tauros has a shallow physical movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power to get past most of its checks. Don't let these faults deter you from using Tauros though, as it can easily sweep through teams once Skarmory and Forretress are eliminated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Tauros doesn't have much of a movepool it can make use of. Iron Tail can be used for Gengar and Tyranitar, while simultaneously giving you a weapon against Aerodactyl, but the 75% accuracy is almost never worth it. Sleep Talk can make Tauros a makeshift sleep absorber. This can be particularly helpful on more offensive teams that will commonly lack a more reliable sleep absorber or cleric. A Substitute set with Leftovers could work, but Tauros is better off with Choice Band. As Tauros's physical movepool is so mediocre, it should just stick with the moves mentioned on the set. Body Slam is useful for paralyzing opponents, but Tauros doesn't really need the paralysis support as it's so fast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned before, Forretress and Skarmory are the most common and best checks to Tauros; they take little damage from Tauros's moves bar Fire Blast and can set up Spikes to give their team the upper hand. Jirachi and Metagross can switch in on a predicted Return and proceed to hit back with Fire Punch and Meteor Mash, respectively. Although uncommon, Regirock and Registeel take little from Return, and can set up with Curse and proceed to do a number to your opponent's team. Dusclops, a staple on many stall teams, takes little damage from any of Tauros's moves bar Hidden Power Ghost, and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>If you lack Skarmory or Forretress, it's important to switch in your Pokemon that resist Normal moves on Return and try to defeat Tauros that way. Although Tauros is somewhat bulky, it can still be revenge killed by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, Gengar, and even Alakazam. Tauros is a dangerous and underrated threat so you need to perform well in order to bring it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>If you're looking for an excellent late-game cleaner, look no further; Tauros runs through unprepared teams with little effort, and even prepared teams still have difficulties with it. Thanks to its base 100 Attack stat and the Choice Band boost, Tauros's STAB Return is sure to dent anything that doesn't resist it. Double-Edge serves as an alternative to Return; it hits significantly harder, but causes recoil damage. Earthquake is the secondary move of choice as it allows Tauros to combat the likes of Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi, who all do not fear STAB Return or Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar, one of the most common and powerful Pokemon in ADV, for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EV spread is rather simple; maximize Attack to make Tauros hit as hard as possible and maximize Speed to ensure Tauros can outpace as many Pokemon as possible. Choice Band is easily the best option for Tauros as it hits incredibly hard with the aforementioned item. An Adamant nature is a viable alternative to a Jolly one as Tauros already outspeeds most of the ADV metagame.</p> <p>Tauros's best teammates are Pokemon that can eliminate the likes of Forretress and Skarmory. Magneton is easily Tauros's best partner as it can not only prevent Skarmory and Forretress from switching out, but also OHKO them with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Snorlax and Salamence with Fire Blast and Metagross with Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Fire can surprise the aforementioned Steel-types, who might expect a boosting move or a resisted STAB move.</p> <p>Other good partners are physical attackers that can break through the defenses of Forretress and Skarmory. Choice Band Medicham can 2HKO the aforementioned Steel-types with a little bit of prior damage, which might enable Tauros to sweep later in the game. Choice Band Slaking with Focus Punch also works similarly to Medicham by breaking through Steel-types with relative ease. Additionally, powerful special attackers, such as Zapdos and Jirachi, also make quick work of Forretress and Skarmory with Thunderbolt and Fire Punch, respectively.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is a Pokemon with decent bulk that can function as both an early-game pivot with Intimidate and a late-game threat with Dragon Dance. Unlike other physical sweepers such as Tyranitar and Salamence, it has both an immunity to Ground-type attacks and doesn't have much trouble with bulky Water-types. It can also destroy defensive Pokemon one-on-one with Rest.</p> <p>However, it is countered by Zapdos, and its Attack stat can be underwhelming, preventing it from OHKOing bulky Gengar, Metagross, and Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome because it needs different Hidden Power types to hit Aerodactyl and Celebi and Taunt to prevent status and phazers from ruining its sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used against Pokemon such as Refresh Swampert, Milotic, Forretress, Claydol, Metagross, and Snorlax to block status, exploit the inaccuracy of moves such as Rock Slide, and scouts Explosion. Hidden Power Ghost lets Gyarados OHKO bulky Gengar and offensive Starmie after one Dragon Dance, but Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Rock is generally preferred. Choice Band can be considered, though such a set is generally outclassed by Choice Band Salamence because Salamence has Rock Slide for Zapdos and Aerodactyl, Brick Break for Tyranitar and Blissey, and a better Speed stat to outspeed Suicune, Moltres, Heracross, and Venusaur. Don't be tempted to use a special set to surprise usual Gyarados counters, as it is far too weak and is outclassed by other special attackers such as Starmie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos is the best counter because it resists Hidden Power Flying, is immune to Earthquake, and OHKOes Gyarados with Thunderbolt. It can also use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis against Gyarados teams and Agility to use Gyarados as setup fodder. Although Rest Gyarados tanks Thunderbolt from bulky Gengar and 2HKOes it with +1 Hidden Power Flying, bulky Gengar tanks +1 Hidden Power Flying from standard Gyarados and strikes back with Thunderbolt or Explosion. It can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Gyarados teams. Physical Salamence can outspeed Gyarados and set up with Dragon Dance or use Rock Slide. Aerodactyl and Jolteon are faster than Adamant Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance boost and revenge kill it with their STAB moves. However, these Pokemon don't enjoy taking Thunder Wave from Gyarados.</p> <p>Skarmory beats Gyarados one-on-one with Drill Peck. If Gyarados lacks Taunt or Rest, Toxic and phazing moves, especially from Swampert, will prevent it from sweeping. Porygon2 shrugs off Gyarados's attacks with ease and threatens it with an Electric-type move and status. Starmie and Regice also survive Gyarados's attacks to counter with decently powerful Electric-type moves or Thunder Wave; however, with investment in special bulk, Gyarados tanks Thunderbolt from offensive Starmie and 2HKOes it with +1 Hidden Power Flying. Thanks to Taunt or Rest, it can also shrug off Thunder Wave from defensive Starmie. Pokemon such as Celebi can deal with Hidden Power Rock variants of Gyarados.</p> <p>Weezing can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Gyarados and can batter Gyarados down with Sludge Bomb. If needed, it can even pack an Electric-type move or Explosion to defeat Gyarados. Gyarados can also fall easily to a surprising coverage move, such as Zap Cannon from Forretress, Thunder Punch from Metagross, Hidden Power Electric from Pokemon such as Suicune, Thunderbolt from Pokemon such as Blissey, and Counter from Snorlax. Finally, Gyarados can't come into status moves well unless it can use Rest in a late-game one-on-one situation against Pokemon such as Blissey and bulky Water-types.</p> <p>The number of Pokemon that reliably counter Gyarados may be quite limited, but there are plenty of Pokemon that can prevent Gyarados from sweeping by checking in a pinch. Snorlax, Metagross, and even Claydol can survive anything Gyarados throws at them and use Explosion to trade, while Tyranitar can survive boosted Earthquake to KO Gyarados with Rock Slide.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Standard Gyarados can be sent out against foes that cannot threaten it very much like Swampert and Suicune. In addition, it is a good switch-in to Heracross thanks to Intimidate and a resistance to its STAB moves, but it must be careful, as it doesn't take even -1 Rock Slide well. Furthermore, Gyarados can be switched into Celebi on predicted Recover.</p> <p>Dragon Dance is often used late-game when checks like Zapdos, bulky Gengar, and physical Salamence have been sufficiently weakened. Hidden Power Flying is generally superior to Hidden Power Rock because it not only receives STAB but also hits Pokemon such as Heracross, Celebi, Gengar, Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom. Hidden Power Rock deals heavy damage to Zapdos, which is one of Gyarados's main counters, as well as Aerodactyl, which usually walls Gyarados, though Hidden Power Rock variants must run a Jolly nature so that they outrun Aerodactyl after Dragon Dance. Earthquake is for Tyranitar, Metagross, and Jirachi, but at +1 it still doesn't OHKO them.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Double-Edge gives extra power needed to finish off Pokemon such as Zapdos (if using Hidden Power Flying) and Starmie. Alternatively, Taunt blocks phazing moves from Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, Toxic from Pokemon such as Milotic and Blissey, and Will-O-Wisp from Moltres. It also prevents offensive Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Substitute + Endeavor Swampert, from setting up on Gyarados. Lastly, Thunder Wave cripples switch-ins such as Zapdos, Gengar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, which can be useful early-game.</p> <p>With 188 Speed EVs, Gyarados outspeeds all unboosted Tyranitar, as well as offensive Starmie after a Dragon Dance. 208 Speed EVs let +1 Gyarados outrun Jolly Dugtrio. When a Jolly nature and Hidden Power Rock are chosen, 172 Speed EVs let Gyarados beat out Jolteon and Aerodactyl after a Dragon Dance, while 232 Speed EVs let Gyarados outpace Modest Moltres. However, Adamant is generally preferred, as the extra power is crucial in giving Gyarados a chance to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton traps Skarmory, which walls Gyarados and even wears Taunt variants down with Drill Peck. It also chips Metagross and defensive Jirachi, making it easier for Gyarados to sweep. Dragon Dance Tyranitar offers a secondary wincon and punishes Zapdos, which annoys Gyarados. In return, Gyarados deals with bulky Water-type Pokemon, Choice-locked Dugtrio, and Heracross. Dragon Dance Salamence has both offensive and defensive synergy with Gyarados: one acts as a wallbreaker, and the other acts as a sweeper, with the idea that many answers to Dragon Dance sweepers are only one-time checks. The double Intimidate combination on a frail hyper offense team also provides additional insurance against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Metagross not only can provide a resistance to Rock-type attacks but also can either soften Zapdos for Gyarados with Rock Slide or exploit Gyarados's chip damage to sweep with Agility and Meteor Mash. Special sponges such as Snorlax deal with special attackers like Zapdos, Starmie, Jolteon, and Porygon2, which Gyarados dislikes. With Earthquake, Snorlax helps to provide the chip damage needed to bring Tyranitar and Metagross into boosted Earthquake's KO range. Pursuit users trap Gengar most of the time, which helps Gyarados, especially if it chooses Hidden Power Rock. Pursuit Tyranitar also chips down Aerodactyl, Choice Band Salamence, and Zapdos, all of which are threats Gyarados wants weakened. Ground-type Pokemon such as Claydol and Swampert act as both Pokemon that resist Rock-type moves and pivots for Electric-type attacks. Swords Dance Celebi can Baton Pass its boosts to Gyarados, alleviating its lack of power.</p> <p>If a Jolly set with Hidden Power Rock is used to lure Zapdos and Jolteon, Suicune is an ideal partner. If Thunder Wave is used for switch-ins such as Gengar, Zapdos, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, slow wallbreakers such as Heracross, Marowak, Machamp, and Rhydon can be considered.</p>"

      "Rest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rest allows Gyarados to shrug off damage and status from Pokemon such as Blissey without Thunderbolt, Milotic, Refresh Claydol, defensive Jirachi, defensive Starmie without Thunderbolt, and defensive Swampert, which are commonly seen on defensive teams. However, after it uses Rest, it can lose momentum. A big negative is that setup sweepers can capitalize on Gyarados's sleep turns, so Rest is best used in the endgame so that Gyarados can beat non-Thunderbolt Blissey and Toxic-wielding bulky Water-types one-on-one.</p> <p>The investment in special bulk lets Gyarados survive Thunderbolt from Pokemon such as offensive Starmie and bulky Gengar. It also tanks other special attacks such as Salamence's Dragon Claw well. However, it is also possible to use a bulkier spread. For example, 248 HP / 56 Def / 112 SpD / 92 Spe lets Gyarados soak up not only Rock Slide from Adamant Tyranitar and +1 Salamence but also Thunderbolt from offensive Starmie in sand while still letting it outrun Pokemon such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi and Jolly Salamence after a boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is nearly mandatory, as this set does nothing with Skarmory around. Steel-types such as Metagross and the rare Steelix take Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Aerodactyl. Gyarados and Steelix form an interesting synergistic combination in checking all common special threats bar Starmie. In return, Gyarados takes Ground- and Fire-type attacks from threats such as Swampert, Moltres, Claydol, and Flygon. Salamence provides a Gyarados team with another Intimidate Pokemon, providing more safety against physical attacks. Pursuit Tyranitar traps Gengar most of the time and chips down Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Choice Band Salamence, of which Gyarados takes advantage. Pokemon such as Snorlax, Celebi, and Blissey deal with special attackers such as Zapdos and Jolteon, which Gyarados dislikes. As Rest Gyarados is prone to being exploited by Tyranitar or taken out by Metagross's Explosion while it is asleep, Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax can be a great partner that baits and removes these powerful physical threats.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>With a huge 130 base HP stat, decent stats all around, an excellent offensive movepool coverage-wise, and a great ability in Water Absorb, Lapras looks awesome in theory. However, it has major issues in practice. First of all, Lapras is outclassed by other OU Water-types, notably Vaporeon (who also has Water Absorb), Milotic, and Swampert, in the role of bulky Water. This is because many of the Pokemon that bulky Waters typically check, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, beat Lapras one-on-one due to its irksome secondary Ice typing, which gives it many qualities undesirable in a bulky Water, most notably a weakness to Rock and a neutrality to Steel. In addition, Lapras is outclassed as a Dragon Dance sweeper by other Pokemon with higher offensive stats, physical STAB, and a better physical movepool, such as Salamence. Finally, Lapras is outclassed as an all-purpose special wall by the likes of Regice due to the fact that Lapras has two special weaknesses to common attacking types, namely Electric and Grass, and is also vulnerable to all forms of passive damage and status.</p> <p>In general, Lapras works best against teams that rely on defensive type synergy and resistances, as opposed to those that rely on dedicated special walls to counter special attackers. Lapras has one major niche in OU: Toxic enables it stall out bulky Waters such as Milotic, and Roar enables it to phaze boosting Waters such as Suicune, and rack up Spikes damage as well. However, note that if it lacks Roar, Lapras is a poor answer to Suicune, as Suicune will then be able to Pressure stall it with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has an interesting boosting move in Dragon Dance and could potentially occupy a niche as a bulky boosting sweeper with Dragon Dance and 101 HP Substitutes, as well as either the unresisted combination of Hidden Power Ground and Ice Beam, or Return and Surf. Surf is a decent STAB move that provides some coverage; not only is it Lapras's best option against Metagross, it might allow Lapras to take Tyranitar by surprise and hit it for good damage. Surf can also nail Houndoom, but note that Surf forces Lapras to forgo one half of the BoltBeam combination--usually Thunderbolt. There's always Hydro Pump as well, but this is inferior to Surf on a tank such as Lapras due to its lower accuracy and PP.</p> <p>Sing is a good option for the Utility set as it lets Lapras put an unsuspecting switch-in to sleep, but its accuracy is shaky, and it leaves Lapras vulnerable to status and unable to wear down its counters. Psychic can catch Heracross off-guard, but is generally not worth it as it provides no notable coverage outside of Heracross. Perish Song is an interesting option for an alternative phazing move that can deal with threats such as the feared last-Pokemon Calm Mind Suicune; it can also work decently in conjunction with Chaosbreon. Finally, Lapras can function as a decent Curse user, but it is weak to the most common special type in the game, and is easily OHKOed or 2HKOed by all STAB Thunderbolts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Special walls in general, such as Blissey and Snorlax, shrug off anything that Lapras can throw at them; Curse Snorlax can even set up on Lapras that lack phazing utility, while Blissey can heal its teammates of status that Lapras has spread. Specially defensive and Light Screen Forretress variants can use Lapras as Spikes fodder if Lapras is not carrying Surf or Hydro Pump. Regice laughs at anything Lapras throws at it and can hit it hard with Thunderbolt. Dusclops completely walls Lapras and can status it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, and its Pressure ability lets it beat even RestTalk Lapras.</p> <p>Heracross has the Special Defense to take hits from Lapras, and can hit it with a super effective Fighting move. In addition to being immune to Toxic, Metagross can also take all of Lapras's hits, then swiftly 2HKO it with Meteor Mash. Tyranitar needs to watch out for Surf and Toxic, but once it's safely in, it can dispatch of Lapras with a powerful Rock Slide or set up with Substitute or Dragon Dance on a predicted switch; uninvested Tyranitar outspeeds Lapras by one point. Houndoom is a good answer to Lapras as it is not even 3HKOed by Thunderbolt and can deal a good 45% with Fire Blast. However, as with Tyranitar, it needs to be cautious of Surf and Toxic. Specially defensive Zapdos is a decent answer to Lapras despite being hit super effectively by Ice Beam; Ice Beam is a 3HKO while Zapdos's Thunderbolt 2HKOes Lapras. SubCM Jirachi makes an excellent Lapras counter as it can boost up to make its Substitutes unbreakable, is immune to Toxic, and immediately threatens Lapras with Thunder or Thunderbolt. SubCM Raikou is in a similar boat to Jirachi, but needs to watch out for Toxic on the switch. Lanturn and Magneton both resist the BoltBeam combination and can hit Lapras for super effective damage with their STAB Electric moves. Thick Fat Hariyama resists Ice moves and can hit Lapras hard with Cross Chop.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Switch this into a bulky Water and predict accordingly; either use Roar to rack up hazard damage, or hit the incoming Electric-type with Ice Beam. Otherwise, the idea of this set is to function as a general tank and status absorber. Rest and Sleep Talk enable Lapras to stay alive for long periods of time, recover its health back, and not be dead weight when asleep.</p> <p>Thunderbolt gives Lapras a good answer to Water-types such as Vaporeon, while Roar makes it a reliable phazer that capitalizes on Spikes support. Note that Roar only really works alongside Spikes support; without it, Lapras will be ironically stalled to a rather boring death by the status-inflicting Water-types it usually likes to switch into. Forgoing Thunderbolt for Roar, however, leaves Lapras with major issues with special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax. The latter in particular can fearlessly set up multiple Curse boosts on it and proceed to do huge damage to your team.</p> <p>Maximize Lapras's HP to optimize its tanking ability. The given spread provides roughly equal defenses so that Lapras can take both physical and special hits decently enough. The Special Attack investment enables Lapras to deal out decent damage to the Water-types it can absorb status from, such as Toxic Milotic.</p> <p>This set works best alongside Spikes support, but unfortunately, none of the three most common OU Spikes users synergize particularly well with Lapras: Skarmory shares a crippling Electric weakness with Lapras, while Cloyster shares the exact same typing as Lapras. Your best bet for Spikes support is Light Screen or specially defensive variants of Forretress, which can defend itself to some extent against neutral special hits, such as Gengar's Thunderbolt. Despite the Electric weakness, however, Skarmory is a decent Spikes user because it can switch into and set up on Blissey and Snorlax, while Curselax forces Forretress to Explode at some stage. Furthermore, Forretress and Skarmory make decent switch-ins to Metagross, and the latter also counters Heracross; both are foes that Lapras fears. Swampert makes for an excellent partner to Lapras thanks to its ability to check Tyranitar and Metagross; it is also immune to the Electric-type attacks that Lapras hates. However, beware as Swampert has issues with Electric-types that utilize Hidden Power Grass, which most do nowadays.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>This Lapras, while bereft of recovery aside from Water Absorb, can provide very effective team support. The idea behind this set is to switch into Water-types and heal off any prior damage by absorbing Surf, then proceed to deal out damage, phaze, spread status, or provide cleric support. Toxic is preferred over Heal Bell as catching the likes of Raikou on the switch disables it from sweeping, but Heal Bell is also a good option because Lapras is a relatively durable cleric. On the flip side though, Toxic leaves Lapras vulnerable to status itself, especially poison, while Heal Bell often renders it unable to inflict decent residual damage. Roar is an important aspect of the set as it enables Lapras to capitalize on forced switches, rack up Spikes damage, and also phaze opponents that try to set up on it. It is possible to forgo Roar to accommodate both Toxic and Heal Bell, but this is inadvisable.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard; max HP optimizes its ability to take hits in general. The Defense EVs are invested to roughly equal out both of Lapras's defenses. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Attack so that Lapras packs a little more offensive punch with its Ice Beams and Thunderbolts.</p> <p>If Lapras chooses not to use Heal Bell, physically defensive Heal Bell Celebi makes a good partner as it resists the Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks that plague Lapras's existence, while also removing Lapras's vulnerability to status. Note that Heracross, OU's premier Fighting-type, beats them both unless Celebi has substantial Speed investment, so it's advisable to also pack a Heracross counter, such as Skarmory. Swampert makes a decent partner thanks to its resistances to Rock and Steel, as well as its immunity to Electric; it can also check threats to Lapras, such as Tyranitar and Metagross. Both share a weakness to Grass though, so be sure to pack a teammate that resists Grass, such as Skarmory or Salamence, which are both good Heracross checks as well. Claydol makes an excellent partner to Lapras thanks to its ability to check Tyranitar, as well as its key resistances to Rock and Fighting, and its immunity to Electric. In addition to spinning away the Spikes that wear Lapras down, Claydol can also bait Water moves from the likes of Milotic to heal Lapras. Yet again, though, Heracross beats both Claydol and Lapras, so Skarmory or another of the aforementioned Heracross counters is recommended.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced many years ago and is currently being <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/adv-vaporeon-qc-0-2-gp-0-2.3684996/\">revamped</a>. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current ADV OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Vaporeon is probably the best team player of all the Water-types, thanks to Wish and Baton Pass. Its stats are high all-round, and with Haze and Water Absorb, it makes one of the best Suicune counters. Along with the bulkiest Substitutes in the game, Vaporeon can also pass Wish and Acid Armor, which makes it a great asset to Baton Pass chains.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charm can frustrate physical sweepers with Curse and Dragon Dance. Rest is not as support-oriented as Wish is, but Vaporeon is crippled by status otherwise, so it's a viable option. Vaporeon can also Baton Pass Curse boosts. Hidden Power Electric is the only way Vaporeon can beat Taunt Gyarados, and it also helps against other Water-types as Vaporeon does have a respectable Special Attack stat to work with. A Modest nature is an option on sets with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric if you feel Vaporeon needs the extra power. Wish + Baton Pass sets can also run a Relaxed nature with a Speed IV of 0 so that Vaporeon can take a hit and allow a frail sweeper to switch in safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gyarados can Taunt Vaporeon and set up Dragon Dance with little risk to itself, unless Vaporeon has Hidden Power Electric. Quagsire is immune to Surf thanks to Water Absorb and can set up Curse against sets that lack Haze or Roar. As Tentacruel has high Special Defense and resists both Surf and Ice Beam, it can set up Swords Dance easily. Snorlax can set up Curse boosts on Vaporeon with ease or just wall its hits and prevent it from successfully passing a Substitute. Celebi can set up Calm Mind in Vaporeon's face and Baton Pass to a recipient of its own, or slam it with boosted special attacks. Suicune too can Calm Mind up and Roar out Vaporeon, but unless Spikes are down, Vaporeon can just come right back in and wall mono-attacking Suicune.</p> <p>Lanturn resists Surf and Ice Beam and has STAB Thunderbolt to smack Vaporeon with. Raikou, Jolteon, and Zapdos can easily 2HKO it too; Zapdos has to watch out for Ice Beam if it doesn't invest heavily in Special Defense, however. Porygon2 has the stats to take Ice Beams easily, can Trace Water Absorb to make Surf less than useless, and can nail Vaporeon with Thunderbolt. Trace Gardevoir functions similarly, except it has Wish over Recover, and can set up Calm Mind. Venusaur and Meganium can take on sets without Ice Beam if they have a Grass-type move to smack Vaporeon with. However, all of the Pokemon listed above need to be wary of Vaporeon Baton Passing to a counter as they switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + WishPass": {"description": "<p>Vaporeon is an incredibly durable Baton Passer; it can switch into Metagross to support teammates or heal itself. It must heal off any damage taken before switching out or Baton Passing to a teammate, however, as it will otherwise lose the ability to repeatedly switch in and pass Substitute and Wish. Vaporeon's Substitute has more than 100 HP, so Seismic Toss will not break it. This Vaporeon combines nicely with heavy hitters, as they will have more turns to hurt their counters or set up and sweep; examples are Gengar, Heracross, and Rhydon.</p>"},
      "Wall": {"description": "<p>This set is easier to keep alive and dishes out more diverse damage. Wish + Protect forms a makeshift Recover for Vaporeon, and allows it to heal its teammates too. Protect further eases prediction against Choice users and, in conjunction with Toxic, helps Vaporeon stall out threats that can't 2HKO it.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Vaporeon survive two hits from Choice Band Salamence, which allows it to switch in with ease and OHKO back with Ice Beam.</p>"},
      "Phazer": {"description": "<p>Haze provides more security against Suicune, as Suicune is faster and can Roar Vaporeon away before the latter can do the same to it; Haze also works against Soundproof Pokemon. However, with Roar, Vaporeon can blow away Substitutes and inflict Spikes damage on opponents. Several moves are viable in the last moveslot: Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types such as Salamence, Protect eases prediction and pairs well with Wish, while Toxic cripples walls that lack Rest or Natural Cure.</p>"},
      "Acid Armor + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This set works best on a dedicated Baton Pass team. Acid Armor allows Vaporeon's teammates to set up on powerful physical attackers such as Salamence and Snorlax. With Acid Armor, Vaporeon also becomes the next best counter to Choice Band users outside of Scizor and Mawile. Substitute is preferred in the fourth moveslot for its general utility, especially if you have another Wish user such as Celebi for a teammate; Vaporeon's ability to pass Substitutes that stand up to Seismic Toss is another major plus. However, if you don't have a team slot to spare for a Wish user, then Vaporeon itself can run Wish over Substitute.</p>"}

  "Jolteon": {
    "overview": "<p>With base 110 Special Attack and base 130 Speed, Jolteon can both force numerous switches to rack up damage from Spikes early-game and act as a cleaner late-game. Thanks to Volt Absorb and decent Special Defense, it can also act as a pivot against numerous special attackers including Gengar, Zapdos, and to a lesser extent Starmie, though it can be crippled by all forms of status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used, as it also cripples most Pokemon hit by either Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass. However, Toxic damage racks up too slowly for the fast-paced teams on which Jolteon usually fits to take advantage of. Stat-boosting Berries such as Petaya, Salac, and Liechi Berry can come in handy when passing Substitute to make another member of the team more dangerous. In particular, Petaya Berry has the added benefit of being useful to Jolteon itself. However, in order to get into the activation range of these Berries, Jolteon must be worn down much more quickly, which detracts from its pivoting ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax easily shrug off Jolteon's attacks. Celebi is another good counter to Jolteon because it doesn't even fear Hidden Power Ice. Bulky physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Metagross can check Jolteon with the threat of Earthquake. Ground-type Pokemon such as Flygon, Swampert, and Claydol can handle Jolteon, but Flygon cannot wall Hidden Power Ice variants and Swampert cannot take on Hidden Power Grass variants. Though they are uncommon, Camerupt and Steelix are probably the best counters to Jolteon, as they can take any attack Jolteon can throw at them. Porygon2 is an interesting counter because it can acquire Volt Absorb with Trace. Roar Jolteon itself can check an opposing Jolteon, but it must be wary of Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {

Baton Pass allows Jolteon to escape from Dugtrio, rack up damage from Spikes, and keep up the momentum. Roar racks up plenty of residual damage on foes in combination with Spikes. Thunder Wave is useful due to Jolteon's ability to outspeed most offensive threats and safely cripple them. Combined with Baton Pass, Substitute is great to support dangerous Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Metagross because Jolteon attracts special walls like Blissey. It also blocks status moves such as Thunder Wave from Zapdos. Wish is an option that allows Jolteon to heal its teammates. Jolteon's lack of bulk may make this move seem undesirable, but the fact that it draws in a large number of passive Pokemon can make it an effective Wish passer.</p> <p>76 HP EVs allow Jolteon to survive Hydro Pump from offensive Starmie after sand and three layers of Spikes, as well as Rock Slide from Aerodactyl. Maximum Speed investment lets Jolteon outspeed the majority of the metagame and Speed tie with Aerodactyl and opposing Jolteon if necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jolteon fits comfortably on offensive teams with Spikes, making Spikes users such as Skarmory and Cloyster great partners. Jolteon also pairs well with physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Metagross, as its Baton Pass can bring them in against special walls.

The other two moves should be used along with Leftovers. Protect can stall for additional Leftovers recovery and scout Choice Band users. This can significantly reduce prediction as, for the most part, they only have Earthquake and STAB Fighting moves with which to threaten Omastar.</p> <p>As Omastar will not be tanking any special attacks regardless of investment, it should focus on physical bulk to sponge attacks from the likes of Salamence.

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to STAB Rock Slide and Swords Dance, Kabutops can put the hurt on Skarmory with some boosts under its belt. However, it has trouble with the common Metagross and Swampert due to its lack of access to Earthquake, which hurts it a lot in terms of usability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rapid Spin is useful as it clears away Spikes. Giga Drain can let Kabutops hit Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, most notably Swampert, on the switch. Thief can steal an item, such as Choice Band or Leftovers, and make life hard for your opponents, but Knock Off is superior. Confuse Ray can give Kabutops a bit more time to sweep, while Body Slam has a nice paralysis chance, which can also be useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metagross and Swampert can both hurt Kabutops badly while Kabutops cannot really damage them much in return. Suicune is a good counter thanks to its high HP and Defense, as are Donphan and Claydol due to their good Defense stats. Flygon is a solid choice too, because it takes little damage from most of Kabutops's moves. However, Claydol, Flygon, and Donphan should all beware of Surf.</p>",

While this set is usable, it is not the best as Kabutops is slow, has poor HP, and is weak to many common attacks.

Hidden Power Ground can hit Steel-types, but Kabutops's lack of access to Earthquake hinders its sweeping potential. It's a toss-up between Brick Break and Knock Off; the latter hits Normal-types and does about 10% more damage to Snorlax than Double-Edge does, while Knock Off is a good hit-and-run attack for annoying the opponent.</p>"}

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is one of the most feared Choice Band users in OU. Its standard combination of attacks in Rock Slide, Double-Edge, and Earthquake is unresisted, allowing the prehistoric tyrant to ravage the OU metagame. Aerodactyl's secondary Flying typing blesses it with an immunity to Earthquake and, more importantly, Spikes, allowing it to hit hard throughout the match. Finally, as if it could get any better for Aerodactyl, it's tied for the fastest Pokemon in ADV OU with Jolteon, which is OHKOed by Earthquake. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl's weakness to Ice Beam, Surf, Rock Slide, and other common moves in the ADV OU metagame prevent it from switching in as often as one would hope. Additionally, Aerodactyl's defenses are far from stellar; even non-STAB super effective moves will do significant damage to Aerodactyl, if not OHKO it outright.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerodactyl has a pretty big movepool, but it should really stick with the given set. The only other viable set would consist of Rock Slide, Earthquake, Double-Edge, and Substitute with a Liechi Berry and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 SpD. This set takes full advantage of Aerodactyl's ability to force switches and hit hard behind a Substitute. Toxic can be used over Double-Edge to cripple incoming Water-types; if using Toxic, be sure to use Pressure as Aerodactyl's ability. Fire Blast might seem useful to roast Skarmory, but Aerodactyl can beat Skarmory with Rock Slide. Taunt might also seem viable, but that would mean forgoing the necessary Choice Band for the mediocre Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Aerodactyl is hard to counter, as it can strip away a win from you with an untimely flinch. However, Aerodactyl does have a good number of checks. Metagross and Jirachi can switch into Aerodactyl's STAB moves and retaliate with a super effective move of their own. Jirachi deserves a special mention, as it can set up Reflect and Wish, further aiding your team by lessening Aerodactyl's sweeping prowess. However, Wish + Reflect Jirachi is not a strong check to Aerodactyl, as Jirachi will forgo super effective coverage if it runs Reflect. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert can take any one attack from Aerodactyl and return the favor with a STAB Surf or Hydro Pump. Physically defensive Celebi can switch into any of Aerodactyl's moves bar Hidden Power Flying and set up Calm Mind or cripple it with Leech Seed.</p> <p>On more offensive teams, Intimidate users such as Salamence and Gyarados can lessen Aerodactyl's sweeping prowess while giving your own team a chance to sweep. It's worth noting that Salamence and Gyarados share excellent defensive synergy with Jirachi and Metagross, as they can switch into an Earthquake that was meant to hit Metagross or Jirachi, set up a Dragon Dance boost, and proceed to sweep. Claydol can take a couple of Aerodactyl's hits in the early-game and retaliate with Ice Beam; however, Claydol is sure to lose in the late-game due to its lack of reliable recovery. Although Flygon can't switch into Double-Edge, having a Rock-type resistance is necessary to prevent Aerodactyl from running through your team. Also, Flygon pairs well with Metagross and Jirachi, ensuring that you have an offensive core that will give Aerodactyl trouble due to such a pair's excellent defensive synergy. Skarmory can switch into any of Aerodactyl's moves, set up Spikes, and heal off any damage taken wth Rest. More uncommon checks to Aerodactyl include Donphan and Steelix. Steelix in particular can take on Aerodactyl throughout the game due to its resistance to most of Aerodactyl's moves and its excellent Defense stat. Remember that an untimely flinch can spell doom for your Aerodactyl check, so it's a good idea to have two Aerodactyl checks, or at least two Pokemon that can take a hit and OHKO Aerodactyl before it runs through your team. A bulky Gengar set can play such a role, as it can take Rock Slide and hit back with Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Behold: one of the most dangerous late-game sweepers in ADV OU. Rock Slide is Aerodactyl's main STAB move, and combined with a Choice Band, it gives Aerodactyl the ability to demolish even sturdy walls such as Suicune and Milotic into oblivion thanks to the move's high flinch chance. Other than making foes flinch to death, Rock Slide is also useful for defeating Zapdos, Gyarados, Salamence, and opposing Aerodactyl. Double-Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest move, and combined with Rock Head, Aerodactyl can spam Double-Edge throughout the match. Double-Edge is also Aerodactyl's best choice against bulky Water-types in the early-game, ensuring that Aerodactyl can deal a blow heavy enough to where it or a teammate can sweep later in the game. Earthquake is chosen as the third option, as it provides excellent coverage alongside Rock Slide, and Flygon and Claydol, the two Pokemon that resist the combination, are hit hard by Double-Edge. Additionally, Earthquake also slams Jirachi and Metagross, two common Aerodactyl switch-ins. Hidden Power Flying rounds off the set by giving Aerodactyl a strong secondary STAB move that is useful against Fighting-types and Celebi. Hidden Power Bug hits Celebi a lot harder, and is especially useful for stopping the Calm Mind + Baton Pass variant. Hidden Power Fighting is a niche option that allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar in the presence of Spikes when the team lacks a sturdy Tyranitar counter.</p> <p>Choice Band is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl can sweep late-game. The EV spread listed takes full advantage of Aerodactyl's excellent offensive stats; maximum Attack investment is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl hits as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed every Pokemon with the exception of Jolteon and other Aerodactyl; the IVs ensure that Aerodactyl can Speed tie with opposing Aerodactyl and Jolteon when using Hidden Power Flying. An EV spread of 32 HP / 248 Atk / 8 SpD / 220 Spe is another viable option; this spread allows Aerodactyl to survive Gengar's Thunderbolt while still being able to outspeed Timid Raikou and Starmie.</p> <p>Aerodactyl really appreciates Spikes support to turn 3HKOs into possible 2HKOs, such as with Double-Edge against Suicune and Milotic. Specially defensive Skarmory makes for a great partner, as it can switch into a lot of the Pokemon that switch into Aerodactyl, such as Metagross, Suicune, Milotic, Swampert, and opposing Skarmory. Pokemon that can lure and either weaken or defeat Aerodactyl's checks are also fine partners. Tyranitar is one of the better offensive partners for Aerodactyl, as it can deal huge chunks of damage to many of Aerodactyl's checks and can also negate their Leftovers recovery with Sand Stream. Metagross shares good defensive synergy with Aerodactyl and can take out Skarmory and bulky Water-types with Thunder Punch and Explosion, respectively. Zapdos and Celebi are also great partners due to their ability to force out bulky Water-types, ensuring that Water-types have to switch into Spikes one more time if they want a chance to beat Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Aerodactyl really shines on offensively based Explosion teams. Prominent offensive Explosion users such as Metagross and Snorlax can defeat or severely weaken most of Aerodactyl's checks, as most teams can't handle more than one Explosion. After Water-types are eliminated, Dugtrio can trap and defeat weakened Normal-type switch-ins, such as Jirachi and Metagross, increasing Aerodactyl's chances to sweep later in the game. It's important to remember that Aerodactyl really doesn't need too much support, as it can cut through most teams with a lucky flinch. Thus, Spikes setters are probably Aerodactyl's best partners, as the move supports both Aerodactyl and the entire team. Once again, specially defensive Skarmory is an excellent Spikes user alongside Aerodactyl.  Finally, bulky Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar with maximum Special Attack EVs not only blocks Rapid Spin, but also has the potential to defeat Suicune and Milotic, both of which are common Aerodactyl switch-ins.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a special wall with a great defensive and offensive presence thanks to its Curse set as well as its access to Self-Destruct, as taking out an extra opposing Pokemon or a sweeper that wants to overpower it can be crucial for a game. While it does have some weaknesses, namely mediocre Defense, low Speed, and a vulnerability to Spikes and sand, its strong points make it the force that defines ADV OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is a traditional answer to Steel-types such as Skarmory, Forretress, Metagross, and Magneton. Brick Break is not as powerful as Focus Punch, but it is an immediate answer against Tyranitar. Thunder is a powerful choice for combatting Aerodactyl, Gyarados, Cloyster, and Skarmory, and it provides a great paralysis rate. However, the accuracy is rather low, so it may mandate rain support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most counters depend on Snorlax's set.</p> <p>Skarmory, Metagross, and defensive Celebi are some of the biggest checks to Snorlax. Skarmory can come in, set up Spikes, and phaze Snorlax. If Snorlax doesn't have Earthquake, it won't do much damage to Metagross. Without Hidden Power Bug or a boost from Curse, Snorlax cannot easily 2HKO Celebi, which means it can outstall Snorlax with Leech Seed and Recover. It also shrugs off Body Slam paralysis thanks to Natural Cure and Heal Bell. To prevent itself from losing to a Snorlax with Rest, Celebi can set up Calm Mind and take down Snorlax with Psychic, as long as it is safe with Recover. However, it needs to be wary of Self-Destruct.</p> <p>Besides Skarmory and Metagross, other Steel- or Rock-types resist Snorlax's STAB attacks. Snorlax without Earthquake will be setup fodder for Calm Mind Jirachi, but Wish Jirachi can only reliably deal with the Curse non-Earthquake set. Under sand, Magnet Magneton can make Snorlax use Rest repeatedly and beat the utility set if it's not running Earthquake or Brick Break. Forretress can run Explosion or Counter to handle the utility set, though it must be wary of Fire Blast and Curse versions. The seldom-used Steelix can run Roar to phaze Snorlax and Explosion to do a ton of damage to it. If Snorlax doesn't have Focus Punch or Brick Break, it can be setup fodder for Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which also kicks up a sandstorm, which is very important for teams that lack a reliable Curse Snorlax counter to prevent it from setting up comfortably. Although Aerodactyl may be scared of being paralyzed by Snorlax's Body Slam, it can click Rock Slide to possibly make Snorlax flinch. Knock Off / Harden / Rest Armaldo is the greatest counter of all time to Snorlax, though it's uncommon.</p> <p>Virtually any Snorlax set is walled early-game by Suicune, which can remove its Curse boosts with Roar. However, Suicune gets worn down by hits pretty quickly, and Snorlax can do some major damage to it with Self-Destruct.</p> <p>If Snorlax doesn't have the right moves for Gengar, it will be beaten. However, note that Curse Snorlax can outstall Gengar that lack Taunt or Perish Song, even if it doesn't have anything to hit Gengar with.</p> <p>Fighting-types make for offensive checks or counters to Snorlax. None can repeatedly come in on STAB Return, Body Slam, or Double-Edge and live to tell the tale, but they can switch into predicted Rests, Curses, and, to an extent, coverage attacks. Afterward, Fighting-types can capitalize on Snorlax's relatively poor Defense. Importantly, Focus Punch will hurt Snorlax even after multiple Curse boosts. Heracross puts a big dent in Snorlax with Focus Punch, Brick Break, and Megahorn. Machamp and Hariyama are also decent checks.</p> <p>Weezing is physically bulky enough to take most boosted hits and can use Pain Split to feed off Snorlax's higher HP. Furthermore, Weezing has access to moves such as Haze, which will eliminate any boosts Snorlax can muster from Curse. Besides, Weezing's Will-O-Wisp will harshly reduce Snorlax's Attack while also causing a little damage. Weezing can hit relatively hard with Sludge Bomb, and if required, turn to Explosion to finish off Snorlax.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse Snorlax can be a secondary check for special attackers such as Zapdos because it is usually buffeted by Sandstorm and doesn't have a reliable way to restore its HP. If Curse Snorlax is the last Pokemon on your team, there will be a strong possibility that you can make a comeback, as Snorlax can boost up and beat down phazers such as Skarmory, Suicune, and the rare Steelix, which can no longer use Whirlwind or Roar against it.</p> <p>Curse and Rest are obligatory moves. Since Curse Snorlax usually works as a late-game Pokemon and doesn't care about spreading paralysis as much as KOing the foe, Return is generally chosen. However, Body Slam is still an option for overall utility. Earthquake hurts Tyranitar, Jirachi, Metagross, and Magneton. Shadow Ball hits Gengar, Celebi, and Starmie for super effective damage. Hidden Power Bug strikes Celebi and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Steel not only hits Gengar but also has the benefit of hitting Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Sleep Talk prevents Snorlax from being helpless during its two turns of Rest, though it's a niche option because of sleep turns resetting if Sleep Talk is used before switching out. Shadow Ball + Earthquake provides wide coverage, but Suicune can set up on and take out Snorlax lacking a STAB move faster than Snorlax can kill it, and even other special attackers such as Zapdos and Moltres can score critical hits if Snorlax spends too many turns attempting to take them out.</p> <p>Immunity is generally the preferred ability because it allows Snorlax to deal with Toxic users such as Blissey, Zapdos, Magneton, Milotic, and Porygon2, thus becoming a status pivot. Thick Fat has its niche because Moltres does a lot of damage to Snorlax with its Fire-type STAB moves, but Toxic is more common.</p> <p>The specified EVs allow Snorlax to guarantee a 3HKO on near-maximum physically bulky Suicune with +1 Return after sandstorm damage. 144 HP and 136 Special Defense EVs help Snorlax wall special attackers such as Zapdos and Suicune better. If your Snorlax runs Body Slam, you may wish to consider running 116 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature to OHKO 4 HP Dugtrio. If you need a better matchup against physical attacks, Impish will be an ideal nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Above all, Magneton is almost always paired with Curse Snorlax for its ability to take out Skarmory, Magneton, and a weakened or Choice-locked Metagross. Magneton can also run Rain Dance or Sunny Day, thus letting Snorlax avoid being buffeted by sandstorm. A Pursuit user such as Tyranitar traps Gengar, thus creating a juncture for Snorlax without Shadow Ball to sweep late-game. Dugtrio matches well with this set, being able to trap Celebi and Heracross as well as Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Magneton. Psychic-types such as Celebi and Claydol are common teammates. The former's Baton Pass can let trappers, namely Magneton and Dugtrio, work more easily, while the latter can not only remove Spikes with Rapid Spin but also act as a pivot for Electric-type attacks that would normally wear down Snorlax.</p>"
      },
      "Utility Lax": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Self-Destruct is Snorlax's strongest attack, powerful enough to even damage Rock- or Steel- types. Snorlax usually uses Body Slam with this set, especially if it runs standard non-maximum Attack EVs, because paralyzing Suicune, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory is quite nice. Return has extra power, and if you invest enough Attack EVs, it can 2HKO some versions of Zapdos. Shadow Ball hits Gengar super effectively if your team doesn't have Pursuit support and does good damage to Celebi and Starmie. Focus Punch OHKOes Tyranitar on the switch or when it clicks Dragon Dance and does good damage to Skarmory, though you should be wary of Drill Peck variants. Earthquake hurts Tyranitar, Jirachi, Metagross, and Magneton. Curse + Self-Destruct deals with Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Metagross. Counter is a decent answer to physical attackers such as Metagross.</p> <p>The specified EVs allow Snorlax to guarantee a KO on 4 HP Dugtrio with Body Slam. The Speed investment makes Snorlax just faster than paralyzed 394 Speed Pokemon, namely Aerodactyl and Jolteon. If your team wants Snorlax to hit Skarmory harder with Focus Punch, you may want more Attack investment. 24 HP and 184 Special Defense EVs are needed to take Modest 252 Special Attack Zapdos's Thunderbolt and +1 Modest Suicune's Hydro Pump more comfortably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snorlax without Focus Punch is best suited to a Magneton-aided balance or offense team, especially Magneton-based physical spam. With Hidden Power Fire, Magneton can trap Earthquake Forretress more reliably. If Snorlax runs Focus Punch, it should generally be used on offensive teams without Spikes. Flying-types such as Salamence and Gyarados are great partners because Snorlax appreciates their Fighting-type resistance. If Snorlax can remove its typical counters such as Metagross and Tyranitar, it will be easier to sweep. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar combine with Snorlax excellently, being able to trap Gengar, thus letting Snorlax give up Shadow Ball and use Self-Destruct more comfortably. Although Houndoom is a niche Pokemon, it removes defensive Celebi, which is a solid answer to Snorlax without Hidden Power Bug.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is considered overshadowed by Salamence and, to a lesser extent, Flygon. Thanks to Intimidate, the former can force switches much more easily and takes less damage from physical attacks as he switches in. Meanwhile, the latter has a better defensive typing, with resistances to Rock-type attacks and an immunity to Thunder Wave, which gives him more opportunities to switch in. However, Dragonite packs a serious punch, and has great surprise value. If you manage to bring him in on a Choice-locked Earthquake or a Snorlax's Rest, your opponent will need to play very cautiously.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heal Bell is a workable option for healing Dragonite and its teammates of status. Other support moves Dragonite receives include Thunder Wave and Haze, but all other recommended moves have already been mentioned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos, Armaldo, Claydol, and Weezing can counter the Dragon Dance set most reliably; Metagross, Slowbro, and defensive Swampert are good picks as well. Milotic and Suicune are also solid switch-ins as Dragonite can't hurt them much outside of a Choice Band Focus Punch. All in all, Dragonite doesn't have many great counters due to his awesome movepool.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance optimizes Dragonite's stats to make him a formidable sweeper. His base 134 Attack is nothing to laugh at, and thanks to his ability to shrug off most non-STAB Ice attacks, he can set up with surprising ease. However, you should mostly try to bring Dragonite in on Pokemon that won't harm him, such as Skarmory and Rest users, in order to keep him as healthy as possible.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are options, but they don't pack the punch that Thunder does. In fact, with the listed EVs, Dragonite's Thunder does around 80% to Skarmory, 40-50% to Milotic, and a ton to Suicune. The HP investment lets Dragonite take Ice Beam from most Swampert, and the Speed EVs enable unboosted Dragonite to outspeed neutral-natured Magneton and Breloom, as well as Pokemon that hit 361 Speed after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Dragonite works best when used on a team that can force switches and provide Spikes support. You can consider using Heal Bell to let Dragonite set up on Thunder Wave, but if not, you should play him carefully and make sure to keep him healthy.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>This was the standard Dragonite set for a long time, and for good reason. With his stellar offensive stats, Dragonite can hurt a multitude of opponents. Nothing resists both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt except Shedinja, Lanturn, and Magneton: of these, Shedinja dies to sandstorm damage, the former two are uncommon, and the latter two can be taken care of by Focus Punch. Special walls, such as Regice, Blissey, and Snorlax, also can't take a super effective Focus Punch to the stomach. SubPunch Dragonite doesn't pack the punch that the Dragon Dance variant does, and can't clean up as easily, but it sure is something to watch out for if you don't carry the right counters.</p> <p>The SubPunch set is the toughest to EV. You'll want to concentrate on Dragonite's HP, as well as his offensive stats. Pick either an Attack- or Special Attack-raising and Speed-lowering nature, and balance both his offenses.</p>"},
      "Mixed Attacker": {"description": "<p>This set is a variation to the one above, but has a more specific idea behind it. With the EVs listed, Dragonite should be able to dent Regice, Snorlax, and Blissey severely with Focus Punch, to the point where even sandstorm damage will finish them off. Hidden Power Flying is stronger and makes Dragonite a better finisher, but Hidden Power Grass lets Dragonite 2HKO Swampert, and isn't much weaker than Thunderbolt against Waters such as Milotic and Suicune. However, note that said Water-types outspeed Dragonite and often pack Ice Beam. The moves in the last moveslot are interchangeable to an extent; it all depends on your team. Speaking of teammates, this Dragonite should be paired with Tyranitar for residual sandstorm damage.</p> <p>Go with the EVs listed unless running Hidden Power Flying; if so, Dragonite will need less Attack EVs to finish off the targeted special walls. You can put these leftover EVs into HP or Special Defense.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>The main reason to use Choice Band Dragonite over Salamence is the movepool difference. Dragonite has Focus Punch, which can do huge damage to Suicune and other Water-types; in fact, it hits just as hard as Choice Band Tyranitar's Focus Punch. Dragonite can also hit these threats hard with an Electric move, and Thunder's paralysis chance might help as well. Ice Beam is an option here to deal more damage to Donphan, Claydol, and other Ground-types not named Swampert, but Dragonite will have to take out Skarmory with Focus Punch or in another way.</p> <p>Aim for as much Attack as possible, enough Speed to hit a stat of 244, and put the rest in HP.

      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {"description": "<p>This Dragonite is nearly guaranteed to take out Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert if they switch in on Dragonite when he is at full health. This set works as follows: Dragon Dance on the switch-in, then use Hidden Power Flying to weaken them. Dragonite should survive the Ice Beam, but be weakened enough that Liechi Berry will trigger. Hidden Power Flying will KO most opponents bar a low damage roll, but this is where the massively powerful Double-Edge comes in. Dragonite should usually survive the recoil, but even if he doesn't, you can now bring in one of the many Pokemon that have a great chance at sweeping opposing teams lacking a capable bulky Water.</p> <p>The EVs listed are most effective, but if you want to variate, just make sure Dragonite can survive a non-STAB Ice Beam off around 263 Special Attack.</p>"}

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat is best off with direct offense, in the form of the Choice Band set. Its amazing Speed makes it a great late-game cleaner, and its nice typing grants it several handy resistances, including 4x ones to Fighting and Bug. However, Crobat has huge problems with Steel-types, and should therefore be paired with Magneton.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crobat's Special Attack is high enough that it can use Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass to dent Swampert and Rhydon on the switch; both are fairly common switch-ins on Sludge Bomb. Quick Attack seems to make little sense as Crobat has a base 130 Speed stat, but it will come as a godsend if you are being swept by a Reversal user, as Crobat can actually switch in on Reversal thanks to its 4x Fighting resistance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that resist or are immune to Sludge Bomb usually beat Crobat. There is absolutely no chance that Crobat will ever break past the likes of Swampert, Skarmory, Steelix, Weezing, Donphan, and Forretress. Suicune's high Defense lets it take Sludge Bomb well, and while Milotic's Defense isn't as good, Marvel Scale will make it even bulkier if Milotic is poisoned. Aerodactyl outruns most Crobat as they usually don't attempt maximum Speed, and can smash it with Rock Slide; if Crobat lacks Hidden Power Fighting, Tyranitar can do the same.</p>",

Not only will this inflict massive Spikes damage, it will also force out opponents with Calm Mind, Curse, Swords Dance, and Substitute. However, beware of waking up too early. Rest is an option here if you don't want to rely on your opponent to put Crobat to sleep, but it will then be using Rest instead of Whirlwind 50% of the time.</p> <p>Maximize Speed and HP, and put the leftovers in Defense or Special Defense; it won't matter much.</p>"}

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Lanturn's excellent typing makes it only one of three ADV Pokemon that resist both parts of the BoltBeam combination; it is also the only one with any defenses to speak of. Thanks to its has good special bulk, excellent type synergy with Pokemon such as Skarmory and Gyarados, and ability to spread paralysis, Lanturn is a decent choice for standard teams. In addition, Lanturn is one of the few Pokemon that can effectively stop offensive Calm Mind Suicune, who is a huge threat that many teams have difficulty dealing with.</p> <p>However, without large investment in Special Attack, Lanturn lacks firepower. It suffers from a crippling weakness to the very common Ground-type attacks, and its lack of phazing capability leaves it setup bait to the likes of Calm Mind Celebi and Curse Snorlax. It is also vulnerable to all forms of passive damage, and hates poison unless it is running a RestTalk set. Nonetheless, its glut of resistances and immunities to common attacks, along with its good bulk, makes it a worthwhile addition to most teams that need a bulky Water-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Substitute + three attacks set works well on Lanturn; once Blissey and Celebi are removed, it will prove to be a thorn in the side of typical stall teams that use a combination of Suicune, Zapdos, and Skarmory. Dugtrio therefore makes a good partner to the aforementioned set due to its ability to remove Blissey and Celebi. However, this set is setup fodder for Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax, and is also unable to recover efficiently.</p> <p>Toxic is an interesting option to use over Confuse Ray on the parafusion set; it can even be considered over Surf on the RestTalk set, but is not recommended as it allows Dugtrio a free switch. Nonetheless, it can wear down Lanturn's counters, such as Swampert. Hydro Pump is an alternative STAB option, but its low PP is an issue in longer games, and it does not give enough extra power over Surf to merit use. Thunder is a viable option on the RestTalk set if you want Lanturn to be able to spread status, but its low accuracy is a major turn-off. Even though Lanturn is bulky enough to afford the occasional miss, it could miss a crucial KO on a threat such as Explosion Cloyster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Celebi is the best Lanturn counter in the game as it resists both Lanturn's STAB moves, does not fear paralysis, and is able to use Leech Seed to chip away Lanturn's HP. Celebi can also set up Calm Mind boosts on Lanturn with impunity. Swampert is immune to Electric-type attacks, takes little from Surf, and can do heavy damage with Earthquake or set up with Curse; it needs to watch out for Toxic, however. Snorlax has an awesome Special Defense stat, can take any hit that Lanturn dishes out, and sets up Curse on it fearlessly. Blissey stops Lanturn cold, but can't really hurt it back. It will always win a stall war one-on-one, however. Metagross can take anything Lanturn throws at it and can OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p>Venusaur resists both of Lanturn's STAB moves and can wear it down with Leech Seed or hit it hard with Razor Leaf. It can even set up with Swords Dance on it. However, Venusaur needs to avoid paralysis and Ice Beam. Exeggutor is in the same boat as Venusaur, but it also needs to watch out for paralysis and Ice Beam if attempting to sweep.</p> <p>Finally, although it can't switch in on Surf or Ice Beam, Dugtrio can trap and revenge kill Lanturn.</p>",

With reliable recovery in Rest and Volt Absorb constantly bringing it back up to high health, it is very durable. Sleep Talk stops Lanturn from being dead weight when asleep, and also means that it is not reliant on cleric support. Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB move that provides decent coverage alongside Surf. Alternatively, Ice Beam provides better coverage in general, allows Lanturn to hit Zapdos harder, and also puts a large dent into Grass- and Dragon-types--such as Venusaur and Flygon, respectively--that love to switch in on it. Celebi, however, shrugs off Ice Beam damage and can Recover any lost health.</p> <p>This set is easily trapped and killed by Dugtrio as it has to Rest at some point, which allows Dugtrio to switch in freely; Dugtrio can alternatively come in on a predicted Thunderbolt. When using this set, make sure that Lanturn attacks first with Surf or Ice Beam--as opposed to Thunderbolt--so that Dugtrio cannot freely switch in. Be careful about when you choose to let it use Rest as well.</p> <p>The given spread allows Lanturn to reach 401 HP, which means that it can survive five Seismic Tosses with Leftovers recovery, switch into three layers of Spikes four times, and also survive eight turns of Leech Seed damage. Maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature allow it to deal decent damage. The rest of the EVs are placed in Special Defense to maximize Lanturn's special bulk.</p> <p>Skarmory is an awesome partner for this set because of its immunity to Ground and 4x resistance to Grass, as well as its ability to check physical threats such as Snorlax and Salamence. In return, Lanturn can switch into Electric- and Fire-types attacks while beating Skarmory's counters, such as Starmie, one-on-one.</p>"

      "Parafusion": {
        "description": "<p>This set, as opposed to absorbing status like the RestTalk set, aims to spread status of its own around the opponent's team. It is best utilized alongside Spikes support, as Spikes puts opponents in a catch-22 situation; they are forced to make the difficult decision between staying in on Lanturn while confused and possibly taking confusion damage, or switching out and taking Spikes damage. Parafusion is also an excellent method to allow your hard-hitting Pokemon to switch in with more ease. Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray are the two most important moves on this set as they form the parafusion combination, while Thunderbolt is an obligatory STAB. There are two choices for the last slot--Surf provides another reliable STAB, while Ice Beam is an option for better type coverage, especially on the Grass-types that Lanturn despises. When using this set, like the RestTalk set, attack first with Surf or Ice Beam so Dugtrio can't just freely switch in and dispatch Lanturn.</p> <p>The issues with this set are its lack of reliable recovery outside of Volt Absorb and its vulnerability to being stalled or poisoned. Despite the fact that Lanturn can switch into Electric-type attacks with impunity and regain health, a good opponent can predict its switch-ins and wear it down by Spikes, sandstorm, status, or simply prediction. Additionally, many Electric-types now favor Hidden Power Grass or Toxic over Hidden Power Ice to hit Swampert, which reduces Lanturn's ability to wall them.</p> <p>This set synergizes excellently with all three of OU's premier Spikes users--Cloyster, Forretress, and Skarmory--not only type-wise, but also by forcing switches through inflicting confusion. Cloyster is also a large help to Lanturn in that it spins away the Spikes that this Lanturn dislikes. This set also works well alongside sweepers and hard-hitters such as Gyarados and Aerodactyl. Not only does Lanturn make it easier for them to switch in and fire off attacks or set up by paralyzing and confusing the opponent's Pokemon, the two aforementioned Pokemon also bait Electric-type moves for Lanturn to switch into and gain health from. This set is easily worn down by status; as such, clerics in general make good partners.</p>"

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>I can't stress enough how much Espeon does not have to be a special sweeper just because of its high Special Attack and Speed stats. Assuming this does a great disservice to the sexiness that is Calm Mind and Baton Pass, and Espeon can arguably pull this combination off the best, being only weak to Dark attacks specially. I honestly think that nothing can really \"counter\" EspyJump straight up, with Baton Pass and great Speed, besides Dugtrio if you don't have a Substitute up and are at full or near-full HP (Adamant Dugtrio does a maximum of 79% damage with Earthquake).</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Water can go over Baton Pass if you want a chance to take down some common Pokemon that think they've got Espeon in the bag: Metagross, Tyranitar, and Houndoom. You can also use Morning Sun for more staying power. Bite is an option for other Psychic-types but I wouldn't recommend it, because the more powerful Hidden Power Dark would be better since the Pokemon that are weak to Dark attacks, Psychics and Ghosts, are all usually faster than Espeon (read: Alakazam, Gengar, Starmie), so you won't be flinching the Pokemon that Bite is super effective against. Charm is there for annoyance, although it is still a move better suited for a Pokemon that is designed to actually take physical blows, like Umbreon. The same goes for Wish, really. Reflect can let Espeon keep up a Substitute against both physical and special attacks, but the only thing you could really drop for that is Psychic, which is just going to make life easier for phazers like Skarmory.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>EspyJump, surprising as it may seem, is a special tank. It is there to lull special attackers into a false sense of security, and then belie its charming exterior by setting up until your opponent realizes you've got three Calm Minds and a Substitute and there's no way that they can break your Substitutes efficiently. For this reason, I prescribe a Timid nature, putting 200 EVs in HP for 321, 236 in SpD for 285 and 72 in Speed for 301. This used to be 296 Speed because when I devised EspyJump in 2004, Choice Band Salamence and its 299 Speed had yet to be created; rather, Heracross and its max-295 speed was the thing to beat. 321 HP is used over 320, as this allows for an extra Substitute, since it's conceivable that Espeon takes no direct damage, thanks to Calm Mind and Substitute blocking attacks, especially if someone attempts to status Espeon, giving you a free turn. Remember, Espeon is not Alakazam, and it doesn't need to outspeed that much, especially if you have a Substitute up and can Baton Pass your Calm Minds to an appropriate teammate anyway before threats like Tauros and Slaking can get you.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Aerodactyl sacrifice and Dugtrio combo can counter this and like 90% of the things in the game, but I'll mention it again. The aforementioned Metagross, Tyranitar, and Houndoom are all effective counters to EspyJump somewhat, as is Claydol (they will all fall to Hidden Power Fire/Water though), but that is what Baton Pass is for, being faster than all of those Pokemon save Houndoom, whose attack you should be protected against via Substitute or Calm Mind anyway. Tyranitar messes with EspyJump the most, its Sand Stream negating the Leftovers that are integral to its efficacy. And of course I can't forget the obligatory Blissey mention, but again, Baton Pass (to a CursePert for example) makes the strategy behind EspyJump virtually uncounterable. Snorlax also forces a Baton Pass, and Skarmory and Suicune will Roar you the hell out if you don't attack them soon enough, and they of course aren't OHKOed anyway. Again, I feel that nothing can really be a \"counter\" to EspyJump unless it manages to phaze it, which Skarmory and a Roaring Suicune can do, which is why you shouldn't always just sit there and set up. If you're worried about getting Roared out, jack up its Special Attack--I'm an extremist and I know that putting absolutely no EVs into a Special Attack is so sexy (394 highest) is somewhat of a crime.</p> <h3>Jumpman16's Final Thoughts</h3> <p>Oh EspyJump, you are my first love. This Pokemon has no business being used so little, and I feel that it is often overlooked because most players think that it is just a weaker version of Alakazam. Espeon was just about my favorite Pokemon in GS because of its looks, and with what I learned it can do in Advance play my love for it just skyrocketed. It is an awesome Pokemon, and I suggest you all give it a try.</p>",
    "sets": {"EspyJump": {"description": "<p>Baton Pass is your friend. So is Calm Mind. You are encouraged to have a good special recipient of EspyJump's Calm Minds, though the Special Defense boost is always welcomed. You can bring it out against a non-STAB-boosted special attack as well, and then use your head and try to outpredict your opponent's status or attacking attempts. And honestly, I'm trying to think of a better Celebi counter than EspyJump, and I really can't. If you manage to status some of your opponent's Pokemon and Celebi pops out, you should immediately be salivating at your keyboard. The predictable Heal Bell, and the high probability that Espeon's \"nemesis\" Blissey is not also being used by your opponent, gives you a great opportunity to set EspyJump up if you play it smart, and Substitute regardless of whether they Leech Seed or switch.</p>"}}
  },
  "Umbreon": {
    "overview": "<p>Umbreon can be an extremely deadly Pokemon because of its access to Mean Look, Baton Pass, and Taunt. It can make a great wall as well as a good supporter, and contributes Mean Look, Wish, Charm, and good Substitutes to a Baton Pass chain. It might open your team up to powerful hits such as Heracross's Megahorn and Focus Punch, though, so be careful. Pairing it with Dugtrio and using Baton Pass the first turn Umbreon is out is a good way to quickly patch up this weakness, however.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Umbreon can soften up opponents with Charm and Tickle for a teammate to sweep. It can also run Charm along with Wish to counter Curse users pretty easily. Torment can further aggravate opponents and Pursuit can be used as an offensive option, but these are generally not recommended due to their unreliability. Umbreon can also use Snatch with Baton Pass to catch boosts such as Dragon Dance and Curse as it is typically setup bait. Psychic can hurt common switch-ins such as Gengar and Heracross, but it has little other use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jolteon, Espeon, Mr. Mime, and other fast Substitute + Baton Pass users are Umbreon's best checks, while Taunt users such as Gyarados, Gengar, and Houndoom can prevent Umbreon from doing anything. If Umbreon doesn't invest in Speed, Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up on it too. Medicham, Primeape, Breloom, Hariyama, and Heracross can use their STAB Fighting- or Bug-type moves to stop Umbreon, and the Guts users among them love Toxic as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mean Look + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This set is best used with Perish Song Celebi and boosting sweepers. Once you get Umbreon in safely, Taunt phazers and stat-boosters, use Mean Look, and pass to a counter. This strategy is harder than it seems, but it can be extremely effective in the hands of a skilled player. Wish is better if you can use it with proper prediction, especially as it can potentially heal a teammate, but Moonlight's instant healing is also highly useful. However, note that Moonlight's healing is halved in sandstorm.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs enable Umbreon to outspeed Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Maximize HP and dump the rest in Defense.</p>"},
      "Curse + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Umbreon can also Baton Pass Curse boosts. Once again, it can block any attempts at phazing from the likes of Aerodactyl with Taunt and set up Curse to better tank physical hits while relying on its amazing Special Defense to sponge special attacks. Once it is done setting up, Umbreon can Baton Pass to a fast sweeper with a White Herb for a winning sweep.</p>"},
      "WishPasser": {"description": "<p>Wish is yet another useful tool with which Umbreon can use Baton Pass to support its teammates. The 0 Speed IV and Speed-lowering nature ensure Baton Pass goes last so that Umbreon--and not its recipient--takes the incoming hit.</p>"},
      "Mean Look + Toxic": {"description": "<p>This set can be exceedingly difficult to stop if used in conjunction with Magneton to eliminate Skarmory; Poison-types will still shut Umbreon down completely though. Houndoom is also a nice partner for this set as it can Pursuit Poison-types such as Gengar and Weezing. All Umbreon has to do is switch in safely; it can then begin a cycle of misery for the opponent by trapping the foe with Mean Look, hitting it with Toxic, and blocking recovery with Taunt, healing off any damage taken in the process with Moonlight or Wish.</p>"}

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snatch can catch a nice Substitute on opponents that expect Confuse Ray or Thunder Wave. Pain Split is a decent idea for recovering HP, as Misdreavus's HP is still low even after investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Counters to Misdreavus include Raikou, Tyranitar, Metagross, Gengar, and Houndoom; these Pokemon are faster then Misdreavus and will do serious damage thanks to Misdreavus's below-average bulk.

The latter's faster Taunt makes it possibly a better option, but Misdreavus's advantages lie in its slightly higher Special Defense and its lack of weakness to Psychic. Nonetheless, Perish trapping is just as--if not more--effective in ADV thanks to Taunt. Trap the foe, Protect to regain health from Leftovers, then use Perish Song or Taunt depending on who is on the field. Stall with Protect and Taunt until it falls, then switch out. Use Destiny Bond if you are sure Misdreavus isn't going to survive the three-turn setup Perish Song needs.</p> <p>This set works best when partnered with Jirachi, who can provide Wish support. Jirachi can also take Explosion, which the opponent will likely use on the last turn of Perish Song to hit the switch-in.</p>"},
      "Calm Mind": {"description": "<p>A cool set, to tell you the truth. Taunt prevents Blissey from using Soft-Boiled and Thunder Wave. Misdreavus can then proceed to set up with Calm Mind and lay the smack down with Thunderbolt.</p>"},

Imprison therefore prevents them from touching it, and can prove very frustrating. With Thunder Wave on the set, Misdreavus can't be paralyzed bar Stun Spore. It also works nicely alongside Hidden Power Ice--which forces Ground-types to switch--to help spread paralysis.</p>"}

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress has established itself as a strong pillar of the ADV metagame due to its access to both Spikes and Rapid Spin. Its Steel / Bug typing, solid resilience, and role compression give common Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm teams versatility in fitting other Pokemon. Forretress can use its good bulk to set up Spikes on Pokemon that cannot threaten it effectively, such as Skarmory, most Metagross, most Blissey, Milotic, some Celebi, some Zapdos, defensive Swampert, and Porygon2. With Pursuit support, it can also be an effective counter to many TSS teams due to its prowess as a spinner.</p> <p>Forretress is commonly compared to Skarmory and Cloyster as a Spiker and Claydol and defensive Starmie as a spinner. In comparison to Skarmory, Forretress is much more difficult to trap with Magneton, as Forretress's Earthquake OHKOes variants not specifically EVed to survive it. In addition, Modest Magneton's Hidden Power Fire has only a 25% chance to OHKO Forretress, whereas Magneton's Magnet-boosted Thunderbolt is much more likely to eliminate Skarmory. Forretress is much more resilient than Cloyster due to its Toxic and sand immunity as well as superior special bulk. As a spinner, Forretress is a better counter to Skarmory than Claydol and Starmie due to its Toxic immunity; Claydol can run Refresh but is vulnerable to Skarmory's Taunt. Skarmory can still use Taunt on Forretress to prevent Spikes or actively wear it down with Drill Peck, however.</p> <p>Forretress's primary faults lie in its tendency to get worn down, weakness to specially defensive Gengar, and relative passivity. Forretress performs worse as a physical wall than Skarmory despite its numerical bulk advantage, as it can't phaze, typically can't fit Protect to passively recover health, and is damaged by Spikes. Cloyster's superior Speed, resistance to Water, and immunity to being trapped by Magneton allow it to be used on offensive teams that can't fit the rigid support Forretress teams need. Unlike Claydol, Forretress is not immune to the Spikes it is removing, and unlike Starmie, it cannot use a recovery move nor heal status by switching. Forretress is also vulnerable to surprise Fire-type moves from Pokemon such as Metagross and Blissey, which often greatly weaken or OHKO it. Additionally, due to the prominence of specially defensive Gengar, which can't be OHKOed by Tyranitar's Pursuit, Forretress will struggle to use Rapid Spin, as its sets typically have very weak or no options to hurt it. Forretress is also quite easy to set up on with Pokemon like Curse Snorlax, Substitute Heracross, and Jirachi, as its only counterplay is to use Explosion or hit them with weak coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Forretress is generally required to be specially defensive, but it has quite a few options for its last moveslots. One of the more prominent of these is Counter, which can defeat Hidden Power Fire variants of Magneton, mixed Metagross, and Celebi—Counter always succeeds against Hidden Power in ADV. Counter also allows Forretress to act as a physical wall, notably improving its matchup against Metagross, Tyranitar, Snorlax, Gyarados, Heracross, and Dugtrio. Forretress survives Snorlax's +6 Earthquake, avoids a 2HKO from even +1 Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash, and takes any of +2 Heracross's attacks bar Focus Punch. Forretress can also use Counter to surprise threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Tyranitar, as they need multiple boosts to OHKO Forretress. Counter additionally improves Forretress's matchup against Drill Peck Skarmory—a common way to chip Forretress is using Drill Peck whenever it tries to remove Spikes, but Forretress outdamages Skarmory with Counter.</p> <p>Zap Cannon is often used in tandem with Counter or even over Rapid Spin. It allows Forretress to chip and paralyze Gengar and hit Skarmory fairly hard. Notably, Zap Cannon + Pursuit from Tyranitar is a guaranteed KO on 248 HP / 112 SpD Gengar in sand. Zap Cannon's unreliability is its main drawback, but against Skarmory, Forretress has quite a few chances to use it. Forretress can use a variety of Hidden Power types, such as Hidden Power Fire for completely invalidating opposing Forretress—it does 38.4 - 45.1%—and doing some small chip damage to Skarmory, Hidden Power Ghost for hitting Gengar as hard as possible, and Hidden Power Flying for teams horribly weak to Heracross. These alternate Hidden Power types allow for versatility in choosing teammates—Hidden Power Fire can cover for a lack of Gengar to block opposing Forretress's Rapid Spin, as an example. For both Hidden Power Fire and Zap Cannon, make sure to give Forretress a Sassy nature to increase power.</p> <p>Toxic is also a very nice choice on Forretress, as many of its common switch-ins, such as non-Refresh Claydol, Starmie, Moltres, and Salamence really hate being poisoned. It additionally improves Forretress's match-up against Cloyster considerably; watch out for Gengar or Magneton switching into Toxic, however. Forretress can also run Protect to help with residual damage or Light Screen to assist with tanking special hits from Magneton or to help teammates; however, these moves are often difficult to fit.</p> <p>Despite being very slow, maximum Speed investment allows Forretress to use Explosion on most Claydol sets before they can remove Spikes on aggressive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar spinblocks and forces Forretress out, making it take more Spikes damage when it switches in again to remove Spikes. Defensive Gengar avoids the OHKO after sand from Pursuit Tyranitar, whereas offensive Gengar can run Hidden Power Grass, Hypnosis, or even Focus Punch to defeat Pursuit Tyranitar on the switch. Even a defensive Gengar hit by Pursuit on the switch is a risk to Forretress, as Forretress commonly runs sets that do little or no damage to Gengar. If Forretress chooses to stay in, it risks being burned or possibly OHKOed by Gengar's Fire Punch. Dusclops is rare but threatens Forretress the same way.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Forretress can beat Magneton, but Magneton will always do major damage to Forretress with Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt before falling to Earthquake if it switches in safely. Additionally, Magneton can use an EV spread of 240 HP / 80 Def to survive Forretress's Earthquake. Hidden Power Fire Magneton should be careful of the occasional Counter, which will always OHKO it if it uses Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Forretress is not immune to Spikes, and therefore, it can be worn down easily if not played carefully. An example of this unfavorable situation is Skarmory using Taunt against Forretress to prevent Spikes, then switching to Gengar on the ensuing Rapid Spin. Being forced in via Roar with Spikes down wears Forretress down quite a bit.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves and Pokemon</strong>: Teams with multiple Pokemon using Fire-type moves, such as Moltres, Charizard, Blaziken, Fire Blast Tyranitar, and Fire Blast Salamence as well as surprise ones from Blissey, Metagross, Snorlax, Porygon2, and Regice, can greatly damage, if not OHKO, Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Setup Threats</strong>: Forretress and its common partners are frequently weak to Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, Celebi, and Suicune. Forretress without Hidden Power Bug or Explosion is setup fodder for these Pokemon, and it is generally scared of Jirachi and Celebi's Fire-type coverage. This weakness is exacerbated by Forretress's most common phazer teammates being Pursuit Tyranitar and Swampert with Surf as its only attack, both of which don't have strong offensive pressure and are defensively poor against Grass- and Water-type coverage. Forretress's offensive output besides Explosion does not scare physical sweepers like Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Substitute or Swords Dance Heracross. While these Pokemon typically won't try to switch in and counter Forretress, they can be very dangerous against Forretress and its common partners with momentum.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Claydol, Starmie, opposing Forretress, and even Donphan can easily remove the Spikes that Forretress sets up. While Forretress can combat these Pokemon, they can easily weaken Forretress so that another threat such as Magneton or Dugtrio can remove it with certainty. Forretress needs Hidden Power Bug to have any chance against Starmie and Claydol, whereas Forretress will stalemate with itself unless it has Hidden Power Fire. Donphan doesn't particularly care about anything Forretress runs besides Toxic and Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Forretress sets Spikes up against a wide variety of Pokemon and can often do so multiple times a game due to its bulk. With maximum special bulk and Leftovers, Forretress shields itself as much as possible against Magneton and greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can use Spikes on, like Milotic and Zapdos. In addition, this allows Forretress to better combat defensive Starmie trying to remove Spikes. Almost all Forretress run Rapid Spin due to Spikes's prominence in the metagame. Beware of teams likely to have defensive Gengar, as opponents will often liberally bring it in on Forretress with their Spikes laid to prevent losing them as well as to force Forretress out.</p> <p>After Spikes and Rapid Spin, Forretress's options open up quite a bit, letting it defeat some of its counters or be a general threat with Explosion. Hidden Power Bug helps against Claydol and Starmie as well as Celebi and Tyranitar. It is a guaranteed 3HKO at least on both Claydol and Starmie—this discourages them from performing their duty of removing Spikes. It also 2HKOes all variants of Celebi, which is useful due to Forretress teams frequently being weak to Celebi passing Calm Mind or Swords Dance. If Gengar tries to block Rapid Spin, Hidden Power Bug can remove it after sand if it was hit by Pursuit upon switching out, easing Forretress's ability to keep Spikes off the field. Earthquake Forretress OHKOes most Magneton and damages Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi. If you suspect Magneton is on the opposing team, aggressively using Earthquake as it comes in can be a game-winning play. Earthquake's utility against Metagross can be very important to stop it, especially Choice Band sets, from accumulating chances for Meteor Mash boosts and potentially steamrolling Forretress's team, especially since the best common option to phaze Metagross is a Roar Swampert that lacks its own Earthquake. Earthquake also gives Forretress an option to combat Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Substitute non-Fire Punch Jirachi in desperate situations. Forretress can additionally use Explosion, which notably prevents setup from Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Salamence. It can additionally eliminate threats coming in, such as Moltres and Charizard. Smart uses of Explosion include against incoming Claydol and Starmie to keep Spikes up, on paralyzed threats to end turns—since Explosion prevents action by slower threats in ADV—or even against Rock-resistant Pokemon or walls to set up an Aerodactyl or mixed Salamence sweep. Be careful of Gengar switching in, however. Picking two of Hidden Power Bug, Earthquake, and Explosion is up to personal preference outside of teams with specific needs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress needs specific support from its teammates in order to be most effective: Pursuit support for removing Gengar, special walls for the strong threats like Moltres it often attracts, good physical answers for the threats that try to set up on it, like Salamence and Snorlax, and Pokemon that take advantage of the extra residual damage Spikes provides. Tyranitar is by far the best partner for Forretress. It not only sets up the sand that helps make Spikes damage stick, but it also Pursuit traps Gengar, acts as a solid answer to Moltres as well as some Snorlax, and takes advantage of Spikes with Roar or a well-timed Focus Punch. With smart play, Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Claydol and Starmie to prevent Rapid Spin, but be careful of their Earthquake and Surf, which will typically 2HKO Tyranitar. However, Forretress's Pursuit trapper does not have to be Tyranitar—Umbreon and Houndoom are other options that can also free up Tyranitar to run a physical set, such as Choice Band, Dragon Dance, or bulky physical attacker, that benefits more from Spikes. Forretress can also be run without a Pursuit Pokemon if it has additional assistance from another Rapid Spin user such as Claydol, though this pairing is relatively niche. Gengar is another good Forretress teammate because it not only greatly appreciates Spikes, but it also helps keep Spikes up against Claydol, Starmie, opposing Forretress, and even the rare Donphan. A Forretress, Gengar, and Tyranitar core is commonly used to take advantage of Spikes and keep them up against spinners while also finding opportunities to trap and remove them.</p> <p>As for special walls, the standard on many Forretress teams is Blissey, often with Wish to help Forretress deal with residual damage. It also commonly runs Counter, sometimes with Wish as well, due to Forretress teams generally being weak to mixed sweepers such as Salamence and Tyranitar. This point is especially true when the team does not have strong physical walls. However, the special wall can easily be Jirachi, which has an easier time fitting Wish, works well with Pursuit trappers to prevent Gengar from burning it, and shores the team up against physical threats such as Metagross, Fighting-type Pokemon, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. Wish support in general from not only Blissey and Jirachi but also Salamence and Umbreon can be helpful to keep Forretress and its teammates healthy, especially if Spikes can't be removed as easily. Celebi can fill the specially defensive role, as it is stronger against defensive Water-types such as Rest Suicune and switches into Leech Seed from opposing Celebi and Venusaur. Beware of offensive Water-types such as fast Calm Mind Suicune and Starmie hitting hard or freezing with potentially boosted Ice Beam, however. Specially defensive Roar + Rest Zapdos is a good choice on these teams, as it provides additional support against Calm Mind Pokemon like Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune and mixed Salamence, which often tries to take advantage of Forretress. It also is great as additional support against offensive Water-types, such as the aforementioned Suicune and Starmie, which love to spam Hydro Pump against Forretress and its common teammates. Furthermore, it stops Gyarados from taking advantage of Forretress's passivity. Zapdos can even use Light Screen to give Forretress a better chance against Magneton.</p> <p>For physical walls, Forretress appreciates Pokemon like Swampert and Flygon to help the team handle physical threats such as Tyranitar and Salamence. Defensive Metagross, Milotic, and bulky Roar Suicune can also work on some Forretress teams, as they check the Rock-type threats and Metagross that can break apart Forretress teams. Milotic is especially nice here, as it also is a fantastic counter to Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard as well as mixed Salamence, which prey on Forretress and its common teammates. Dugtrio can also be helpful on some Forretress teams because it can trap threats such as Calm Mind Celebi, Calm Mind Jirachi, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Heracross—dangerous Pokemon that are typically difficult to handle for many Forretress teams.</p> <p>Forretress really appreciates Pokemon that can take advantage of Spikes. Roar is a good option to repeatedly force Spikes damage on foes, and it can easily be fit on essential teammates, such as Pursuit Tyranitar, Swampert, Suicune, and even mixed Salamence. Outside of Roar users, Zapdos, physical Tyranitar, Gengar, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Venusaur, and Moltres work well. Aerodactyl is especially strong, as it not only benefits from a good Skarmory answer and Pursuit support, but it also cleans effectively with Spikes and helps against Calm Mind and Swords Dance Baton Pass Celebi with Hidden Power Bug. Moltres is a nice middle-ground switch-in against Gengar, as it is immune to Gengar's Will-O-Wisp and takes a pittance from Grass-type coverage and Focus Punch meant for catching Pursuit Tyranitar. Moltres, Salamence, and Gengar also provide a switch-in to Heracross—a dangerous threat that takes advantage of the lack of Drill Peck Skarmory on these types of teams. Very aggressive Forretress teams can also run their own Fighting-type Pokemon such as Medicham, Breloom, or Hariyama, as its role compression of Spiker and spinner allows TSS teams to fit a variety of Pokemon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Steelix makes for an excellent wall as it can sponge attacks from a large number of standards, can beat Metagross and most Tyranitar with STAB Earthquake, and can use the powerful Explosion to take out a threat. It can also phaze threats such as Snorlax and Baton Pass Zapdos while beating any Raikou that lacks Hidden Power Water; in other words, virtually all of them. However, it isn't used much because of its subpar offenses; base 85 Attack is not impressive at all, and consequently, quite a few standards take little damage from its attacks. It is far from unusable, though; it is one of the best BL Pokemon available.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Block can be useful for trapping and severely weakening a Water-type switch-in. Steelix can usually survive the Surf to use Explosion, which opens up a sweep for an attacker that is walled by bulky Water-types, such as Salamence. Psych Up can let Steelix steal Curse boosts from Snorlax or even Regirock; it can then Roar them out or just beat them one-on-one.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory, Cloyster, and Forretress can set up Spikes in Steelix's face easily, though Cloyster must watch out for Toxic. In general, any Water-type with decent defenses can come in easily, shrug off Steelix's hits, and OHKO or 2HKO it with Surf; examples include Suicune, Swampert, Milotic, Slowbro, and Vaporeon. Moltres can OHKO Steelix with any Fire-type move as long as it avoids Rock Slide and Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p>Fire- and Water-type attacks hurt Steelix a lot, unboosted or otherwise, and any decent neutral special attack will also seriously harm it. Its physical weaknesses aren't quite as big of an issue, but a boosted Brick Break or Earthquake will deal heavy damage; Choice Band sweepers such as Aerodactyl, Medicham, and Heracross thus make good checks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Wall": {"description": "<p>Steelix can easily switch into Normal- and Flying-type attacks, most Electric-types, Metagross, and Snorlax, and then attack accordingly. Earthquake is Steelix's most reliable STAB move, while Toxic cripples Water-types and other bulky Pokemon it cannot otherwise hurt. Hidden Power Rock hits Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake, but Toxic is generally the preferred option in the second moveslot. With cleric support, Steelix can gain a new lease of life with Rest; alternatively, Explosion allows it to go out with a bang when its job is done. However, the greatest flaw with Steelix as a wall is its lack of instant attacking power.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>A Choice Band set somewhat patches up Steelix's low Attack, but it's still slow and unable to hurt common Water-type switch-ins; it also greatly misses Leftovers recovery. Still, Steelix is easy enough to switch in and can punch holes in the opponent's team with some prediction. Earthquake is Steelix's most powerful STAB attack. Iron Tail and Hidden Power Steel are both options for its Steel-type STAB, and the choice between them comes down to a simple power vs. accuracy argument; the former is preferred as it is Steelix's most powerful option against Gengar, Aerodactyl, and Regice. There are three options for the third moveslot: Double-Edge is a powerful move with good neutral coverage, while Hidden Power Rock and Rock Slide deal heavy damage to Zapdos. Finally, Explosion provides one last powerful hit when Steelix has been weakened.</p>"}

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor is an interesting Pokemon. Its type, Bug / Steel, is a cool defensive type with only one weakness (4x to Fire). It has a base Attack of 130. It can learn Agility to make up for its low Speed. Finally, it can survive most Explosions with about 10% or 20% to spare. So, the question remains: why the hell isn't it used more often?</p> <p>Simple: its offensive movepool sucks. The only useful attacks it gets are Silver Wind, Steel Wing, and Hidden Power. While it does get STAB off Silver Wind and Steel Wing, their low Base Powers mean they won't do any major damage to teams. Physical walls and tanks completely shut it down, any Fire-type attack will always OHKO it, and even Blissey can hurt it with Thunder Wave if it lacks Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>However, for what it has to work with, Scizor isn't too bad. On occasion, Silver Wind can give stat boosts and provide it with some additional staying power. Agility grants it the potential to sweep. It can OHKO Psychic-types that lack a Fire move, such as Alakazam without Fire Punch; it can survive any attack from Aerodactyl and OHKO back with Steel Wing; finally, it can OHKO Jolteon with Hidden Power Ground. Scizor is not a bad Pokemon, but requires some setup and, occasionally, a little luck.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can let Scizor bounce back some boosted hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Fire-type attack can take it down; most special attackers will eventually break through it as well. Phazers such as Skarmory and Suicune can keep Scizor from successfully using Baton Pass while walling any attacks it can throw their way.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Try to nab an Agility or Swords Dance boost on the switch. While Scizor can sweep decently, it is rather underpowered due to lack of a good movepool. Hidden Power Rock takes down Salamence and other Flying-types, and also nails Houndoom.</p>"},
      "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Scizor fits nicely into a Baton Pass chain. Aside from Mawile, it is the only Baton Pass user that resists Normal-type attacks, and it has the HP and Defense to back this up. Substitute is a must here to block critical hits; it also blocks random status moves and scouts for Fire Blast on the likes of Snorlax. Silver Wind is useful for Tyranitar, but do invest in Scizor's Attack if taking this route. Otherwise, focus on Scizor's HP and defenses.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {"description": "<p>With Liechi Berry activated, Scizor's Reversal does more damage than even Heracross's. Agility ensures Scizor will go first, while Scizor's Steel typing ensures it won't die to sandstorm after using Endure.</p> <p>Don't be tempted to use either Salac Berry or Substitute; keep Scizor's poor base 65 Speed in mind. Even after the Salac boost, it cannot outspeed Jolteon and Aerodactyl, but Agility lets it outspeed everything but Ninjask. In fact, if you like, you can give Scizor 176 Speed EVs to let it outrun Adamant Ninjask, but even with the full 252 Speed EVs, Scizor cannot outspeed Jolly Ninjask, and it's not worth it to run a Jolly nature purely to beat out Ninjask.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set can hit hard off the bat; however, it has some trouble with enemy Steel-types. Baton Pass is an option in the last slot to scout and maintain momentum, and is particularly effective when used alongside Magneton and Dugtrio to trap the likes of Skarmory.</p>"}

  },
  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>With its high Attack stat and powerful STAB Megahorn, Heracross is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers in ADV OU that threatens slow-paced teams with Pokemon such as Claydol and defensive Celebi. Even its checks are not foolproof, as Gengar dares not burn it because of Guts, while Dugtrio risks being caught by Substitute or Salac Berry variants. Generally speaking, with support from trappers, Choice Band Heracross's STAB moves can easily overwhelm an opposing team.</p> <p>However, although Heracross can pivot into bulky Water-types such as Milotic, it doesn't contribute much defensively; Salamence is troublesome for offensive teams with Heracross, while some balanced teams with Heracross suffer against Moltres. In addition, a well-switched Dugtrio can remove Heracross before it works.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Chesto Berry and Hidden Power Ghost, Heracross can lure and wear down Hypnosis Gengar. Chesto Berry can also be used alongside Rest for extra longevity. Endure or Substitute + Reversal sets can be really powerful, but sand limits their viability. Still, these sets can be used with weather changers like Charizard and Kingdra, and even without Reversal, Heracross pairs well with them anyway, exploiting their Dugtrio synergy and acting as an offensive pivot into special walls. Hidden Power Rock doesn't have accuracy issues compared to Rock Slide, and Rock Tomb might help Heracross overcome hovering threats by lowering their Speed or even deter Salamence or Gyarados from setting up with Dragon Dance. Hidden Power Flying can be used on teams weak to opposing Heracross. Thief potentially steals Leftovers from Salamence and Gengar, which are notoriously difficult to lure and remove entirely. A Bulk Up set with three attacks is an interesting prospect for Heracross. Although it is generally outclassed by its Swords Dance counterpart, with Salamence and Gyarados still OHKOing it even at +1 Defense anyway, Bulk Up allows Heracross to survive Dugtrio's Aerial Ace. Earthquake is a reliable option for Metagross and Jirachi, but Megahorn usually does enough to them. Body Slam, with some luck, can be used to paralyze and disable almost all hovering threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados resist Heracross's STAB attacks, have Intimidate to reduce damage, and can OHKO back with Hidden Power Flying or threaten to take the opportunity to set up with Dragon Dance. Mixed Salamence also has Fire Blast for Heracross. Still, Rock Slide hits both of them hard. Skarmory resists Megahorn, takes about 30% from Brick Break, hits Heracross hard with Drill Peck, and can take the opportunity to lay Spikes. However, it is unreliable because it can be severely damaged by Focus Punch and trapped by Magneton. Offensive Zapdos outspeeds Heracross, can use Roar to prevent it from setting up, and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt or OHKO it with Drill Peck, but it is not a reliable check at all, as it can get taken out by successive hits of Megahorn and Rock Slide. Furthermore, Choice Band Heracross can OHKO Zapdos with Rock Slide. Aerodactyl can pivot into unboosted attacks and OHKO Heracross with Hidden Power Flying, but it will not survive Focus Punch or boosted Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gengar can use Fire Punch to 2HKO Heracross, Explosion to trade, or Hypnosis to put Heracross to sleep. It can also burn Swarm Heracross with Will-O-Wisp. Weezing resists Megahorn and can eliminate Heracross with Fire Blast, Flamethrower, or Sludge Bomb. Especially with Gengar, one might want to avoid inflicting Heracross with status through Will-O-Wisp for fear of activating Guts.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can trap and take out Heracross with Aerial Ace. However, it's not going to take hits bar Rock Slide and Hidden Power Ghost and is very prone to allowing Salac Berry variants to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Moltres and Charizard resist STAB moves from Heracross and can OHKO uninvested variants, but they are OHKOed by Rock Slide. Houndoom outspeeds Heracross and OHKOes it with Fire Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set mostly acts as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker, capitalizing on bulky Psychic-, Normal-, and Water-types. Megahorn OHKOes Celebi and Claydol, has a chance to 3HKO defensive Suicune and Swampert, and 2HKOes Blissey and Snorlax. Furthermore, it can also allow Heracross to hold its ground against more offensive non-hovering special threats by threatening to 2HKO offensive Suicune and OHKO Jolteon. Rock Slide punishes switch-ins such as Salamence, Gyarados, Zapdos, and Moltres. Focus Punch is for a predicted switch to Skarmory, thus being mostly used when Magneton is absent on the team. In addition, it exploits Rest Pokemon such as Snorlax and Hariyama. Otherwise, Brick Break 2HKOes Snorlax and Blissey without the inaccuracy of Megahorn and OHKOes Magneton.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Swords Dance gives Heracross the ability to sweep bulkier teams and can be used set up on a predicted switch or a Choice-locked Earthquake. After a Swords Dance, Rock Slide OHKOes Zapdos and offensive Gengar and has a chance to OHKO Adamant Gyarados and slower variants of Salamence. Substitute pairs well with Focus Punch, allowing Heracross to scout for Drill Peck on Skarmory and potentially play mind games with it. Substitute can also catch an attempted sacrifice into a Dugtrio trap, protect Heracross from Forretress, bring Heracross into Swarm range, and exploit the miss rate of Swampert's Hydro Pump. Adamant Hidden Power Ghost comfortably KOes Gengar in sand after Megahorn, making Heracross a Gengar lure.</p> <p>Guts is generally the preferred ability on this set to allow Heracross to face Gengar and Zapdos without fear, but Swarm is appropriate when the team has additional Gengar pivots like Starmie and when Heracross's HP can be controlled with Substitute. An Adamant nature increases the odds that Suicune, Swampert, Snorlax, Metagross, Gengar, and Gyarados are taken out with one less hit, but Jolly allows Heracross to outspeed slower variants of Salamence, Modest Zapdos, and Modest Moltres. Jolly Heracross only needs 216 Speed EVs to outspeeds Modest Moltres and Timid Venusaur, so the rest can be allocated to bulk.</p> <p>Heracross can also be given varying amounts of bulk. Bulk EVs are useful on the Leftovers set, as this Heracross doesn't get chipped into KO range by sand. Although maximum Speed is straightforward, a little bulk can go a long way; lowering the Speed to 250 and putting the remaining EVs in HP lets Heracross outspeed Adamant Claydol while increasing the odds of surviving Jirachi's and Celebi's Psychic, fast variants of which offensive teams frequently use to check Heracross. Swarm might be preferred here, as Heracross gets a 50% chance to OHKO bulkless Jirachi after taking Psychic. An alternative way to EV Heracross is to make it bulky with 144 HP / 184 SpD, which allows Heracross to survive Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt twice, Timid Moltres's Flamethrower in sand, and +1 Adamant Dragon Dance Tyranitar's Rock Slide in sand. The rest of the EVs are split between Attack and Speed; Heracross should achieve at least 244 Speed to outrun Jolly Tyranitar, but it is recommended to add more Speed EVs to creep Celebi, Jirachi, and Zapdos that also try to achieve the same benchmark.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio easily traps Heracross without Substitute or Salac Berry, so having one's own Dugtrio or Porygon2 as a partner can be helpful either to trap Dugtrio beforehand or to revenge kill it. By using Heracross as bait, this core also paves the way for other Dugtrio-weak teammates like Tyranitar, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou to shine. Porygon2 also defensively synergizes with Heracross; of all Dugtrio-immune threats, Salamence is the one that Heracross finds the hardest time breaking through, but apart from Choice Band-boosted Brick Break, Porygon2 nullifies whatever Salamence throws at it. In addition to the Dugtrio revenge kill tactic, offensive Celebi and Jirachi also appreciate the chip damage that Heracross induces on Salamence and Zapdos, bringing them into KO range of boosted Psychic. Defensively, with Dugtrio, Jirachi suffices as a Rock-resistant Pokemon that only needs to halt Aerodactyl, because Heracross exerts massive offensive pressure on Tyranitar, and Dugtrio can revenge kill Tyranitar should something go wrong. Celebi and Jirachi also appreciate Heracross's ability to pivot into Hidden Power Bug or Earthquake from Tyranitar, and Heracross gets to come in for free after Dugtrio takes the grounded Psychic-types out.</p> <p>Paralysis support such as Thunder Wave from Zapdos onto opposing Zapdos or Jolteon or Thunder Wave from Gyarados onto the opponent's whole slew of fast threats allows Heracross to fully exploit its high Attack without being forced out. Substitute Heracross can also exploit opportunities generated by full paralysis. Through Baton Pass or double switching, Zapdos provides entry points for Heracross by luring Blissey, Celebi, Snorlax, Claydol, and Tyranitar. Furthermore, Zapdos provides coverage against Dugtrio-immune threats like Gyarados, Skarmory, Gengar, Moltres and Charizard, which all annoy Heracross. Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert check Salamence, which comes in rather freely on Heracross. Suicune can pivot into Moltres and Charizard, while Swampert can also pivot into and play mind games with Zapdos. In addition, they can lure and weaken Zapdos.</p> <p>Other physical threats can also complement Heracross. Choice Band or mixed Metagross can lure Skarmory and Zapdos in and either wear them down or take them out with Explosion and Thunder Punch or Rock Slide. Occasionally, Heracross's Ground resistance allows it to be a pivot into Claydol's Earthquake for Metagross. As a Water-type pivot, Heracross can bear the brunt of the opponent's bulky Water-types, softening the opponent's team before Tyranitar presents itself. Chipping Metagross, Gengar, and Zapdos with Heracross is going to be immensely useful in preparing for a sweep by Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, or mixed Salamence. To obtain these setup opportunities, Dragon Dance sweepers can capitalize on Choice-locked Aerial Ace from Dugtrio, and conversely, Heracross can exploit Dugtrio revenge killing Tyranitar or Metagross in the same vein as Jirachi to chip its checks.</p> <p>Finally, Magneton can be used with Heracross to remove Skarmory, but this is perhaps the set that least requires Magneton support due to Focus Punch. Still, removing Drill Peck Skarmory in particular eliminates the need for making predictions with Focus Punch.</p>"
      },
      "SubSalac": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The key to this set is that with Swords Dance, Swarm, and Salac Berry, Heracross becomes a threatening sweeper that outspeeds and annihilates almost the entire metagame with Megahorn. Substitute is primarily used to activate Salac Berry and to get into Swarm range, but it also blocks status moves and eases prediction. The last move depends on whether or not Magneton is present on the team to eliminate Skarmory. Without Skarmory around, Rock Slide provides better coverage; after a Swords Dance, Rock Slide OHKOes bulkless Salamence and Gyarados 75% of the time even after Intimidate, and OHKOes Moltres, Charizard, and defensive Zapdos as well. Note that with Swarm and STAB, even resisted Megahorn is almost as strong as super effective Rock Slide and will OHKO offensive Zapdos and Aerodactyl after Swords Dance. Focus Punch 2HKOes Skarmory and combines well with Substitute to alleviate predictions, especially against Drill Peck Skarmory. With 30 HP IVs, Salac Berry activates after the third Substitute, preventing sand from immediately KOing Heracross before it can sweep.</p> <p>This Heracross plays out rather differently depending on the filler move. With Rock Slide, the preferred gameplan involves taking out Heracross's checks before revealing itself, as it cannot do much with unboosted Megahorn early-game. However, with Focus Punch, Heracross can also do some wallbreaking early-game so that even if it eventually finds its HP too low to sweep, it has paved the way for teammates to take over. In brief, the Focus Punch variant lends itself to more fluid situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In general, Salac Berry Heracross features on fast-paced offensive teams. With Rock Slide in the filler moveslot, it requires Magneton support to remove Skarmory. Gengar doesn't necessarily prohibit Heracross from sweeping, but Heracross falls short of OHKOing it after a Swords Dance and Swarm boost. So, Pursuit Metagross helps to obtain that chip damage on Gengar; compared to Pursuit Tyranitar, it not only avoids setting up Sand Stream, which chips down Salac Berry Heracross, but also has more offensive presence with Explosion. Speaking of sand, having a fast Pokemon with Rain Dance or Sunny Day such as Zapdos, Salamence, or Suicune helps to clear the sky for Heracross's longevity. Magneton can also clear sand, but it is unreliable for doing so due to its propensity of being trapped and its lackluster Speed. With Magneton for first trapping Metagross, it is also possible to use offensive Snorlax with Earthquake and Self-Destruct to bait and remove Tyranitar for the weather change. Offensive Suicune is a partner with complementary sweeping abilities; while Heracross is impressive at taking out stall teams but may have some trouble breaking through a well-played Salamence, especially with Intimidate drops, or staying alive with sand in play from late-game Tyranitar, offensive Suicune tends to be able to clean up against these physical or mixed threats. Salamence can be a partner with multiple functions: mixed Salamence can lure in and chip Gengar, and with its Speed, it can even clean up if Heracross misses a hit, while Dragon Dance Salamence complements Heracross in its ability to cleave through offenses while Heracross punches through stalls. It can take over the sweep if the opponent sacrifices a bulky Pokemon in order to take down Heracross. Finally, as a minor point on Magneton, although it can be revenge killed by Dugtrio, many teams with Skarmory and Dugtrio tend not to have other Heracross checks, so Heracross can sometimes even take the opportunity to set up on Choice-locked Dugtrio after the revenge kill.</p> <p>The Focus Punch variant similarly belongs on fast-paced offense, but without Magneton. It appreciates teammates that can similarly lure and mount a lot of pressure on Skarmory, such as Choice Band Metagross and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, to take it down in tandem. The availability of more offensive options due to relinquishing the Magneton slot also makes sand removal support less necessary. Substitute + Baton Pass Vaporeon is an interesting partner, for Vaporeon can force in Blissey and pass a 101 HP Substitute out to Heracross, giving Heracross a free opportunity to fire off Focus Punch without predicting. Vaporeon can also turn the momentum on Celebi by hitting it hard with Ice Beam and bringing Heracross in on Recover.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Heracross primarily seeks to use its boosted STAB moves to overwhelm the opponent after its most resilient checks such as Skarmory and Gengar have been removed. Megahorn OHKOes Celebi and Claydol, but with the boost from Choice Band, it also OHKOes Tyranitar and bulkless offensive Swampert and threatens to OHKO Blissey. The boost significantly shortens the lifespan of physical walls, allowing Megahorn to 2HKO Metagross and defensive Swampert with certainty and do likewise against defensive Suicune with good odds. Boosted Megahorn's ability to 2HKO Zapdos also allows Heracross to stay in, take a Thunderbolt, and finish off its check. As Megahorn can fall just shy of OHKOing Blissey and Snorlax, Brick Break is run to KO them more reliably. If Magneton is not used on Heracross's team, Heracross can run Focus Punch for a 25% chance to OHKO Skarmory. Rock Slide OHKOes Aerodactyl and Moltres, 2HKOes Salamence, and is likely to OHKO offensive Zapdos. Hidden Power Ghost OHKOes Gengar. The damage output of these boosted coverage moves allows for a high-risk, high-reward play where a prediction is all that is needed to take out a check.</p> <p>An Adamant nature increases the odds that many of Heracross's targets are taken out with one less hit and is the preferred nature because Choice Band Heracross operates in a hit-and-run manner, pivoting in on slower threats and switching out after. However, Jolly allows Heracross to outspeed slower variants of Salamence, Modest Zapdos, and Modest Moltres.</p> <p>Choice Band Heracross gets worn down to low HP pretty frequently, and sometimes the best way to deal with it is to stall it out in sand. Thus, getting the extra power on the last few hits with Swarm can go a long way, OHKOing Aerodactyl, non-defensive Metagross, and bulkless Magneton as well as nearly OHKOing Zapdos and Swampert. Guts can be used to exploit status moves from Blissey and allows Heracross to stay in on Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Heracross prefers support from trappers to remove its sturdiest checks. Magneton traps Skarmory, letting Heracross drop Focus Punch, and Forretress, which resists Megahorn. Pursuit Tyranitar wears down hovering threats that resist Megahorn such as Gengar, Choice Band Salamence, and Aerodactyl; with some prediction, it also chips Zapdos and Moltres. Porygon2 removes Dugtrio, which can revenge kill Heracross; Porygon2 can get the opportunity to do so when Dugtrio KOes Magneton or Tyranitar.</p> <p>To mitigate the momentum lost from being locked into a move, Choice Band Heracross tends to be used on more balanced teams with defensive backbones compared to its other sets. Porygon2 nullifies most of what Salamence tries to throw at Heracross, though it can be taken out by Choice Band Brick Break with proper prediction. Celebi can force switches with Leech Seed and pivot to Heracross safely through Baton Pass, especially against Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar, either during an expected switch or by utilizing Leech Seed's recovery. Leech Seed's recovery can be important for mitigating damage from sand, which Heracross cannot compensate for due to its lack of Leftovers. Celebi also checks Zapdos. Milotic shrugs off damage from Salamence, Moltres, and Charizard with Recover and can slowly chip Zapdos.</p>"

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Ursaring is the epitome of power, with a whopping base 130 Attack and an excellent ability in Guts. However, its rather lackluster Speed and vulnerability to all forms of residual damage certainly don't do it any favors. It's also rather difficult to switch in on anything other than a predicted switch, a Ghost-type attack, or a status move. However, Ursaring can serve as a potent mid-game wallbreaker with a Swords Dance or Choice Band set and can even clean up late-game with Bulk Up. Above all, it is extremely difficult for the opponent to switch anything in on Ursaring as it deals good damage to almost everything in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ursaring can utilize a RestTalk set for the Guts boost while asleep, but it is inconsistent overall; Ursaring has to forgo a coverage option, doesn't have the bulk, and is walled even harder by Skarmory. Facade, Double-Edge, and Body Slam are other interesting options for an alternate STAB move, but bear in mind that sleep does not boost Facade. Ursaring also has Brick Break and Rock Slide in its movepool, but these are inadvisable as they do not provide any notable coverage; Earthquake OHKOes Tyranitar with either a Choice Band or a Guts boost, and Rock Slide's only possible use is for Aerodactyl, not to mention that it requires Ursaring to give up another coverage move. Counter can work if you try and force Skarmory to attack Ursaring with Drill Peck by showing Focus Punch, which acts as a pseudo-Taunt in that situation.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ursaring is a Pokemon that is incredibly difficult to directly counter; its only real safe switch-ins are Skarmory and Forretress, and even then only to a slight extent. However, the Choice Band set can be defeated with superior prediction, and both boosting sets are vulnerable to simply being outpaced and revenge killed by Pokemon that can hit it adequately hard or super effectively, such as Heracross and Medicham. Choice Band Metagross is also an excellent counter because it will always OHKO in sandstorm with Meteor Mash and resists Return, Ursaring's main STAB option. Ursaring also needs to avoid Choice Band Salamence because of its Intimidate ability and the possible threat of Brick Break.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set can be highly effective if used correctly. The premise is simple: switch Ursaring into a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Toxic and predict switches accordingly. Return is a basic powerful STAB move and hits many opponents very hard. Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Metagross on the switch, while Hidden Power Ghost allows Ursaring to hit Gengar and Dusclops for good damage. Focus Punch takes a massive chunk out of Skarmory switch-ins, but if your team is desperately in need of a sleep absorber, Ursaring can use Sleep Talk in the fourth slot as Guts gives it an Attack boost while asleep. This set should be played aggressively, and a player with good prediction skills will benefit from using it.</p> <p>This set also works decently in the lead slot as it scares away threats such as Gengar, Regice, Snorlax, and many others. The EV spread allows Ursaring to outspeed Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Claydol, making it an excellent switch-in to them as they all often carry Toxic and have no real offensive presence. Ursaring can go slightly faster with an alternate spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe to outspeed all non-Agility variants of Metagross and non-Taunt Skarmory, both of which are prime counters to the bear.</p> <p>Ursaring pairs excellently with Substitute + Baton Pass Zapdos, which resists the Fighting-type attacks that Ursaring doesn't enjoy, scares out Skarmory, and can pass Substitutes to Ursaring or simply dry pass on predicted switches. Like all physically attacking Normal-types, Choice Band Ursaring enjoys Magneton support to remove Skarmory and Forretress.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>As opposed to the hit-and-run approach that the Choice Band set employs, this set aims to break down stall by boosting Attack, and it truly shines at doing so. The basic idea behind the set is to bring it in on a wall such as Blissey or Dusclops, Swords Dance on the switch (usually to Skarmory if you're playing against stall), and choose the appropriate attack. Focus Punch is the preferred move because of its ability to hit Skarmory hard before it Roars. With Guts activated and a Swords Dance boost, Ursaring will almost OHKO the metal bird with Focus Punch. However, Earthquake is also an option for its ability to hit Metagross and Tyranitar, but it leaves Ursaring completely walled by Skarmory. When playing with this set, it is important not to be afraid to stay in and take damage.</p> <p>Bulk is much more important to this set than to the Choice Band one, so that it can switch in and stay in, so a faster EV spread is a poor option. Even the bulkiest of Water-types, Suicune, does not make a safe switch-in as a +2 non-Guts Return will 2HKO it most of the time in sandstorm or with one layer of Spikes.</p> <p>Due to its lack of recovery and the fact that it will probably be taking heavy damage, this set adores Wish support; Jirachi in particular forces Skarmory out and can use the free turn to pass a Wish along. Magneton is not as important a partner for this set as this Ursaring can beat Skarmory itself by Focus Punching on a predicted Roar.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>This Ursaring plays very similarly to the wallbreaker set, but it can tank hits slightly better and also clean up balanced teams late-game to a certain extent. However, as this set does not hit as hard off the bat, it struggles with Skarmory and bulky Water-types such as Suicune, which will tank its comparatively weaker hits and phaze it away without fear. Return is a powerful STAB move, Hidden Power Ghost offers coverage against Dusclops and other Ghost-types, and Earthquake is preferred as this set does not aim to beat Skarmory itself but to clean up after it has been removed. Earthquake also allows Ursaring to stand a chance against most variations of Metagross after a Bulk Up, although it does help if the opponent's Metagross is weakened in advance. However, Focus Punch is usable if your team does not have the necessary support for the bear.</p> <p>Another issue with this set is that Ursaring is vulnerable to Spikes and sandstorm, which massively lowers its durability. Therefore, Starmie is a great partner as it beats Skarmory and can Rapid Spin away all hazards on the field to aid Ursaring's sweep. Magneton also makes an ideal partner for this set--even more so than others--due to its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and prevent it setting up the Spikes that Ursaring dislikes. Other good teammates for this set include Zapdos, and Jolteon to an extent. Ursaring has surprising mixed bulk that can be utilized with a set such as this.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory stands out as the tier's best Spikes user and one of the best physical walls. Its movepool makes it a strong pick for teams that appreciate the extra residual damage it can inflict with Spikes and, most of the time, Toxic. Its Steel / Flying typing is also perfect for its role as a wall, leaving it without any physical weaknesses and with a resistance to all but two physically attacking types, namely Rock and Fighting. However, two exploitable weaknesses to specially attacking types make it vulnerable to Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Despite this, Skarmory is an incredible Pokemon that should always be considered.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest can be used, allowing Skarmory to cure itself of status and regain health at the cost of being inactive for two sleep turns. Soft Sand on the offensive Spikes set can be used to have a better chance to OHKO bulky Magneton, though Skarmory will miss out on recovery from Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory is quite easy to counter due to its lack of offensive presence and low Special Defense. Magneton is the best counter to Skarmory; thanks to Magnet Pull, it can switch in, trap Skarmory, and KO it with Thunderbolt. It is to be emphasized that Timid or bulky Magneton variants are more reliable at trapping offensive Spikes Skarmory; however, Timid Magneton has a lower chance to OHKO standard Skarmory with full investment in special bulk. Any decently strong special attacker with a Fire- or Electric-type move can scare Skarmory, especially if it is not concerned about Toxic or Drill Peck, such as Jirachi.</p> <p>Most of the time, the main issue for the opposing team is dealing with Spikes set by Skarmory. Spinners such as Starmie, Claydol, Forretress, and Cloyster can remove Spikes. Refresh Claydol, Starmie, and Forretress don't care about Toxic, but they will be worn down by Drill Peck. While Rapid Spin is not commonly found on offensive teams, they usually have at least five members that can deal with Skarmory. As offensive teams usually don't switch enough for Spikes damage to really rack up, it may be fine for them if there are one or two layers of Spikes on their side.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes allows Skarmory to apply residual damage to the opposing team and is the primary reason to use it. Roar is one of the main reasons to use Skarmory over other Spikers because most of the time it prevents Skarmory from being setup bait for foes. It also allows Skarmory to take advantage of Spikes by phazing foes and racking up residual damage. Protect gives Skarmory an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and is quite effective due to Skarmory's immunity to Toxic, Sandstorm damage, and Spikes. It also gives Skarmory a method of scouting for unexpected Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Taunt is an option that allows Skarmory to stop opposing Spikers from laying Spikes. Toxic allows Skarmory to threaten spinners such as Cloyster and non-Refresh Claydol, both of which can switch in and remove Spikes without fear. It also allows Skarmory to threaten many other Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Swampert without Refresh, Zapdos, Salamence, Suicune, Jolteon, and Porygon2. Furthermore, it pairs great with Protect to apply more damage to the foe; even defensive Starmie has trouble with Toxic + Protect Skarmory. Drill Peck is an option that allows Skarmory to do a lot of damage to Fighting-types such as Heracross, prevent Gengar from switching in for free, and hurt Taunt Gyarados. It also prevents Refresh Claydol and Forretress from regaining health with Leftovers against Skarmory. Drill Peck can also be used alongside Toxic in place of Protect at the cost of recovery and scouting ability.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Skarmory's special bulk. This allows Skarmory to take advantage of weak special attackers such as defensive Swampert with ease. It also gives it a better chance to survive Magneton's Thunderbolt. If Taunt is used, it is recommended to run a decent amount of Speed investment to outspeed opposing Skarmory.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded walls and makes powerful attackers such as Tyranitar more difficult to switch into. Blissey forms the fearsome SkarmBliss core with Skarmory: Blissey can handle special attackers that trouble Skarmory, while Skarmory can handle physical attackers such as Snorlax that take advantage of Blissey. Gengar not only takes advantage of Skarmory's Spikes but also has the added benefit of being able to block Rapid Spin, which makes it a great teammate. Swampert can back Skarmory up as a physical wall and run Roar to utilize Spikes even better. Fast sweepers, such as offensive Starmie and Aerodactyl, appreciate Spikes wearing down the opponent's team so that they can clean late-game. Pokemon such as Jolteon that force a lot of switches are also great with Spikes support, as the switches they force become much more potent with the additional residual damage. Dugtrio or Hidden Power Fire Magneton can trap opposing Magneton, which can often be disastrous for teams that rely on Magneton to check Skarmory. At the very least, they can revenge kill Magneton after it has trapped Skarmory, making a one-for-one trade.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is obligatory on Skarmory. STAB Drill Peck hits surprisingly hard and discourages Gengar from freely switching in. Hidden Power Ground OHKOes Magneton lacking investment in bulk, which can be game changing, as Magneton is the only answer to Skarmory on many teams. Taunt shuts down opposing Skarmory and helps Skarmory beat Blissey without a Fire-type move. Roar can almost always force out setup sweepers that try to set up on Skarmory and can rack up residual damage as well.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Skarmory's Attack and Speed, which enables it to outspeed Modest Magneton that has Hidden Power Fire and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ground. A Jolly nature can be considered to outspeed Timid Magneton and the rare Medicham, but as a result, Skarmory's Attack will be lower, meaning Skarmory is no longer able to guarantee OHKO on Magneton without investment in bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Skarmory set isn't bulky, it fits on Spikes offensive teams. Jolteon absorbs Electric-type attacks for Skarmory, and its STAB Thunderbolt synergizes well with Spikes because Pokemon immune to Spikes are often vulnerable to Electric-type attacks. Gengar acts as a spinblocker for Spikes from Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-type attacks for Gengar. Offensive Swampert can be an excellent glue, while Skarmory can switch into Grass-type attacks for Swampert. Bulky Tyranitar resists Fire-type attacks and can take some Electric-type attacks for Skarmory, and Spikes support makes it harder for foes to switch into its STAB Rock Slide. Moltres can pivot into Fire-type moves for Skarmory and run Roar to better utilize Spikes. Thanks to Starmie's access to Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Psychic, it threatens many Pokemon that are immune to Spikes.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Houndoom seems unsuited to the ADV metagame, being entirely walled by the sponges Blissey and Curselax, stopped by bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, and trapped by the ubiquitous Dugtrio. However, Houndoom is capable of filling an often pivotal role: Pursuit-trapping the spinblocker Gengar while also providing a consistent switch-in to Celebi and Superachi with its immunity to Psychic, resistance to Grass, and powerful Fire Blast. Its ability to remove Gengar is especially significant, as it allows for the likes of Forretress and Cloyster to successfully Rapid Spin with greater ease. Pursuit also helps open up a sweep from the likes of Earthquake Curselax and allows Explosion to be used with less fear.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is workable on Houndoom, as Early Bird halves its sleep duration. This markedly improves Houndoom's longevity; however, it can be dangerous as a sleeping Houndoom is easy Dugtrio prey—be sure to scout. Beat Up can work on Houndoom if you have a team heavy on physical attackers, as it has the potential to 2HKO the likes of Calm Mind Blissey. However, in doing this you often sacrifice coverage or status, and if your team is physically strong enough for Beat Up, then it shouldn't have problems with the special sponges. If you do use it, though, be sure to use nicknames so as not to prematurely reveal your team! Houndoom can exchange Early Bird for Flash Fire in order to get a boost off a predicted Fire attack, but it loses the ability to wake up more quickly from the likes of Gengar's Hypnosis and also gains a counter in Porygon2. Houndoom can potentially use a SunnyBeam set to clean up late-game, but it is generally far too slow to sweep, and this defies its main purpose as a Pursuit trapper. Sleep Talk without Rest is decent, due to the popularity of Hypnosis Gengar against Pursuit users, especially if you have no sleep absorber; however, it can be somewhat of a waste of a moveslot in a lot of cases.</p> <p>Houndoom can use Counter alongside Will-O-Wisp, the idea behind the set being to catch Tyranitar or Snorlax on the switch-in with Will-O-Wisp and then survive an unboosted burnt Rock Slide or Earthquake to Counter it back for the KO. It can also do the same against burnt Aerodactyl's Rock Slide with 52 HP and 48 Defense EVs. However, in most cases you are better off switching to a defensive Pokemon such as Swampert or Skarmory, who can easily take these attacks and do damage or set up Spikes in return, because Tyranitar and Aerodactyl nearly always have no recovery or way to remove status and Snorlax sometimes will not Rest either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Being a specially oriented, frail Fire-type, Houndoom is countered by a vast array of Pokemon. The special walls Snorlax and Blissey easily defeat it, sponging Fire Blasts merrily while either statusing Houndoom or just bashing away at it. Non-Rest Snorlax needs to watch out for Will-O-Wisp though, as this can cripple it and remove its offensive presence. Milotic and Suicune can switch into Houndoom repeatedly and threaten it with STAB super effective Surfs. Milotic is especially notable as it loves to absorb Will-O-Wisp thanks to its Marvel Scale ability. It also has instant recovery, unlike Suicune, which is forced to use Rest. However, Milotic must watch out for Toxic, as this will greatly decrease its longevity.</p> <p>Dugtrio can trap and OHKO with Earthquake if brought in on a predicted switch or when Houndoom has just made a kill. However, one must remember that it cannot switch in on an awake Houndoom without the heavy risk of an OHKO from Fire Blast. Tyranitar, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Flygon, and Gyarados are all in the same boat when it comes to Houndoom: they are all fairly decent answers to it, resisting Fire moves and KOing back, but being physical attackers without a way to remove status, none of them can deal well with a Will-O-Wisp burn. RestTalk Zapdos can deal with Houndoom outside of sand or if it has Flamethrower instead of Fire Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pursuit": {
        "description": "<p>This set has a very simple premise behind it—defeat Ghost-types with maximum efficiency. Pursuit does exactly that, catching spinblockers switching out for double damage. Fire Blast is generally the better choice for the next slot, as Flamethrower can fail to OHKO the likes of Metagross with some HP investment. Crunch is the primary choice for the third slot, as the threat of Pursuit often dissuades Gengar from switching out and it can land an OHKO on any brazen enough to stay in. Crunch can also actively threaten the rarer Dusclops, which can weaken Houndoom if it only has Pursuit. Hidden Power Grass can also fill the third slot to take a huge chunk out of Swampert and dent other Water-types. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can take out Salamence and Flygon, as Houndoom outspeeds their standard sets. The fourth slot can be filled by one of two status moves, namely Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Will-O-Wisp is better against physical attackers such as Gyarados, Flygon, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, Utilitylax, and Salamence, while Toxic cripples non-Rest Swampert and Milotic, and is also better in last-Pokemon situations.</p> <p>The EVs given hit 300 Speed, beating all standard Salamence and Flygon. If using Hidden Power Ice, you should drop Houndoom's Attack and Defense IVs to 30 as opposed to dropping its Speed IV. 56 HP gives a total divisible by 16 for optimal Leftovers gain. Maximum Special Attack is used rather than significant defensive investment because Houndoom is painfully frail and unlikely to stay around for a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>Houndoom is a useful partner for the Spikes-laying spinners Forretress and Cloyster, as the pair have difficulty successfully executing a spin against more defensive Gengar and Dusclops in Cloyster's case and any Ghost-type whatsoever in Forretress's. With spinblockers out of the way, both Forretress and Cloyster will be able to more effectively keep Spikes off your side of the field. Houndoom also synergizes very well with Gengar, being immune to Psychic-type moves and resisting Ghost- and Dark-type moves, whilst Gengar is immune to Fighting- and Ground-type moves and can help Houndoom's Spikes-using partners keep their entry hazards up. Roar also works very well in conjunction with this combination of Pokemon to take advantage of Spikes to their fullest. However, this can be a dangerous strategy if the opponent has Dugtrio. Houndoom also enjoys support from Pokemon that are able to switch into bulky Water-types, such as RestTalk Zapdos and Celebi. Zapdos is useful in that it can absorb Gengar's Hypnosis, which can put Houndoom out of commission for a while, and also does not share a weakness to Dugtrio. However, Celebi also checks Snorlax and Blissey with the combination of Leech Seed and Calm Mind.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's Swift Swim gives it an unmatched Speed tier in rain, notably outspeeding Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon. Its good bulk and defensive typing allow it to consistently set up Rain Dance. This makes it a good cleaner, especially against frailer offensive teams. Compared to offensive Starmie, it outspeeds more Pokemon when rain is active  and has more bulk, which lets it offensively check physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl. It also outspeeds many notable Pokemon that offensive Suicune does not like Zapdos and Gengar. Additionally, the threat of Kingdra can scare frailer offensive teams into sacrificing important special checks like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax to prevent it from sweeping, enabling specially offensive partners like Suicune, Zapdos, Jirachi, and Celebi.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Kingdra cannot boost its power outside of Rain Dance and has poor coverage. As such, it struggles to deal with special walls and  Pokemon that resist Water. Notably, it is completely walled by Blissey, specially defensive Jirachi and Celebi,  and common bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Explosion users such as Metagross, Gengar, and Forretress can also check it in a pinch if they are healthy. Finally, Kingdra's sweep can also be neutered by status and Tyranitar's Sand Stream. It also faces stiff competition from offensive Starmie and Suicune. The former naturally outspeeds most Pokemon, has better coverage, and has access to Rapid Spin. The latter has far more wallbreaking power thanks to Calm Mind. Kingdra isn't seen often due to the above reasons, but it is a formidable threat if given the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used in the last slot with Petaya Berry. The Special Attack boost lets Kingdra secure important OHKOs on Skarmory, Metagross, bulkless Zapdos, Jolteon, and Forretress with rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Mystic Water may be used to improve the odds to OHKO bulkless Zapdos and some Metagross sets with rain-boosted Hydro Pump. 188 Speed EVs may be used to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Claydol and Timid Vaporeon. Maximum Speed EVs may be used to Speed tie with Heracross and offensive Suicune, although this is rarely ever useful, and the bulk drop required to meet these Speed benchmarks is noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can stomach any hit from Kingdra and retaliate with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Seismic Toss. However, it does have to beware Kingdra's frequent teammate Dugtrio, which can trap and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can come in after Kingdra gets a KO and swap Kingdra's rain for sand, cutting its sweep short. However, it loses 1v1 to Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Suicune</strong>: Suicune can come in on any of Kingdra's attacks and set up on it with Calm Mind. However, non-Rest variants are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Milotic</strong>: Milotic can take any hit from Kingdra and retaliate with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax can take two Hydro Pumps and threaten it with Body Slam or Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Celebi</strong>:  Specially defensive sets can take an Ice Beam and heal off damage with Leech Seed and Recover.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>:  Specially defensive Jirachi walls Kingdra endlessly with Wish + Protect and can cripple it with Body Slam paralysis or Toxic. However, Subsitute + Petaya Berry variants can break through it.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: If healthy, Explosion users like bulky Metagross, Cloyster, and Forretress can take a hit and OHKO non-Substitute variants of Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Non Lum Berry Kingdra is vulnerable to Thunder Wave from Jolteon and Zapdos while setting up. This ruins its Speed and stops it from sweeping most of the time. Toxic from Skarmory, Swampert etc. can also cut a potential sweep short, especially in conjunction with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: Protect can be used to stall out rain turns. Once rain runs out, Kingdra becomes far less threatening. However, Substitute Kingdra can take advantage of Protect users.</p> <p><strong>Regice</strong>: Similar to Snorlax, it can take multiple rain boosted Water-type moves and threaten back with Thunder Wave, Ice Beam, or Explosion.</p>",

      "Rain Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rain Dance, in conjuction with Swift Swim, makes Kingdra faster than all relevant unboosted Pokemon and powers up your chosen Water-type move. Surf's perfect accuracy makes it more consistent at cleaning up late-game . However, Hydro Pump hits some notable benchmarks like OHKOing bulkless Tyranitar outside of rain and having a chance to OHKO bulkless Zapdos and Jolteon in rain. Ice Beam hits Salamence, Celebi, Flygon, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Grass cleanly 2HKOes defensive Swampert without risking a Hydro Pump miss and 2HKOes  offensive Starmie. Hidden Power Electric hits Gyarados hard. Toxic cripples Suicune and is also useful for chipping Blissey into Dugtrio range, forcing it out to let Kingdra damage another Pokemon. This also means that your momentum doesn't come to dead stop upon Blissey coming in. Substitute lets Kingdra avoid status, especially from Zapdos, Jolteon, Skarmory, and Swampert. It can also be used to avoid Explosion, especially from Metagross and Gengar,  and take advantage of opponents using Protect or sacrificing weakened Pokemon to stall out rain turns. 152 Speed EVs allow Kingdra to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, and 104 HP EVs let it survive Salamence's Dragon Claw. Trading Speed for additional bulk is perfectly fine as well, as Kingdra still outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in rain even with no investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Kingdra in late-game after special walls like Blissey and Snorlax have been removed or heavily chipped and preferably after Tyranitar has been KOed. Beware of paralysis or poison while setting up if lacking Lum Berry. Kingdra can set up on most Pokemon that don't have Explosion or a super effective attack on it that it can threaten back. If it's supporting Substitute + Calm Mind (SubCM) Suicune against a defensive team that Kingdra is unlikely to sweep against, it can be used to clear weather for Suicune's benefit with Rain Dance. Kingdra often forces in passive special walls like Blissey and bulky Water-types like Milotic. These can be taken advantage of by well-timed double switches to Dugtrio or SubCM users against Blissey and special sweepers like Zapdos, Jirachi, SubCM Suicune, and Raikou against bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kingdra mostly fits on offensive teams with Dugtrio and multiple special attackers. Kingdra requires support against special walls like Blissey, specially defensive Jirachi, Celebi, and bulky Water-types like Milotic and Suicune, as these wall it endlessly. It also requires opposing Tyranitar to be KOed before attempting a sweep. There are two main categories of Pokemon that have good synergy with Kingdra: ones that can lure in and KO special walls and bulky Water-types and ones that can take advantage of the passivity of special walls and bulky Water-types to set up.</p> <p>In the category of lures, Dugtrio is an excellent partner as it can trap and 2HKO Blissey, Jirachi, and Celebi. It can also trap and OHKO Tyranitar after some chip damage. Zapdos, especially with Substitute + Baton Pass, can bait special walls like Blissey and pass to Dugtrio to trap them. It can also threaten Milotic and Suicune. Gengar can lure in and use Explosion on Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, and its Will-O-Wisp can also cripple Snorlax and Regice.  Metagross can bait in and use Explosion on Suicune and Milotic. Regice can lure in Blissey and use Explosion on it. Note that weak Explosion users like Gengar and Regice may require Dugtrio to follow up by trapping and KOing Blissey. Offensive Snorlax can pressure Milotic and Blissey and use Self-Destruct to remove Suicune and Celebi. Curse + Self-Destruct sets can also lure in and take out Metagross and Tyranitar. On the rare occasion where Kingdra comes out before Snorlax does, it can also remove sand and enhance Snorlax's longevity.</p> <p>The category of Pokemon that set up on Kingdra's counters is comprised of Calm Mind users. Substitute + Calm Mind (SubCM) Suicune can set up on Blissey, Jirachi, and Milotic. Kingdra's removal of sand allows Suicune to beat Blissey as long as it comes in first and at full HP. Offensive Suicune also pressures Snorlax, Celebi, Jirachi, and Regice in general. SubCM and Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi can also set up on Kingdra's counters, especially Milotic, Blissey, and Regice. Offensive Jirachi also lures in and chips Kingdra checks like Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>As with any specially offensive Pokemon, Kingdra appreciates Calm Mind + Baton Pass support from Celebi, which allows it to secure crucial OHKOs on Metagross, bulkless Zapdos, and Skarmory with Hydro Pump in rain. This setup also helps Kingdra to break through some of its soft checks like Jirachi, Celebi, and offensive Suicune (if running Hidden Power Grass or Electric). The pairing with Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is not wasted even in the presence of a sturdy wall like Blissey or Milotic, as Celebi can exploit their passivity to set up and pass to more appropriate targets like Jirachi and Zapdos. In conjunction with using partners that break special walls, one can also pair Kingdra with Pokemon that are strong against the entire stall matchup. Bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar is very strong against Suicune or Milotic + Blissey cores, as they tend to come with flimsy Tyranitar checks like Claydol and Dugtrio. Claydol removes Spikes, which are commonly laid by Skarmory after a Dugtrio trap, keeping Kingdra's natural bulk intact. It also checks Zapdos and Tyranitar, which Kingdra teams typically struggle with, and can lure and remove bulky Water-types with Explosion as well.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>Donphan's main advantage over Claydol, Starmie, and other Rapid Spin users is its ability to actually hurt the most common spinblocker: Dusclops. However, Donphan faces serious problems in a lack of a reliable recovery move, as well as the fact that it's hurt by the Spikes it's coming in to spin. It also has trouble with poison status, which Starmie can shrug off thanks to Natural Cure. While Donphan makes an excellent Dragon Dance Tyranitar counter, it has some troubles with TyraniBoah variants. All in all, it is a solid Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is a nice surprise, but Donphan won't be taking much physical damage anyway, and does enough damage to Tyranitar with STAB Earthquake. Body Slam can cause paralysis, but that's about it. The Rapid Spin set can use Substitute in place of Rest to beat Dusclops one-on-one and to ease prediction, but Donphan will be worn down much more quickly. Toxic can be used to cripple Swampert and other Waters that often switch in on Donphan.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Donphan falls to any special attack; the trick is to switch your special attacker in without it dying to Donphan's powerful attacks. Bulky Water-types and Celebi make solid counters to the defensive set, but the Choice Band do can serious damage to almost all of them. Skarmory and Flygon fare well against the Choice Band, and prediction in general will usually work against it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Donphan is a typical physical tank and spinner. Switch it into one of the many physical attackers it can handle, then fire off attacks or use Rapid Spin. Thanks to its high base Attack stat and powerful STAB Earthquake, Donphan's damage output is a lot higher than almost every physical wall in OU. Hidden Power Rock is generally superior to Rock Slide because Donphan is too slow to take advantage of the flinch chance, and Hidden Power Rock does more damage on average. Additionally, Hidden Power Rock has more PP; this can be quite useful when facing a stall team, which is when Rapid Spin Donphan really shines. While Donphan is one of the few good users of Rapid Spin, it can also use Roar to phaze Pokemon such as Snorlax, Salamence, and Ninjask.</p> <p>You'll generally want to maximize Donphan's HP and invest fairly equally into its Attack and Defense. 24 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outspeed Relaxed Swampert, but if you aren't worried about the mudfish, you can dump the EVs into Attack or Defense instead.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set is useful for multiple reasons. The first is that as long as your opponent packs a Ghost, such as Dusclops or Gengar, standard Donphan won't be able to Rapid Spin. With a Choice Band, however, Donphan can 2HKO Dusclops with Earthquake and Gengar with Rock Slide. Second, Donphan has a horrible typing, as far as special resistances go, in addition to an equally bad Special Defense stat. It will therefore have to either OHKO the incoming special attacker or switch out; Choice Band perfectly suits this sort of hit-and-run style of play. The final reason is sheer surprise: Donphan OHKOes Celebi with Hidden Power Bug, for instance, and 2HKOes all bulky Waters bar Suicune with Earthquake. Hidden Power Ghost can be used over Hidden Power Bug to OHKO Gengar and still do some damage to Celebi.</p> <p>Choice Band Donphan needs a bit more Attack than its Rapid Spin counterpart does. The remaining EVs are split between HP and Defense for maximum physical survivability.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2's main function is trapping Dugtrio to allow grounded attackers to shine. Its ability, Trace, also gives it cool tricks such as blanking Claydol's Earthquake, absorbing Jolteon's Thunderbolt, and stealing Natural Cure. Furthermore, thanks to great bulk, solid Special Attack, and BoltBeam coverage, Porygon2 is able to counter dangerous sweepers such as Salamence and Gyarados. However, Porygon2 is usually the sole Pokemon with no pace on offensive teams, so it can be exploited by setup attackers such as Curse Snorlax and Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rain Dance can be used to clear sand for Pokemon such as Salac Berry Heracross. Hidden Power Fire does significant damage to Forretress and hits Metagross. Hidden Power Fighting pressures Tyranitar. Sharpen can be used to set up on Dugtrio and attempt to sweep the opposing team with boosted STAB Return. However, it is not useful in matchups where Dugtrio isn't present. Furthermore, even if Porygon2 manages to set up, there are still numerous things that can stop it such as Explosion and Fighting-type moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon like Snorlax, Substitute Jirachi, and Metagross that don't care too much about Porygon2's attacks or status moves are solid counters to it. Curse Snorlax and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi can set up on Porygon2, while Metagross hits it hard with its STAB Meteor Mash. Forretress can lay Spikes on Porygon2 quite easily. Tyranitar does not appreciate Porygon2's status moves, but it can generally do great damage to Porygon2, especially if it can hit Porygon2 with Focus Punch. Additionally, although Dragon Dance Tyranitar is not a check to Porygon2, it can set up on it Porygon2 while avoiding status with Lum Berry or Taunt, which is dangerous because opposing players will aim to use Porygon2 as setup fodder when it's used on offensive teams with frail defensive backbones. Blissey is easily forced out by Toxic, but it can use Toxic, Thunder Wave, or the rare Sing to make Porygon2 rather useless. Suicune takes solid damage from Porygon2's Thunderbolt or Thunder when its Special Defense isn't boosted, but if it is, Suicune can set up on Porygon2. Celebi can easily pivot in, shrug off damage by using Recover, and switch out to prevent status from crippling its teammate unless Porygon2 predicts the switch. Furthermore, Baton Pass + Calm Mind or Swords Dance Celebi can also set up on Porygon2. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heracross, Machamp, and Hariyama threaten Porygon2 with their STAB moves and don't take much damage from it. Finally, although Porygon2 has potential to remove status by getting Natural Cure via Trace from Pokemon such as Blissey and Starmie, it is otherwise quite afraid of status, which severely hinders its ability to do its job.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover makes it hard to wear down Porygon2. Ice Beam lets Porygon2 take on Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Salamence, and Flygon. Thunderbolt or Thunder does some damage to Skarmory and turns Porygon2 into one of the best Gyarados counters in ADV OU. While the raw power and paralysis rate of Thunder can be helpful, the accuracy of Thunderbolt makes it more reliable. Alternatively, Toxic hits common targets such as Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples threats like Jirachi, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Using a set with double status is a viable option, because an Electric-type attacking move is not very useful on teams with Magneton.</p> <p>The physical bulk investment allows Porygon2 to avoid being 2HKOed by Adamant Dugtrio's Earthquake in sand, which is important because Porygon2 cannot guarantee an OHKO on Dugtrio with Ice Beam. A more offensive spread can be used as well. For example, an EV spread of 252 HP / 192 Def / 64 SpA with a Modest nature allows Porygon2 to guarantee an OHKO on 8 HP / 40 SpD Dugtrio with Ice Beam. However, this comes with the risk of being worn down by Pokemon such as Salamence and Aerodactyl more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Porygon2 fits on Calm Mind spam teams, where it traps Dugtrio for key threats such as offensive Celebi, Jirachi, and the rare Raikou. Dugtrio itself appreciates opposing Dugtrio being removed too, because it can use Hidden Power Bug and Aerial Ace without worrying about being revenge trapped. The combination of Porygon2 and Dugtrio also checks Salamence, Tyranitar, and Flygon, allowing a team to use a more offensive check to them like Suicune. Meanwhile, with support from Porygon2, Heracross, Tyranitar, Magneton, Starmie, and offensive Swampert no longer worry about being trapped by Dugtrio. In return, they can deal with Porygon2's counters such as Snorlax, Metagross, and Jirachi.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is a veteran of Baton Pass chains and the main reason why they are not easily countered by phazers. Even outside of a full chain, Smeargle can cause a loss right away because passing a Belly Drum and a Salac boost to, say, Medicham, will simply be \"good game\". Beware of Smeargle, despite its fragility.</p> <p>As of March 2011, Ingrain is illegal on Smeargle in Smogon Tours, which makes some of its main sets obsolete.</p> <p>As of August 2019, Baton Pass is illegal on Smeargle, which makes some of its main sets obsolete.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smeargle is one of the two Pokemon in the game that can Baton Pass Tail Glow. If you pull that off and pass a boost to a powerful and fast special sweeper, such as Raikou or Zapdos, you can give your opponent a hard time. Other than that, while Smeargle has the movepool to perform just about anything in the game, the more useful options have already been mentioned, and Smeargle doesn't have the stats to pull off anything else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost-types block the Endeavor set. Quick Attack users and Ninjask hurt Smeargle a lot as long as they avoid a Belly Drum-boosted Extreme Speed. Phazers, Skarmory, Suicune, and Steelix in particular, scare all Smeargle, while Weezing can Haze away its boosts. As Smeargle will fall to just about any attack, sleep absorbers easily end it.

It can be used over either Spore or Substitute, but Ingrain and Baton Pass are required moves.</p> <p>These EVs guarantee Smeargle survives Zapdos's Thunderbolt, which is about the strongest unboosted special attack used in standard, so it'll survive attacks such as Starmie's Surf as well.</p>"},
      "Belly Drum + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>The ultimate instant Baton Pass setup; this Smeargle works marvels. Its execution is simple: send out Smeargle against a slow threat and use Substitute. If your opponent brings in a Pokemon that doesn't have phazing, hazing, or multi-hit moves, use Belly Drum; otherwise, use Spore. Set up and pass a Belly Drum boost as soon as possible, then proceed to sweep with Medicham, Aerodactyl, Cradily, or Gyarados. Medicham is the best if you can guarantee the pass as, at +6, it OHKOes every single Pokemon in OU. Cradily, however, has the benefit of being immune to phazing, making it easier to pass to. Aerodactyl and Gyarados are easier to switch in and can Taunt bulkier threats they can't OHKO.</p> <p>This Smeargle does appreciate being paired with the likes of Exploud, Mr. Mime, Magneton, Octillery, or Cradily, but it is not required.</p>"},
      "Normal Endeavor": {
        "description": "<p>A dastardly surprise, this Smeargle is guaranteed one kill in a match if your opponent does not have a Ghost-type and doesn't know what you are pulling. Endure a hit from just about any Pokemon, put it to sleep with Spore, and unless facing a Sleep Talk user, use Endeavor. If the opponent stays in, attack it with your last move, and repeat the cycle. It's more likely that the foe switches, in which case feel free to use Endeavor on the switch-in too. Now, Smeargle will have put one opponent to sleep and left another one a sitting duck at 1 HP. Beware of Reversal and Flail though. Some opponents are so shocked by this that they make odd switches, and every switch to a new Pokemon means another Pokemon screwed by Endeavor.</p> <p>Where this set really shines, however, is in 2v2 Stadium Mode. Lead with this guy and a Pokemon that knows the move Explosion or Self-Destruct--the higher Attack and Speed they have, the better. Use Extreme Speed in this mode of play: it helps against the likes of Rayquaza. As Smeargle's ally uses Explosion or Self-Destruct, Smeargle should Endure the hit. Next, send in a Pokemon that has Fake Out--Jynx is preferred, but Persian works as well. If one enemy is faster than your Fake Out user, Spore that one and target the other with Fake Out; otherwise, Spore the Pokemon less likely to be carrying a Lum Berry (as there is Item Clause, only one Lum Berry is allowed per team). Next turn, Endeavor the Pokemon that is awake, and finish it off with Jynx's Ice Beam. Repeat this strategy on every awake Pokemon, then finally finish off the sleeping Pokemon.</p> <p>The last 4 EVs on this set have been omitted because they would be detrimental to this Smeargle's quality; it needs to be able to get to as low HP as possible after Endure for Endeavor to work well. The 0 HP IVs are there for the same reason.</p>"

      "Level 5 Endeavor": {
        "description": "<p>Set this Smeargle to level 5, and pair it up with Sand Stream Tyranitar. It is nearly impossible to switch in, but if you manage to do so and there are no Ghost-types on the opposing side, it will screw up at least one opponent. Substitute or Spore when you can to buy a little more time, and Endeavor anything you can. Due to Smeargle's extremely low HP, all bar immune opponents will be put straight into Sand Stream's KO range. The last move finishes these foes off, and all others if sandstorm isn't up. While Dragon Rage does more damage, Extreme Speed stops Salac-boosted Pokemon at 1 HP from ruining this set; it'll be doing about 2 HP damage to most Pokemon. This set is extremely deadly, especially if your opponent doesn't wise up to the fact that it is level 5 and switches in its sleep absorber without realizing that everything is faster and powerful enough to KO it.</p> <p>One of the easiest ways to switch this Smeargle in is by pairing it with a Pokemon with both a trapping and a sleeping move; Mean Look + Lovely Kiss Jynx, Block + Yawn Snorlax and Mean Look + Hypnosis Gengar are all good options. Smeargle essentially needs one turn to switch in and one to set up with Spore or Substitute. If you ever encounter something that cannot really touch him, such as a Pokemon with no attacking moves or only Ghost-type moves, use that to switch Smeargle in more than once.</p> <p>Smeargle's EV spread and hold item will likely not matter. One thing to note, though, is not to give Smeargle HP EVs when running this set; this will reduce Endeavor's damage. In fact, you'll want to set its HP IV to 9 or less. This gives it 20 HP, which is the minimum possible. Defensive EVs, on the other hand, are helpful on this set because this Smeargle's HP is low enough that it can KO most anything with sandstorm damage, so it doesn't need to take any more damage than sandstorm will inflict. Meanwhile, the defensive EVs might help Smeargle, unlikely as it is, survive something.</p>"

While Smeargle lacks Snorlax's extremely high HP, its other stats will likely be superior.</p> <p>As sleep absorbers are usual switch-ins to Smeargle, it might not be wise to use Spore first. In fact, this Smeargle can check if the switch-in is a Sleep Talk user by using Transform. Any number of utility moves can be used in the last two slots. Aside from the listed moves, other options include Extreme Speed to finish off Salac-boosted Pokemon, Whirlwind to counter Ninjask, as well as Spikes, Rapid Spin, and Aromatherapy.

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey is the defining special wall of ADV OU. It has no special weaknesses and shrugs off special attacks with impunity, countering a wide range of special threats and minimally acting as a safe pivot into those that run utility moves to get past it. Because it takes so little damage, it can choose not to recover after taking a hit even under sand or after taking Spikes damage, generating free turns that can be used to gain momentum via its punishing moves or double switches. Its moveset can be customized to suit both defensive and offensive needs; it can apply three different kinds of status, support teammates with Wish or Heal Bell, fire off punishing elemental coverage moves, and even pull off a surprise Counter in the face of a physical threat. Due to its enormous HP stat, Blissey can also deal with a number of physical moves from mixed attackers like Salamence, Zapdos, and even mixed Tyranitar or defensive Swampert to some extent.</p> <p>Blissey's main weaknesses are its lack of resilience against powerful physical moves and relative passivity. This makes it easy for Metagross, physical Tyranitar, and Snorlax to exert pressure on Blissey and for Calm Mind users, especially those with a healing move, to overwhelm Blissey with boosted special attacks. Blissey can also be forced out by status and is easy to set Spikes against. Still, many of these weaknesses can be patched by the appropriate filler moves. Blissey on non-Spikes teams usually carries Wish and is ideal for supporting bulky wallbreakers like Choice Band Salamence, Metagross, and Suicune.</p> <p>Blissey is mostly used with Spikes, and it is especially resilient in the face of Spikes and sand compared to other special tanks like Celebi, Snorlax, and Regice. It is by far the most commonly used special wall in the Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm (TSS) archetype. However, it can also be used without Spikes to shield and support a late-game setup sweeper like Curse Snorlax or Calm Mind Jirachi. Blissey can also be used on non-Spikes offensive teams as a robust special wall and one of the few Gengar checks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snatch can be used with Toxic alongside mixed sweepers to sustain the chip on Milotic, Suicune, and Celebi, never letting them exploit Blissey's passivity to recover. It also helps Blissey deal with Calm Mind users a little better. For example, as Suicune is worn down by Toxic and is about to use Rest, a surprise Snatch can cause Suicune to get KOed by Toxic and sand damage. Light Screen can be used to support Skarmory or Forretress against Magneton.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Threats</strong>: Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, and offensive Swampert all force Blissey out. Snorlax can exploit Blissey's passivity to set up with Curse, especially out of sand, and Tyranitar with Lum Berry can set up with Dragon Dance on Blissey. These physical threats, however, need to be careful of Blissey's mitigating strategies: Toxic for Tyranitar and Swampert, Fire Blast for Metagross, and Counter for all of them. These physical threats can also have their progress stalled out by Wish. In addition, these Pokemon have to be wary of double switches into Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Heracross and Breloom exert immense pressure should they get a switch-in on Blissey. Heracross's Guts allows it to absorb status from Blissey rather well. Hariyama also comes in easily on Blissey with its high HP and makes progress with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Standard Dugtrio can pick off a weakened Blissey, and bulky Dugtrio, especially on special offense teams, can even threaten to 2HKO Blissey and live to tell the tale.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic forces Blissey lacking Heal Bell out and threatens to cripple the incoming Pokemon. It also frequently weakens Blissey enough to make it susceptible to a Dugtrio trap.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt Skarmory and Gengar prevent Blissey from recovering after coming in. Skarmory can proceed to set Spikes, apply Toxic poison, or attack Blissey, while Gengar's Will-O-Wisp puts immense pressure on Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Blissey's huge HP stat can feed Celebi and, to some extent, Venusaur indefinitely thanks to Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Many teams use Blissey to compensate for huge special weaknesses on the rest of the team. It's very easy to draw Blissey in with a special threat and double switch or phaze to get Spikes damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled is mandatory because Blissey tends to participate in mid- and slow-paced games and will likely get worn out over the course of a game. Blissey can usually wait to take two or three hits before using Soft-Boiled because of its amazing bulk.</p> <p>The second move ensures that Dugtrio does not simply remove Blissey with zero effort. Ice Beam hits Gengar and allows Blissey to check mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence somewhat reliably. Counter is good for teams with a Pursuit trapper to get rid of Gengar or for teams that are just a little soft against physical attacks like Metagross's Meteor Mash, Swampert's Earthquake, mixed Tyranitar's Brick Break, and any of Aerodactyl's attacks. Counter should not be the primary means by which these attacks are dealt with because Blissey is usually vital to preserve for mid-game, but late-game, Blissey can lure in and take out physical or mixed attackers just as the opponent thinks a sweep is assured. Pursuit trapper + Forretress teams benefit from Counter, as well as teams that form soft-checking cores between Pokemon like Flygon, Metagross, and offensive Suicune with Zapdos or Moltres to handle physical attackers like Tyranitar and Metagross, with Superman teams—teams that use hovering Pokemon to avoid Spikes—being a prominent example of them. Ice Beam and Counter are not mutually exclusive. Traditionally, Counter, unlike Ice Beam, ensures that Dugtrio gets OHKOed regardless of its bulk. However, the emergence of Beat Up on Dugtrio, which cannot be Countered, puts forth a strong case for Ice Beam to be used alongside Counter.</p> <p>By doing a fixed amount of damage regardless of the foe's defensive boosts, Seismic Toss is the most consistent attacking move because it allows Blissey to force Suicune to use Rest and beats chipped or statused Calm Mind users that have no ability to recover like offensive Celebi, Jirachi, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it still is not entirely reliable against these offensive Calm Mind users, as Blissey needs to recover quite a bit against them and can get affected by Special Defense drops or paralysis. Seismic Toss also allows Blissey to reliably chip most other Pokemon bar Gengar without concern of the incoming target's elemental resistances. Fire Blast and Thunderbolt relieve the Spikes pressure a bit by hitting Skarmory hard. Thunderbolt also clobbers Cloyster. Fire Blast 2HKOes Metagross and Heracross and OHKOes Breloom, while Thunderbolt puts immense pressure on Milotic, Suicune, Recover Starmie, and Gyarados. It also prevents Suicune from PP stalling with Rest if it is has not yet used Calm Mind, but Blissey should not be used solely to deal with Suicune in any case.</p> <p>Blissey can run a variety of status moves in its filler slot. Thunder Wave paralyzes most switch-ins such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory and helps slow Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross outrun them. Thunder Wave is also useful for stopping physical attackers in a pinch. It threatens to thwart Dragon Dance Tyranitar's and Agility Metagross's sweeps and gives Blissey an out against Aerodactyl by relying on full paralysis, all of which, while unreliable, is still notable. Thunder Wave also helps Blissey beat offensive Jirachi. Toxic is a much better status move against Tyranitar not only because it is the only way Blissey can consistently do damage to it, but also because paralysis allows Tyranitar to switch freely into Will-O-Wisp from Gengar. Toxic also forces out Swampert and Blissey and can be useful on Pursuit Tyranitar teams that do not have the physical pressure to otherwise punish opposing Blissey. Ice Beam + Fire Blast + Toxic is a good combination of moves that nails all of Blissey's common switch-ins—Metagross, Skarmory, and Tyranitar—at the expense of being beaten by Calm Mind users. Sing can completely shut down a huge threat like Tyranitar, Metagross, or Skarmory, which can help Pokemon like Jirachi and Aerodactyl. However, if it misses, it can also lure in sleep fodder like Magneton, Claydol, and Pursuit Tyranitar, all of which can be trapped by Dugtrio or one's own Pursuit Tyranitar. Sing, while unreliable, may help to take down tanks like Milotic, Rest Zapdos, and even other Blissey, denying them recovery opportunities as they get chipped down by Seismic Toss and perhaps Spikes damage.</p> <p>For supportive options, Wish is good for sustaining the team, especially on more offensive Skarmory + Blissey teams. For example, it heals Choice Band Salamence by using Wish as a Fighting-type or Celebi comes in, and it also supports soft Tyranitar checks like Metagross, Flygon, and Suicune as well as soft Metagross checks like Zapdos and Moltres. Wish also supports Skarmory, especially against mixed attackers that hit it hard but can't quite get rid of it and also supports defensive Suicune, which is a worse physical wall than Swampert in sand. Wish + Counter is a common pairing on teams with a Pursuit trapper that helps to minimize the reliance on dedicated physical walls.</p> <p>Heal Bell supports stall teams that use Wish or Rest on other Pokemon for longevity like Jirachi and Suicune, as well as Snorlax and Vaporeon occasionally, and also allows Claydol to use Explosion over Refresh on teams that have enough support to take down Skarmory. As an auxiliary benefit, Heal Bell also helps Blissey deal with foes that use Toxic like Swampert and Zapdos without having to switch out, possibly take Spikes damage, and perhaps let a teammate take a nasty hit or Toxic again. Note, however, that this can only be done occasionally due to Heal Bell's low PP.</p> <p>The listed EVs allow Blissey to OHKO bulkless Dugtrio with Ice Beam. If special attacks are not used on Blissey, the Special Attack EVs can do into HP or Speed, and the nature can be changed to Bold. A Bold nature can still be used with Ice Beam; this especially helps Blissey against mixed Salamence's and Tyranitar's Brick Break. Unfortunately, bulkless Dugtrio is OHKOed with full certainly only after one layer of Spikes instead.</p> <p>Switch Blissey into special threats or status moves. One of Blissey's biggest advantages early-game is its unrevealed moveset; one can play off the fear of firing off a status move to make a double switch to Skarmory or some other threat. Use Wish as a mid-ground move mid-game when it is unclear whether the opponent will pivot out. The key to winning games with Blissey is to exploit the free turns it gets from soaking special hits, either by forcing chip damage by itself on more defensive teams or by supporting offensive teammates with Wish, aggressive double switching, or exploiting its coverage on offensive teams such that the sequence loops in a way that is unfavorable to the opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey teams tend to play a mid- to slow-paced game and want a way to punish its switch-ins continuously. Spikes is really helpful for that, and the usual suspects are Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster. Skarmory is perhaps the most common partner, as it lures in all the special threats, which Blissey can fend itself off against, while Calm Mind users usually don't have enough power to really hurt Skarmory before they get phazed out. Skarmory's high Defense and immunity to Spikes also allow it to switch in against any Snorlax, Metagross, and, sometimes, Fighting-types that pivot in on Blissey. Forretress also acts similarly, giving up the ability to hit Fighting-types and phaze for spinning and the ability to OHKO Magneton on the switch. Blissey can also be used with Cloyster on offensive Spikes teams, where, despite the seeming mismatch of pace, it helps to pivot against Gengar and Zapdos.</p> <p>Spikes frequently comes with support aimed at getting more layers up than the opponent. Gengar spinblocks Claydol and Starmie and is great for mid- and fast-paced TSS teams, while Magneton traps opposing Skarmory and helps to enable physical attackers. Claydol and Starmie can spin away Spikes, and they can be used on TSS teams or slow-paced stall teams in conjunction with Magneton or Dugtrio. Finally, one's own Dugtrio and Magneton can trap opposing Magneton. Generally, spinning and trapping Skarmory are efforts geared towards mitigating Blissey's propensity to be Spikes fodder, while spinblocking and trapping Magneton are attempts at closing out the game by pressuring the opponent with one's own Spikes before one gets overwhelmed by the opponent's Spikes</p> <p>Tyranitar is a great partner because sand really makes Blissey's bulk shine; as a comparison, while Celebi can function as a solid special wall in a vacuum, its lower special bulk becomes notable in the presence of sand and Spikes. Tyranitar suited to the pace of Blissey teams are usually the bulky physical attacking set and Pursuit Tyranitar, but there is nothing strictly restricting the use of any Tyranitar set. Tyranitar + Skarmory + Blissey is the core that is synonymous with the TSS archetype. Tyranitar also helps to make progress against Snorlax and Suicune by retaining chip damage with sand, which otherwise come in almost freely on Blissey to dish out powerful attacks or set up.</p> <p>Using Blissey requires answers to physical threats like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence. Bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic help Blissey deal with them, and their passivity tends to invite Electric-types in, which Blissey can deal with. Suicune isn't too robust given it lacks the Rock-type resistance of Swampert and the immediate recovery of Milotic, so Wish or Aromatherapy support is a great option to go with Suicune. Another answer not to be missed is Dugtrio, which cannot switch into Tyranitar and Metagross but can trap them with some chip damage. Dugtrio also threatens to stop pesky Celebi from harassing Blissey with Leech Seed and Jirachi from setting up on Blissey.</p> <p>Offensive Pokemon with good pivoting abilities are great partners for Wish Blissey. Choice Band Salamence can come in on Fighting-types and Celebi. Metagross, Flygon, and Suicune can pivot in against Tyranitar. Moltres, Zapdos, and different Suicune variants can pivot in against Metagross. Most of these Pokemon are frail physical checks in a vacuum, but they become a lot more reliable when supported by Wish.</p> <p>Finally, bulky setup sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Wish Jirachi also appreciate Blissey's ability to support them with Wish or Aromatherapy, respectively, and they also appreciate Blissey's special walling presence mid-game so that their HP can be preserved for late-game.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind Blissey was once a metagame staple that is rarely used nowadays. Despite its fall in relevance, it still offers some niche advantages over utility Blissey. Calm Mind allows Blissey to take on other Calm Mind users that don't have a phazing move. These include offensive Celebi and different variants of Jirachi and Suicune depending on the coverage moves chosen. Note that scouting for their movesets is necessary first, though, as Blissey can recklessly lose the Calm Mind war upon being phazed. It can also muscle past opposing Blissey without Toxic; although opposing Blissey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, it is likely to get afflicted by status, fall to a critical hit, or run out of Soft-Boiled PP before it can stall Blissey out. Finally, Calm Mind Blissey also puts pressure on Milotic and Celebi teams, which otherwise have an easy time stalling Blissey out with Toxic and Leech Seed.</p> <p>Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are the more common coverage moves. Ice Beam confers Calm Mind Blissey all the advantages of standard Blissey when facing Dugtrio and Salamence and, with Calm Mind, allows Blissey to push its way past Celebi. Thunderbolt notably allows Blissey to 3HKO maximum HP Suicune with good odds and with certainty in sand. This is particularly relevant for beating RestTalk Suicune. Thunderbolt also exerts more pressure on Milotic and Cloyster than Hidden Power Grass and eases the matchup against Moltres and Charizard. Note that while Blissey theoretically wins the Calm Mind war with offensive Jirachi without Wish, Jirachi is favored to land a critical hit; this is especially true in sand. As alternative coverage, Flamethrower allows Blissey to 3HKO maximum HP Jirachi and reliably defeat Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi. It also heavily pressures Metagross and OHKOes Forretress. Hidden Power Grass helps to round out the coverage against Water-types, especially Swampert, but cannot be used to reliably beat Suicune.</p> <p>Calm Mind is rarely used early-game, as all of Blissey's checks are still around and need to be removed. Furthermore, revealing Calm Mind throws away the surprise value of this set. Calm Mind should only be used mid-game to force out Pokemon that try to stall out Blissey like Milotic and draw in specific targets like Metagross and Tyranitar that can be chipped or trapped. Once all of Blissey's checks are removed, it can set up at will and push its way past passive PP stallers and certain Calm Mind users.</p> <p>This set has very specific purposes, and its lack of a status or supporting move makes Calm Mind Blissey more of something to support rather than something that supports. It should therefore only be used with a very good reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Blissey has two huge weaknesses. First, it has no options for pressuring Tyranitar and Metagross; they can switch in endlessly and not fear getting hit by a status move or super effective coverage. Second, it is also helpless against Calm Mind users with a utility move that is useful against Blissey, like Roar Suicune, Wish Jirachi, and Leech Seed Celebi. Dugtrio is an excellent partner that covers both the physical weaknesses to Tyranitar and Metagross as well as the special weakness to Wish Jirachi and Celebi. It is also good at removing other Blissey, especially those carrying Toxic. Zapdos is a great Suicune check that can be used with Blissey; its Roar also helps as an emergency check against other Calm Mind users. Snorlax can also be used as a Suicune check, and Self-Destruct lets it lure in and severely dent or remove Tyranitar and Metagross.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is the defining Pokemon of ADV OU. First, its ability Sand Stream alone tremendously shapes the strategies and team choices in the metagame. By damaging and nullifying Leftovers on non-Steel-, Ground-, and Rock-types, sand shifts similar roles towards Pokemon that are immune to or more robust under sand. Swampert more reliably checks physical threats than Suicune despite worse stats; Claydol is the preferred spinner over Starmie even with its middling Speed and offensive presence; Blissey's extreme special bulk keeps it around a lot longer under sand than Celebi, and it forms part of the Skarmory + Blissey core so frequently used on defensive teams with Tyranitar. As a result, sand defines one of the most prominent defensive archetypes in the metagame: Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes (TSS). As an offensive tool, sand makes damage stick, greatly neutering the effectiveness of threatening setup sweepers like Suicune and Snorlax while also forcing frequent recovery from Celebi, Blissey, and Milotic. As a defensive tool, sand limits certain varieties of offense by placing Choice Band and Berry-focused Pokemon on a timer. Sand also provides a lot of information in battle, revealing the items on Pokemon like Salamence and Heracross and distinguishing Choice Band and Salac Berry sets from those running Leftovers. As a simulator mechanic, sand reveals the relative Speeds of the Pokemon on the field, dealing damage to the faster Pokemon first.</p> <p>Sand isn’t enough for you? Tyranitar itself is a behemoth in battle; with a strong stat distribution and large movepool, it can fulfill a variety of roles on almost every team. The Dragon Dance set can act as a wallbreaker or sweeper; Pursuit threatens to punish not just Gengar but also other hovering threats such as Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Claydol; the mixed set dismantles TSS-style teams; the bulky physical attacker set exploits Spikes really well by forcing switches; the Choice Band set provides a lot of immediate firepower if supported well or accompanied by good predictions; and the SubPunch set gives added protection against status from Blissey and Snorlax and can be a great lure. While these sets are mostly offensive in nature, Tyranitar's typing and decent defensive stats also allow it to pivot in on Normal-, Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-type moves, guarding the team against Snorlax, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Salamence, Celebi, and Jirachi.</p> <p>While Tyranitar has an incredible number of strengths, it is not without weaknesses. It fails to outspeed just about every offensive Pokemon and even some defensive ones like Celebi without considerable Speed investment. Even with a Speed boost from Dragon Dance, it can be outsped by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, and possibly Starmie. While its typing is mostly positive for it, the Water- and Ground-type weaknesses prevent it from staying in on bulky Water-types and allow it to be easily trapped by Dugtrio. In particular, teams that derive their value from Tyranitar through sand immunity usually leave themselves prone to offensive Water-types, as they usually rely on a single special wall as their Water-type check. Other weaknesses such as Fighting, Grass, and Steel allow many Pokemon to take out Tyranitar in up to two hits after some chip damage, and these attacks frequently come from Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check or be able to do heavy damage to in the first place, like Salamence, Metagross, Gengar, offensive Jirachi, and Celebi. Keeping Tyranitar healthy enough to serve its purpose is key to using it successfully.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute Tyranitar can be an excellent wallbreaker. With 101 HP Substitutes, Tyranitar blocks status moves from Blissey and eliminates the prediction required to fire off Focus Punch. Follow up moves such as Hidden Power Grass, Fire Blast, and Thunder can then severely damage incoming checks like Swampert, Metagross, and Suicune. While mixed Substitute + Focus Punch sets are great lures, they require compromises in Special Attack EVs due to the need for maximum HP and sufficient Speed to outrun tanks while using a Speed-reducing nature. Thus, physical EVs with Rock Slide + Hidden Power Bug or Grass can also be used. Substitute Tyranitar fits well on paralysis-spam teams, allowing Tyranitar to fish for full paralysis.</p> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar can run Salac Berry with Fire-, Grass-, and Fighting-type coverage and offensive EVs just like the mixed Tyranitar set, giving it an extra opportunity to outspeed and trap Gengar while retaining its offensive abilities by using its relatively high Speed unlike bulky Pursuit Tyranitar. Getting into Salac Berry range is not as difficult as it sounds, as teammates can be sacrificed and Spikes damage can be used to manipulate Tyranitar's HP. Thunder Wave can be used, especially on Pursuit Tyranitar, as a nasty surprise against checks like Metagross and Suicune; Ice Beam + Hidden Power Grass coverage allows Tyranitar to deter Ground-types, which do not get affected by Thunder Wave.</p> <p>A variety of items can be used with Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Salac Berry can also be used on bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar to outspeed the entire metagame after a single boost; Endure goes well with that set. Liechi Berry can help with wallbreaking when a Water-type attack brings Tyranitar into activation range. Soft Sand can be used on Dragon Dance Tyranitar to nab the OHKOs on Metagross and Tyranitar after a single layer of Spikes.</p> <p>Protect is especially useful on lead Tyranitar; it scouts the item on lead Salamence and also scouts Choice Band Salamence's move. It also helps Tyranitar heal out of Dugtrio's Earthquake range, giving Tyranitar the chance to KO it. Protect is most easily placed on Pursuit Tyranitar, but it can also be used with bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Notably, Protect allows Tyranitar to survive two Surfs from uninvested Suicune and potentially two Surfs from Milotic too. These odds, compounded with those of Rock Slide flinching, make it very likely that Tyranitar breaks through Milotic.</p> <p>Curse + Rest can be used to turn the tables on Flygon and Claydol, but the prevalence of Water-type moves and the high chance of a critical hit while setting up makes the sweep difficult to pull off. Rest, perhaps even with Chesto Berry, can be used on bulky Tyranitar sets too, giving Tyranitar another lease on life after being burned in the process of trapping Gengar. Toxic can be used to slowly wear down Swampert and Suicune, but the prevalence of Refresh Swampert makes such an option unreliable. For this reason, it is a good idea to use Taunt alongside Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Tyranitar is extremely versatile, its checks and counters can be rather set specific.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types all have the ability to at least 2HKO Tyranitar. Swampert is the premier physical Tyranitar check, boasting the important Rock-type resistance and sand immunity. Unfortunately, Swampert is also the target of a wallbreaker set with Hidden Power Grass. Milotic and, to some extent, Suicune do much better at facing mixed Tyranitar, with the former shrugging its hits off and latter easily pivoting in on any move other than Hidden Power Grass to force Tyranitar out. Suicune, however, gets easily worn down due to its lack of instant recovery. Although Starmie is frail, it can come in on unboosted attacks or even pivot into mixed Tyranitar, outspeed boosted Tyranitar that lack a Speed-boosting nature, and attempt to KO back with Hydro Pump. Gyarados also deals with mixed Tyranitar lacking Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon resists Rock-type moves and is immune to Earthquake, making it a good check to physical Tyranitar sets. It needs to be wary of Ice Beam and Double-Edge, however, and offensive sets without much bulk can be flinched down by Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Claydol completely nullifies Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar and can hold its ground against other Tyranitar sets as long as it pivots into Rock Slide. Claydol, however, takes a great deal of damage from Hidden Power Bug and Crunch. Although rare, Donphan is also an excellent counter to physical Tyranitar that isn't too weak to Hidden Power Grass, and Steelix can survive two boosted Earthquakes from Jolly Dragon Dance Tyranitar with the help of Protect to 2HKO back.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio sets itself apart from other Ground-types with its ability to trap Tyranitar. Jolly Dugtrio can outspeed +1 Tyranitar and has a 75% chance to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar. It's also not too difficult to chip the bulky sets into OHKO range. Adamant Dugtrio cannot outspeed boosted Jolly Tyranitar, but it OHKOes bulkless Tyranitar with certainty and OHKOes full HP Tyranitar half the time.</p> <p><strong>Metagross</strong>: With a bit of bulk, Metagross can often come in on Rock Slide or Dragon Dance, survive the Earthquake, and OHKO back bulkless Tyranitar with Meteor Mash. Defensive Metagross can even survive two unboosted Earthquakes and still OHKO bulkless Tyranitar in return. Metagross can also survive Fire Blast and attempt to KO back. Regardless, Metagross is still a check, not a hard counter; care has to be taken not to switch Metagross into a super effective move unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Despite not being too robust under sand, Fighting-types resist Rock Slide and can OHKO Tyranitar and thus can serve as an offensive check to physical Tyranitar; Hariyama and Machamp are particular examples, with no special weaknesses to Tyranitar's coverage moves either. Breloom resists both Rock Slide and Earthquake and can potentially pack Mach Punch to turn the tables on Dragon Dance Tyranitar; however, Breloom has to be wary of Fire Blast and Ice Beam. Heracross does not resist Rock but can easily OHKO Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados can be important pivots against Dragon Dance Tyranitar by using Intimidate to eliminate its boosts and pivoting or sacrificing themselves or another teammate to send in a check.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: This only applies to the mixed set. Fire-types like Moltres and Charizard have a niche in being able to resist three of mixed Tyranitar's moves and are able to hit back decently hard with Hidden Power Grass.</p>",

      "Fast Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fast Dragon Dance Tyranitar is unique in the metagame in that it can simultaneously function as a sweeper and wallbreaker. Dragon Dance raises Tyranitar's already impressive Attack to insane levels and boosts its middling Speed beyond everything in the entire metagame bar Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon.</p> <p>As a sweeper, Tyranitar's Rock Slide + Earthquake hits the whole metagame bar Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom for at least neutral damage. That is where the remaining move fills the gap. +1 Hidden Power Bug 2HKOes Claydol and has the added perk of OHKOing offensive Starmie and Celebi, which can OHKO back with Hydro Pump or attempt to use Leech Seed to heal up Tyranitar's checks, respectively. This overall coverage makes Tyranitar absolutely terrifying late-game.</p> <p>As a wallbreaker, Tyranitar's boosted Rock Slide minimally leaves checks like Milotic and Suicune at about 10-30% of their HP as it goes down, and it can even break through them with Rock Slide's high flinch rate. Hidden Power Grass severely dents Swampert, its main target, with a 92% chance to 2HKO the standard set of 248 HP / 44 SpD without Protect. Earthquake can KO Metagross with a bit of prior damage. This set is such a potent threat because its terrifying physical presence frequently locks the opponent into sending Swampert in even if they expect Hidden Power Grass coming.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a less common filler move primarily used to OHKO Flygon; it also has the auxiliary benefits of OHKOing Salamence through Intimidate and still hitting Claydol for respectable damage. Ice Beam notably hits Breloom hard, stopping it from comfortably checking Tyranitar. Double-Edge is an alternative that hits both Claydol and Flygon, and in some scenarios it gives the extra power needed to finish off the bulky Water-types; Spikes laid by a teammate can complement Double-Edge by bringing Tyranitar's checks into KO range. Regardless of its role, Lum Berry is the most useful item, allowing Tyranitar to set up on status moves like Zapdos's and Magneton's Thunder Wave, Gengar's Will-O-Wisp, Skarmory's Toxic, and Blissey's status move, all of which would hinder or entirely nullify Tyranitar in both of its roles.</p> <p>A spread of 244 Atk / 12 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature is recommended should Tyranitar use Hidden Power Grass to 2HKO Swampert if it does not use Protect and still has a high enough probability of doing so after a Protect to force a switch. With Ice Beam, no Special Attack EVs are needed. Hasty, Naughty, or Lonely can be used over Naive. By sacrificing physical instead of special defense, Tyranitar gains much better odds to survive two hits from offensive Zapdos and has better survivability under Spikes against non-Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump from Swampert and special attacks from Jirachi, but it gets OHKOed with certainty by Dugtrio and very likely also in the Dragon Dance Tyranitar mirror matchup. Using an Attack-boosting instead of Speed-boosting nature allows Tyranitar to wallbreak more effectively and sweep with less chip damage at the expense of not outspeeding Starmie, Adamant Dugtrio, and fast Gengar. Notably, the added Attack allows Tyranitar to OHKO uninvested Dragon Dance Salamence with certainty.</p> <p>Be sure to send Tyranitar out against foes that cannot threaten it from full health very much like Blissey, Magneton, Jirachi, Zapdos, Gengar, Choice-locked Salamence and Aerodactyl, and other weak attackers that cannot easily 2HKO it. These are the opportunities that Tyranitar needs to get that one—and sometimes even two—Dragon Dance up and wreak havoc. If you're intending to sweep with Tyranitar, make sure that the appropriate checks like Swampert and Milotic have been weakened to the point that they cannot contest its sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Building well with this set requires exploiting its strengths as a wallbreaker and sweeper. It is most frequently seen on fast-paced offenses with fluid gameplans that can materialize opportunities for either of its roles. These teams frequently feature other Pokemon that break walls or follow up Tyranitar's wallbreaking to sweep. One such wallbreaker is Metagross. Choice Band Metagross can take out Skarmory and bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic with an early Explosion; mixed Metagross can slowly wear Skarmory and Swampert down and still use Explosion on the other bulky Water-types; even Agility or Protect Metagross can do a lot of chip damage with help from Spikes. Offensive Swampert itself, including the Endeavor variant, is another wallbreaker that pressures opposing Swampert. While switching Swampert into opposing Swampert may seem disadvantageous, teams using Swampert frequently have no solid Swampert checks, encouraging the opposing Swampert to stay in to be chipped. With some planning and luck, activating Torrent could even let Swampert win the mirror matchup. Offensive Snorlax pivots into Water-types that scare Tyranitar out and gets important chip damage with Focus Punch on Metagross and Skarmory; this allows Metagross to be OHKOed by boosted Tyranitar and makes Skarmory a lot less reliable in checking it. Alternatively, offensive Snorlax can trade KOs with Metagross and Skarmory using Curse + Self-Destruct. Cloyster pivots into Water-types, sets Spikes, and chips its target with Explosion, which can turn 2HKOs on Metagross and opposing Tyranitar into OHKOs. Spikes does more than weaken the team for a sweep; it also makes it a lot harder for the opponent to stop the sweep by pivoting to Salamence for an Intimidate drop and then to Metagross to resist the Rock Slide. Finally, examples of follow-up sweepers should Tyranitar be used as a wallbreaker include physical threats like Dragon Dance Salamence, Agility Metagross, and Aerodactyl. Dragon Dance Salamence and Aerodactyl are also able to set up to sweep or revenge kill Dugtrio should it take out Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar distinguishes itself from the fast variant in that it intends to use Dragon Dance twice with its bulk to sweep. With its defensive EVs, it survives Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake, unboosted Metagross's Meteor Mash, and Starmie's and Suicune's Hydro Pump, and it comfortably takes two hits from Zapdos and offensive Hidden Power Grass Gengar. The bulk also allows Tyranitar to tank +1 Dragon Dance Salamence's Earthquake and possibly OHKO it back as a last-ditch check. Rock Slide + Earthquake hits the whole metagame bar Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom for neutral damage. Hidden Power Bug rounds out the coverage, allowing Tyranitar to plow through Claydol and bulkless Flygon with some chip damage while also giving it an easier time against Celebi, which can otherwise take out Tyranitar with its Grass-type moves and some luck. It also usually OHKOes offensive Starmie after a boost. Taunt prevents phazing from Skarmory and even Suicune or Swampert if one is willing to make a read, and it stops status moves like Toxic from Skarmory and Thunder Wave from Blissey from ruining a sweep. When used as a lead for setting up sand, Taunt also prevents Skarmory from freely laying down Spikes. It is possible to use Substitute in the filler slot with 252 HP EVs, which produce 101 HP Substitutes that block Blissey's Seismic Toss; this can be useful in fishing for paralysis in paralysis-spam archetypes while still doing the job of blocking status and setting up on slow Pokemon like Blissey, Porygon2, and Body Slam Snorlax.</p> <p>Since this set is EVed to survive, not to trade, it is not a wallbreaker but a sweeper. The general plan for sweeping with this Tyranitar should be to leave it mostly untouched while waiting for all of the opponent's Tyranitar checks to be worn down before setting up. Note that the vastly reduced Attack gives only middling odds for Tyranitar to take out Zapdos or Salamence without any boosts, and this is a likely scenario with Salamence's Intimidate in the picture. The same can also be said of Tyranitar's attempt to take out maximum HP defensively uninvested Claydol at +2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On the defensive side, taking even a tiny bit of damage nullifies this Tyranitar's benchmarks, so support to keep it at full HP is definitely helpful. Spinners such as Starmie and Claydol help to keep Spikes off the field. Wish support from Jirachi and Blissey, especially after a sacrifice, also allows Tyranitar to heal up right before sweeping. On the offensive side, this Tyranitar wants support to wear down its checks. Choice Band Metagross is particularly apt, as it lures in and removes Skarmory with Explosion without it laying a single layer of Spikes, allowing Tyranitar to fulfill all its defensive benchmarks when it enters the field. However, this set features relatively more on balanced teams that use Spikes from Skarmory and sometimes Cloyster to wear down the opponent's Pokemon uniformly so that Tyranitar's all-encompassing coverage can break through late-game. Spikes also makes it a lot harder for the opponent to stop the sweep by pivoting to Salamence for an Intimidate drop and then to Metagross to resist the Rock Slide. Additionally, bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar has the advantage over the fast set here due to its ability to continue using Dragon Dance in the face of non-Choice Band variants of Salamence and Metagross.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bulky physical Tyranitar commonly features on TSS-style teams; it sports immense bulk, an intimidating Attack stat, and a brutally varied selection of coverage. Its sheer power and coverage make this set a very realistic threat to any team. Capable of quickly wearing down Skarmory and Swampert with Focus Punch, even hard checks and counters need to keep an eye out while switching into this Tyranitar.</p> <p>With the first three attacks, Tyranitar can hit the entire tier for at least neutral if not super effective damage. Rock Slide is a great spammable STAB move that becomes very difficult to pivot around consistently when Spikes are up. Earthquake hits Metagross, Jirachi, and opposing Tyranitar hard and OHKOes Dugtrio should it try to trap Tyranitar and spoil the fun. Focus Punch hits Skarmory and Swampert for neutral damage, and Hidden Power Bug allows Tyranitar to reliably beat Celebi as well as hit incoming Claydol for meaningful damage. This all-round coverage makes Tyranitar an excellent at forcing switches out of the Pokemon standing right in front, making Focus Punch an excellent move for hitting Tyranitar's checks hard. Roar can be used on slower-paced teams where the Spikes damage can be expected to really rack up, and it provides a defensive lifeline against Rest Suicune lacking Sleep Talk and Curse Snorlax as well as the added bonus of disrupting Baton Pass teams at the cost of the huge damage that can be dished out from a well-timed Focus Punch. Roar can potentially double Spikes chip by forcing special walls in and then forcing them to pivot out to physical walls again, paving the way for a clean KO from threats like Dugtrio.</p> <p>The bulk EVs help Tyranitar survive boosted Dragon Dance Salamence's and Tyranitar's Earthquake, Metagross's Meteor Mash, Starmie's Hydro Pump, and Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake. Maximum Attack EVs are used to get the hefty damage from Tyranitar's coverage moves. The EVs also help against offensive Jirachi's Hidden Power Grass. Leftovers rounds up Tyranitar's defensive role, recovering a significant amount of HP each time it switches in on a passive Pokemon or a resisted attack.</p> <p>Bulky physical Tyranitar is great in the lead spot on TSS-style teams, as it gets up sand immediately, which is key to chipping down non-sand-immune Pokemon such as Suicune, which is immensely threatening to the TSS teams this set commonly finds itself on. You should not be attempting to sweep with this Tyranitar set; rather, focus on chipping down specific checks on your opponent's team to make an opening for a cleaner such as offensive Starmie or Choice Band Aerodactyl. Aim to support Tyranitar early-game with as many layers of Spikes that is safely possible, since it removes the need for Tyranitar to make any huge predicts in order to make significant progress against the opponent's checks. Attempt to get in Tyranitar repeatedly throughout the game against Pokemon such as Blissey, Choice-locked Salamence, Snorlax, and defensive Zapdos that it forces out in order to fully take advantage of the support it gets from Spikes. However, remember to watch out for Focus Punch from Snorlax and status moves such as Toxic from Zapdos and Blissey and take care to get Tyranitar in without sustaining too many smaller hits, as even with such good bulk, uninvested Thunderbolt and Seismic Toss damage can quickly rack up, especially when Spikes are on the field.</p> <p>Tyranitar should also not be overlooked as a defensive pivot that can force out unboosted Snorlax and decently checks defensive Celebi and Calm Mind Jirachi thanks to its bulk, typing, and sheer power. It should also be noted that sometimes, having Tyranitar at a good amount of HP can provide extra wiggle room against late-game threats such as Starmie, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. However, this line of play has to be performed pretty deliberately, as keeping Tyranitar at full throughout a game is not particularly easy due to how it is easily chipped by Spikes and weak attacks throughout a game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Naturally, this set fits best in Spikes-orientated teams due to its ability to force lots of switches and easily rack up chip damage. Because of this, you really can't go wrong pairing this set with most Spikers; both Skarmory and Cloyster fully appreciate its presence on a team and how Tyranitar likes to lure in defensive Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune and Steel-types, which are easy to set Spikes against. Additionally, Cloyster is armed with Explosion, which, if timed right, has the power to put some Tyranitar checks out of commission.</p> <p>Defensively speaking, special pivots such as Blissey, Celebi, and, to a lesser extent, Jolteon are all also appreciated by Tyranitar; the former two can absorb status with Natural Cure and even potentially heal up Tyranitar with Wish or Leech Seed, respectively. Jolteon appreciates Tyranitar for providing immense pressure against Blissey, and it makes a great momentum gaining target for Jolteon's Baton Passes while providing an absorber to strong Thunderbolts Tyranitar doesn't want to take. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert also make good partners; their ability to sponge Metagross's attacks is much appreciated, as it gives Tyranitar the space to play a longer game and fully take advantage of Spikes. Gengar also deserves a separate special mention, as between it and Tyranitar, all of Snorlax's coverage is walled flawlessly.</p> <p>Finally, offensive partners vary from Gengar, which also takes advantage of Spikes and has strong special attacks, to teammates built for late-game cleaning such as Aerodactyl, which hugely appreciates Tyranitar's ability to soften up Rock-resistant foes and make room for it to finish the job. Other potential offensive partners include the likes of Starmie and Moltres, providing support through cleaning and breaking, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Pursuit": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar's main purpose is to trap Gengar, which can otherwise wreak havoc on teams that rely on Rapid Spin, lack burn pivots, or use physically offensive Pokemon with moves that Gengar soaks with its plethora of immunities and resistances. Pursuit also has the auxiliary benefit of forcing chip damage on Choice-locked Salamence and Aerodactyl. With some prediction or the benefit of its set being unrevealed, Pursuit Tyranitar can also chip Zapdos and Moltres or even remove Celebi and Claydol. With chip damage from Celebi's Leech Seed or even the occasional Breloom's Mach Punch, Pursuit can furthermore be used to revenge kill Dugtrio. Crunch is a safe move that allows Tyranitar to severely damage any Gengar that attempts to stay in on Pursuit, hits most of unrevealed Tyranitar's switch-ins—Swampert, Metagross, Suicune, Claydol, and Flygon—for at least neutral damage, and can threaten to take out even Snorlax and Swampert with Special Defense drops. Notably, Tyranitar can survive Hydro Pump from offensive Starmie and OHKO back with Crunch in a pinch; this is a scenario that appears rather frequently on teams running Pursuit Tyranitar with Magneton, and these teams are weak to Starmie more often than not.</p> <p>The third move is decided usually by the presence or absence of Magneton on the team. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar to 2HKO Skarmory, preventing it from running amok with Spikes; it also KOes Metagross after Crunch, and Tyranitar has enough bulk to survive non-Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash and perform the trade if necessary. Fire Blast also prevents Heracross and Breloom from coming in freely, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. With Magneton as a teammate, Skarmory and, to a lesser extent, Metagross can be trapped, so there is less of a need for Fire Blast. Ice Beam has several nifty uses here. First, if one can infer that the opponent is not using Gengar, Dugtrio can be baited to trap Tyranitar and be OHKOed in turn by Ice Beam. This frees up Magneton for trapping Skarmory without being concerned about a double switch to Dugtrio. Second, Tyranitar can survive Dragon Dance Salamence's boosted Earthquake and KO back. The decision to preserve Pursuit Tyranitar at full HP can be made when it is inferred that Salamence is the last Pokemon, because it is very likely that an opponent using Salamence will not be simultaneously using Gengar. Ice Beam also 2HKOes Zapdos and Aerodactyl, and it OHKOes Flygon.</p> <p>The last move is chosen to suit the pace of the team. Roar is usually the choice for slower-paced teams that use Spikes, such as those carrying Forretress. As physical Tyranitar is usually the Jirachi check for many teams, Pursuit Tyranitar-based teams can be slightly Jirachi weak. While Roar is not a direct answer to Jirachi, it helps to mitigate that weakness by racking up enough Spikes damage so that Jirachi cannot set up sufficiently later on to be threatening. Roar is also good for denying Suicune, Curse Snorlax, and Dragon Dance users like Salamence, Gyarados, and other Tyranitar setup opportunities should they try to take advantage of weakened Tyranitar or its lack of coverage. Hidden Power Grass is good for nailing Swampert and useful for physically offensive teams that appreciate taking a chunk out of Swampert or sand teams that don't have any Swampert checks. Brick Break prevents opposing Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up to +2 and hits Snorlax and Blissey hard. Speed EVs might be useful to outrun Blissey in case Brick Break is used, but its usefulness is limited because Blissey is not 2HKOed, and one should generally not count on Blissey being slow. Other options not mentioned are Earthquake, which gives Tyranitar some semblance of an ability to check Jirachi, Taunt, which halts Skarmory in its tracks and prevents Blissey from taking the opportunity to come in to heal, and Counter, which is a catch-all for Dugtrio, Metagross, and Salamence and lets Tyranitar lure in and remove Claydol, giving Spikers free rein. Note that mixed sets can run a Quiet nature, though that is not strictly necessary if Brick Break's sole purpose is stopping Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>Although Leftovers is the standard item and gives Tyranitar the longevity for drawn-out games involving Snorlax or Jirachi, Black Glasses can be used when removing, and not just heavily chipping, Gengar is absolutely essential. The scenario where this is most relevant is where Pursuit Tyranitar is used in conjunction with a Pokemon that has no coverage moves for Gengar, such as Curse Snorlax lacking Shadow Ball or Breloom. It provides about 2/3 odds of OHKOing Gengar with Pursuit at the expense of Tyranitar's longevity and nullifying many of its defensive benchmarks.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment gives Tyranitar the bulk to switch in and KO defensive Gengar without a Grass-type move down should Gengar decide to stay in while Tyranitar keeps using Pursuit. It also allows Tyranitar to survive Starmie's Hydro Pump, Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake, boosted Earthquake from Dragon Dance Salamence and Tyranitar, and Metagross's Meteor Mash with high odds after Spikes and Leftovers recovery. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Tyranitar to OHKO offensive Gengar with Crunch or Pursuit on the switch. More Speed at the expense of Special Attack and HP can be used to outrun Blissey and Skarmory at the expense of the aforementioned benchmarks.</p> <p>Even with all its strengths, Tyranitar is not an absolutely reliable trapper. Defensive Gengar is frequently EVed to survive Pursuit on the switch out, and Tyranitar can then be chipped down via burn or removed with Dugtrio. Gengar can also nullify Tyranitar with Hypnosis or play mind games with Tyranitar if it carries Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass. Even Gengar without these moves can play mind games with chipped Tyranitar. Thus, wherever possible, getting Tyranitar in the same turn as Gengar can greatly improve the odds of eliminating it. When Gengar is absent on the opponent's team, it may seem like Pursuit Tyranitar is useless for the battle apart from setting up sand, and one can be discouraged from sending it in. However, prudent use of Tyranitar can still maximize its utility in the battle by setting sand, trading, and exploiting its bulk. For example, if it is inferred that Pursuit Tyranitar is not needed for defensive purposes end-game, it can be switched into something like Snorlax mid-game, even if a stronger check like Metagross might be the more reliable switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar prevents Gengar from performing its defensive and offensive roles: spinblocking, spreading burns, threatening frail offenses that are not fast enough to contest it, and having a plethora of important immunities and resistances. As such, teammates that can exploit its removal are optimal.</p> <p>Defensively, Gengar's removal allows Forretress to use Rapid Spin without fear of getting spinblocked. Defensive Jirachi can fully exploit the Wish + Protect sequence without fear of burn damage accumulating over two turns. Defensive Flygon can be used as a Tyranitar check that is immune to Spikes. Celebi can drop Psychic in favor of a supporting move like Heal Bell or Baton Pass as long as the team has another way of checking Zapdos. With Magneton support, defensive Swampert can give up Hydro Pump and increase its durability tremendously by using both Protect and Refresh; Donphan can be used as a spinner that is a solid physical Tyranitar check; Steelix can be used both as a physical and Electric-type check.</p> <p>Offensively, Pursuit Tyranitar supports all variants of Salamence well, as Gengar is one of the few Pokemon that can survive +1 Salamence and OHKO back. Venusaur is also well supported by Pursuit Tyranitar, for Gengar is one of the few members of stall teams that freely switches in on it. Venusaur's Sleep Powder also gives Tyranitar free turns to come in and trap the sleeping Pokemon; this is especially useful if the opponent uses Claydol as sleep fodder. The combination of Pursuit Tyranitar and Magneton takes a multi-pronged approach in weakening or eliminating most hovering threats—Gengar, Skarmory, Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Zapdos—reducing the need for prediction when using Choice Band Flygon, Heracross, or one's own Aerodactyl and making up for Gyarados's limited movepool. This combination also allows Curse Snorlax to drop Shadow Ball in favor of the vastly more threatening Earthquake and allows Breloom to run a set with only Fighting-type moves. Notably, Breloom and Pursuit Tyranitar form a very synergistic core. Should Breloom get trapped by Dugtrio, Mach Punch puts it in range of Tyranitar's Pursuit. Tyranitar also pivots into and chips Choice Band Salamence and Moltres, both of which are checks to Breloom.</p>"

      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Tyranitar is a threatening wallbreaker that excels at dismantling slower teams with the versatile coverage granted by its expansive movepool. It weaponizes the element of surprise, drawing in the likes of Swampert and Metagross, which opponents will often switch in expecting physical sets with Rock Slide. With an early prediction, Tyranitar can heavily weaken these Pokemon as they switch in and compromise a defensive structure for an entire game. Its 243 Speed suits its role well; it is faster than the vast majority of Metagross sets, all Swampert sets, uninvested base 100s such as Celebi, Zapdos, and Jirachi, and base 70s with a neutral nature such as Magneton and Skarmory. Getting the first hit off is very valuable for Tyranitar, as this set is not at all resilient. It cannot switch into Zapdos's Thunderbolt, is OHKOed by Hydro Pumps from Torrent-active Swampert and Starmie, and most importantly is easily trapped and picked off by Dugtrio. Tyranitar will get KOed quickly and is not at all suited to drawn-out games, so sharp lines of play are required to harness its potential.</p> <p>Fire Blast scorches Skarmory and Metagross; it is a comfortable 2HKO on both. Skarmory is able to regain health later on with Protect and its excellent pivoting ability, but if Metagross takes a Fire Blast, it is essentially out of the game, and even if it manages to get in safely again later, it is forced to prematurely use Explosion. Hidden Power Grass targets the ubiquitous Swampert, a Pokemon that will switch into Tyranitar very often, as it is the ideal response to physical sets. When using this Tyranitar, bluffing a physical set such as Dragon Dance to lure in Swampert can be devastating and is not too difficult to pull off either. For example, bringing Tyranitar in at a natural Dragon Dance juncture such as versus weakened Blissey achieves this effect.</p> <p>Ice Beam is employed to cover the two 4x Ice-weak Pokemon in the tier, Salamence and Flygon. Salamence cannot use Dragon Dance against this Tyranitar, as it will be comfortably OHKOed. Having the OHKO move for Flygon available is ideal; Flygon is another desired response to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and as such, mixed Tyranitar excels at luring it. Ice Beam is also the only move other than Focus Punch that mixed Tyranitar can use to OHKO Dugtrio; once Tyranitar has revealed a lack of Leftovers and Fire Blast, Dugtrio could otherwise freely switch into any move and trap it. Rock Slide is an alternative to Ice Beam that lets Tyranitar crush Moltres, and it is stronger against Zapdos. 16 Attack EVs are recommended with Rock Slide, as this allows Tyranitar to always OHKO Aerodactyl. Crunch is a third option, dealing strong neutral hits as a somewhat spammable move and being Tyranitar's only method of 2HKOing Claydol and its best move for dueling Celebi due to Fire Blast's extremely limited PP and imperfect accuracy. Crunch is also notable for OHKOing frailer Gengar sets. However, this Tyranitar is not particularly suited to switching into Gengar due to its poor bulk, and if Tyranitar shows no Leftovers, Gengar will rarely stay in to get hit by Crunch because Pursuit becomes considerably less likely. Crunch is also much worse than Ice Beam and Rock Slide against Zapdos and Salamence.</p> <p>Brick Break completes the set's rainbow of coverage. It is particularly useful in the Tyranitar mirror, with its universal 2HKO giving it the edge against all sets outside of Choice Band and Dragon Dance. It nonetheless stifles Dragon Dance Tyranitar, disallowing the setup of multiple boosts. Brick Break also prevents Blissey from switching into Tyranitar, particularly with Spikes up. However, Tyranitar sadly cannot 2HKO a fully healthy blob. Tyranitar can still potentially break through Blissey with chained Brick Breaks, as the repeated uses of Soft-Boiled that Brick Break forces give Tyranitar more chances for a critical hit and Lum Berry shields Tyranitar from that crucial Thunder Wave. Brick Break is also the best thing this Tyranitar can throw at Snorlax. Focus Punch is an alternative to Brick Break, best used alongside Rock Slide for a one-two punch of forcing Blissey to heal away Rock Slide damage then smashing it as it does so with Focus Punch. Focus Punch also denies Dragon Dance Tyranitar any setup opportunity whatsoever.</p> <p>Lum Berry is a fantastic item for this set; so many defensive teams lean on status to combat Tyranitar. A single-turn shield from Skarmory's Toxic, Gengar's Will-O-Wisp, Snorlax's Body Slam, and Blissey's Thunder Wave and Toxic grants Tyranitar a crucial lifeline that allows it to continue pressurizing for that extra turn or two, which can greatly swing the game's momentum. Leftovers can grant Tyranitar a few turns of passive recovery, especially as defensive teams often spend multiple turns pivoting or using Protect versus mixed Tyranitar. Hasty Tyranitar with Leftovers also consistently avoids being 2HKOed by Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Naturally, one should not rely on this Tyranitar as a Zapdos stop at all, but this bonus is useful in a pinch. Salac Berry is also a viable alternative because Tyranitar is frequently chipped or can be manipulated into activation range by a combination of attacks and Spikes. It allows Tyranitar to fire off that extra super effective hit before it goes down.</p> <p>Hasty is the slightly preferred nature, as it gives Tyranitar a little more staying power against Gengar and Zapdos and enables it to always survives Torrent-boosted Surf from uninvested Swampert—even most of the time after one layer of Spikes. A Naive nature allows Tyranitar to survive two Aerodactyl Rock Slides almost all the time and improves Tyranitar's odds of surviving a MixMence's Brick Break after Spikes. Naive improves Tyranitar's staying power against Claydol's and Flygon's Earthquakes, avoiding the 2HKO from the former more often and the OHKO from all spreads of the latter. A Special Attack-boosting nature can replace the usual Speed-boosting one, and it makes Tyranitar's damage against Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross stick a little more. However, being slower than the multitude of Pokemon between 221 and 243 Speed—Choice Band Metagross, Endeavor Swampert, uninvested base 100s, and Modest Magneton—is devastating.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is a lesser used option that can take fast Pokemon such as Gengar and Zapdos out of the game. It is also Tyranitar's best option for dealing with Superachi. Thunder Wave will likely replace the Fighting-type coverage move, and it is best used alongside Rock Slide, as paraflinching Blissey is Tyranitar's best way of getting past it with no Fighting-type move available. Finally, Thunder is usable for catching Milotic and Suicune on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Tyranitar is a fast-paced offensive Pokemon that finds its best use on similarly offensive teams built around cultivating momentum. It is extremely well suited to supporting late-game physical threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence, Agility Metagross, and Aerodactyl, all of which highly appreciate a weakened—or even KOed—Skarmory or Swampert. Mixed Tyranitar works well alongside other breaking Pokemon that effectively make use of momentum; doubling up on mixed attackers with a mixed Metagross or Salamence is a great combination for exerting high pressure. This Tyranitar also functions well on a more specially oriented offense, in particularly alongside the likes of Supercele and Dugtrio. This triumvirate has some excellent synergies; Dugtrio can trap other Dugtrio that have revenge killed Celebi, allowing Tyranitar to later attack with impunity and not fear being trapped. Celebi is also excellent at using the small selection of Pokemon that wall this Tyranitar, namely Milotic and defensive Suicune, to comfortably set up with Calm Mind and threaten to sweep. Dugtrio removes Metagross after it has been dented with Fire Blast, preventing a threatening trade from the opponent via Explosion, and also removes slightly weakened Starmie, which can otherwise exploit the specially offensive vulnerabilities of many offensive teams that contain this Tyranitar. On the topic of special attackers, Tyranitar needs a partner that can weather a special hit once or twice from the likes of Starmie, offensive Suicune, and Zapdos. Out of the limited repertoire of special walls in the tier, this will more likely be Snorlax than Blissey, as Snorlax is better suited to the fast offensive teams that this Tyranitar works best on, surrendering less momentum than Blissey. Finally, mixed Tyranitar also goes well with Spikes, as its rainbow of coverage and surprise factor give it an easy time forcing switches and racking up Spikes damage. On offensive teams, the Spiker of choice is frequently Cloyster, but it can easily also be Skarmory.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a potent wallbreaker; while mixed Tyranitar is surgically precise at dismantling TSS teams, Choice Band Tyranitar is an all-around great wallbreaker that is adept at switching into and forcing out special walls and denting the tier's selection of defensive Water-types. Rock Slide exerts tremendous pressure on bulky Water-types that do not resist Rock, namely Milotic and Suicune. The odds of 2HKOing Milotic under sand are overwhelmingly high, forcing Milotic to switch; the definite 3HKO on Suicune forces it to use Rest early. Sometimes, Tyranitar even gets away scot-free by flinching through these walls. Once Milotic and Suicune cede momentum, it is no longer a straightforward task bringing them in. Choice Band Tyranitar is essentially the strongest set against bulky Water-types. Focus Punch is Choice Band Tyranitar's main coverage move, smashing Water-types, Skarmory, Flygon, and Metagross on the switch when the opponent respects the possibility of losing the Pokemon right in front of them with Rock Slide. Notably, it threatens to 2HKO Suicune under sand, and it 2HKOes Swampert as well. Earthquake nails Metagross on the switch, keeps Jirachi under control defensively, and hits opposing Tyranitar hard. Hidden Power Bug OHKOes Celebi and 2HKOes Claydol. An alternative in the fourth slot is Double-Edge, which eliminates prediction by providing neutral coverage against bulky Water-types, Flygon, and Claydol as they come in, and, compared to Focus Punch, it does not require Tyranitar to switch out after. Another alternative is Brick Break, which helps against Curse Snorlax, Blissey, and opposing Tyranitar. It is advised to have other measures for Celebi such as Dugtrio and Moltres if these alternative fillers are used.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs help Tyranitar maximize the odds of KOing its walls. Maximum Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outspeed Milotic and Suicune, most offensive Swampert, and most Metagross. Other options are a Jolly nature, unfortunately with a huge reduction in power, and at least 188 HP EVs to get to 387 HP, surviving Dugtrio and helping with checking offensive Jirachi and Zapdos, but the lack of Leftovers and the ease of taking chip damage through Spikes and attacks from even passive Pokemon frequently nullifies those benchmarks; this spread is perhaps most useful when Tyranitar is passed Wish.</p> <p>This set is ideally played with emphasis on aggressive prediction as a fearsome lead that is very effective against Zapdos and its switch-ins, coming in on slow Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax, using Focus Punch or Earthquake on predicted switches to Rock-resistant Pokemon. While Focus Punch does a ton of damage should the opponent switch, using Earthquake as a midground hits both Metagross and Water-type switch-ins really hard while not revealing the move choice when Zapdos uses Baton Pass and mitigating the risk of locking into Focus Punch against a Snorlax that decides to stay in and attack. A single turn can put an offensive team's physical defenses out of commission just like that. Its weaknesses lie in its momentum losses and lack of bulk, so aggressive double switches are preferred to coming in and taking damage. One has to be far-sighted using this set as the game goes on; being Choice locked is dangerous against offensive teams and allows them to set up or gain momentum. Without any bulk investment or Leftovers, Tyranitar gets annihilated by Dugtrio, and its offensive abilities are severely compromised by paralysis from Blissey, Snorlax, and Jirachi. It is also prone to getting burned by Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Surprisingly, this offensive set fits best with more defensive partners; being Choice-locked allows for easier setup from foes, so the team needs to be safe against boosting threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence. Skarmory and Swampert can soak hits from Metagross and Salamence, both common pivots into Tyranitar's most potent moves. Choice Band Tyranitar works nicely with Spikes support for additional pressure on Water-types and Metagross. Blissey and Jirachi can pass Wishes to Tyranitar; furthermore, Blissey absorbs Will-O-Wisp from Gengar too. Spinners like Claydol and Starmie can prolong Tyranitar's longevity in light of lacking Leftovers. Zapdos can use Baton Pass to bring Tyranitar in safely on an anticipated switch to Blissey, Snorlax, or Celebi. Dugtrio can trap Steel-types, allowing Tyranitar to mindlessly lock in on Rock Slide should the opponent not have another Rock-resistant Pokemon. Porygon2 can counter trap opposing Dugtrio, while Choice Band Tyranitar is also great at threatening Curse Snorlax, which Porygon2 lets in a lot. Physical late-game threats such as Aerodactyl and Salamence appreciate weakened Water-types. Aerodactyl especially fits well on the same teams that Choice Band Tyranitar fits on, and being faster than Gengar and Starmie is really helpful on those kinds of teams. Moltres is a particularly synergistic partner. It draws Blissey in and forces it to recover, allowing Tyranitar an entry point, while Tyranitar's chip damage on Water-types gives Moltres an easier time.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi is one of the most versatile Pokemon in ADV OU. With high stats across the board, it can easily run physically and specially defensive sets, momentum-maintaining Baton Pass sets with Calm Mind or Swords Dance, a special sweeper set, or a Substitute + Baton Pass set.</p> <p>Defensively, Natural Cure and crucial resistances to Electric-, Water-, Ground- and Fighting-type attacks allow it to pivot safely into Zapdos, Jolteon, Magneton, Swampert, defensive Suicune, Claydol, and Breloom without Hidden Power Bug and into status moves from Blissey, Snorlax, Defensive Jirachi, Milotic, and Porygon2. Leech Seed is the best move defensive Celebi can offer, allowing it to not only soften the impact of incoming threats but also chip bulky Pokemon into KO range of its teammates.</p> <p>Offensively, it is one of the few pivots that can easily turn the tides against Zapdos and Swampert by absorbing Thunderbolt or Hydro Pump, setting up, and Baton Passing out; it is perhaps the only common and reliable stat boost passer in the game. Celebi as a sweeper itself is often also very dangerous in an unconventional way, because its coverage and natural bulk allow it to challenge checks to more passive sets like Tyranitar, Salamence, and Metagross, while its ability to heal from Giga Drain may very well help to win the war against Snorlax and Blissey.</p> <p>Unfortunately, while Celebi's typing offers all its useful resistances, it is also the root of all its flaws. Weaknesses to very common attacking types like Flying, Fire, and Bug invite all sorts of threats like Salamence, Moltres, and Heracross, while its need to repeatedly use Recover in the face of Ice Beam to gain back a substantial amount of HP makes it very susceptible to freeze and critical hits. Its four-fold Bug weakness makes it susceptible to being trapped by Dugtrio, and its Dark weakness makes Pursuit Tyranitar a huge threat to any Celebi without Baton Pass. While Celebi can often be considered a special wall, its inability to pressure Skarmory and weaker special bulk make it relatively weaker to Spikes and sand than Blissey.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Celebi can really exist anywhere on the spectrum of defense to offense. The sets listed above are pretty much divided into day and night, but mid-paced Celebi sets are also entirely feasible on the right team. A set of Calm Mind, Leech Seed, and two of Psychic, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power Fire can be used with the appropriate trappers to exert a lot of pressure in the face of Blissey and Snorlax. Alternatively, Recover / Leech Seed / two attacks on an offensive set gives Celebi some defensive utility without compromising its ability to hit threatening switch-ins. Calm Mind / Leech Seed / Psychic / Baton Pass with Magneton support can be really helpful for forcing switches and getting the right foe in so that pass targets have an easier time, and this set also allows Celebi to set up in the face of Blissey and Snorlax. Toxic on the utility set permanently cripples a ton of Celebi's checks, especially Salamence, Moltres, and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice can be used on offensive Celebi to nab the surprise KO on Salamence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Flying-types</strong>: Salamence, Gyarados, and Aerodactyl can switch in safely on any of Celebi's sets and set up or threaten to hit Celebi very hard with a Choice Band-boosted attack. They cannot, however, take repeated hits of Psychic indefinitely, and mixed Salamence in particular struggles to break past Calm Mind Celebi. Note that none of these are foolproof answers to Baton Pass Celebi carrying boosts, as faster Celebi can outspeed them before taking any damage, and slower Celebi can be EVed to take a hit before passing the boosts out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Moltres and Charizard either OHKO many Celebi sets or come very close to doing so and are good pivots against defensive Celebi. Offensive Celebi can, however, beat Moltres and slower Charizard if it uses Calm Mind on the switch, and Baton Pass Celebi can safely pivot out by outspeeding either or tanking a hit if Moltres does not have Roar. Houndoom is a rare check that works in the same vein but can also use Pursuit to catch Celebi switching out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Threats</strong>: Metagross and Tyranitar are usually able to exert enough pressure on defensive Celebi before it can take them out with its coverage moves. They won't stop Celebi from Baton Passing out its boosts, but Metagross can at least use Explosion, and Tyranitar can at least set up on the target with Dragon Dance. Roar Tyranitar can also stop a pass, but it is highly unreliable due to many Celebi packing Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Skarmory takes next to nothing from defensive Celebi's attacks. It can also stop Celebi from passing boosts while tanking Hidden Power Fire, though that is not an ideal position because it forces Skarmory to take damage without laying Spikes. Roar Zapdos and Moltres can easily phaze Celebi that don't have a move to hit them hard, like Psychic or Ancient Power.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can come in on weakened Celebi to trap and finish it off with Hidden Power Bug. Spikes and Toxic help to induce the chip needed for the KO.</p> <p><strong>Bug-type Moves</strong>: Heracross and Flygon don't switch in so well but can threaten to OHKO or 2HKO back with Megahorn and Hidden Power Bug, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Regice and Jynx hit Celebi very hard and undermine Celebi's role as a special tank as well as that of the Zapdos and Celebi core as a specially defensive core. These Ice-types, however, do not stop boosts and should be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Skarmory and Forretress can freely set up Spikes on defensive Celebi to erode its defensive capabilities significantly. Celebi frequently relies on Recover to make progress against attacks that do less than 50% damage, so attacks crossing that threshold with Spikes damage place Celebi into unfavorable Recover loops.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Utility Celebi is unique in the metagame as a mixed wall that can deal with Electric-types, Water-types, and Snorlax as well as exert constant pressure with Leech Seed and the threat of trapper support.</p> <p>Leech Seed and Celebi's accompanying bulk are the main features of this set. Leech Seed is a move with both offensive and defensive utility that allows Celebi to chip a number of Pokemon while maintaining momentum via passive recovery for itself or its teammates. Offensively, the chip damage is excellent at wearing down bulky physical tanks, potentially putting Metagross and Tyranitar into OHKO range of boosted Salamence's, Aerodactyl's, and Dugtrio's Earthquake. It can also place Tyranitar into OHKO range of defensive Metagross and potentially into 2HKO range of Snorlax's Earthquake. Leech Seed is also excellent at wearing down Flying-types because of their lack of recovery and, in some cases, lack of sand immunity, allowing Water-types to threaten weakened Zapdos more easily, putting Moltres into 2HKO range of Pursuit Tyranitar, and placing Skarmory into OHKO range of Timid Magneton. Defensively, Leech Seed allows Claydol to keep spinning in the face of Drill Peck Skarmory, forcing Skarmory to switch out first, hence leaving no Spikes on the field. It is also serves to check Suicune and Snorlax by forcing them to Rest repeatedly, allowing a teammate to exploit those free turns. Finally, Leech Seed's passive recovery and ability to force switches can either provide Choice Band users like Salamence and Heracross with some added longevity or let them switch in freely.</p> <p>Recover allows Celebi to stick around for a long time and is especially needed in the face of repeated hits from Snorlax; Ice-type coverage from Water-types, Zapdos, and Gengar; Will-O-Wisp from Gengar; and Toxic from Blissey, Milotic, Swampert, and Zapdos. Celebi is bulky and does not have to use Recover frequently if it pivots only into resisted attacks. If the opponent has Dugtrio, though, Celebi should be kept near full HP through Recover, even though it can be tempting to maintain the pressure with repeated Leech Seeds.</p> <p>Psychic hits Gengar very hard, which is important because many teams rely exclusively on Celebi to pivot into its Will-O-Wisp. It also makes progress against many switch-ins, like Salamence, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Heracross, Flygon, and Heracross, and helps Celebi deal with Zapdos a bit more easily. Although most Zapdos are unable to severely threaten Celebi, Leech Seed's PP can easily be drained through Zapdos's Pressure, and the occasional Substitute Zapdos can completely turn the tables on Celebi lacking Psychic.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass allows Celebi to OHKO Dugtrio with minimal Special Attack investment, hits Tyranitar hard, and allows Celebi to be a Starmie pivot. On Spikes teams, it allows Celebi to threaten the two common spinners—Claydol and Starmie—should they attempt to spin on Celebi. Hidden Power Grass is mostly run when Celebi is not paired with Dugtrio or Porygon2. When paired with either, the preferred move is Baton Pass, as Celebi can scout for a Tyranitar or Dugtrio switch-in and pass out to either trapper. If Celebi is at full HP, it can also tank Hidden Power Bug and trap opposing Dugtrio by passing to one's own Dugtrio. When used with Magneton, Baton Pass also helps to catch Skarmory.</p> <p>As for less commonly used moves, Substitute in conjunction with Leech Seed and Baton Pass makes Celebi adept at inducing chip damage, eases trapping, and generates free turns for huge threats like Aerodactyl. Reflect neuters Metagross's Explosion and Snorlax's Self-Destruct, protecting one's bulky Water-types and also Celebi itself. Reflect also provides a crucial setup turn for sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Dragon Dance Salamence. Heal Bell can be helpful for teammates with Rest like Suicune, Snorlax, and Zapdos. Light Screen helps Forretress and Skarmory avoid being trapped and taken out by Magneton; Forretress can then KO back with Earthquake, while Skarmory can phaze Magneton and a reverse trap can be set with Dugtrio later on. Perish Song is a phazing move that stops Calm Mind users in their tracks and also deals with bulky setup sweepers in the endgame. The downside to using these alternative moves is that dropping a STAB move or Baton Pass for any of them compromises Celebi's ability to deal with both Gengar and Dugtrio at the same time. Gengar is easier to deal with than Dugtrio because Celebi can simply be paired with a Pursuit trapper, so Hidden Power Grass is frequently the attacking move kept when Celebi sports these alternate moves.</p> <p>The EVs are fashioned to survive Choice Band Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Salamence's Hidden Power Flying in sand, and they let Celebi comfortably survive Hidden Power Bug from Dugtrio. 40 Special Attack EVs are required to OHKO Dugtrio with Hidden Power Grass; variants lacking the said move can place the EVs in Special Defense or Speed. 32 Speed EVs are required to outrun all Tyranitar. Celebi can go for a faster benchmark like 136 Speed EVs, which gets the jump on Adamant Heracross and most offensive Suicune. Substitute Celebi can use a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe with a Timid nature to survive Adamant Dugtrio while outrunning Timid Moltres and neutral-natured Salamence, Zapdos, Flygon, and Charizard. With this spread, Celebi can also Baton Pass out of a significant number of Taunt Gengar that are EVed to survive Pursuit Tyranitar under sand and Dragon Dance Salamence. If Celebi is important as a special wall, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 40 SpA / 120 SpD / 32 Spe with a Calm nature can be used; this spread also allows Celebi to survive Adamant Dugtrio's Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p>The key to using Celebi successfully is to generate entry opportunities for strong threats and trappers and to rack up enough chip damage to allow sweepers to run their course. Try to use Leech Seed to force switches and heal passively so that powerful threats can enter the field while taking minimum damage, but be careful to combine that with smart pivoting so as not to burn through Leech Seed's PP too quickly; common Leech Seed targets, especially Pokemon with Pressure like Zapdos and Suicune, tend to have the bulk to last quite a while. Conserving PP allows Celebi to be more threatening throughout the game, especially in the closing stages. Also, take advantage of Celebi drawing in many trappable checks, like Tyranitar, Metagross, Dugtrio, and Skarmory, especially by using Baton Pass if it is run. Finally, an aggressive sequence of consecutive Leech Seeds, especially with Spikes, can generate a lot of chip damage without having Celebi take any damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trappers are very common partners to utility Celebi. Magneton gets rid of Skarmory, which easily comes in and sets up Spikes on any variant of utility Celebi. Leech Seed also has nifty synergy with Substitute Magneton, which can trap and indefinitely wear down seeded Metagross and defensive Jirachi. Dugtrio traps chipped Tyranitar, Metagross, and opposing Celebi and can also take out opposing Dugtrio locked into Hidden Power Bug either from KOing or getting Baton Passed out of by Celebi. While Dugtrio does not directly help with Spikes control, taking out the bulky offensive Pokemon that exploit Celebi with Spikes around can allow Celebi to function reasonably well even under Spikes. Porygon2 is also a splendid partner that removes opposing Dugtrio and can indefinitely wall Salamence, one of the few common checks to Celebi that cannot be removed easily by trapping. Pursuit Tyranitar frees up Celebi to use a filler move instead of Psychic and can wear down Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl locked into a resisted move.</p> <p>Winning the Spikes war is one option for teams using utility Celebi. Bulky Spikers like Skarmory and Forretress are great for exploiting Celebi's switch forcing abilities. Together with Leech Seed, Spikes can generate a lot of chip damage for a sweeper like Aerodactyl to clean up the opposing team. Defensively, these Pokemon also help Celebi to deal with physical Metagross and Salamence. Claydol spins Spikes away, which is useful given Celebi's extraordinary propensity to attract Skarmory, and it can make use of Leech Seed's healing to stand its ground against Drill Peck Skarmory. Flygon's Spikes immunity and role as an Electric- and Rock-type check also help to compensate for Celebi's Skarmory attracting tendencies.</p> <p>Secondary special walls with a niche of their own, like Curse Snorlax and Rest Zapdos, make the team more robust against special attacks while offering their own utility. Celebi acts as a mid-game special wall, protecting Snorlax from taking chip so that it has the HP to perform a Curse sweep, while Snorlax can support Celebi should it falter against more potent special threats like Starmie, Calm Mind Suicune, Jirachi, and Celebi. Rest Zapdos helps Celebi deal with Suicune and other special threats, especially when Spikes are present, and can phaze Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Hard-hitting physical Pokemon, like Heracross and Choice Band Salamence, benefit from the entry or healing opportunities presented by Celebi's Leech Seed and from their mutual synergy with trappers. Heracross batters down Salamence, which Celebi can threaten later with Psychic, and Celebi can absorb Thunderbolt from Zapdos should it be the opponent's Heracross check. Heracross also benefits from Celebi synergistically luring in Dugtrio to be revenge killed by one's own Dugtrio. Salamence provides robust defensive utility against Heracross and draws in Swampert and Zapdos, which Celebi can easily pivot in on.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types are appreciated teammates, as Celebi's checks are mostly physical attackers. Milotic is a physical and mixed wall that can continuously soak up hits from Salamence, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Flygon, which love coming in on Celebi. Suicune is less robust than Milotic, but it can make full use of Leech Seed's recovery to provide some mid-game utility and play a more targeted endgame through a Calm Mind sweep. These Water-types benefit from the Dugtrio synergy, which reduces the heavy burden of Tyranitar and Metagross using unresisted Rock Slide or Explosion on them. Using Swampert might be tempting, but the prevalence of Fire-types with Grass-type coverage makes the Celebi + Swampert core unreliable for the long haul, and such cores must win the game through aggressive plays and trades on the more offensive side of the team.</p> <p>Finally, as Celebi has a propensity to wear down physically defensive Pokemon, sweepers like Aerodactyl, Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Agility Metagross are all fine partners for taking down weakened teams.</p>"

      "Calm Mind + Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is an excellent offensive momentum reverser that can support both wallbreakers and sweepers. It is one of the few Pokemon on offense teams that can shrug off Zapdos's Thunderbolt and offensive Swampert's Hydro Pump and pressure the opponent by setting up. Its coverage moves hit phazers hard and force opposing Metagross and Snorlax to navigate a tricky decision of sacrificing themselves with Explosion or Self-Destruct, lest they miss their chance to take out an attacking Celebi or waste the sacrifice on an unfavorable target.</p> <p>Calm Mind does not merely function as a stat boost for passing, though—it provides Celebi with both offensive and defensive utility as well. Boosted Giga Drain allows Celebi to stay in on a Tyranitar switch-in and threaten to 2HKO it. The recovery allows Celebi to be brought back to full HP from any chip damage it might have received from pivoting in, giving it better survivability against Hidden Power Bug from Tyranitar. The boost also allows Celebi to OHKO Starmie under sand with Giga Drain, protecting it from the latter's Ice Beam. Boosted Giga Drain also OHKOes Dugtrio and heals back whatever HP was lost from taking a Hidden Power Bug, which might otherwise place Celebi into sand range. Finally, Giga Drain allows Celebi to take down any Swampert or Suicune that are brave enough to stay in to phaze or continue chipping down Celebi. Psychic is a notable alternative that allows Celebi to hit Taunt Gengar, Moltres, Roar Zapdos, Salamence, Heracross, Flygon, and Charizard hard, especially after a Calm Mind boost. Note also that the Special Defense boost protects Celebi from Moltres and mixed Salamence too. Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory hard, forcing it to waste a turn phazing Celebi so that no Spikes are laid on the field, and threatens Metagross. It also prevents Jirachi and other Celebi from checking this set easily by engaging in a Calm Mind war.</p> <p>Baton Pass is mostly used for passing Calm Mind boosts, but it can also be used without any to aid Dugtrio or Porygon2 in trapping incoming Metagross, Tyranitar, or Dugtrio. After all, the last thing a Baton Pass Celebi team wants is Metagross using a free Explosion or Tyranitar setting up on the Baton Pass target.</p> <p>All EVs spreads come with tradeoffs. The listed EVs give boosted Celebi good odds to 2HKO bulky Tyranitar and the assured OHKO on offensive Starmie in sand while outspeeding Timid Moltres and Adamant Salamence. They also give Celebi a chance to OHKO Dugtrio without a boost. The HP investment helps Celebi to survive Hidden Power Bug from Jolly Dugtrio and provides extra bulk against Ice-type coverage. Alternatively, one can place the Special Attack EVs into Defense to always survive Adamant Tyranitar's Hidden Power Bug under sand at the expense of all the odds and assurances above. A spread of 76 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe can be used to heavily pressure Skarmory with an almost assured 2HKO and turns all the above rolls into certainties. However, such a set is likely to be OHKOed by Hidden Power Bug from Dugtrio and Tyranitar. Finally, one can even lower the Speed investment to the level of outspeeding Adamant Heracross in order to strengthen Special Attack, resulting in a spread of 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 Spe. This turns the offensive rolls into certainties without sacrificing bulk; it is especially useful when paired with Agility + Baton Pass Zapdos to make up for Celebi's lack of Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is usually found on special and mixed offense teams. The key to choosing recipients for the Calm Mind boost is understanding which targets pivot nicely into Celebi's checks. The hard-hitting checks that Celebi cannot deal with reliably using its coverage moves fall into three categories: bulky physical threats such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and Snorlax; physical Flying-types such as Salamence and Aerodactyl; and Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard. Additionally, Blissey is a counter that falls into none of these categories.</p> <p>On mixed offense teams, one can consider the following Baton Pass targets. Offensive Swampert comes in safely on Metagross, Tyranitar, and Salamence lacking Choice Band, as well as on Thunder Wave Blissey. A Calm Mind boost allows Swampert to OHKO Tyranitar with Hydro Pump, as well as Metagross while in Torrent range. The Special Defense boost also prevents Swampert from getting 2HKOed by Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar, and if Swampert comes in at full HP, it can also prevent mixed Salamence from OHKOing it with Hidden Power Grass. Should Swampert enter the game first, it easily lures in Zapdos, which lets Celebi switch in easily. Fire-types like Charizard and Moltres are high-pressure wallbreaking pivots into Metagross that can also threaten Skarmory should the opponent send it in as Celebi Baton Passes out. Mixed Metagross is a nice Snorlax and Blissey pivot that can 2HKO Swampert with Psychic after a boost. Mixed Tyranitar and Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar can also pivot into Snorlax; a Calm Mind boost allows mixed Tyranitar to often OHKO Swampert and Metagross and allows Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar to comfortably 2HKO Swampert without worrying about getting taken out by Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Zapdos is a pretty unique partner, as it has Baton Pass and Agility. Baton Pass allows it to maintain boosts by sending them to a teammate and can be used with or without Agility. Just having Baton Pass allows Zapdos to be a specially offensive Baton Pass target that can keep the boost alive for a longer period of time should Celebi get battered down while boosting, and Zapdos will not be concerned with being walled when it can pass the boosts to a mixed wallbreaker. While having Baton Pass Zapdos is itself great, Agility takes the synergy to a whole new level. Celebi with a Speed boost no longer gets revenge killed by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Salamence, and the pairing allows Celebi to get by with lower Speed investment. Conversely, Agility and Calm Mind boosts allow Zapdos to be a great late-game sweeper, and if the time is not ripe, it can pass the boosts to mixed Swampert or mixed Metagross, annihilating potential checks and revenge killers like Gengar, Zapdos, mixed Salamence, Starmie, Dugtrio, and Aerodactyl. Natural Cure on Celebi is a subtle but important part of passing Speed; Thunder Wave is a common measure for negating Speed boosts, so Zapdos can first pass the boost to Celebi, which then heals itself of the paralysis by passing out. Since paralyzed Celebi is usually the slower Pokemon on the field, the intended target receives the boosts without ever taking a scratch. Salac Berry + Substitute Zapdos is another possibility for acquiring the Speed boost that eases the prediction-based sequences of Swampert to Snorlax and allows Zapdos to still get the boost in the face of an onslaught of attacks that would have KOed Zapdos trying to squeeze off an Agility boost.</p> <p>On special offense teams, one can use the following Baton Pass targets instead. Calm Mind Suicune, Jirachi, and Raikou all appreciate boosts as a head start in the attempt to muscle through Blissey. Suicune acts as a pivot into Fire-types and physical attackers, and upon Celebi's first entry, it can use the fear of Celebi's potential Psychic pressuring Moltres to attack directly to avoid Will-O-Wisp. Jirachi acts as a much-needed source of Rock resistance and is the most reliable Calm Mind user to take down Blissey lacking Thunder Wave and Snorlax. Porygon2 can trap Dugtrio, and though it does not have much offensive presence, it can come in indefinitely on Salamence's Hidden Power Flying. Regice is a great secondary special check to Zapdos, Suicune, and Starmie, and with Calm Mind boosts, it really pressures Blissey and Snorlax to come in and take the Explosion. The chip damage that Regice can induce on Tyranitar and Metagross is also highly appreciated by the other Calm Mind users. Kingdra can use a boost to nail the much-appreciated OHKOs on Zapdos, Gengar, and Skarmory with Hydro Pump. Starmie can also take advantage of a boost, and its Speed helps to maintain the team's momentum by minimizing revenge kill opportunities after being passed a boost.</p> <p>Finally, Dugtrio is a fine partner on any sort of team, and here it can remove Metagross and Tyranitar or trade Celebi with them, revenge kill opposing Dugtrio, and use the Special Defense boosts to safely take Blissey's Ice Beams to possibly 2HKO with Earthquake.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Celebi plays a unique role in ADV OU as a special sweeper and mixed wallbreaker. Although it is not as fast as Starmie and needs at least a turn to set up, it notably differs from other sweepers in that it frequently has the bulk to trade KOs with its checks, making it great at maintaining momentum. Unlike most special sweepers, many of its checks are physically bulky, allowing Celebi also to function as a wallbreaker for physically offensive Pokemon.</p> <p>With a boost, Giga Drain 2HKOes Tyranitar, Suicune, Claydol, and possibly Milotic, and it OHKOes Starmie, Dugtrio, and Swampert. Don't underestimate Giga Drain's healing abilities—it can increase Celebi's odds of surviving being trapped by Dugtrio by bringing it back to full HP after a KO as well as healing back the damage Dugtrio did to it, keeping Celebi out of sand KO range. Giga Drain's regeneration also helps Celebi survive Hidden Power Bug from Tyranitar and helps it when facing fast foes like Starmie. Notably, with enough boosts, Giga Drain in conjunction with Psychic gives Celebi a way to muscle past Blissey lacking a status move. Again requiring a boost, Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Metagross, often 2HKOes Skarmory, helps in tussles against Celebi and Jirachi, and usually OHKOes Forretress and Magneton. Psychic is Celebi's strongest STAB move and is the primary move used to wear down Snorlax and Blissey. With a boost, it also 2HKOes airborne Pokemon—Salamence, offensive Zapdos, Moltres, and Flygon—that would check or phaze Celebi, and it OHKOes Gengar and the Fighting-types Heracross and Breloom.</p> <p>Offensive Celebi can be used either mid-game or late-game. As a mid-game wallbreaker, bring it in against Zapdos or Swampert, and use it to trade KOs with mixed Salamence, Moltres, Snorlax, Metagross, and Tyranitar. It also prevents Skarmory from setting up Spikes by forcing it to phaze Celebi. With the aforementioned Pokemon worn down or removed, Celebi can also sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Celebi fits mostly on special offense teams, especially in conjunction with Calm Mind users, but can sometimes be used with Spikes. Ironically, it can also fit on physically offensive teams due to its ability to trade KOs with physical tanks like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence, wear down Skarmory, get ahead of and take out Moltres, and pivot into Gengar's Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Dugtrio is a useful partner, and it is almost mandatory on special offense. It revenge kills opposing Dugtrio that end up trapping Celebi and can remove checks like Blissey, chipped Tyranitar and Metagross, and weakened Snorlax.</p> <p>Offensive Jirachi is an excellent partner. With almost the same coverage and natural bulk and shared Calm Mind usage, Jirachi is a Celebi lookalike. They share essentially all their checks, and a trade with one paves the way for the other to sweep. Speaking of trading checks, one common way to eliminate Dugtrio should Jirachi go down first is Porygon2, which also indefinitely checks Dragon Dance Salamence. Offensive Suicune is also an offensive pivot for Dragon Dance Salamence on Calm Mind teams. With Celebi around, Regice is a good secondary special check to Zapdos, Starmie, and Suicune that can also lure in and use Explosion on Blissey and Snorlax without worrying too much about compromising the team's special bulk. Regice also draws in and wears down Tyranitar and Metagross, which can be helpful for turning Celebi's 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p> <p>Offensive Celebi can be used on some Spikes teams too. Aggressive setters like Taunt Skarmory and Cloyster are possible partners. Gengar's spinblocking abilities are always useful with Spikes, but defensive Gengar also helps the team survive against Dragon Dance Salamence, while offensive Gengar's rainbow of coverage can provide the chip needed for Celebi to finish the opposing team off. Celebi is always a nice Aerodactyl partner, as it turns the tide on Electric- and Water-types. However, using offensive Celebi instead of defensive Celebi also makes Skarmory and Cloyster's weakness to Electric-types more pronounced, so having Aerodactyl to exert immense pressure on Zapdos is helpful.</p>"
      },
      "Leech Seed + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Leech Seed + 3 Attacks Celebi combines the coverage of offensive Calm Mind sets with the ability to force switches and heal in Leech Seed. This Celebi set takes advantage of the huge HP stat of special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax to potentially force them out to hit their teammates with strong coverage. Despite getting 3HKOed by Blissey’s Ice Beam, getting potentially even 2HKOed by Snorlax’s Shadow Ball, and despising potential paralysis or poison, hitting them with Leech Seed is often enough to force them out. Even without much defensive investment, Celebi is still bulky enough to switch into offensive Zapdos’s Thunderbolt and Swampert’s Hydro Pump, allowing it to heal off the damage with Leech Seed as it threatens them out.</p> <p>Giga Drain is highly valuable on Celebi to OHKO Swampert and Dugtrio, as well as potentially 2HKO Tyranitar and frailer Water-types such as Starmie. It also threatens Milotic and Suicune, but beware of its 8 PP. Giga Drain in conjunction with Leech Seed also helps keep Celebi healthy. Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory, Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, and opposing Celebi hard. While it only 3HKOes Skarmory, Metagross, and Jirachi, Leech Seed can potentially chip them into KO range. Psychic rounds off its coverage, pressuring Pokemon such as Gengar, Moltres, Zapdos, Flygon, Heracross, Salamence, and Charizard. Generally, offensive versions of these Pokemon are 2HKOed, while defensive versions are outsped and at least 3HKOed and none of them enjoy Leech Seed. The additional coverage is often surprising alongside Leech Seed, allowing Celebi to hit them hard with its coverage.</p> <p>Celebi has lots of possible EV spreads. As Celebi is pretty close to KO thresholds on Pokemon such as 2HKOing Tyranitar with Giga Drain, 2HKOing Skarmory with Hidden Power Fire, and 2HKOing Moltres with Psychic, it often runs maximum Special Attack EVs. To facilitate threatening Moltres, Heracross, slower Zapdos, and slower Salamence, the given EV spread outspeeds Moltres and neutral-natured Zapdos and Salamence. As Celebi is most often taking special hits such as Blissey’s Ice Beam, Swampert’s Ice Beam, and Gengar’s Ice Punch, the remaining EVs are put in Special Defense to help Celebi survive these attacks more easily. Beware that Dugtrio will almost always OHKO Celebi with Hidden Power Bug, however. The choice of a Modest or Timid nature depends on how valuable it is to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Salamence, Timid Moltres, and offensive Flygon. Modest is often preferred to pressure Skarmory more easily. There are many other choices, however. An example faster EV spread is 168 SpA / 160 SpD / 180 Spe with a Timid nature to outspeed up to Timid Moltres and avoid the 2HKO after Spikes to Modest Blissey’s Ice Beam. If Speed isn’t as important, Celebi can invest as low as 32 Speed EVs with an EV spread of 252 HP / 224 SpA / 32 Spe to outspeed positive-natured Tyranitar and be as bulky as possible. Celebi also doesn’t have to invest in Special Defense; it can invest the extra EVs in Defense, such as 140 Defense EVs to survive neutral-natured Dugtrio’s Hidden Power Bug or in HP to survive as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leech Seed + 3 Attacks Celebi is excellent alongside more offensive teammates as a token Zapdos and Water-type check. Even with Leech Seed, Celebi doesn’t have a lot of longevity and needs an aggressive pace to compensate. One of its best teammates is Skarmory, as Spikes in conjunction with Leech Seed help wear down walls such as Blissey and Snorlax, making it more likely Celebi forces them out. Another excellent teammate is mixed or Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as they both threaten common defensive cores and Water-types trying to check them give Celebi a free switch-in. In a similar vein, other common choices include Agility Metagross and offensive Swampert, as these check Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, two Pokemon that can switch-in and potentially OHKO Celebi. Agility Metagross especially appreciates Celebi wearing down Zapdos and Skarmory. Other fast, strong offensive Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, offensive Gengar, offensive Starmie, and mixed Salamence can maintain the pace needed and appreciate Celebi wearing down foes. Offensive Starmie and Gengar are particularly good partners, as they can help Celebi check offensive Suicune, which if it gets Calm Mind, powers past Celebi.</p> <p>Celebi can also fit alongside another good special check such as defensive Jirachi, offensive Snorlax, or Blissey. These Pokemon ease Celebi’s burden of switching into both Zapdos and offensive Water-types, meaning it can use Leech Seed and its coverage offensively. Two common synergetic partners with these Pokemon are Claydol and defensive Starmie, as they spin away Spikes to maintain Celebi’s longevity. As Celebi is often faster than Heracross, it can lure in and KO it before it threatens Starmie and Claydol with an OHKO with Megahorn. Especially if Celebi is paired with Jirachi, offensive RestTalk Suicune is another common teammate, as it covers Charizard and Moltres, the two special threats they do not cover. Alongside Snorlax, Celebi fits well with common mixed offensive teammates such as Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, offensive Zapdos, Charizard, and offensive Swampert.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Celebi's main purpose is to pivot into special attacks or passive Pokemon and Baton Pass Attack boosts to physically offensive teammates. Leech Seed wears down physical tanks for the Baton Pass target and helps to force switches so that Celebi can set up on something favorable. This set is most effective when Swords Dance has not been revealed, as Celebi can surprise a Roar-less Zapdos or Blissey sent in to stall out Leech Seed PP with a boost and subsequent pass to Aerodactyl or Metagross. Recover helps Celebi to function as a tank akin to utility sets.</p> <p>Attacking filler moves can also be used to hit phazers and setup sweepers that try to ruin the pass. After a boost, Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes or comes close to OHKOing Tyranitar, Shadow Ball OHKOes Taunt Gengar, and Ancient Power has good odds to 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKOes Moltres. Hidden Power Bug is an option over Hidden Power Fighting when only a single attacking filler move is used. It still hits Tyranitar pretty hard and can finish off weakened defensive Taunt Gengar that barely survived Tyranitar's Pursuit.</p> <p>This set has several EV options with their own tradeoffs. The listed spread survives Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying under sand while also outspeeding Adamant Heracross. The slower option of 252 HP / 124 Def / 96 SpD / 36 Spe can be used to still outspeed all Tyranitar. When using attacking moves, 76 Attack EVs allow Celebi to OHKO Tyranitar and Gengar after a boost; take EVs out of Special Defense if need be. Alternatively, one can also go the fast route with 252 HP / 76 Atk / 180 Spe to outspeed Moltres, neutral-natured Salamence, and neutral-natured Flygon. Taking EVs out of Attack for 252 HP / 40 Def on the prior spread can also be done to survive Jolly Salamence's Hidden Power Flying while still outspeeding and passing out of Adamant Salamence. When not using Hidden Power Fighting, which requires 30 Speed IVs, Jolly Celebi can Speed tie with Speed-invested Salamence and Flygon, though this is extremely dangerous because Choice Band variants can OHKO Celebi should they win the tie. Note, however, that being slow can be advantageous, as Celebi taking the foe's move shields the pass target from any damage or status. This is helpful when passing to Aerodactyl or Agility Metagross, for example.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Celebi requires quite a bit of support. Magneton is almost always required to stop Skarmory from switching into Celebi and walling all its physically offensive teammates. Pursuit Tyranitar is needed for Gengar if Celebi is not carrying Shadow Ball or Ancient Power; Taunt Gengar prevents Celebi from passing, and is generally a huge threat to physical sweepers due to Will-O-Wisp and Ice- and Electric-type coverage to OHKO Salamence and Gyarados. Pursuit also limits the longevity of Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl, which otherwise enter freely on Celebi. Ice Beam on Tyranitar also allows it to pivot in on Dragon Dance Salamence and land an OHKO. Milotic is great as a reliable physically defensive wall that can continuously pivot into Salamence, which, again, Celebi can barely touch.</p> <p>As far as recipients go, Agility Metagross is a nice sweeper that can either use Explosion to take out bulky Water-types or boost and sweep. Dragon Dance Gyarados is one of the few pass recipients that does not fold to bulky Water-types. Notably, with a Swords Dance and a Dragon Dance boost, Gyarados OHKOes Zapdos with Double-Edge and OHKOes Aerodactyl that has been chipped by Pursuit Tyranitar. Dragon Dance Salamence has better coverage and power at the cost of being weak to Ice Beam; one can consider running a Jolly nature on it to outrun Moltres, neutrally invested Zapdos, and neutrally invested mixed Salamence. Substitute + Liechi Berry Aerodactyl is a very fast cleaner that needn't risk taking attacks for a boost, unlike Dragon Dance Salamence, despite being a little weaker. Mixed Zapdos can make use of the Attack boost to break past Blissey, Celebi, and Tyranitar or pass it further to another target. Lum Berry can be helpful on it to avoid Blissey's status moves. Finally, Snorlax is a decent physically offensive special tank that, when passed a boost, can OHKO Metagross and Tyranitar, lest the eventual Baton Pass target take an Explosion or be set up upon.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Celebi is a late-game sweeper. Early-game, it functions like typical utility Celebi, but Calm Mind provides pressure against PP stallers like Snorlax, Blissey, Suicune, Claydol, Zapdos, and other defensive Celebi, making this set more prone to drawing in phazers like Skarmory and Roar Tyranitar or bulky offensive Pokemon like Metagross, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Moltres. Such pressure can be used to wear down or trap Celebi's checks. With only defensive Pokemon left on the field, Calm Mind + Leech Seed is adept at cleaning up the game.</p> <p>Leech Seed, apart from its variety of functions shared with its role on utility sets, also helps Celebi to plow past Blissey, Curse Snorlax, and Rest Suicune in the endgame. Psychic is the chosen STAB move over Hidden Power Grass, as this set's attack option needs to pressure threats that cannot be reliably trapped like Salamence, Zapdos, Moltres, and Flygon.</p> <p>The Defense EVs are tailored to survive Choice Band Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying in sand. The Speed EVs allow Celebi to outrun Endeavor Swampert. A modest amount of Special Attack investment allows Celebi to OHKO Dugtrio after a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Celebi to 2HKO Salamence and Moltres after a boost. That said, these EVs are not really needed with Spikes and should go into Special Defense otherwise. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to minimize the odds of Swampert's Ice Beam 2HKOing Celebi under sand. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 76 SpA / 96 SpD / 20 Spe with a Calm nature can be used for better robustness against special threats, especially when trying to set up repeatedly against bulky Water-types using Ice Beam. 40, 76, and 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outrun Adamant Heracross, Modest Moltres, and Timid Moltres, respectively, are also options.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most of the partners from utility Celebi sets apply, but with slight variations. Where it comes to trappers, Dugtrio features prominently, as Calm Mind forces out more passive Celebi pivots in favor of bulky physical Pokemon like Tyranitar and Metagross, and the lack of Hidden Power Grass means Tyranitar switches in almost freely. Given that Tyranitar poses a massive offensive threat, one must have a very good reason not to use Dugtrio with this Celebi set. Magneton is still a suitable partner, but a team dedicated to supporting Calm Mind Celebi would not need Magneton to remove Skarmory in its role as a physical wall, so a spinner like Claydol or occasionally Starmie can be more useful for Spikes control. Porygon2 is also a theoretical possibility, but if one uses it, it might be hard to fit all the support this Celebi appreciates in a team.</p> <p>Defensively, Milotic and Suicune are good partners for full coverage against Tyranitar and Salamence that switch in repeatedly, and Celebi's propensity to chip Zapdos also helps these bulky Water-types in return. Swampert is also a possible partner, but it compounds the team's weakness to Moltres and benefits a little less from Dugtrio's ability to trap. Flygon's Spikes and Electric-type immunities help the team defensively against both physical and special threats, especially given Celebi's tendency to attract Skarmory. Rest Zapdos forms a nice specially defensive core with this Celebi set, especially because Celebi without Hidden Power Grass is a little shakier at dealing with offensive Water-types like Starmie and Suicune.</p> <p>Calm Mind Jirachi, Celebi, and Dugtrio form a core where Celebi and Dugtrio lure in and remove bulky physical Pokemon, and countertrapping opposing Dugtrio from a revenge kill on Celebi can open the way for a Jirachi sweep.</p> <p>Finally, just to comment on additional subtleties of using Calm Mind as opposed to a more standard utility set: it's not as common to see Calm Mind Celebi used with Heracross or Curse Snorlax. These two pretty much have the same trappable checks as Celebi, and their physical presence does not need Celebi's Calm Mind to pressure passive Pokemon, so Baton Pass is preferable for those pairings.</p>"

Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze ability makes Ludicolo's Leech Seed backfire; it packs STAB Sludge Bomb as well. Muk has high Special Defense and, once again, has STAB Sludge Bomb.

However, if Ludicolo has Thunder Punch, Gyarados must predict well in order to come in safely.</p> <p>To a lesser extent, the following options work too: Victreebel and Salamence (watch out for Ice Beam), Weezing (doesn't like STAB Surf), Blissey and Snorlax (hate Leech Seed), as well as anything with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p>",

Toxic and Leech Seed pile on the residual damage quickly, and STAB Surf never hurts. Surf helps against most enemies, but Seismic Toss is its only hope against SubCM Raikou. Should you ever play 200, Protect will not only benefit Ludicolo by gaining Leech Seed recovery and Toxic damage, but will also save it from Slaking.</p> <p>Use a Calm nature, as well as maximum HP and loads of Special Defense EVs, in order to reduce damage taken from special attackers it doesn't resist, such as Sceptile and Raikou. The rest should go in Special Attack.</p>"},
      "Rain Dance Sweeper": {"description": "<p>This set can sometimes surprise your opponent if he or she expects the stall variant, and in particular destroys teams that rely on resistances instead of walls. Rain Dance makes Ludicolo faster than everything else, while Ice Beam lets Ludicolo take down Salamence. Leech Seed is for the obvious special wall, namely Snorlax or Blissey, while Hidden Power Grass can OHKO Swampert and beat up unsuspecting, low-health Water-types; moves from the Other Options section can be used here too. Lum Berry is a viable item if you don't want your sweeper to get paralyzed.</p> <p>104 Speed EVs enable Ludicolo to beat Jolteon and Aerodactyl after the Swift Swim boost, as well as +1 Adamant Heracross. Maximize Special Attack because the point of a sweeper is to KO as many opponents as possible before being KOed. The rest should go in HP to optimize bulk.</p>"}

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom is the most reliable sleep inducer, thanks to Spore, the only fully accurate sleep move. It exploits sleep excellently with the most powerful Focus Punch in OU, possibly 2HKOing even physical walls and resistant switch-ins like Skarmory and Zapdos. To generate Spore opportunities, it makes use of its great defensive typing to switch into Water-type attacks from Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune and Crunch from special Tyranitar. It also resists the Rock Slide + Earthquake coverage of the tier's most potent physical threat: Tyranitar. To top it off, Breloom has Mach Punch to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar, limit Dugtrio's ability to revenge kill it, and generally finish off weakened foes.</p> <p>Breloom, however, is incredibly frail, and the Pokemon that it switches into frequently carry moves like Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Focus Punch that can severely damage or OHKO it. Breloom is also rather slow; while it can outspeed most defensive Pokemon, the vast majority of offensive threats can easily revenge kill it. Breloom also has poor coverage; it relies on a weak Hidden Power or status moves to cripple Pokemon that resist Fighting. This limits its utility outside of the initial Spore + Focus Punch sequence, lets Ghost-types and Psychic-types with Recover wall it, and renders it setup fodder for Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados. Finally, Breloom is easily trapped and revenge killed by healthy Dugtrio.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Bug nails Celebi and deals good damage to the spinners Starmie and Claydol, making it especially effective on Spikes teams. Hidden Power Ghost Breloom can hit Gengar super effectively if Pursuit Tyranitar is not used as a partner, and like Hidden Power Bug sets, it can chip Psychic-types. However, Hidden Power Ghost is unreliable, as it requires prediction to hit Gengar on the switch to win the interaction.</p> <p>Stun Spore cripples common Breloom switch-ins like Zapdos, Moltres, Gengar, Salamence, and Gyarados. One of the most common ways to deal with Breloom is to sacrifice a Pokemon to Spore and then go to a Fighting-resistant or immune teammate above to absorb the Focus Punch. Stun Spore really cripples these checks because they are highly valued for their Speed. Stun Spore is also useful for denying free setup opportunities to Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Calm Mind Jirachi. However, Stun Spore is quite useless against Celebi and Starmie due to Natural Cure.</p> <p>A SubSeed Breloom set can exploit the free turn that sleep generates to set up Substitute and start stalling. Besides allowing Leech Seed stall, Substitute lets Breloom scout for switches to a designated Pokemon to absorb Spore. Should the foe be slower, Substitute allows Breloom to use Focus Punch without expending Spore or continue with Spore to fire off two Focus Punches. This really punishes teams that have only one Pokemon that can take a Focus Punch. Unfortunately, this set has a hard time getting past Celebi due to its immunity to Leech Seed.</p> <p>Swords Dance combined with Mach Punch and Sky Uppercut turns Breloom into a scary late-game sweeper when all the Fighting-resistant foes have been cleared out. This set does very well against opposing offense teams that plan on revenge killing Breloom with fast but frail cleaners like Aerodactyl and Jolteon. The cost of this set is its mid-game wallbreaking power due to the lack of Focus Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados are great checks to Breloom thanks to their typings and Intimidate. Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados can use Breloom to set up, while mixed Salamence can be particularly threatening to Breloom's teammates, especially when it gets many opportunities to enter the field. While less common, Wish + Protect Salamence and Rest Gyarados are perhaps the most robust Breloom counters. Other Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, Charizard are all frailer Fighting-resistant Pokemon but can still switch into Focus Punch once per game. Skarmory can effectively check Breloom with Drill Peck but cannot switch safely into Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Fighting, so it can switch safely into any Breloom, assuming it is not running Hidden Power Ghost or Stun Spore; however, Breloom is frequently partnered with Pursuit Tyranitar, so Gengar is not a reliable solution.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Celebi and Starmie with Recover are some of the best Breloom checks; however, they have to be careful of Hidden Power Bug Breloom and Pursuit Tyranitar. Claydol lacks a form of instant recovery, but with its good bulk and sand immunity, it can manage to switch into Breloom a couple of times.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio traps and OHKOes Breloom. However, Mach Punch followed by a Pursuit user will trap and eliminate Dugtrio in return.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk Heracross</strong>: Sleep Talk Heracross is a rare set, but it’s a good Breloom check; unlike any other check, it can absorb the Spore and threaten Breloom out with Guts-boosted attacks. It also takes little damage from Breloom's attacks, courtesy of its Fighting resistance.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Venusaur and Weezing are serviceable Breloom checks thanks to their Fighting resistances. However, they lack recovery moves and are not immune to sand, so they are bound to get worn out over the course of the game.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Jirachi</strong>: Wish + Protect physically defensive Jirachi is a good Breloom check despite not resisting Fighting because of its sheer bulk and sand immunity.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Aerodactyl, Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Suicune, and offensive Starmie cannot switch reliably into Breloom, but all are faster and can threaten an OHKO as long as they are out of range of Mach Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spore": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spore is what sets Breloom apart from the other Fighting-types in OU. Sleep is a great asset against balance and defensive teams that have a dedicated role for each Pokemon, as putting one wall out of commission provides opportunities for specific teammates to wallbreak and sweep. For example, putting a Ground-, Water-, or Steel-type to sleep can help secure a Dragon Dance Tyranitar sweep. Spore is also good against hit-and-run-based offense teams that lack setup sweepers that are strong against Breloom, as these teams struggle to come back from the functional one Pokemon deficit of sleep. Spore is also useful to shut down Spikers and spinners like Skarmory,  Claydol, or Forretress.</p> <p>Focus Punch is Breloom's strongest move and synergizes perfectly with Spore, allowing it to dish out a devastating attack while the opposing Pokemon is sleeping or switching out. It is so strong that physically bulky Pokemon like Skarmory, Metagross, and Swampert are likely to be 2HKOed, common Fighting-resistant foes like offensive Zapdos and Moltres are potentially 2HKOed in sand, and even sturdier Fighting-resistant foes like Salamence cannot switch in forever. While not as powerful, Sky Uppercut is a reliable attack that threatens Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Blissey, which sometimes stay in on Breloom after a teammate has been put to sleep; Sky Uppercut is also useful to finish off slow Pokemon that Breloom or its teammates have weakened previously, like Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross. The combined threat of Focus Punch on switching out and Sky Uppercut on staying in makes Breloom really hard to predict and appropriately check.</p> <p>Mach Punch makes Breloom the best priority user in OU. Mach Punch primarily revenge kills chipped Dragon Dance Tyranitar and low HP Aerodactyl; additionally, it puts Dugtrio that revenge kill Breloom into range of Tyranitar's Pursuit. Finally, Mach Punch gives Breloom that extra bit of damage against many faster offensive threats like Jolteon, offensive Jirachi, Salac Berry Heracross, and Salac Berry Vaporeon, helping teammates take them down, possibly with the aid of sand, even if Mach Punch itself does not KO them.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, Swampert, Cloyster, and Vaporeon; slower variants of defensive Celebi, Jirachi, and Zapdos; and neutral nature Metagross, Claydol, and Magneton. At worst, Jolly Breloom Speed ties with Metagross, Cloyster, and Magneton. Outspeeding maximum Speed Tyranitar is especially important because it commonly runs a set with Lum Berry and Fire Blast, which allows it to switch into Spore and OHKO Breloom. However, an Adamant nature gives a 50% chance to OHKO Modest Blissey with Sky Uppercut and a chance to 2HKO Skarmory with Focus Punch + Sky Uppercut.</p> <p>There are generally two ways to use Spore. If Breloom is used on a team with a variety of sweepers and wallbreakers, it is beneficial to use Spore early-game. There is a good chance that Spore disables a check to one of Breloom's teammates, letting it make progress. If Breloom's team is focused on trading KOs with the opponent, such as a Dugtrio team or one with Choice Band Metagross and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax, then it is beneficial to use Spore late-game after several trades are made. This prevents opponents from sacrificing the sleeping Pokemon and increases Breloom's impact—with few Pokemon remaining, it is likely that the opponent will lack a sufficient defensive backbone to handle Spore and Focus Punch. While Spore is almost always good to use, one must be wary of getting lured into providing setup opportunities; sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Calm Mind Jirachi can easily turn the tables if Breloom slept a different foe instead, bringing their team back from behind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The single most important piece of support that Breloom appreciates is Pursuit, since Gengar walls it and bulky Psychic-types like Celebi, Starmie, and Claydol check it effectively. Pursuit Tyranitar is an excellent partner that can potentially deal with all of these Pokemon. In addition, it traps the Flying types that threaten Breloom: Tyranitar can switch into Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying, mixed Salamence’s Fire Blast, Choice Band Aerodactyl’s Double-Edge or Hidden Power Flying, Moltres’s and Charizard’s Fire Blasts, and even Zapdos’s Thunderbolt to forcibly chip each with Pursuit. If Dugtrio revenge kills Breloom, Mach Punch, followed up by Tyranitar's Pursuit, will KO it in return. Tyranitar also sets sand, which makes Breloom's Focus Punch damage stick against the sand-weak Fighting-resistant foes like Zapdos and Salamence. Despite Pursuit Tyranitar having the most synergy with Breloom, mixed and Dragon Dance Tyranitar might be better partners on hyper offense teams, as they have more offensive potential. If this choice is made, one should mitigate the Gengar weakness with Stun Spore or Hidden Power Ghost. Less popular Pursuit users like Metagross, Houndoom, and Umbreon are also potential Breloom partners, fitting well on teams without sand or those that prefer a different Tyranitar set.</p> <p>Breloom sometimes struggles to get on the field due to its poor defenses, so it is commonly paired with pure or Substitute Baton Pass users like Zapdos, Celebi, and Vaporeon. Zapdos is the most common and consistent of the three, as it synergizes nicely with Breloom defensively and offensively: Zapdos can pass to Breloom to handle a Rock Slide from Tyranitar or to pressure Blissey and Snorlax that come in on Zapdos. Celebi can pass out of Pursuit Tyranitar into Breloom or catch Skarmory on the switch to deny Spikes with Breloom's Spore. Vaporeon is another Substitute + Baton Pass user that can create Substitutes that survive Blissey's Seismic Toss to pass to Breloom safely.</p> <p>Breloom fits well on mixed offense teams. Mixed attackers lure in and weaken Skarmory, Celebi, and Zapdos for Breloom and vice versa, while Breloom compensates for their inability to break past the bulky core of Milotic and Blissey. These mixed attackers include mixed Salamence, offensive Swampert, Charizard, and mixed Zapdos. Using Charizard and Zapdos helps offensive teams check the tier's most fearsome physical threats without wasting a teamslot on a passive wall; both defensively cover Metagross, while Breloom covers physical Tyranitar. In general, offense teams need a strategy for checking Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Mach Punch Breloom shores up that weakness without ceding momentum. Breloom is also great on offense teams that rely on trades to get into a favorable position. With partners that can take out just about any Pokemon one-on-one, like mixed or Choice Band Explosion Metagross, Self-Destruct Snorlax, and Endeavor Swampert, one can continuously trade KOs until there are few Pokemon left on either side; here, Spore, by disabling one of the key Pokemon remaining, can be devastating. Dugtrio can also perform trades via trapping and revenge killing; additionally, it can reverse trap opposing Dugtrio and enable Calm Mind sweepers, though one has to be careful about stacking weaknesses to Dragon Dance Salamence. Finally, Breloom fits very well on offense teams that feature setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar; Calm Mind Jirachi, Suicune, and Celebi; or Substitute Aerodactyl, as sleeping a wall provides extra turns for them to set up and break through.</p> <p>On stall and balance teams, Breloom is used to generate momentum and win the Spikes war, putting either the opposing Spiker or spinner to sleep. While both Skarmory and Forretress are appropriate Spikers, Forretress is the more common Breloom partner, as they both benefit from Pursuit Tyranitar. Forretress is also good at pressuring the Psychic-types that wall Breloom like Celebi, Claydol, and Starmie with Hidden Power Bug. As both Breloom and Forretress are weak to mixed attackers, they are often paired with a mixed wall like Blissey, Milotic, or specially defensive Zapdos; these are especially useful versus mixed Salamence, which is a very common Breloom answer. Aerodactyl is another good switch-in to mixed Salamence and acts very well as a late-game cleaner when used with Spikes. Additionally, Hidden Power Bug Aerodactyl can also mitigate Breloom’s weakness to Psychic-types, especially Celebi.</p>"

  "Slaking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slaking boasts excellent HP, great Speed, and an unrivaled Attack stat. This, combined with its great movepool, would make it an amazing Pokemon were it not for its Truant ability, which forces Slaking to idle every other turn. As such, Slaking is best suited as a Choice Band user and must employ a hit-and-run strategy: hit hard, and then immediately switch out to avoid the negative drawbacks of Truant. Slaking can put holes in the opponents team, but relies heavily on precise prediction. With the right support, Slaking is exceptional at dealing massive damage and picking off healthy and weakened Pokemon alike.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Beam, Slaking's most powerful attack, has a chance to OHKO Weezing and Suicune. However, it is rather situational; Return and Double-Edge are better primary STAB attacks. Fire Blast can OHKO Forretress and Scizor, as well as 2HKO Skarmory. If using Fire Blast, though, it is recommended that you first weaken Skarmory, as it can otherwise survive the first hit and use Rest while Slaking's Truant takes effect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost- and Steel-types, such as Gengar and Skarmory, can cause problems for Slaking, as they are immune and resistant, respectively, to Slaking's Normal-type STAB moves. While Gengar can fire off status moves at an idle Slaking or the switch-in, it is a check and not a hard counter, as Slaking can OHKO it with Shadow Ball. Skarmory, on the other hand, can take advantage of free turns to set up Spikes. Residual damage from Spikes and sandstorm is a big problem for Slaking, as with Spikes on the field and sandstorm in play, Slaking will lose a portion of its health every time it switches in. Proper prediction can aggravate this weakness, as Slaking will have to switch out having done little or no damage.</p> <p>Users of Protect can stop Slaking in its tracks: Blissey and Ninjask can use Protect on Slaking's attacking turn and do whatever they please when Truant kicks in. Blissey can use Wish to support its team while Slaking is idling or whittle its HP down with Seismic Toss. Ninjask can use Protect or Substitute against non-Fury Swipes variants, set up a Swords Dance boost, and use Baton Pass on the free turns. In general, Slaking cannot beat Substitute users, as they can simply attack Slaking as it breaks the Substitute and set up another on the free turn. This applies especially to faster foes, particularly Ninjask, Gengar, and Sceptile.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Return is Slaking's primary attack, and with 102 Base Power and a STAB boost, it packs a titanic punch; Pokemon such as Suicune, Snorlax, and Celebi take over 50% damage from it. In fact it comes very close to outright OHKOing Zapdos and Salamence, even factoring in the latter's Intimidate. Double-Edge is an option over Return, as it deals extra damage in exchange for recoil. While the extra power is appreciated in certain situations, such as to nab the OHKO on the aforementioned Zapdos and Salamence, the recoil can sometimes be too much of a drawback.</p> <p>Earthquake provides coverage against the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist Return, such as Tyranitar, Magneton, Jirachi, and Metagross; the former two are OHKOed, and the latter two are nearly so. Shadow Ball allows Slaking to OHKO Gengar, which is immune to Return and can otherwise be problematic; it is also a little stronger against Celebi. The last move is largely filler and isn't as important as the previous three. Focus Punch is the primary option for its ability to OHKO 252/0 Tyranitar, Snorlax, and opposing Slaking. Focus Punch can also do over 50% to Skarmory, which otherwise walls Slaking.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward: maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature give Slaking an incredible 690 Attack with a Choice Band, while maximum Speed makes Slaking surprisingly fast. Fury Swipes is worth consideration in the last slot to break the Substitutes of and potentially KO Pokemon such as Ninjask, Jolteon, and Sceptile. A Choice Band is the best–and only–item for Slaking, as it must usually switch out after firing off an extremely powerful attack to avoid being setup bait or giving the foe a free attack. Being forced to switch out mitigates the locking effect of Choice Band, so Slaking might as well make full use of the Attack boost.</p> <p>Skarmory can take any of Slaking's common attacks and set up Spikes, which severely hinders it. Magneton makes for an ideal partner, as its ability to trap and eliminate Skarmory lets it clear a path for Slaking.</p>"

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninjask is the standard lead of one of the most powerful team archetypes of all time: the Baton Pass chain. It can be extremely hard to stop there, which makes Ninjask and the team around it a huge threat worth keeping in mind. Ninjask also works well outside of Baton Pass teams; it can pass boosts to dangerous sweepers such as Metagross and Marowak, which might very well start sweeping your team on turn four if you don't watch out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Protect combo lets Ninjask stall for many more turns unless its opponent packs a multi-hit move such as Rock Blast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory completely shuts down all Ninjask. Suicune, although it takes more damage from Ninjask, can counter Baton Pass variants with Roar. Weezing resists Ninjask's STAB Bug moves and can erase its stat boosts with Haze, but Ninjask will still be able to pass Substitutes.</p> <p>Also, be on the watch for Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, and of course Fake Out. Choice Band Medicham's Fake Out will deal over 70% damage to 252/0 Ninjask. However, it can only switch in on a predicted Protect, as Ninjask will almost always have a Substitute up. Arcanine is a potent counter to Ninjask as it not only resists Ninjask's Bug-type STAB moves, but also has Intimidate to lower Ninjask's Attack, a Fire move to beat down its Substitutes, and priority Extreme Speed to take it out for good.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to stall for turns and avoid damage with Substitute while allowing Speed Boost to increase Ninjask's Speed, in order to gain boosts that can be Baton Passed. If Ninjask can keep up a Substitute, it should then use the turn to set up Swords Dance. However, Hidden Power Flying is an option as Ninjask's Substitutes won't stand up to any attacks at all, and after Ninjask has revealed Silver Wind, opponents that expect a mono-attacking Ninjask might be tempted to send in Heracross.</p> <p>In the earlier days of FRLG, a variant with Baton Pass, Protect, Substitute, and Swords Dance was common; however, the general consensus is that Ninjask should be able to do damage if it gets the chance. Do not underestimate Ninjask's own attacking and sweeping capabilities.</p> <p>A Jolly nature lets Ninjask combat opposing Ninjask. If Ninjask's HP divisible by 4, it will only need to use Substitute thrice to activate the Berry boost, but the ability to put up four Substitutes can be handy as well; however, Ninjask will have to watch out for Tyranitar.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>You would be surprised at how many people expect Ninjask to only be able to set up and Baton Pass, and not to be able to deal any actual damage; unpredictability is a definite advantage in the 386 metagame.

Hidden Power Rock is primarily to surprise Zapdos and Salamence, but also OHKOes most Fire-types.</p> <p>An Adamant nature gives this sweeper-oriented Ninjask a handy power boost; it is fast enough even without the boost from a Jolly nature. However, a Jolly nature can be useful for other Ninjask.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>With sky-high Speed and decent Attack, Ninjask can put the hurt on opponents when equipped with a Choice Band. If Ninjask is paired with Magneton, it can use Baton Pass first to check for Skarmory; much the same goes for Dugtrio to pick off the likes of Metagross. In the same vein as the Aerodactyl + Dugtrio strategy, this Ninjask is an excellent kamikaze attacker to break Substitutes from Pokemon such as Raikou and Celebi, which lets Dugtrio finish them off afterwards. Hidden Power Rock takes down Flying-types such as Aerodactyl, while Shadow Ball does the same for Gengar and Aerial Ace for Heracross. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Aerial Ace, but Ninjask will have to forgo Hidden Power Rock as well.</p> <p>Adamant is the recommended nature as Ninjask is fast enough without the Speed boost from Jolly, and it appreciates the power boost an Adamant nature provides.</p>"}

  "Hariyama": {

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current ADV OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Hariyama should be considered for a few main reasons: firstly, it covers all of Salamence's and Celebi's important special weaknesses. Secondly, it can remove Leftovers from the likes of Skarmory, Suicune, and Blissey with Knock Off, which makes them much easier to kill. Finally, its Attack stat is high enough that even without boosting, it can 2HKO Skarmory with STAB Focus Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic increases Hariyama's good stalling potential and works well in tandem with Knock Off. Bulk Up can let it tank physical hits, and can be used together with Counter. In particular, it enables Hariyama to survive Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying and OHKO in return.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Muk is the only Pokemon that can switch into Cross Chop and Knock Off without losing its item. Salamence and Gyarados are obviously good bets as they resist Cross Chop and have Intimidate to cut the damage even more. However, they might lose their item, get hit with Rock Slide, or even eat a Cross Chop critical hit; they need to watch out for Counter too. Weezing is an good bet, but it cannot beat the Sleep Talk set, Will-O-Wisp might trigger Guts, and if Hariyama Counters Sludge Bomb, Weezing is dead. Skarmory's Flying moves will hurt Hariyama, and again they might get Countered. Additionally, Skarmory is not the best bet as its lack of a Fighting resistance means it takes huge damage from Focus Punch or Cross Chop. Heracross can work, but will lose against variants with Counter unless it has Substitute, Bulk Up, or Swords Dance. Ghosts such as Gengar only really work against mono-attacking Hariyama.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Knock Off": {"description": "<p>Cross Chop will hurt a lot, especially if it gets a critical hit against Salamence or Skarmory. Knock Off, as stated above, is always a great move as it gets rid of Leftovers.</p> <p>Hariyama's HP is extremely high, so investing it its defenses is the best way to raise its bulk. An Adamant nature and some Attack investment help Cross Chop threaten enemies, while the 28 Speed EVs allow Hariyama to outrun Swampert. A Defense-boosting or Special Defense-boosting nature can be used as well to make Hariyama even bulkier.</p>"},
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Thick Fat and Guts both work on this set. Guts is the primary choice as it is activated by Sleep Talk, but as Hariyama only has one attack, it's not as important. On the other hand, Thick Fat helps Hariyama overcome its low Special Defense. Some HP or Defense EVs can be swapped for additional Attack, but even without investment, Hariyama OHKOes Tyranitar and 2HKOs Blissey, Snorlax, and Regice, and requires a ton of investment to achieve the OHKO. Furthermore, keep in mind Cross Chop's high critical hit rate, which means that even a +6 Curse Snorlax is not safe.</p> <p>This set is significantly more effective with a few layers of Spikes on the field to take advantage of Whirlwind. It also counters Baton Pass teams effectively, thanks to Cross Chop's high critical hit rate, which scares all but Ninjask, Mr. Mime, and Celebi. For instance, it dents Umbreon, Smeargle, and Vaporeon, and to an extent even Scizor. Moreover, Soundproof does not block Whirlwind, so the only way to set up is if Smeargle can use Ingrain. It is worth noting that for the matchup between Smeargle and Hariyama, the latter has Sleep Talk for Spore and Cross Chop for Ingrain. If you predict Spore, you have two chances to use Cross Chop; once on the Spore, and once on the Ingrain. If you choose Whirlwind on the first turn of Sleep Talk, you have forced the opponent to delay Ingrain, so you can continue to wear it down.</p>"

Counter is an obvious choice with Hariyama's absolutely massive HP, while Revenge is a respectable choice as well. As a sort of reverse Focus Punch, Revenge has 60 Base Power, which doubles if used on a turn when attacked by the enemy. Counter is generally preferred, as Revenge still does very little to Pokemon such as Salamence, whereas Counter will OHKO. However, Revenge's advantage is that it works on both physical and special attacks. Hidden Power Ghost and Rock Slide hit most Pokemon that resist Fighting for super effective damage.</p> <p>Once again, defensive investment is preferred to HP investment due to Hariyama's naturally high HP stat, 28 Speed EVs are used to outrun Swampert, and the rest of the EVs are put into Attack.</p>"}

    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Swampert, the obvious multi-purpose Rock counter, walls anything Aggron can throw at it, as does Claydol. Metagross is a good counter to any non-Earthquake Aggron, and even with it, would 3HKO anyway without a boost from Choice Band. Lastly, Suicune and other bulky Water-types won't be taking much damage at all from Aggron's attacks. However, note that Aggron can potentially beat Skarmory or Weezing one-on-one, thanks to Substitute blocking Weezing's Will-O-Wisp, and paralysis and a 30% flinch chance possibly doing major damage to both, though this is unlikely.</p>",

Thunder Wave cripples Water-types and random fast sweepers, and allows Aggron to fish for full paralysis by continually using Substitute. Then, use Rock Slide to probably nearly flinch them to death. Focus Punch hurts a lot from Aggron's awesome Attack. As it dents even standard walls such as Snorlax and Skarmory, the UU champions Solrock and Sandslash will naturally have a lot of trouble taking this on. 160 Speed lets Aggron outspeed Weezing. Next, maximize Attack, and put what you have left in HP.</p>"}, "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set is pretty straightforward. Aggron's key resistances to certain attacking types such as Rock and Normal lets it switch in easily with some prediction.

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Medicham is, in short, the most powerful Pokemon--aside from possibly Slaking. Especially if it runs a Choice Band, it will pummel you to hell and back. With the potential to be an absolute monster, Medicham should be feared by any self-respecting battler. However, Medicham will be mediocre if you can't predict well enough to switch him in safely or hit opponents super effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch can hit Weezing, Gyarados, and Salamence respectively. Calm Mind helps boost Medicham's low Special Attack, and Medicham can even Baton Pass that and Bulk Up boosts. Psych Up lets Medicham take a blow from Snorlax after a few Curse boosts and either attack or heal off damage with Recover. With an Adamant nature and a Choice Band boost, Double-Edge nabs the guaranteed 2HKO on Weezing, which makes Medicham truly impossible to stall out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Counters to Medicham include Salamence, Gyarados, Weezing, Slowbro, Dusclops, Celebi, Claydol, and Gengar, as well as Skarmory to an extent. A lot of these only counter the Choice Band variant with proper prediction, however, as none of them can take a super effective hit after switching in, except maybe Salamence and Slowbro. Crobat packs a 4x resistance to Fighting and can OHKO Medicham with Choice Band-boosted Aerial Ace, but is OHKOed in turn by Rock Slide and takes a load of damage from Shadow Ball, and even Focus Punch hurts thanks to Medicham's 720 Attack. All in all, resistances are the best way to deal with Medicham.</p> <p>Bear in mind that, unlike Heracross, Medicham is not OHKOed by Jolly Dugtrio if it has at least 20 HP EVs, while Adamant Dugtrio can't guarantee the OHKO on even uninvested Medicham.</p>",

If using a Jolly nature, 270 Speed should be the minimum to beat Heracross.

Dusclops and Weezing in particular like to use Will-O-Wisp, which the aforementioned Pokemon can take advantage of to sweep a team with Choice Band Facade; Medicham can help in this regard by using Brick Break for physical walls and Shadow Ball for Dusclops.</p>"

Endure is generally the superior first move as Medicham's Substitutes are very weak and won't stand up to any kind of attack; as such, it's more difficult to use Bulk Up and Substitute than simply use Bulk Up and a final Endure. Substitute works nicely with Focus Punch, however, and also serves to block status.</p>"}

Everything else fears Explosion, however. RestTalk Zapdos can stall out RestTalk Camerupt; in fact, it only fears Choice Band Rock Slide. Salamence, Gyarados, and Flygon are good checks as long as they avoid Toxic.

The massive EV investment lets it take a mere 24% - 28% from 252+ Zapdos's Hidden Power Ice or Grass, as well as 23% - 25% from Timid Raikou's Crunch, making Camerupt one of the best Calm Mind Raikou counters in the game.</p> <p>Though it is by far the best in this role, Camerupt can do more than wall Electric-types. It switches in on Weezing with relative ease, though Sludge Bomb does take its toll. Support Celebi's Psychic only does 28% - 31%, and Camerupt can retaliate with Fire Blast for 67% - 79%. While Camerupt doesn't exactly wall them, it can beat Jirachi, Jynx, and Alakazam in a pinch: Camerupt is overwhelmingly likely to survive Wish Jirachi's +1 Psychic, and will 2HKO Jirachi 80.7% of the time with Earthquake. Similarly, Jynx and Alakazam miss out on the 2HKO, and are both OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk, combined with a sandstorm immunity, give Camerupt some much-needed durability and allows it to completely wall special Gengar. Dual STAB moves are obvious, and the combination is only resisted by Flygon, Salamence, Gyarados, Moltres, and Charizard in OU. You might find that Fire Blast PP is too rapidly depleted by Zapdos, Suicune, and Dusclops, making Flamethrower a suitable replacement.</p>"

Additionally, with the looming threat of Fire Blast and Earthquake, opponents typically won't risk switching in a Steel-type. Afterwards, Toxic should be used sparingly unless their originally poisoned Pokemon can no longer switch in. Explosion gives Camerupt the ability to completely wreck another opponent.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Zangoose learns a ton of moves, there isn't really much else for it to do. Counter can be paired with Focus Punch, but Zangoose has to survive the physical hit to be able to Counter.

Gengar, Dusclops, and other Ghost-types work well if Zangoose doesn't pack Shadow Ball. Tyranitar can take even a +2 Hidden Power Ground and deal heavy damage in return, but it is OHKOed by +2 Brick Break. The sandstorm it summons can thwart Flail sets, however. Metagross can shrug off anything Zangoose throws at it--even Hidden Power Ground doesn't OHKO --while KOing back with Meteor Mash. Rhydon can do the same, except it's also weak to Brick Break. Golem too works similarly, though it's not as effective as it might not OHKO with Earthquake. Pokemon that are faster than Zangoose and have good offenses can hurt it, but they might have to eat a +2 Quick Attack first.</p>",

STAB Return is a powerful move to sweep with, while Shadow Ball hits any Ghost-types that might attempt to block Zangoose's sweep; finally, Quick Attack can be used in the last slot to put a dent on Ninjask or KO any Endure + Salac Berry users. Brick Break and Hidden Power Ground are also viable options should you fear Zangoose being walled by Rock- and Steel-types; Brick Break hits Tyranitar harder, potentially OHKOing with an Adamant nature, whereas Hidden Power Ground hits Metagross and Jirachi harder than Return does. Note that Brick Break has slightly more power on Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon.</p>"},
      "Counter": {"description": "<p>Zangoose has the raw power to sweep unboosted, but not with Skarmory in the way. To remedy this, it can run a Counter set to surprise Skarmory. Taunt prevents Skarmory from setting up Spikes or phazing with Roar, and Counter lets Zangoose use Skarmory's Drill Peck against it. This is certainly an original alternative to the Swords Dance set.</p>"},
      "Flail": {"description": "<p>Zangoose is also capable of running a Flail set. Substitute and Endure are both options to bring Zangoose down to 1 HP, which activates its pinch Berry and powers up Flail. Shadow Ball allows Zangoose to hit the Ghost-types that are immune to Flail. There are three options for the last moveslot: Fire Blast will 2HKO or 3HKO Skarmory, and takes it down far more effectively than Focus Punch will. Focus Punch has the advantage when it comes to Rock-types such as Tyranitar, however. Swords Dance can further strengthen Zangoose's Flail; a resisted 1 HP Flail is as powerful as a neutral Focus Punch.</p> <p>The EVs listed provide Zangoose with enough Speed to outrun neutral Heracross, which is particularly useful if running Fire Blast. Otherwise, just use an Adamant nature with maximum Attack and Speed.</p>"},

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol plays a fundamental role in ADV OU as one of the best spinners in the metagame. Spinning away Spikes is a great source of support for its teammates, and having a spinner that is immune to Spikes like Claydol is a godsend for many teams. Furthermore, Claydol's immunity to sand and good defensive typing raise its profile as a spinner, despite Starmie's higher Speed and ability to pressure Skarmory. Claydol also packs a Rock resistance and a Ground immunity that allow it to pivot into common attacks like Rock Slide and Earthquake from the likes of Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, and its Electric immunity is handy for pivoting into Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Claydol's lack of a recovery move means it cannot take repeated hits from attacks like Tyranitar's Hidden Power Bug, Zapdos's Hidden Power Grass, and Aerodactyl's Double-Edge. Additionally, despite Claydol's good defensive typing, it cannot threaten back a lot of the Pokemon that it's supposed to check without committing to Explosion. Furthermore, it tends to lose momentum when it goes for a Rapid Spin, as six glaring weaknesses to common attacking types like Water, Ice, Grass, and Bug mean it can be taken advantage by threats such as Heracross and offensive Water-types, and it's often forced to blow up to prevent setup from threats like Calm Mind Celebi and Calm Mind Suicune. Additionally, Claydol can't make progress by switching directly into the opposing Spiker if it's Cloyster, Hidden Power Bug Forretress, or Drill Peck Skarmory, as it will be forced out, leaving at least one layer of Spikes on the field; however, against Toxic + Protect Skarmory it can stay in safely as long as it has Refresh.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be run in order to better deal with the Dragon-types Salamence and Flygon, but it generally is not worth giving up another move for it. The same goes for Hidden Power Fire and Toxic; one could say that Claydol is a good example of four-moveslot syndrome for this very reason.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol's offensive presence outside of Explosion is so minimal that there's no shortage of defensive checks for it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types stand out as the best defensive checks, as they don't fear any of Claydol's attacks; meanwhile, they threaten it with super effective damage but need to watch out for Explosion ending the turn and putting them in KO range of a follow-up sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is the only spinblocker in OU and can threaten Claydol with status or super effective attacks, but since it doesn't want to switch into Psychic or Shadow Ball, good prediction is required for it to successfully spinblock Claydol. If Gengar happens to switch freely on a Rapid Spin, remember that Ice Punch and Giga Drain hurt Claydol considerably, on top of the threat of Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, Destiny Bond and Explosion; this means that Claydol shouldn't try to stay in and push its luck against Gengar but instead just plan to keep wearing it down as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers are also quite annoying for Claydol to face because they can inflict chip damage every time it switches out; Umbreon is the most annoying of the bunch because it doesn't fear any of Claydol's attacks. The combination of a Pursuit trapper, a Spiker, and a spinblocker is the toughest one for Claydol to beat, with a single mistake possibly deciding the outcome of the Spikes war.</p> <p><strong>Spikers</strong>: Finally, it's worth pointing out that, despite Claydol's main asset being to spin away Spikes, it cannot meaningfully hurt the Spikers themselves; Drill Peck Skarmory can take any of Claydol's attacks and force it out with repeated chip damage, while Taunt + Toxic Skarmory can keep even Refresh Claydol poisoned. Claydol also faces similar issues dealing with Cloyster.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rapid Spin separates Claydol from the other Ground-types in OU, as spinning away Spikes is Claydol's main source of support for the team. STAB Earthquake can 2HKO Tyranitar, Jirachi, and most Metagross; additionally, Claydol can threaten Gengar if it dares to spinblock with its STAB Psychic, which can also be used to chip a Heracross or a Breloom attempting to switch in.</p> <p>Explosion gives Claydol some much-needed utility as a wallbreaker and also helps it to check offensive threats by preventing them from freely setting up in its face. In fact, every Pokemon that doesn't resist Explosion has to be fearful of its threat, including setup sweepers like Suicune and Snorlax, as well as walls like Blissey, Celebi, and Milotic and offensive threats like Zapdos, Moltres, and Salamence; however, make sure to use Explosion wisely against Spikes teams, because by losing your only spinner you will leave yourself open to common Spikes attackers such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl. Refresh is an alternative when Claydol is used on stall teams that can't make good use of Explosion, allowing it to spin safely against Toxic + Protect Skarmory without fear of getting poisoned and being very useful for pivoting into status spreaders like Toxic Blissey and Zapdos, as well as Body Slam Jirachi. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Psychic, as it hits opposing Claydol for super effective damage, but it fails to beat Will-O-Wisp Gengar; note that Refresh is not a reliable solution to the burn, as Gengar can pressure Claydol with Taunt.</p> <p>Claydol isn't normally very threatening, but this set is more offensively minded than others, with enough offensive investment to hurt key threats in OU such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Gengar with its STAB attacks. 216 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Claydol to always 2HKO maximum HP Tyranitar with Earthquake and hit hard with Explosion, while 32 Special Attack EVs guarantee the 2HKO of specially defensive Gengar in sand with Psychic. If using Shadow Ball instead of Psychic, one should put the Special Attack EVs in Attack for even greater damage output. Alternatively, Claydol can run a faster spread of 28 HP / 216 Atk / 32 SpA / 232 Spe; this is more suited for offensive teams that want to outspeed and cripple offensive Swampert and maximum Speed Tyranitar. Another common spread for Claydol is 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpD with a Relaxed nature, which maximizes Claydol's resilience as a pivot into physical threats like Tyranitar and Aerodactyl; note that you should always pair this Claydol with Dugtrio, as otherwise Pursuit Tyranitar can be a problem.</p> <p>It's important to preserve Claydol's health as much as possible, taking advantage of its resistances and immunities in order to spin multiple times throughout the game. Note that because Taunt + Toxic or Drill Peck Skarmory will eventually force Claydol out, one should not attempt to switch Claydol in on Skarmory to spin a single layer of Spikes, unless Skarmory runs Toxic + Protect and Claydol runs Refresh or Skarmory is seeded or burned. In circumstances where Skarmory will eventually force out Claydol, one should instead send it in only to spin away two or three layers of Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Claydol is featured as a spinner on stall teams that are frequently running the tried-and-true SkarmBliss defensive core; Claydol's Rock resistance is very helpful because it lets the team forgo Swampert as the default bulky Water-type, freeing up the slot for Milotic or Suicune. This setup of Claydol + Water-type is very sturdy against all sorts of mixed attackers and is still solid against all Dragon Dance Tyranitar variants. Most often these teams feature Tyranitar to set sand, although this compromises Suicune's and Milotic's bulk. On these stall teams Claydol really enjoys being paired with Dugtrio, as the combined effort of the two manages to take on even Hidden Power Bug versions of Dragon Dance Tyranitar more easily; Dugtrio is also important to trap and revenge kill Heracross, as Claydol stall teams tend to be very weak to it. Wish support from Blissey, Jirachi, or Vaporeon is greatly appreciated, as it allows Claydol to absorb more damage and survive longer throughout the game. Heal Bell support is also sometimes seen, allowing Claydol to ditch Refresh.</p> <p>Claydol is also featured on teams that are trying to set up a bulky sweeper that will cleave through the opposition with the right support. The most common bulky sweepers paired with Claydol are Curse Snorlax, Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi. All these threats like having Claydol as a partner because of their shared weakness to Spikes, which will slowly compromise their bulk and consequently their ability to sweep. On teams with Curse Snorlax, Claydol is always paired with Magneton, as the removal of Skarmory is necessary for Snorlax to sweep. The removal of Skarmory as a Spiker is also nice to make sure that Claydol can spin freely without fearing that Skarmory will set up Spikes again. Magneton also helps Claydol by trapping Forretress, which otherwise can be a real nuisance, especially if it's packing Hidden Power Bug. When Claydol is paired with Dugtrio, which can trap Tyranitar and Metagross, Curse Snorlax tends to run Shadow Ball as its coverage move; alternatively, when Claydol is paired with a Pursuit trapper to trap Gengar, Snorlax can ditch Shadow Ball in favor of Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug, and Claydol can spin more freely without the threat of Gengar spinblocking it. Besides spinning, Claydol provides a much-needed Rock-type resistance, as Magneton doesn't really count for this, and a Ground immunity, as most of its partners are grounded and vulnerable to Earthquake spam.</p> <p>Claydol teams supporting Calm Mind + Rest Suicune work very similarly; Claydol still enjoys being paired with Magneton, as Skarmory's phazing can be very annoying, but it also likes being paired with Dugtrio, as it allows Suicune to stay healthy for the end-game without having to take on Tyranitar and Metagross and helps deal with Celebi and Blissey so that Suicune is no longer walled. Claydol can also support Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi; this time it doesn't get paired with Magneton, as the team has enough special offense to take it on. Dugtrio, on the other hand, is a good partner, as Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi struggles against Tyranitar and Metagross. Alternatively, Skarmory can lay Spikes to help wear down Tyranitar and Metagross over the course of the game. When Claydol is supporting Curse Snorlax or Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, it doesn't generally pair with Tyranitar, as sand cancelling Leftovers of the bulky sweepers drastically reduces their longevity; for this reason, a weather-changing move is sometimes slotted on one of the team members—Rain Dance on Magneton, for example. Finally, it's worth noting that these archetypes tend to struggle against Cloyster, since it cannot be trapped by Magneton and threatens Claydol when it tries to spin.</p> <p>As far as offensive teams go, Claydol can sometimes fit on mixed offense, where it provides Rapid Spin support for its teammates and is chosen as a spinner over Starmie because of its strong Explosion and helpful Rock resistance. This archetype is often referred to as \"Skarm beatdown\" because it is trying to lure in Skarmory, bring it down with repeated chip damage, then spin away its remaining Spikes. Given the higher pace of play, Claydol tends to run a more offensive spread with more Speed EVs over bulk, with the intention of spinning only once throughout the game. Common partners in this archetype are mixed Metagross, mixed Salamence, Focus Punch Snorlax, offensive Celebi, Zapdos, offensive Suicune, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Here Claydol serves as a good defensive pivot with its Rock, Ground, and Electric resistances, as well as a wallbreaker with its powerful Explosion; this is very important because it allows Claydol to threaten common walls like Celebi, Blissey, and Milotic, which are all very difficult to deal otherwise. Since the roles of wallbreaker, defensive pivot, and spinner are all compressed into one, Claydol benefits greatly from Pursuit support, as it allows Claydol to perform its roles better in the face of a Gengar. Pursuit Metagross is a good option that puts Gengar in range of Claydol's Psychic while still having a good offensive presence compared to Pursuit Tyranitar.</p>"

However, its weakness to Surf can prove a handicap.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water-types such as Suicune, Swampert, and Milotic counter Armaldo with ease thanks to their high Defense stats and access to STAB Surf.

Steelix too can wall Armaldo all day if it doesn't have Earthquake, but a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake can really screw it up.

Furthermore, if Dusclops runs more Special Defense investment, Armaldo can even Swords Dance on the switch, use Rock Slide as it is hit by Will-O-Wisp, and then KO Dusclops even with its reduced Attack, especially if given Spikes support. Earthquake is an alternative over Hidden Power Bug as it can hit Metagross and Tyranitar, and has good coverage alongside Armaldo's Rock STAB of choice. Rest allows Armaldo to survive for longer and function as a more reliable spinner.</p> <p>Armaldo is a very slow Pokemon, so Speed investment is largely useless. You could give it a few Speed EVs so it outruns Swampert, but this is not really necessary. On the contrary, you should give it as much Attack and HP investment as possible, and put the rest in one of its defenses. In terms of HP EVs, 188 EVs--which yield a stat of 338--should be the minimum, as that allows Armaldo to survive four Seismic Tosses after Leftovers.</p>"

Curse can add some Defense to an Absol using Baton Pass or Taunt, as long as you give the final Baton Pass recipient a White Herb to negate the Speed drop. You might want to stick with Umbreon for Curse passing, however. Psych Up enables Absol to steal boosts from Curse Snorlax and Calm Mind Suicune; it can then proceed to either Taunt them or Baton Pass to another sweeper to take them out. Thief is a cool alternative and Perish Song a novel move, but they are generally overshadowed by Absol's other options. In UU, Absol can use Endure or Substitute and sweep with a Salac Berry boost, thanks to Swords Dance and its massive Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nearly anything. Skarmory, Weezing, and Suicune might find it hard to phaze Absol out due to its access to Taunt and Thunderbolt, but it will be hard-pressed to do much to bulky offensive Pokemon. Metagross is a good example as Absol cannot hurt it outside of a Fire-type attack, while Metagross has STAB Meteor Mash to quickly defeat Absol. Similarly, Tyranitar can use Focus Punch or Rock Slide to pick off Absol. Choice Band Salamence can outspeed Absol and do a lot of damage to it with Hidden Power Flying, Earthquake, or even Brick Break. Tauros outruns Absol as well, and hits hard with its Choice Band STAB Normal-type attacks. All in all, these Pokemon will frequently prevent Absol from surviving for more than one turn.</p>",

There is no need for Taunt here, because Skarmory and Suicune will fall to a Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt. In general, however, this set is inferior to the other.

      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>The Choice Band set doesn't have the benefit of STAB, but it nonetheless packs a punch thanks to Absol's base 130 Attack. Absol doesn't really have the movepool or the Speed to use a Choice Band very effectively, but it might surprise opponents. Baton Pass is a nice move that scouts your opponent's switch. If they go to Skarmory, you can bring in your Magneton, and if they bring in a slightly dented Tyranitar or Metagross, you can switch to Dugtrio. Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Thunder are all options to hurt Skarmory if you wish, while Aerial Ace can OHKO Heracross and Breloom and hurt other Fighting-types.</p>"}

    "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>On the first set, max Special Attack and Modest, that's for sure. Then you have some options, you can give it Defense, take a Dragon Danced Salamence Hidden Power Flying (or one of a Choice Banded one that switches in to take your Surf and ruin Clamperl and the rest of your team) and Ice Beam its face back, go with Special Defense and spam \"jajaja\" when Omastar attempts to HP Electric/Grass you and it fails to OHKO, or you can give it Speed to outspeed something like the Regi Trio and Swampert. On the second, max HP and Special Defense with a Bold nature would do fine.</p> <h3>Opinion</h3> <p>Leave the clams alone, or even, feed it to your Grumpig or something, maybe it'll decide to grow another pearl and double its Special Attack, now THAT would be cool. But Clamperl is still pretty cool, if you're looking for a change on your UU team, go for it. 540 Special Attack is nothing to mess with, and UUs don't have good Defenses to begin with. Beware, though, UU metagame is all about offense, so don't get your clam get killed in the process.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey, Snorlax, Lapras and Lanturn are the obvious ones. Other than that, you need to predict and switch something that can KO it. And nearly everything can KO it, as it's really slow and has no Leftovers recovery, so what it takes, it keeps. It can't switch in anything, as well.</p>",

If you're not good at predicting, Substitute will help a little, emphasis on a little considering Clamperl's HP and lack of Leftovers recovery. Confuse Ray might help you get in a hit or two, Toxic may help because Clamperl has to switch in and out constantly, though it won't do that good against defensive waters compared to other offensive waters such as Gorebyss and Omastar, because the Hidden Powers will HURT, a CH Hidden Power Grass/Electric from this thing OHKOes Suicune for example.</p>"},

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence is one of the defining threats in ADV OU due to its fantastic offensive stats, expansive movepool, and defensive utility from Intimidate alongside a useful resistance palette. The latter two let it run a variety of sets that can dismantle multiple team types while providing important defensive utility. Mixed Salamence has a great matchup against Toxic, Spikes, and Sandstorm (TSS) cores, more specifically ones that contain Skarmory, Blissey, Swampert, and Tyranitar; its good Speed and coverage also make it generally effective against moderately fast offense teams, which usually lack good options to switch into and eliminate it. With Choice Band, the powerful and fast Salamence becomes one of the strongest wallbreakers in ADV OU—it also becomes one of the most effective ways to prevent Baton Pass Celebi from passing Calm Mind or Swords Dance. Dragon Dance Salamence excels as a sweeper against offensive teams that rely on frail physical checks. Its defensive properties are not to be overlooked; it is one of the sturdiest checks to Fighting-types such as Heracross and Breloom. Moreover, Intimidate is useful against physical Tyranitar and Salamence, especially to stop a Dragon Dance sweep. Additionally, Salamence is one of the few viable Pokemon with Wish, allowing it to heal itself and teammates effectively.</p> <p>There are no Pokemon that can comfortably deal with all Salamence sets, but each set is answerable once revealed. Mixed Salamence is walled completely by Milotic, Porygon2, and defensive Zapdos if it lacks Rock Slide and is easily revenge killed by most threats with an Ice-type move. Choice Band Salamence is frequently prediction reliant due to its individually weak attacks, can be countered by common physical walls like Skarmory, and can get Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar if it locks into Hidden Power Flying or Rock Slide. Dragon Dance Salamence has a harder time sweeping when its checks, especially bulky Water-types, Gengar, and even Blissey, are healthy. Offensively, Salamence can be threatened by a variety of prominent and fast Pokemon like Gengar, Starmie, and Aerodactyl, limiting the offensive potential of non-Dragon Dance sets. Additionally, Salamence frequently requires prediction just to get in effectively, as its 4x weakness to Ice and vulnerability to status mean that Pokemon it can check with its Speed and coverage, such as weakened Blissey, Swampert, and Tyranitar, can devastate it on the switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salamence can run a more dedicated defensive and supportive set with 252 HP and 252 Defense EVs that utilizes Wish and Protect. The remaining moves are chosen to suit the team and can range from two attacks, like Hidden Power Flying + Earthquake or Dragon Claw + Flamethrower, to a single attack and a utility move like Roar or Toxic. Flamethrower is a good attacking move to accompany Toxic, as it hits poison-immune Steel-types. This can be useful in teams with bulky setup Pokemon such as Rest Snorlax and defensive Suicune or dedicated stall teams such as those running defensive Hariyama, though the lack of power increases the team's weakness to Rest Suicune and Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence can run a mixed set utilizing Fire Blast over Hidden Power Flying, especially to exploit a Calm Mind boost passed from Celebi. Dropping Hidden Power Flying, however, makes it much harder for Salamence to get past Claydol and Flygon. In its defense, Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi tends to have a good matchup against Claydol teams. Unfortunately, the lack of STAB also makes it easier for the opponent to pivot around and weaken Salamence with their own use of Intimidate. Dragon Dance Salamence can also use Hidden Power Grass in lieu of Hidden Power Flying to break through Swampert, though not only do the same drawbacks apply, but Celebi also walls it. Refresh is a nifty matchup pick that turns bulky Water-type stops that lack Ice Beam or Roar into setup fodder, namely Milotic, some Swampert, and defensive Starmie. This comes at the expense of an attacking move, which is usually Rock Slide to preserve Salamence's ability to hit Claydol, a common Milotic partner. Salamence thus becomes walled by Zapdos and Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is an option on mixed Salamence in order to OHKO Aerodactyl and Moltres, which can be really useful if Salamence has been passed a Speed boost, but this requires giving up another attack. Sleep Talk can be used on Choice Band or mixed Salamence for a safe switch-in to Breloom and Venusaur. Toxic is also another option on the mixed set to cripple Water-types without Refresh and Porygon2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are very few Pokemon that can check all of Salamence's sets because it can hit hard both physically and specially. You will need a combination of the Pokemon below if you want to successfully check each Salamence set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune wall specific Salamence sets and threaten Salamence back with Ice-type coverage, Toxic, or phazing. Swampert is the most robust check to physical Salamence under sand, but it should be wary of mixed Salamence running Hidden Power Grass. Milotic is the best check to all variants of Salamence in a vacuum, but it can frequently be put into 2HKO range of Choice Band Salamence and possibly mixed Salamence when chipped. It is prone to critical hits in the process of healing with Recover. Milotic still requires secondary checks. Defensive Suicune without Ice Beam can phaze physical Salamence with Roar and set up on mixed Salamence. However, it is an unreliable check, as Salamence can muscle through it with critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is one of the biggest problems for physical Salamence due to it walling both Choice Band and Dragon Dance sets to cripple it with Toxic or set up Spikes. However, Skarmory should not be a team's sole Salamence check because Salamence is frequently paired with Magneton and other wallbreakers.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Aerodactyl, Gengar, Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon can switch in, possibly after a KO, to force Choice Band and mixed Salamence out with super effective coverage or status moves. Starmie and physically defensive Gengar have the added luxury of surviving any physical or special attack and threatening to OHKO with their Ice-type coverage or, in the case of defensive Starmie, disable Salamence with Thunder Wave. Aerodactyl and Zapdos can get KOed by Choice Band Salamence's Rock Slide but are safe switch-ins against mixed Salamence too. As Starmie and defensive Gengar can survive boosted Salamence's attacks, they are also single-use checks to Dragon Dance Salamence. Many common Pokemon can also tank a hit from Dragon Dance Salamence and retaliate with Explosion, including Metagross, Snorlax, Claydol, Cloyster, and Forretress. Mixed Salamence OHKOes Salamence without bulk investment under sand with Dragon Claw, and with Intimidate to soften physical blows, it can be an emergency check to physical Salamence as well.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey is a decent mixed Salamence check, as it can OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam or Counter and heal off damage from Brick Break. It can also check Dragon Dance Salamence in a pinch, but a Rock Slide flinch can put it out of commission. Blissey is vulnerable to Spikes and sand damage and cannot check Salamence well if it becomes too weakened.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is able to check mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence thanks to its Ice Beam and Recover. It even checks Choice Band Salamence pretty reliably, as only Brick Break can 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Tyranitar</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar can trap and deal a heavy blow to Choice Band Salamence if it's locked into Hidden Power Flying or Rock Slide. Sacrificing a Pokemon weak to these moves can thus form a reliable strategy for removing Salamence that does not require the risky predictions typically associated with Choice Band users.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Pokemon with Intimidate such as Gyarados and other Salamence can stop Dragon Dance Salamence from sweeping or soften its attacks mid-game, allowing Pokemon such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and bulky Water-types an easier time switching in. Mixed Salamence itself can also survive Rock Slide after Intimidate and attempt to KO opposing physical Salamence.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<p>Mixed Salamence is able to heavily damage most of the tier, including common Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, Metagross, and Skarmory, with its coverage moves. It is a wallbreaker that is particularly potent against Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm (TSS) teams and moderate-Speed offensive teams with its good Speed tier and coverage. Dragon Claw hits most of the tier neutrally and is a safe choice to use if a switch is expected. Specifically, Dragon Claw hits foe Dragon-types like Flygon and Salamence hard and chips checks such as Gengar and Zapdos on the switch. Alternatively, Rock Slide can OHKO Moltres and better handle specially defensive Zapdos. Brick Break threatens Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Grass is a key move in order to hit Swampert very hard and 3HKO Suicune, Starmie, and Milotic switch-ins in sand. Fire Blast completes the coverage by handling Steel-types such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross and other Fire-weak threats like Celebi. Additionally, Fire Blast heavily damages Heracross and Breloom, making mixed Salamence a solid check to Fighting-types.</p> <p>Sometimes, other moves can be used over Hidden Power Grass or Brick Break. The most prominent of these are Wish and Roar. Wish is used to support Pokemon that have a better matchup against the opponent's team. For example, when against strong defensive answers such as Milotic, Suicune, defensive Starmie, and Porygon2, Salamence can use the opportunity to pass Wish to a strong offensive threat like Snorlax or Heracross instead of using a weak coverage move. Roar can be used to mitigate weakness to defensive Suicune and Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi on teams that have neither strong offensive presence nor specially robust phazers, such as ones featuring Forretress.</p> <p>Getting the best utility out of mixed Salamence frequently involves aggressively exploiting Salamence's tendency to force switches; this is especially important in the absence of Spikes. For example, one can anticipate Blissey's entry with Brick Break, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can recover from Salamence's attacks. A well-timed coverage move that cripples a crucial wall like Blissey, Swampert, or Metagross can sometimes tilt the game heavily in favor of one's Zapdos or Tyranitar. Due to only having 8 PP, Fire Blast should be used conservatively against Pokemon that may have Protect or Pressure such as Skarmory, Suicune, specially defensive Zapdos, and pivot Moltres. Salamence can choose to run a Naive nature instead of Rash so that it can outspeed Moltres, Celebi, and some Gengar sets. However, Rash allows Salamence to OHKO other offensive Salamence in sand and offensive Swampert. Additional Attack investment can help Brick Break and Rock Slide hit some damage rolls, such as 2HKOing Blissey and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Salamence is a staple on momentum-based offensive teams. Metagross and mixed Salamence make for a great physically defensive backbone on offensive teams, providing short-term defensive coverage without losing momentum. Metagross can chip walls such as defensive Swampert and Skarmory so that Salamence can more easily OHKO them. Likewise, Salamence can weaken these walls to give Metagross an easier time breaking through them. Note that Metagross's set choice is highly flexible and depends on the team's needs; Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash, mixed Metagross's Psychic, and even defensive Metagross's Toxic can heavily cripple Swampert or even defeat it with some luck, and all sets can use Explosion on Water-types. In particular, Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash has a high probability of breaking through Water-types with an Attack boost or a critical hit. Mixed Metagross can potentially pack Pursuit, which takes out Gengar after some chip damage from Salamence, or at least limits its ability to check Salamence. Agility Metagross variants especially enjoy Rock Slide Salamence removing Zapdos, Gyarados, and Moltres.</p> <p>Since mixed Salamence dismantles physically defensive cores that incorporate Skarmory and Swampert, physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Aerodactyl pair well with it. Salac Berry Heracross is also a synergistic sweeper for a different reason—mixed Salamence frequently lures in and chips Flying-types and Gengar, which prevent Heracross from sweeping. Generally, Fighting-types like Heracross, Hariyama, and Breloom benefit from Salamence luring in their checks and tend to do well against teams that wall Salamence with Milotic, defensive Suicune, or defensive Starmie.</p> <p>Snorlax checks common special attackers that Salamence struggles against such as Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon. It also pressures mixed Salamence's walls—Milotic, defensive Starmie, Blissey, Porygon2—and can help put Skarmory and Metagross in KO range of Fire Blast with its coverage and Self-Destruct. Salamence can switch into Heracross and Breloom, which take advantage of Snorlax. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster can help put Pokemon such as Blissey, Tyranitar, and Swampert in KO range of Salamence's coverage moves. Spikes can also greatly reduce the need for prediction. In return, Salamence can give Spikes setters support against Fighting-types and be a strong, fast cleaner. Defensive Jirachi can provide mixed Salamence with Wish support, while Salamence pressures its checks—Swampert, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax—with its coverage moves. In some matchups, Jirachi will need to predict moves and switch-ins like Earthquake and Celebi to pass Wish to Salamence. Tyranitar's summoned sand is important for retaining chip damage on bulkier Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Blissey so that Brick Break 2HKOes them. Additionally, sand preserves damage on checks like Zapdos and Gengar.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Salamence is a potent combination of offense and defense. It excels as a wallbreaker with the movepool to OHKO or 2HKO a majority of ADV OU. At the same time, its typing and Intimidate let it switch into Celebi, defensive Suicune, Fighting-types, and Earthquakes easily. These offensive and defensive properties make Choice Band Salamence a good fit on balanced teams, especially those without sand. First, balance teams usually consist of a defensive backbone with only one or two offensive Pokemon. The passive backbone tends to sit at the mercy of Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, defensive Suicune, and Fighting-types, so the team's offensive Pokemon should be able to switch into and force them out. Second, as balanced teams have a limited number of offensive Pokemon, the primary offense is often required to hit hard across a variety of matchups. Third, the defensive backbone can absorb momentum losses of the offensive Pokemon. Choice Band Salamence can lose momentum because it lacks the flexibility of switching moves, unlike mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence, but in exchange, they are walled more easily and cannot pressure Celebi and Suicune as easily.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Salamence's strongest physical STAB move, dealing heavy damage to most targets and threatening Celebi and Fighting-types. Earthquake nails Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Magneton. Rock Slide hits Flying-types hard; it OHKOes uninvested Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Moltres, and 2HKOes defensive Zapdos, opposing Salamence, and Gyarados. Its flinch chance can be used to break down defensive answers such as Skarmory in desperate situations. Brick Break OHKOes Tyranitar and heavily damages Blissey and Snorlax; it also 2HKOes Porygon2, which can recover from Salamence's other attacks.</p> <p>There are significant compromises to be made when choosing Salamence's nature. Adamant Choice Band Salamence is able to 3HKO defensive Suicune, OHKO Zapdos, and possibly OHKO defensive Gengar in sand. A Jolly nature is best for making Salamence a fast check to dangerous offensive Pokemon. Notably, it lets Salamence prevent Baton Pass Celebi from passing stats, threaten Moltres, and Speed tie with Timid Jirachi and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Salamence excels on balance and occasionally bulky offense builds as the team's immediate offensive threat. Magneton is almost always partnered with it for removing Skarmory.</p> <p>Choice-locked Salamence loses momentum easily, so it appreciates sturdy defensive Pokemon as partners. Common physically defensive partners include Skarmory, Protect Metagross, defensive Suicune, and defensive Swampert. Skarmory is the Spiker that has the strongest synergy with Salamence, as it is also a wall that can switch into Metagross, Swampert, and perhaps Tyranitar. Spikes generally helps with wallbreaking and makes Hidden Power Flying a safe move choice that chips switch-ins. In particular, Spikes provides the chip damage needed to OHKO Metagross, Jirachi, and Blissey and 2HKO Milotic. Protect Metagross complements Salamence with its Rock resistance and can use Toxic to cripple Swampert and Suicune. Defensive Suicune switches into Metagross and Swampert well but is less robust against Tyranitar; Claydol and defensive Metagross thus help bolster the physically defensive core. Defensive Swampert switches into most physical threats, but it should ideally be paired with Skarmory for other Swampert and to allow some flexibility in pivoting around lures and Metagross's Explosion.</p> <p>Choice Band Salamence also needs sturdy specially defensive partners, the most common of which are Blissey, Celebi, and Snorlax. Blissey is the most reliable special wall; it checks Gengar, Zapdos, and Starmie, which outspeed Salamence and threaten to OHKO it. Wish support from Blissey can help negate the chip damage Salamence receives in sand. Celebi is also a decent special wall; it may struggle with Starmie and is prone to getting trapped by Dugtrio or Pursuit Tyranitar, so it is sometimes found alongside Curse Snorlax, a secondary special check. Celebi has more opportunities for synergy; its Leech Seed chips the foe and heals Salamence—important given the lack of Leftovers—and it can use Baton Pass to let Magneton to trap Skarmory more reliably. It also pressures Swampert harder. Snorlax is the shakiest of the special walls, but with Curse, it has the greatest ability to pressure Salamence's checks in Milotic and Suicune. While most Snorlax are found alongside Celebi in this context, a small fraction of bulky offense teams use Snorlax as the sole special check, perhaps in conjunction with Claydol or Suicune for additional defensive coverage against Electric- or Water-types. In return for protecting Salamence from special threats, special walls benefit from Salamence protecting them from Fighting-types.</p> <p>Choice Band Salamence has several fringe partners. It is possible to use Salamence without Magneton, provided that one has a spinner to stop Skarmory's Spikes and other Pokemon that force Skarmory in to take strong hits. Usually, this leads to a core of Choice Band Salamence; Starmie, Claydol, or Forretress; and a Fighting-type like Heracross, Hariyama, or Medicham. Occasionally, one can use Dugtrio to remove Pursuit Tyranitar, which otherwise gets the opportunity to chip Salamence heavily upon entry. Finally, there is a small fraction of bulky offense teams that use Choice Band Salamence with Gyarados as a sweeper in the Magneton offense archetype. Gyarados acts as a switch-in to Water-types and a secondary line of defense against physical threats with Intimidate, stopping Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Aerodactyl.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence is adept at sweeping offensive teams that rely on frail Pokemon such as offensive Swampert and Metagross or revenge killers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Starmie to check physical sweepers. This proficiency comes from Salamence's Speed; unlike Tyranitar, +1 Salamence outspeeds the entire metagame. Dragon Dance Salamence also offers some unique defensive properties; it is the best Heracross counter, with the ability to OHKO, boost its Speed past Salac Berry variants, and heal with Leftovers. Unfortunately, Dragon Dance Salamence suffers in terms of power, bulk, and susceptibility to Intimidate. Many common Pokemon seen as physically frail like defensive Zapdos, Gengar, and even Blissey can survive a boosted attack and stop Salamence from sweeping. Opposing Salamence can also deny a sweep with Intimidate; although Dragon Dance Tyranitar can similarly be stopped, it more heavily pressures opposing Salamence with its STAB Rock Slide.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Salamence's strongest attack. While it is comparable to Earthquake in power, it hits Celebi and Fighting-types super effectively and Claydol and Flygon neutrally. It also dissuades the opponent from weakening Salamence by switching to Intimidate Salamence or Gyarados on Earthquake. Rock Slide threatens Zapdos, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Gyarados, and other Salamence. Due to the flinch chance, it also allows Salamence to take down Skarmory despite being a 3HKO. Earthquake completes the coverage by threatening Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Metagross. Occasionally, Brick Break is used over Earthquake to help Salamence beat Blissey and Tyranitar at the expense of coverage against Metagross and Jirachi.</p> <p>Salamence can use a variety of EV spreads that differ mostly in trading off Attack for Speed and bulk. The only mandatory benchmark is 116 Speed EVs for outspeeding Aerodactyl and Jolteon after a boost. The listed EVs allow Salamence to outspeed Adamant Heracross. It is possible to increase the Speed investment to 180 EVs for Moltres or simply maximize Speed at the expense of bulk. This allows Salamence to outspeed Jolly Heracross and increases its chances of outspeeding other Dragon Dance Salamence, Gyarados, and Agility Metagross that try to get into a boosting war. It also Speed ties with neutral-natured Zapdos and mixed Salamence, which can be important because Salamence usually cannot afford to boost against them.</p> <p>Salamence can also run a specially defensive EV spread of 180 Atk / 212 SpD / 116 Spe, which takes defensive Gengar's Ice Punch and defensive Swampert's Ice Beam, turning two of the most prominent Salamence checks into non-answers or setup opportunities. Less commonly, these EVs also guarantee that Salamence survives Timid Jirachi's Ice Punch. Note that the divestment from Attack can be significant, for near-guaranteed OHKOs on uninvested Tyranitar and Zapdos after a boost become roughly two-thirds chances.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence's use and role depend on the team and matchup. One needs to discern whether its HP should be used liberally for defensive pivoting and inducing chip damage, sacrificed to wallbreak for other sweepers, or preserved for a Dragon Dance sweep in the endgame. Salamence can be used mid-game to switch into Fighting-types, defensive Suicune, Celebi, and other physical Salamence, and it can also pivot in on Earthquake to weaken Tyranitar, Swampert, Flygon, Claydol, and Snorlax with Intimidate. Most of these Pokemon are also potential setup targets; even some threatening Pokemon like Tyranitar, defensive Swampert, and Jirachi can be set up on in specific circumstances, as Intimidate softens Rock Slide's damage, and Salamence can have EVs to survive Swampert's and Jirachi's Ice-type coverage. Additionally, Salamence can set up on Choice-locked Pokemon like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl; these are revenge killers that offensive teams sometimes use to relieve their physical weaknesses, yet +1 Salamence bypasses them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence fits well on momentum-based teams that benefit from its potential to sweep over the general utility of the mixed set. Occasionally, it can also fit on Magneton-based balance teams in lieu of Choice Band Salamence, where it pivots into Fighting-types, Celebi, and defensive Suicune. Most of Salamence's partners are geared towards breaking through its most prominent walls in Skarmory and bulky Water-types, most notably Swampert. Magneton is one of Salamence's most effective partners, as it can trap and remove Skarmory. Metagross is another effective partner that can plow through those walls. Choice Band Metagross is great for removing Skarmory and bulky Water-types with Explosion. While it targets Skarmory less specifically than Magneton, Choice Band Metagross prevents Skarmory from setting Spikes, which can exacerbate typical physically offensive teams' weakness to special sweepers like Starmie and Gengar. Mixed Metagross is great for wearing Skarmory and Swampert down over the course of a game. Pursuit on mixed Metagross also chips Gengar and puts it into boosted Salamence's KO range. Defensive Metagross is a good choice in conjunction with Magneton, where Metagross has the flexibility of defensive and offensive use with Explosion or Toxic to wallbreak against bulky Water-types. This set also makes the best use of the physically defensive synergy of Salamence and Metagross.</p> <p>A variety of Tyranitar sets can also lure Water-types in to chip them. The most prominent example is Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar, which frequently leaves the opponent no choice but to expend a huge amount of HP on their bulky Water-type. Hidden Power Grass is not strictly necessary if one has other means of luring and damaging Swampert or if the rest of the team has a good matchup against Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams, which Swampert is usually found on and Dragon Dance Salamence struggles against. Mixed Tyranitar does not target Water-types as specifically and cannot get past Milotic, but it is great against TSS teams; it can chip Skarmory and other one-time checks like Blissey, defensive Zapdos, Starmie, and physically defensive Celebi. Note that Tyranitar's Sand Stream is really helpful for maintaining chip damage on most Pokemon, especially Milotic, Suicune, Gengar, Blissey, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Offensive Water-types also tend to have good matchups against TSS teams and can switch into defensive Swampert relatively easily. Offensive Swampert is a good choice for heavily damaging Skarmory as it tries to set Spikes, and opposing Swampert is frequently compelled to trade blows for the lack of a better switch-in, unwittingly facilitating the Salamence sweep. Offensive Swampert is also generally great at luring in and chipping the other aforementioned one-time checks. Offensive Suicune works in a similar vein; it heavily threatens the special walls Celebi and Jirachi, and it can use Toxic to chip Blissey and dissuade it from staying in, thereby also forcing chip damage on Swampert, Skarmory, Gengar, or Starmie. It also trades with Snorlax, which could otherwise use Self-Destruct on Salamence.</p> <p>Enabling a Dragon Dance Salamence sweep also requires chipping bulky Tyranitar and Metagross, which can survive boosted Earthquake and OHKO back. Offensive Snorlax lures in Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory and can chip them with Earthquake, Focus Punch, or Self-Destruct; Curse + Self-Destruct can even take out these checks. Snorlax also acts as a special tank. Gyarados is another great partner for Salamence. They share similar checks in Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Snorlax, Gengar, and Starmie; together, they can overload these checks. For example, a common sequence involves using Dragon Dance Gyarados to force bulky physical Tyranitar in, sacrificing Gyarados to chip Tyranitar with Earthquake, and exploiting Salamence's Intimidate to set up. Also, having two fast Dragon Dance users vastly expands one's coverage—Salamence's Rock Slide can make up for Gyarados's potential lack of coverage for Aerodactyl, while Gyarados can set up on Water-types and potentially carry Hidden Power Ghost for Gengar. Water-types are the bane of Salamence's existence, so Gyarados's ability to set up on Water-types is particularly complementary. Celebi is also able to gain momentum on Water-types. Offensive Calm Mind Celebi can lure in and trade with Tyranitar and Metagross or pass its boosts to Swampert; alternatively, Leech Seed variants can slowly provide the little chip damage needed to bring Tyranitar, Metagross, and Blissey into KO range. Salamence is also able to protect Celebi from Heracross and other physical Salamence sets to an extent. Offensive Jirachi performs a similar role of luring in and chipping Tyranitar, providing Salamence a setup opportunity upon its sacrifice; it can also wrestle with Snorlax to bring it into Salamence's KO range.</p> <p>Chipping Gengar and opposing Salamence also makes it easier for Dragon Dance Salamence to sweep. Heracross lures in and chips these targets, and on top of that, it has a good matchup against Milotic-based stall teams. Heracross is a decent switch-in to Water-types as well.</p> <p>While Dragon Dance Salamence is harder to fit on Spikes teams than mixed Salamence, Spikes helps Salamence break through all grounded checks. On offensive teams, Cloyster can provide Spikes support, and its Explosion and Surf provide the little dent needed to beat Tyranitar, Metagross, or Gengar. On balanced teams, Skarmory is the default Spiker.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross offers a unique and fantastic mixture of power and versatility to ADV. It is a staple of many iterations of offense, with access to the devastating Explosion and the ability to draw in many of its best targets. Metagross goes far beyond just blowing itself up, though; it is a truly multi-faceted creature. Whether generating early aggression with Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mashes, pivoting into resisted Rock Slides mid-game, or cleaning weakened teams with a well-timed Agility, this cosmic colossus is a force to be reckoned with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metagross can hold a Salac Berry with a Jolly nature and Endure on a set that works similarly to its Agility build. This circumvents the requirement for a turn of vulnerability when it would usually set up Agility, finding particular efficacy against Dugtrio and +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which it outspeeds after its boost. However, Salac Berry Metagross is still slower than Aerodactyl and Jolteon at +1. Psych Up is an interesting choice for combating CurseLax. However, the necessity for tankiness on this type of set leaves it too slow to theoretically copy a Dragon Dance boost from Tyranitar and then outspeed it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The most ubiquitous and important Metagross counter is Swampert. Its Steel resistance and great defensive stats allow it to soak up Meteor Mashes and return damage with Earthquake. Swampert's love affair with Protect forces Metagross users to be wary of attempting an Explosion against it—the preferred strategy is often to predict a Swampert switch and use Explosion then as opposed to doing so when actually facing it. Other Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can also absorb Meteor Mashes but are far more vulnerable to Explosion. Zapdos is a handy offensive check to Metagross, often staring it down from the lead. Zapdos must avoid Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide, though, which comes a damage roll away from OHKOing its offensive variant. Gyarados and Moltres are similar to Zapdos in this fashion; they resist Meteor Mash and are Earthquake immune but must care for Rock Slide. Skarmory can lay Spikes against Metagross well and use Protect to recover damage dealt. It too folds to Choice Band-boosted Explosion, however. Metagross can be removed by both the tier's trappers, Dugtrio and Magneton, from a certain range. When preparing to trap Metagross with either one of these, one should employ the information given by Metagross's set to estimate the amount of bulk on its spread and thus the safe range to pick it off from. Magneton can also switch into a Choice-locked Meteor Mash with its double resistance to Steel and comfortably 2HKO Metagross too.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Metagross is the single best source of immediate offense in the tier. Its STAB Meteor Mash backed by base 135 Attack and a Choice Band is freakishly powerful. Metagross is often able to muscle even past targets that resist it such as Skarmory with this move, in particular if a fortuitous Attack raise should occur. Explosion is an incredible tool for splitting defensive cores open, OHKOing everything bar Gengar. Earthquake provides fine coverage, striking opposing Metagross and Jirachi, as well as offering an acceptable neutral hit against Swampert and Suicune. Rock Slide is the foremost choice in the fourth slot, as it targets Zapdos and Moltres. Hidden Power Bug sees use as a countermeasure to defensive Celebi, punishing it for staying in and using Leech Seed on Metagross. Double-Edge is a fine option over either of these for a hard neutral hit that simultaneously covers Water-types and Zapdos.</p> <p>The EVs allow Metagross to maximize its damage output and guarantee a KO on Skarmory with Explosion. 128 HP EVs ensure that Metagross survives Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake from full health and covers MixMence's Fire Blast well too. The Speed makes Metagross just faster than minimum Speed Suicune. Metagross can use a spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe to outrun maximum Speed neutral-natured Tyranitar and Swampert. An alternate spread of 184 HP / 252 Atk / 72 Spe, which always survives an Earthquake from +1 Metagross or Salamence, is another possibility. If your team relies solely on Metagross for switching into Rock Slides, you may wish to consider a bulkier spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe to provide cushioning against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. It is worth noting that these bulk benchmarks, while well intended, lose their efficacy if Metagross switches into just a resisted Body Slam or Rock Slide or even a layer of Spikes. Lacking Leftovers severely damages Choice Band Metagross's longevity, so a proactive approach with your Explosion early on is often advisable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is particularly potent when leading on an offensively inclined team. A blind turn 1 Explosion against a favorable lead matchup such as Tyranitar can be game breaking in its ability to blow a major roadblock away when it catches a Skarmory or Swampert on the switch. Dragon Dance users such as Tyranitar and Salamence appreciate Metagross's ability to tear down walls, creating a juncture for them to sweep in the later phases of the game. Snorlax pairs well with this set, being able to tank early hits from Zapdos and Suicune and keep up offensive momentum. When played aggressively, this Metagross is likely to take substantial damage or be KOed early, so a secondary Rock-type answer such as Swampert is appreciated for safety against the physical armada. Swampert's pivoting ability is also excellent for getting Metagross into play repeatedly. Zapdos, another purveyor of offense, has good type synergy with Metagross and can switch into Skarmory and Water-types well. Zapdos is also able to shut down opposing Zapdos with Thunder Wave in lead mirrors, reducing its capability to threaten Metagross.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Unlike other Metagross sets that see the majority of their action early, this configuration is designed for late-game and sweeping. Its immunity to sand and Toxic negates the strategies that damage the efficacy of other Speed boosters like Dragon Dance Salamence and also avoid forcing it to hold Leftovers. Once its counters are weakened or removed, Metagross can use Agility to take its Speed to 396, beating out every unboosted Pokemon. From there, its usual Meteor Mash and Earthquake wipe through a carefully weakened enemy team. Explosion is the favored choice in the final slot on this set, as the opportunity will not always present itself for Metagross to sweep. Your judgement of the game situation should indicate whether Metagross must be relegated to a luring and wall removal role. For example, if you have been unable to weaken your opponent's conservatively played Swampert, it is unwise to keep Metagross alive and withheld in an effort to facilitate its sweep—instead, look to use Explosion. For more one-dimensional teams that rely less on gameplan flexibility, Rock Slide is available over Explosion to cover Zapdos and Moltres.</p> <p>Lum Berry opens up many otherwise unavailable setup opportunities, shielding Metagross for a turn against Gengar's Will-O-Wisp and Blissey's Thunder Wave. Opting for Leftovers improves Metagross's longevity and ability to switch into attacks once or twice earlier on. Liechi Berry is a more niche item option; combined with Substitute to reach activation range, it allows Metagross to boost its Attack without hoping for Meteor Mash's chance to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Agility Metagross is the set that most appreciates Clear Body, negating the issues with Intimidate pivoting often faced by other boosters. This ability to avoid Attack drops contributes to its value as the perfect receiver for Baton Pass Celebi's Swords Dance boosts. Performing this combination successfully is extremely threatening. Magneton is a requirement on most Agility Metagross teams, as Skarmory's ability to safely wall Metagross and Whirlwind it away hinders its potency. Metagross also benefits from the support of mixed attackers such as Tyranitar and Salamence due to their ability to lure in Swampert and cripple it with Hidden Power Grass.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>An often overlooked strength of Metagross is its base 130 Defense, which is supported by a valuable defensive typing that grants it sand and Toxic immunity along with a fine selection of resistances. This set offers a different dimension to Metagross, bolstering its role as a mid-game pivot and check to physical attackers while still enabling it to output respectable damage with Meteor Mash and Earthquake. Protect facilitates this strategy as a superb and multifaceted move that provides free recovery through the game and scouts Choice Band users such as Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. The aggressive Explosion remains a fixture on this balanced set, as Metagross retains its role of removing bulky Water-types to support its offensive teammates. Explosion also sees use to remove a boosted CurseLax in a pinch. Toxic is a possible option over Explosion, but heavy use of Refresh on Water-types such as Milotic and Swampert invalidates its greatest niche. It is still valued against Zapdos, Moltres, and the lesser seen non-Rest Suicune, though. Hidden Power Grass is usable, most likely over Protect; however, it requires some investment to 2HKO Swampert, its main target.</p> <p>This Metagross set suffers from letting Moltres enter freely, a particularly dangerous prospect because the Magneton balance teams it often features on hate Moltres's Will-O-Wisps and Fire Blasts. Replacing Protect with Rock Slide turns this weakness on its head, catching the Moltres switching in with a crushing OHKO. Rock Slide also deals respectable damage to Zapdos, comfortably 2HKOing it.</p> <p>The EV spread is heavily favored to survive two Earthquakes from Jolly Tyranitar and is guaranteed to do so if you risk Protect on a possible Dragon Dance. Its Dugtrio survival chances are also aided, being able to do so even after stepping on three Spikes and using Protect right after. Metagross still requires attacking investment to threaten Snorlax and pressure its switch-ins. On teams with unreliable physical walling, in particular those lacking a traditional bulky Water-type, Metagross can invest more in Defense and use an Impish nature for greater safety against the likes of Dragon Dance Salamence and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tank Metagross appreciates Magneton, as it cannot punish Skarmory by itself. This set is best suited to a Magneton-aided balance or offense team, in which its typical partners in Salamence and Gyarados are found. Metagross combines with either of these two Intimidate users to generate a formidable balance core with excellent type synergy. Metagross appreciates their Ground immunities and Fire resistances and reciprocates the favor with Rock and Ice resistances. Celebi combines with Metagross excellently, being able to freely switch into Water-types all game and potentially even support it with Heal Bell to remove paralysis from Snorlax, Jirachi, and Blissey and burns from Gengar.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Metagross is a balanced set, a jack-of-all-trades designed to fill a void left on many specially inclined or mixed offense teams. STAB Psychic from a well-invested Special Attack stat dominates Gengar, and Metagross does not fear its usual Will-O-Wisp. The move also makes for a respectable neutral hit on Swampert and offensive Zapdos. Hidden Power Fire weakens Skarmory, which will often willingly tank multiple hits from Metagross in exchange for the opportunity to lay Spikes. It offers an improvement over Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash, which is otherwise Metagross's best means of damaging Skarmory while staying alive, due to Metagross's ability to switch moves and gain Leftovers recovery. It also eliminates the possibility of a pivot from Skarmory to Magneton from the opponent, which would usually comfortably trap and pick off a Metagross locked into Meteor Mash. Hidden Power Fire also dominates Forretress, which often sees Metagross as an opening to set up Spikes. The combination of Thunder Punch and Hidden Power Grass can replace Psychic and Hidden Power Fire on teams that profit from weakening Swampert. Thunder Punch retains the ability to strike Skarmory that the loss of Hidden Power Fire would otherwise sacrifice. This configuration of mixed Metagross also often uses Earthquake in lieu of Meteor Mash, OHKOing Magneton and hitting Jirachi and opposing Metagross harder. However, losing Meteor Mash makes Snorlax and Blissey more difficult to deal with, often pressuring you to use Explosion earlier than what is ideal. Mixed Metagross without Meteor Mash also has to use Explosion to OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p>This set is typically selected on teams that would like to have Jirachi in a vacuum but fear Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax too much to justify its use. Unlike Jirachi, Metagross has Steel STAB and Explosion available to it. Meteor Mash disallows Tyranitar's Dragon Dance setup and is also mixed Metagross's only way to OHKO Dugtrio while staying alive itself. The threat of Explosion forces Blissey and Snorlax to switch out. Explosion can be replaced with Pursuit on teams where Gengar removal is crucial, but this choice is often inadvisable, as multiple successful Pursuits are required to KO Gengar, which can wear Metagross down through the game's course with Fire Punch, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes damage.</p> <p>Maximized Special Attack is required for the greatest possible damage output against Gengar and Skarmory, a necessity in the era of specially defensive Gengar. 252 HP EVs help Metagross switch into Gengar's Thunderbolts and Aerodactyl's Rock Slides alike. However, on teams without Tyranitar that particularly fear CurseLax, greater Attack investment in place of this HP is appreciated for a more powerful Explosion against this boosted target.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The loss of Earthquake compromises Metagross's ability to check Jirachi and duel other Metagross. Dugtrio is a fantastic partner to Metagross, as it can mitigate this loss by trapping these Pokemon. Dugtrio also fits well supporting the special offenses that often elect to use this Metagross, picking off weakened Blissey and Snorlax to open up Suicune or Celebi. Celebi is also able to Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts to Metagross, which is an often effective mid-game receiver due to its physical threat to typical special walls.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi is an extremely versatile Pokemon thanks to its great stats, movepool, and typing. As a Calm Mind sweeper, it distinguishes itself from Suicune and Celebi by virtue of its part-Steel typing, which grants it immunity to passive damage from sand and Toxic and enables it to take advantage of Choice Band users such as Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar locked into their STAB attack more easily. Furthermore, Jirachi's colorful array of coverage moves makes it difficult to handle defensively, and its access to Wish can invalidate special sponges such as Blissey as answers while enhancing Jirachi's defensive capabilities. Jirachi also has some niche options at its disposal and can run physical sets to lure out and eliminate Pokemon that typically scare it out such as Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>On the other hand, Jirachi is held back by a very exploitable weakness to Earthquake, which makes it prone to being trapped and taken down by Dugtrio and allows metagame staples such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, Salamence, and Snorlax to potentially scare it off. While Jirachi has the needed coverage and support options to threaten all of these, it cannot fit each into a single set and thus will remain kept in check by some popular Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi can also choose to go fully physical with a Choice Band and make use of its signature move in Doom Desire backed up by Hidden Power Fighting, Body Slam, and Shadow Ball. Doom Desire can hits targets with low physical bulk such as Blissey extremely hard regardless of its typing, whereas the remaining offensive options can take Pokemon like Celebi, Claydol, and Tyranitar by surprise. Nonetheless, the lack of Leftovers not only is detrimental to Jirachi's longevity but also can give a hint to the opponent, and in terms of raw power, Jirachi cannot compete with behemoths like Metagross.</p> <p>Lum Berry allows Jirachi to set up in front of Pokemon such as Zapdos, Magneton, Snorlax, Blissey, and Porygon2 without the fear of being paralyzed. It also prevents Breloom, Gengar, and, to a lesser extent, Milotic from putting it to sleep. Salac Berry is an option, as Jirachi can't be worn down by sand and is difficult to OHKO due to its great natural bulk, thus allowing it to survive most hits and gain a boost in Speed to hopefully sweep teams made of faster Pokemon, but the recovery provided by Leftovers is hard to give up, and such a strategy heavily relies on specific situations. Reflect can turn the tables in Jirachi's favor against strong Earthquake users, most notably Dugtrio, which might be forced out, but it can be played around and it's difficult to give up a precious moveslot. Hidden Power Water hits Tyranitar and Claydol super effectively while keeping a neutral hit against Steel-types. It also has the benefit of denting the uncommon Houndoom, which is a very threatening foe for most Jirachi variants. In a similar manner, Jirachi can use the weaker Water Pulse, which has the same coverage while also providing a decent chance to confuse the target thanks to Serene Grace. It can be used alongside Rain Dance and Thunder to maximize its effectiveness at dealing damage and pairs well with paralysis. Removing opposing sand with Rain Dance can also be very beneficial for teams with Pokemon like Suicune and Curse Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Perhaps the biggest pain for Jirachi to face, Dugtrio limits what Jirachi can accomplish throughout a match thanks to Arena Trap, its superior Speed, and its super effective Earthquake, which inflicts a huge amount of damage to Jirachi or outright OHKOes it. Nonetheless, Dugtrio can be defeated by bulky variants of Jirachi, which can potentially pull off a victory with two Body Slams aided by a paralysis or a Calm Mind-boosted hit backed up by Wish or a Substitute cover.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert is bulky enough to withstand several boosted Psychics and answer with a powerful Earthquake, but Hidden Power Grass invalidates it as a check. Refresh variants can also take on defensive Jirachi and can come up victorious even without Earthquake by PP stalling Jirachi. Claydol possesses even greater special bulk as well as a resistance to Psychic, allowing to take on most Jirachi's assaults easily. However, without EVs in Attack, it fails to 2HKO standard offensive Jirachi and to 3HKO the Wish + Calm Mind variant most of the time, which can break through it with Hidden Power Grass or Ice Punch. If Claydol lacks Refresh, it is also likely to lose to Toxic variants of defensive Jirachi. Flygon wants to avoid Ice Punch and possibly Psychic as well, but it can potentially outspeed and badly damage or OHKO Jirachi with Earthquake. While rare, Steelix is the bane of non-Fire Punch Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Thunder Wave Blissey handles offensive Calm Mind Jirachi fairly well but loses to the Wish + Calm Mind variant and has trouble against defensive and Substitute + Calm Mind variants. Perish Song Celebi shuts down any attempt to sweep from Jirachi and cripples it with Leech Seed, but without Perish Song, Jirachi can accumulate Calm Mind boosts and eventually break through Celebi's recovery. Substitute Jirachi in particular is a very tough foe for most variants of Celebi. As long as it packs Earthquake, Snorlax has the upper hand against most variants of Jirachi, but if sand is active, staying healthy becomes harder for Snorlax. Suicune can try to have a Calm Mind war with Jirachi and is likely to win if it has Roar to nullify Jirachi's boosts, but it may not have the luxury to do so if Jirachi packs an Electric-type move. Other phazers such as Tyranitar and Zapdos have the bulk to prevent Jirachi from sweeping at least once, but they usually will end up overpowered if they try to do so in the long run. Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar also have to watch out for Dynamic Punch from the mixed variant.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Earthquake</strong>: Tyranitar and Metagross, by virtue of their bulk and typing, naturally check most Jirachi variants and can scare them off with a powerful Earthquake. However, boosted Hidden Power Grass and Fire Punch inflict a noticeable amount of damage to both of these threats, and Tyranitar also needs to worry about Dynamic Punch. Aerodactyl outspeeds and can remove weakened Jirachi, but failing to eliminating it with Earthquake can lead to Aerodactyl's downfall if Jirachi manages to get a hit off, especially if it has Thunder or Thunderbolt. The same applies to Salamence, which is even more powerful but has to Speed tie with Jirachi most of the time and is taken out by Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Houndoom, while uncommon, can wall some Jirachi variants by virtue of its ability and typing and scare it off with a powerful Fire Blast. Moltres holds the merit of potentially OHKOing offensive Jirachi after a Calm Mind with Overheat and can outspeed Modest variants. Charizard can Speed tie with Jirachi and threatens it in a similar way. However, all of these are in trouble if Jirachi has several Calm Mind boosts under its belt, especially if it has either Thunder or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While trying to set up or recover, Jirachi might expose itself to Thunder Wave from Blissey, Zapdos, Magneton, and Porygon2; Body Slam from Snorlax; and Will-O-Wisp from Gengar. These effects hamper Jirachi's effectiveness significantly, as paralysis makes it slower than Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, and Heracross, which can pick off Jirachi more easily, whereas burn outdamages Leftovers recovery and reduces Jirachi's longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Superachi (Offensive Calm Mind)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi is one of the main Calm Mind sweepers in the metagame and can become an offensive powerhouse with this set. Calm Mind provides the needed boost in Special Attack to attempt a sweep, and the added increase in Special Defense enables Jirachi to potentially set up multiple times against the likes of Zapdos and Gengar. STAB Psychic OHKOes most Gengar variants, dents Heracross, and hits most neutral targets reasonably hard. Fire Punch OHKOes most Magneton variants after a Calm Mind and threatens Pokemon such as Metagross, Celebi, Skarmory, Forretress, and opposing Jirachi, which are all potentially troublesome. Boosted Hidden Power Grass takes out Swampert and hits Tyranitar, Starmie, and Ground-types such as Claydol hard. Ice Punch and Thunderbolt can be run over the two aforementioned coverage moves, since they complement each other very well and can drastically change some matchups in Jirachi's favor; Ice Punch OHKOes Salamence and most Flygon while keeping the ability to hit Celebi and Claydol super effectively, while Thunderbolt threatens Gyarados and Moltres with a potential OHKO after a Calm Mind, hits Skarmory harder than Fire Punch, and enhances Jirachi's chances of winning a Calm Mind war against Suicune. If having more than two of these coverage moves is desired, it is possible to drop Psychic, but keep in mind that this Jirachi variant typically wants to deal the greatest amount of damage it can as soon as possible.</p> <p>Jirachi sits at crowded Speed tier and wants maximum Speed to outrun the likes of Salamence, Zapdos, Flygon, Celebi, and Moltres if possible. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. Nonetheless, a Modest nature is an option, as it meets some notable benchmarks after a Calm Mind like a guaranteed 2HKO on Celebi with Fire Punch or Ice Punch, an OHKO on Moltres with Thunderbolt, a 2HKO on maximum HP Tyranitar and Claydol with Hidden Power Grass, and, most importantly, an OHKO with Ice Punch on most Dugtrio without any boost. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 40 Def / 152 SpA / 68 Spe with a Modest nature can be considered to ensure that Jirachi can stomach an Earthquake from Choice Band Dugtrio and +1 Tyranitar at full health while outspeeding maximum Speed Tyranitar, most Celebi, and some Suicune. 32 EVs in Speed is all you need to get the edge over maximum Speed Tyranitar, though, so you can drop some and invest more into Special Attack instead. Leftovers improves Jirachi's longevity and ability to enter the field throughout the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Jirachi has trouble getting past Thunder Wave Blissey. Thus, Dugtrio is a good partner to trap and eliminate it as well as other problematic Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Magneton; this is especially beneficial for Ice Punch + Thunderbolt variants, which tend to struggle against the aforementioned Pokemon. Conversely, Jirachi is prone to being removed if it gets trapped by Choice Band Dugtrio. Therefore, packing several targets of Dugtrio's coverage moves like Heracross and Celebi is a viable strategy when backed up by a Dugtrio of your own, as the opposing Dugtrio can be safely removed when locked into its weaker attacking moves, thus opening the field for Jirachi and its teammates. Similarly, while Porygon2 doesn't threaten Blissey, Tyranitar, and Metagross, it can trap and remove an opposing Dugtrio locked into any of its moves, which can be very useful if Jirachi's teammates are vulnerable to Earthquake as well. Having one or several Pokemon that can punish a Dugtrio locked into Earthquake such as Salamence, Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Gengar can prove to be beneficial. Pairing Jirachi with Explosion Gengar, Regice, or Weezing to lure Blissey in and damage it heavily is also a good idea, especially when backed up by Dugtrio to ensure Blissey's downfall. Heracross and Metagross also make good partners, as they can pivot in on and heavily pressure the likes of Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, which tend to be awkward for Jirachi to fight. Snorlax can also switch nicely into most Blissey and damage the likes of Tyranitar and Metagross with Self-Destruct, Earthquake, or Focus Punch. Another way to wear down the aforementioned foes is to set up Spikes with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Skarmory, one layer of which guarantees the 2HKO on Tyranitar with +1 Hidden Power Grass. Pokemon such as Roar or Baton Pass Zapdos, Jolteon, and Moltres can take advantage of Spikes to weaken Blissey and therefore make Jirachi more dangerous. Jirachi is also a good candidate for teams focused on Calm Mind alongside sweepers such as Celebi, Suicune, and, to a lesser extent, Raikou, as together they can play around and eventually overpower their shared foes.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi is the only Steel-type in the game with a reliable recovery move in the form of Wish. This trait coupled with its solid bulk allows Jirachi to serve as a durable answer to specially offensive Pokemon such as Zapdos, non-Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Starmie, and Jolteon while also being able to pivot in on Choice Band users such as Salamence, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Aerodactyl, something that Blissey, the main special wall of the metagame, cannot do. Wish also enables Jirachi to heal its teammates, making it a strong team player. Protect makes Wish safer to use, scouts which move Choice Band users lock themselves into, and allows Jirachi to gain extra health from Leftovers, as the recovery cannot be negated by sand. Fire Punch hurts opposing Steel-types to make sure that Jirachi cannot be easily trapped and worn down by Magneton and doesn't let Skarmory and Forretress set Spikes up too freely. Thanks to Serene Grace and Jirachi's longevity, it can also fish for burns by spamming Fire Punch, which can be very rewarding if it manages to catch the likes of Tyranitar and Swampert looking for free opportunities to get onto the field. Jirachi can make full use of its ability with Body Slam's increased paralysis chance. An important application of this move is against Dugtrio, as Jirachi is likely to survive an Earthquake from full health and can win one-on-one by paralyzing Dugtrio with Body Slam and getting rid of it with another afterwards. Toxic is an alternative that allows Jirachi to cripple Pokemon such as non-Refresh Swampert and can be spread fairly easily due to Jirachi's ability to scare off most Poison-immune Pokemon with Fire Punch. Toxic is especially awkward for Pokemon such as Tyranitar, which doesn't mind being paralyzed nearly as much depending on its set, but should be kept in mind that dropping Body Slam makes Jirachi much weaker to Dugtrio.</p> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice for any defensively oriented Pokemon. The given EV spread allows Jirachi to take an Earthquake from +1 Adamant Salamence while being able to tank most special hits with ease. Another option is 128 EVs in Defense, which guarantees that Jirachi can take an Earthquake from Choice Band Adamant Dugtrio. Should Jirachi be running Toxic instead of Body Slam, the nature of choice should be Calm instead of Sassy, and it is an option to invest up to 32 EVs in Speed in order to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar and Swampert. Alternatively, with more EVs in Defense and a Bold nature, Jirachi can sit in front of defensive Swampert and slowly wear it down with Toxic, at the cost of giving up Jirachi's ability to wall most specially offensive threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Jirachi fits well into a variety of bulky teams where it can support its teammates with Wish. Pokemon that appreciate this kind of help include all-out offensive or Choice Band variants of Tyranitar and Salamence as well as defensive teammates like Suicune, Swampert, Forretress, and Claydol. Suicune and Swampert in particular greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to switch into Choice Band users like Aerodactyl and Salamence locked into Hidden Power Flying or Double-Edge, as it can ease the offensive pressure they have to handle. This help is enhanced by Wish, which can enable them to take care of most variants of Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, and Flygon that tend to threaten Jirachi. Skarmory is also a good teammate, as it can obtain free layers of Spikes by switching onto Earthquakes aimed at Jirachi while enjoying Wish to back it up. Unlike Blissey, defensive Jirachi doesn't mind Focus Punch or Explosion from Gengar, but it lacks Natural Cure and thus wants to avoid Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave from the various threats it is supposed to handle. Therefore, specific answers such as Flygon, which generally has the upper hand against Thunder Wave Zapdos and can switch into Earthquake aimed at Jirachi, and Pursuit Tyranitar, which can usually afford to take Will-O-Wisp from Gengar and proceed to pressure it on top of providing additional passive damage for Jirachi to take advantage of through sand, are two teammates of choice. Jirachi is a frequent member on teams that use many hovering Pokemon to avoid Spikes damage due to simultaneously having a Rock-type resistance, the bulk for tanking Electric-type attacks, and Wish support. Zapdos frequently features on these teams due to forming a specially defensive synergistic core with Jirachi by dealing with almost all Electric- and Water-types and pivoting into Metagross.</p> <p>Jirachi is also setup fodder for Curse Snorlax and bulky variants of Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune. As a result, it is a good idea to pack a phazer like Zapdos, Tyranitar, Perish Song Celebi, or, once again, Skarmory. Jirachi is also unable to break through Refresh users such as Swampert and Milotic, so packing something that can take advantage of these such as Celebi, Cloyster, or, to a lesser extent, Skarmory is a good idea. More offensive Pokemon that enjoy Jirachi's ability to spread paralysis such as Heracross, Machamp, Marowak, and Rhydon can also be considered.</p>"

      "Wish + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With this set, Jirachi can turn into a bulky sweeper that can easily use Blissey as setup fodder and become very difficult to safely remove from the game. It makes for a great stallbreaker that is very difficult for defensive cores featuring the likes of Skarmory, Blissey, Milotic, and Claydol to handle. Wish may seem like a risky choice when not backed up by Protect, but it is reliable enough to take advantage of a lot of passive Pokemon in the metagame. Furthermore, the boost in Special Defense offered by Calm Mind increases the number of Pokemon on which Jirachi can set up. For instance, Timid Zapdos is unable to 4HKO this Jirachi variant after a Calm Mind, giving it plenty of opportunities to heal itself with Wish if Zapdos doesn't have Roar. Another noteworthy application of Wish is against Dugtrio, as Jirachi can use Wish when Dugtrio switches in, stomach the first Earthquake, survive a second once it has been healed by Wish, and proceed to get rid of Dugtrio within the two turns. With only two moveslots for offensive options, this Jirachi variant may prefer Ice Punch and either Thunder or Thunderbolt to retain near-perfect coverage with two attacking moves. Due to its increased longevity with this set, Jirachi may value the universal coverage and the possibility to fish for freeze and paralysis thanks to Serene Grace over the immediate firepower, as it will likely get more Calm Mind boosts under its belt and can afford to miss Thunder at some point. Calm Mind-boosted Ice Punch also has the benefit of immediately threatening fast Earthquake users such as Dugtrio, Salamence, and Flygon that cannot OHKO Jirachi before getting OHKOed in return, while Thunder has a relatively high chance to inflict paralysis and gives Jirachi the upper hand against phazers such as Skarmory and Suicune. Nonetheless, Psychic remains an option, as it can discourage Heracross and Gengar, and the damage difference can be significant when dealing with Snorlax. Thunderbolt is a safer alternative to Thunder, while Fire Punch threatens Steel-types and Celebi and can be spammed to inflict burns, which can be really awkward for a Tyranitar attempting to take advantage of a Jirachi that can't hit it at least neutrally. Hidden Power Grass remains an option if getting rid of Swampert and damaging Tyranitar is a priority, at the cost of leaving Jirachi with otherwise severely lacking coverage.</p> <p>Leftovers is crucial to this set's success, as its recovery isn't negated by sand. The given spread gives Jirachi as much physical bulk as possible and enables it to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, which, in tandem with Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, makes it very sturdy overall. Most notably, the physical bulk lets Jirachi endure powerful Earthquakes, the most common way to take it out. For instance, Adamant Salamence, Metagross, and Tyranitar all fail to 2HKO Jirachi with Earthquake. However, giving it more Special Defense can be useful to set up on Pokemon such as Zapdos, Gengar, and Suicune more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi performs well alongside Suicune, which can handle the various Earthquake users such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Flygon most of time. Suicune also appreciates Wish support to help it deal with the aforementioned threats and Jirachi's ability to switch in on their STAB attacks if they're packing a Choice Band. Consequently, Pokemon that can take advantage of Earthquake aimed at Jirachi such as Gengar, Zapdos, Salamence, and Flygon are good partners. Choice Band Salamence in particular is a noteworthy Wish recipient. Other Pokemon that allow Jirachi to sweep more easily and benefit from Wish include Spikers such as Skarmory, spinners like Claydol, and Tyranitar, which provides help against Snorlax and Suicune in the case of a Calm Mind war by virtue of sand and potentially Roar. As this Jirachi set lacks coverage moves, Dugtrio is a good partner to remove Tyranitar, Metagross, and opposing Jirachi. It also helps against Celebi and Magneton, the latter of which could try to cripple Jirachi with Thunder Wave. Finally, Jirachi may expose itself to Thunder Wave from the likes of Blissey and Zapdos and Will-O-Wisp from Gengar while trying to set up. Therefore, Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Blissey can be considered to alleviate this issue.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With its immunity to sand and base 100 HP stat, Jirachi makes good use of Substitute. This move allows it to set up on the likes of Blissey, which notably cannot break its Substitute with Seismic Toss, Milotic, some variants of Snorlax and Zapdos, and Porygon2 without having to worry about a potential paralysis. It also shuts down Celebi's attempts to cripple it with Leech Seed, and if Jirachi manages to keep the Substitute, it can defeat its usual revenge killers, most notably Dugtrio. After two Calm Mind boosts, the Substitute is able to tank a Thunderbolt from Zapdos and a Fire Punch from Gengar. Psychic is recommended on this set, as the raw power and potential drop in Special Defense made more likely by Serene Grace really improve the matchup against Blissey and Snorlax, and directly threatening Pokemon like Gengar and Heracross can also make a significant difference. Fire Punch is usually the preferred coverage move in the last slot, as it hits important targets such as Skarmory, Metagross, Celebi, Magneton, and opposing Jirachi super effectively. While the inability to hit Tyranitar neutrally is bothersome, the chance of burning it with Fire Punch is something to keep in mind. Thunderbolt is an option that hits Suicune, Skarmory, and Moltres very hard. It pairs well with Ice Punch, which can be used over Psychic, as it directly threatens Salamence and Flygon and is Jirachi's best special attack to damage Claydol. While it offers near-perfect coverage alongside Thunder or Thunderbolt, dropping Psychic makes Jirachi less likely to get past Blissey and Snorlax. Hidden Power Grass is an option if getting past Swampert and, to a lesser extent, Tyranitar is really necessary, but it comes with huge coverage issues.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Jirachi's Substitute doesn't fall to a Seismic Toss from Blissey or a Thunderbolt from defensive Zapdos after a Calm Mind. The investment in Defense ensures that Jirachi can stomach an Earthquake from Choice Band Dugtrio from full health. 136 EVs in Speed let Jirachi outspeed Adamant Heracross, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack with a Modest nature to hit relatively hard. 148 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are enough to outspeed neutral-natured Pokemon sitting at base 100 Speed such as Salamence, Zapdos, and Celebi. Other Speed benchmarks include 176 EVs to get the edge over Moltres. Leftovers is the mandatory item, as the recovery provided allows Jirachi to get more attempts to use Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar provides residual damage in the form of sand, which helps Jirachi immensely against Blissey, Snorlax, and Suicune. Tyranitar can also check these by itself in a pinch. Dugtrio's ability to trap and remove troublesome Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, opposing Jirachi, and weakened Blissey can be key to this set's success. Snorlax does a good job luring in Tyranitar and Metagross and can put them into KO range of Jirachi with Focus Punch, Self-Destruct, or Earthquake, and it might even manage to take them out entirely with Curse + Self-Destruct. Sleep inducers such as Breloom and Venusaur can cripple the likes of Claydol and Tyranitar should the opponent think that they can essentially sacrifice them instead of a seemingly more important Pokemon, which is highly beneficial for Jirachi. Jirachi is a prime candidate on teams focused around Calm Mind sweepers, as it can weaken or take advantage of the likes of Blissey, non-Perish Song Celebi, and Snorlax, which tend to be troublesome for this kind of team. Consequently, Suicune and Celebi make good partners, as they can damage their shared checks and provide an appealing defensive presence against the likes of Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross, which usually keep Jirachi in check. Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard are also pretty effective at pressuring physical offense teams featuring the aforementioned threats. In return, Jirachi can take advantage of walls like Milotic and Blissey, which give Fire-types trouble. On the other hand, Tyranitar and Swampert are also good partners, as they tend to attract opposing Swampert and can badly damage it with Hidden Power Grass, something that Jirachi greatly appreciates. Finally, while Jirachi can take out faster Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Jolly Salamence, Flygon, and especially Dugtrio if it's covered by Substitute, these can still threaten it with a powerful Earthquake if that's not the case. Thus, Pokemon that can take advantage of these once they're locked into Earthquake such as Gengar, Zapdos, and Salamence, as well as general physically defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, can be good backups.</p>"

      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi can go with a more immediately offensive approach with this set, which can act as a lure and be very awkward to deal with in spite of luck playing a significant part in this set's success. Dynamic Punch is a key move on this variant, as it allows Jirachi to secure a 2HKO on Tyranitar and, with sand on the field, a 2HKO on maximum Defense Blissey and a 3HKO on most Snorlax variants. The induced confusion makes it even more difficult for them to heal or retaliate. However, its iffy accuracy can ruin the surprise factor and thus affect the overall reliability of this set. Body Slam, coupled with Serene Grace, has a good chance to paralyze the opposing Pokemon, including Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert. Even though the move itself isn't very powerful, it can be useful as an offensive measure against a very weakened Blissey or Snorlax when betting on Dynamic Punch can be avoided. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, trades the ability to hinder Ground-types for a guaranteed paralysis on every Pokemon that is not immune to Normal-type moves, most notably Gengar. Paralysis is a good way to cripple what Jirachi can't hit super effectively due to four-moveslot syndrome, potentially makes missing with Dynamic Punch less punishing should full paralysis occur, and, coupled with confusion inflicted by Dynamic Punch, can make this Jirachi variant difficult to hit. Substitute is a less common option over Dynamic Punch or Body Slam that eliminates prediction and enhances Jirachi's ability to deal with Blissey by blocking its status moves and Seismic Toss, possibly allowing Jirachi to fire off multiple Dynamic Punches without worrying about missing.</p> <p>Fire Punch does a good amount of damage to Steel-types such as Metagross, Skarmory, Magneton, and opposing Jirachi while also threatening Celebi and Heracross. Hidden Power Grass dents Swampert and hits Claydol relatively hard. This set is extremely customizable, and there are plenty of options available. Body Slam or Thunder Wave can be dropped in favor of another coverage attack; Psychic can be considered to invalidate Gengar and do more damage to Heracross, while Thunder allows Jirachi to hit Skarmory while pressuring Milotic and Suicune more effectively and can inflict paralysis at a decent rate, though relying on another inaccurate move can lead to dicey situations. Nonetheless, Thunder provides both desirable coverage and paralysis and thus opens up another moveslot like Substitute or Hidden Power Grass. Ice Punch grants good coverage alongside Thunder and threatens Salamence and Flygon with an OHKO while dealing a good amount of damage to Zapdos, Claydol, and Celebi.</p> <p>The investment in Attack is needed to reliably 2HKO Blissey with Dynamic Punch. 136 EVs in Speed allow Jirachi to outrun maximum Speed Heracross and Suicune with a neutral nature. The rest is dumped into Special Attack alongside a Mild nature to maximize Jirachi's damage output with its coverage moves. The EV spread is highly customizable. Maximum Speed with or without a Hasty nature can be considered to outspeed other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Salamence, Zapdos, Celebi, and Flygon that choose not to maximize their Speed stat as well. Other relevant benchmarks include 32 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar and 56 EVs to get the jump over maximum Speed Adamant Claydol. If using Substitute, running 252 EVs in HP ensures that the Substitute can stand a Seismic Toss. Leftovers is the item of choice to increase Jirachi's longevity, which can be important against bulky teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi greatly appreciates sand to get some notable KOs and another source of passive damage that adds up to the confusion induced by Dynamic Punch. Therefore, Tyranitar is a teammate of choice that in return will greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to potentially lure out and cripple the likes of Swampert, Flygon, and Metagross. Pursuit variants can also threaten Pokemon such as Gengar and Celebi that can be awkward for Jirachi to fight due to their access to Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, respectively, as well as Jirachi's inability to scare them off most of the time. Zapdos is another good partner due to its typing synergy with Jirachi and ability to scare off Milotic, which can be difficult for Jirachi to break through. In return, Jirachi can potentially heavily damage Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax, something that Zapdos greatly appreciates. Since Jirachi is prone to being trapped and taken out by Dugtrio and targeted by strong Earthquake users in general, other hovering Pokemon such as Salamence, Gengar, and Flygon that can take advantage of Pokemon locked into Earthquake can be considered. Spikers such as Skarmory and Cloyster provide yet another form of residual damage that Jirachi appreciates when trying to break through bulky Pokemon. Finally, since this Jirachi can take several Pokemon such as Swampert, Flygon, and Suicune by surprise and badly cripple them with paralysis or its coverage move, late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar and Salamence as well as Agility Metagross can benefit from Jirachi's wallbreaking abilities.</p>"
