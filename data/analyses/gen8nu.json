    "overview": "<p>Gallade sets itself apart from other Fighting-types in the metagame like Toxicroak and Passimian due to its part-Psychic typing, allowing it to threaten the tier's bulky Poison-types like Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor. It is an equally, if not even more, dangerous wallbreaker thanks to Knock Off and Swords Dance, letting it cripple and eventually muscle past common physically defensive Pokemon like Mudsdale and Quagsire. However, it matches up poorly against the tier's common offensive threats: Gallade's Speed tier is average at best and, considering its frailty, makes it very vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Talonflame, Tauros, and Aerodactyl. It also faces tough competition from the aforementioned Toxicroak and Passimian, which have better defensive profiles and viable set diversity.</p> ",

Choice Scarf lets Gallade outspeed and revenge kill faster threats such as Salazzle, Toxicroak, and Tauros; however, it is generally outclassed by Passimian in this role due to it having U-turn. Assault Vest can make use of Gallade's solid special bulk to soft check special attackers like Salazzle, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk; Swords Dance is then dropped for Drain Punch to give Gallade a source of recovery, making more use of its added bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to its middling Speed tier, Gallade is outsped and OHKOed by faster threats like Aerodactyl, Talonflame, and Tauros. Even though Talonflame hates getting its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, it has the bulk and typing to withstand any attacks thrown by Gallade, punish non-Protective Pads variants with a Flame Body burn, and gain momentum afterwards via U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Without a boosting item, Mudsdale, Quagsire, and Sylveon can comfortably tank a +2 attack from Gallade and retaliate with Toxic or, in the latter's case, a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Moreover, thanks to Unaware, Quagsire ignores any Swords Dance boosts Gallade tries to accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: Non-Protective Pads variants can be extremely crippled by Talonflame's Flame Body, one of Gallade's best switch-ins. Poison-types like Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor that would otherwise lose to Gallade are more free to switch in on a predicted Fighting-type attack just to punish it with Effect Spore or Rocky Helmet and subsequently switch out to a Psychic-resistant teammate. The accumulated damage from Rocky Helmet and even Garbodor's Aftermath can easily put Gallade in range of being revenge killed, especially with the chip damage from Life Orb.</p> ",

Life Orb allows +2 Gallade to OHKO Vaporeon and potentially 2HKO Mudsdale, as well as Quagsire, which would otherwise ignore any of its Swords Dance boosts with Unaware.

Pivots like Rotom-C, Tsareena, and Talonflame can bring Gallade into the field safely on their switch-ins like Vileplume, Weezing, and Stakataka. Talonflame in particular can also switch into faster threats like Tauros that would otherwise revenge kill Gallade. Swords Dance Silvally-Ground is a potent setup sweeper that can help threaten Talonflame with Rock Slide and enjoys Gallade pressuring Weezing and overwhelming shared checks in Mudsdale and Quagsire. Silvally-Ground can also run U-turn to bring Gallade in safely on Weezing.</p> "

Rhydon's good bulk with Eviolite makes it a strong check towards Salazzle and Aerodactyl. In addition to this, Rhydon's great Attack combined with Swords Dance and decent enough Speed let it break through defensive Pokemon like Vaporeon, Snorlax, and Weezing. However, Rhydon falls short defensively because of its typing, poor special bulk, and reliance on Eviolite. Its 4x weaknesses to Water and Grass are incredibly problematic, as NU is filled with fantastic Water- and Grass-types alike. Furthermore, Rhydon's a poor Volt Switch deterrent because Rotom-C and Heliolisk both OHKO it with super effective coverage moves, and many other Pokemon Rhydon would like to check like Xatu, Salazzle, and Drapion exploit its type weaknesses or vulnerability to Knock Off. Stakataka and Mudsdale are almost always better options because of their superior defensive typings. Both of these Pokemon also can afford to lose their items to Knock Off.</p> ",

However, Heat Crash Rhydon is able to effectively lure these threats in, 2HKOing all of the aforementioned Pokemon except Alolan Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types, namely Vaporeon and Quagsire, can switch into Rhydon and heavily threaten it with Scald. More offensively-oriented Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon, while not able to directly switch in, can easily OHKO Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Passimian and Toxicroak, while unable to switch in directly, can 2HKO Rhydon with Close Combat and Low Kick, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Due to Rhydon's lack of reliable recovery, burn, poison, and entry hazards wear it down well.

With Knock Off and Sleep Powder, Tangela has enough disruptive utility to break down walls and prevent threats like Salazzle and Toxicroak from freely switching into it. These special attackers and more, however, easily force out Tangela once in, as its mediocre special bulk means even neutral special attacks are an issue. Tangela's walling capabilities are also often contingent on it retaining Eviolite, which is tough in the long term given some of the Pokemon it's meant to check, like Passimian, Tsareena, and Rotom-C, may cripple it with Knock Off and Trick.</p> ",

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is one of NU's best leads for hyper offense teams. It offers impressive utility in the lead slot by being able to both set Stealth Rock and clear opposing hazards with Rapid Spin while dissuading spinblockers and forcing progress with a strong Knock Off. Kabutops is also an offensive threat on its own, with Weak Armor and Rapid Spin to boost its Speed and a powerful STAB Stone Edge to bust through Pokemon that can prevent or ignore Stealth Rock, such as Xatu, Tsareena, and Heavy-Duty Boots users. These factors give Kabutops an edge when compared to leads such as Aerodactyl and Froslass, which are faster but far more passive and, unlike Kabutops, helpless to remove hazards on their own if an opponent can play around Taunt. However, because its typing is exploitable and it struggles to fit a Water-type move, Kabutops struggles one-on-one against bulky Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale, though it can cripple them in the long term by removing their Leftovers. In addition, Stealth Rock can be an inconsistent factor in many games: aside from the prevalence of Heavy-Duty Boots, many of the tier's walls, such as Mudsdale, Stakataka, and Copperajah, resist Stealth Rock. This can factor into the decision to choose Froslass over Kabutops, as Spikes is more impactful against these defensive threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Liquidation could be used in place of Stone Edge, improving Kabutops's matchup against Silvally-Ground and defensive Pokemon such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Mudsdale that otherwise give it significant trouble. However, it forfeits Kabutops's crucial ability to beat Tsareena and Mantine and also leaves it largely unable to dissuade Rotom-C and Toxicroak from taking advantage of it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Stakataka and Mudsdale take a pittance from Kabutops's common attacks and can use Toxic to prevent it from continually spinning away their Stealth Rock. Silvally-Steel, on the other hand, can use Toxic alongside Defog to prevent Kabutops from getting Stealth Rock up. Sandaconda also performs well, as it can cripple Kabutops with Glare and OHKO it with Earthquake after Rocky Helmet chip, so a lucky Sandaconda could come away from the exchange with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Dhelmise can block Rapid Spin, take Kabutops's attacks reasonably well, and use its own Rapid Spin to clear away Kabutops's Stealth Rock. However, Stone Edge has a slight chance to 2HKO Dhelmise if it has no Defense investment. Tsareena is also equipped with Rapid Spin and can attempt to stall Kabutops out of Stone Edges with Synthesis, but it cannot switch in safely for fear of a 2HKO. Vileplume walls Kabutops and can defeat it with Giga Drain or render it useless with Sleep Powder or Effect Spore. Rotom-C can neutralize Kabutops with Trick or Will-O-Wisp and potentially clear its Stealth Rock with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Silvally-Ground: Barring Liquidation, Kabutops has nothing to effectively hit Silvally-Ground, which can proceed to begin a sweep by setting up against it with Swords Dance and possibly Flame Charge.</p> ",

Xatu can serve as additional support for these teammates, offering a backup form of hazard control against Pokemon such as Mudsdale that can keep Stealth Rock up against Kabutops or set the hazard easily once it faints. Xatu can also set up dual screens, which, in conjunction with Kabutops's Stealth Rock, can enable a myriad of powerful sweepers such as Salazzle, Decidueye, Toxicroak, and Kingdra. Kabutops's Knock Off support is especially appreciated by wallbreakers with similar checks such as Heliolisk and Tyrantrum. Lastly, Thwackey is an excellent yet very niche teammate for Kabutops, revenge killing Silvally-Ground and luring in Talonflame to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots, and together they can support dangerous Grassy Terrain-reliant sweepers such as Dhelmise and Uxie.</p> "

Its utility goes beyond its Speed and defensive use, though; Aerodactyl can support its team as a Stealth Rock setter with a positive Xatu matchup or opt for Toxic to cripple the plethora of bulky Ground-types in NU, including Mudsdale, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Alternatively, Dragon Dance sets make Aerodactyl's average Attack more than enough to clean through weakened defensive checks like Mudsdale, Vaporeon, and Vileplume, and revenge killers like Rotom-C become inadequate. Aerodactyl is very easy to revenge kill with Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C, Passimian, and Heliolisk if lacking a Speed boost, though, and without significant chip damage, getting by checks like Mudsdale, Vaporeon, and Weezing can be an impossible task. Aerodactyl also faces notable competition from Talonflame, which fills a similar role as a fast Flying-type with useful defensive utility, and Tyrantrum, an even more potent Rock-type sweeper.</p> ",

Aerodactyl can also run a lead set on hyper offense teams with Stealth Rock / Rock Blast / Taunt / Earthquake and a Focus Sash to guarantee its entry hazard and beat Froslass, a common lead on such teams. Hone Claws is another option for setup sets, and it makes Stone Edge perfectly accurate, but the Speed boost from Dragon Dance is crucial against Choice Scarf users.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Quagsire shuts down any attempts at sweeping from Aerodactyl thanks to Unaware, whereas Mudsdale and Gastrodon must be severely weakened for Aerodactyl to ever pose a threat to them. Silvally-Ground's natural bulk is just enough to let it check Aerodactyl in a pinch and revenge kill it with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Foes like Vileplume, Weezing, and Vaporeon don't resist Aerodactyl's attacks, but their natural bulk and utility moves are enough to let them handle it even when boosted.

However, its ability to lure in and poison bulky Ground-types like Gastrodon and Mudsdale with Toxic is also valuable, with Roost further amplifying its supportive presence and letting it consistently check Talonflame and Salazzle. None of Aerodactyl's abilities are too helpful, but Pressure can help stall out certain moves from weaker attackers, such as Sylveon's Moonblast.

Snorlax's longevity gives it the edge in many matchups, able to survive hits from powerful physical attackers like Tauros and Guzzlord with a few Defense boosts and healing with Rest. In addition, Snorlax finds setup chances often due to its great natural bulk turning defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, Sylveon, and Vaporeon into setup fodder. Even in matchups where sweeping is unlikely, this bulk and Body Slam's paralysis chance give Snorlax good general utility. However, Snorlax's reliance on Rest for recovery leaves it open to a variety of Pokemon that can stop its sweep. Its dismal Speed leaves it very vulnerable to item removal, status, and a slew of dangerous wallbreakers, all of which can force it to use Rest early or negate its sweeping potential entirely. On top of this, Snorlax's typing gives it almost no relevant defensive benefits, even if it opts to use Thick Fat, and gives it a very common and exploitable weakness in Fighting. Snorlax's sweeping ability can be highly matchup reliant, as it will rarely get past certain threats such as Vileplume, Golurk, Escavalier, and Diancie without the right coverage move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Darkest Lariat allows Snorlax to hit Golurk, Decidueye, and Psychic-types such as Xatu in the same moveslot, and it provides great neutral coverage. However, it comes at the cost of either super effective damage on Steel-types or the utility of Body Slam, making it a generally subpar option. Heavy Slam can be used to let Snorlax lure in Diancie, but it is rarely worthwhile because it targets little else of note. Snorlax can also surprise its checks with more offensive sets: Assault Vest increases Snorlax's coverage while retaining its special walling capabilities, Choice Band can hit traditional walls like Mudsdale, Diancie, and Escavalier very hard, and a set with three attacks, Protect or Rest, and Leftovers allows Snorlax to both increase its immediate offense and preserve its longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Toxicroak, Gallade, Scrafty, and Passimian can all force huge damage on Snorlax, even after it has begun to set up. The former two especially can OHKO Snorlax with Choice Band Close Combat, even after a Curse. Several physical attackers that naturally check Snorlax, such as Escavalier and Tauros, commonly run Close Combat to deal with it. Snorlax is also prone to being caught off guard by coverage moves such as Focus Blast from Heliolisk and Superpower from Copperajah, which 2HKO it on the switch or force it to use Rest early.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Trick users, including Rotom-C, can almost totally negate Snorlax's usefulness by locking it into one move.

This issue in particular can have major consequences; common defensive Pokemon like Escavalier, Sylveon, and Copperajah OHKO Sneasel if they manage to survive its hits. Sneasel's frailty and awful defensive typing hold it back, too.

Immunities to Ground and Water and a resistance to Fighting define Mantine's defensive presence, allowing it to come in on Choice-locked threats such as Passimian and Golurk and pivot well against other defensive Water-types such as Quagsire. Mantine's Scald and Toxic ensure it isn't overly passive, and it can more easily check physical attackers such as Silvally-Ground and Copperajah by crippling them with a burn. In addition, Mantine is not a sitting duck against traditional Water-type answers such as Toxicroak, Heliolisk, and Vileplume; its access to Hurricane and ability to easily fit Toxic set it apart from Vaporeon, which cannot viably run much to circumvent these checks due to its more restricted moveslots. However, Mantine's physical bulk is less than impressive, allowing threats such as Golurk and Tauros to easily muscle past it with the right coverage. Mantine is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off from many of the physical attackers it wants to pivot into, as its Stealth Rock weakness means it struggles even more to take hits after losing its item. Finally, though Mantine seems like it would be a good Defog user, it has difficulty effectively removing hazards because it is threatened by most of the tier's common Stealth Rock setters: Diancie and Stakataka can defeat it with their Rock-type STAB attacks, and Copperajah can muscle through it with Rock Slide and Power Whip.</p> ",

Water Veil makes Mantine immune to Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp and is especially good on teams that already possess good Water-type counterplay, but Water Absorb is usually preferred to beat Inteleon even more consistently.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-C and Heliolisk can switch into Mantine and gain momentum with Volt Switch as Mantine is forced out, and Heliolisk is also immune to Scald. However, both of these Pokemon dislike Toxic, and Rotom-C is hit fairly hard by Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic forces Mantine to use Roost and switch out constantly to avoid taking major damage, which can rack up quickly with Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots has been removed. As such, Mantine needs to be careful when attempting to switch into defensive Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Mudsdale, and Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: The vast majority of physical attackers have little trouble breaking past Mantine due to its low physical bulk. For example, Choice Band Passimian can 2HKO Mantine with Rock Slide. Poltergeist users such as Golurk and Decidueye prey on Mantine due to its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots.

Jellicent faces stiff competition from other great Water-types in the tier like Mantine, Vaporeon, and Gastrodon, but its great utility movepool makes it quite difficult to be taken advantage of by traditional Water-type answers such as Toxicroak and Decidueye, and it beats opposing bulky Water-types head-to-head. Despite Jellicent's great defensive typing and movepool, its stats leave much to be desired, leading to it taking more damage than it'd like to and spending more turns recovering health instead of shutting down opposing walls. Jellicent also greatly suffers from being limited to only four moves. Taunt and Recover are basically mandatory, and any combination of status move and STAB move always ends up walled by something: Toxicroak walls the combination of Scald and Toxic, whereas Normal-types like Exploud and bulky Dark-types like Scrafty and Guzzlord can easily shrug off Will-O-Wisp and Hex.</p> ",

While the Choice Specs set may catch checks like Scrafty and Snorlax off guard, it is often outclassed by faster and more powerful Water-types like Inteleon and Starmie. Jellicent can use Strength Sap for recovery, but Recover's consistency makes it much more preferred. Cursed Body can be quite useful into Choice-locked attackers and Pokemon with a single attack, especially with Jellicent's Taunt, but Water Absorb's utility in the tier is unmatched and gives Jellicent a lot of its viability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Faster Grass-types like Alolan Exeggutor, Decidueye, and Tsareena threaten an OHKO with their powerful STAB moves and also have pivoting moves to take advantage of threatening Jellicent out.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Heliolisk is immune to both of Jellicent's STAB moves, and Rotom-C easily comes in and gains momentum off Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-types: Jellicent may effectively shut down defensive Water-types like Vaporeon and Mantine, but it cannot effectively threaten stronger and faster ones like Inteleon and Starmie, and they both boast super effective coverage.</p> ",

Note, however, that each combination struggles with a different group of checks to bulky Water-types. 76 Speed EVs let Jellicent outpace even Jolly Copperajah and Glastrier, both of which can be quite threatening if not burned. A Colbur Berry lets Jellicent serve as a reliable switch-in to Fighting-types like Passimian, Toxicroak, and Gallade, even if they use Knock Off.

Jellicent appreciates Vileplume's defensive qualities as both a Grass- and Electric-resistant Pokemon and a sturdy Knock Off switch-in.

Scald targets opposing Ground-types such as Silvally-Ground and Golurk, doing solid damage while also having a chance to burn them. Yawn in conjunction with Snap Trap can be a nasty combo, forcing an unsuspecting Pokemon to sleep.

Dragon Tail lets Druddigon rack up Stealth Rock chip damage and phazes some setup users like Drapion and Braviary. Earthquake lets Druddigon hurt Steel-types like Copperajah and even Levitate Weezing when backed up by Mold Breaker. Glare and Toxic are both good status move options; Toxic in particular is a great move alongside Mold Breaker Earthquake. On Leftovers sets, Protect can be used over Dragon Tail to recover some extra HP and potentially rack up extra Toxic damage; it also lets Druddigon scout the moves of wallbreakers like Exploud. The given special bulk investment lets Druddigon tank attacks from +2 Salazzle, while the physical bulk investment is for foes like Toxicroak and +2 Talonflame.

Despite Golurk's colorful movepool and great Attack stat, its poor Speed and middling bulk make it quite easy to find midgrounds for once its set is successfully identified. Golurk also faces competition from the much superior Silvally-Ground and Mudsdale for a teamslot because they have significant fewer flaws and are easier to build around; with Golurk, you lose a ton of defensive utility and cannot easily run item displacement such as Knock Off. As a wallbreaker, Golurk is slower than the likes of Exploud and Sylveon while only matching their damage output.

Just like its Sticky Barb and Assault Vest sets, Golurk can use a Choice Scarf to catch its foes off guard, although this has similar drawbacks to the Assault Vest set.

In addition, its good Attack, powerful coverage, and access to Swords Dance let it crush defensive staples such as Copperajah, Diancie, and Sylveon, while useful priority in Shadow Sneak lets it sufficiently threaten offensive teams. However, Doublade's meager Special Defense despite Eviolite means even powerful resisted STAB moves from the likes of Exploud and Sylveon can 2HKO it, making it awkward to fit on teams as a Steel-type, and its reliance on Eviolite makes it a poor answer to many physical attackers like Toxicroak, Escavalier, and Tsareena that run Knock Off. Doublade's total lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to common coverage makes it an ineffective long-term check and spinblocker to Tyrantrum, Copperajah, and Tsareena. While Doublade is powerful after Swords Dance, it is also not exceedingly difficult to wall, with bulky Pokemon like Mantine, Talonflame, and Mudsdale able to take it on, and it is easy to revenge kill due to its over-reliance on a relatively weak Shadow Sneak to handle faster threats.</p> ",

Rock Slide Doublade can lure in and OHKO Talonflame without a boost, but fitting Rock Slide heavily compromises Doublade's overall coverage. Toxic punishes walls that Doublade baits in such as Mudsdale and Arcanine but diminishes its offensive potential.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off: Powerful Knock Off users such as Escavalier, Toxicroak, and Scrafty are very dangerous for Doublade to take on, opening it up by hitting it hard and removing its Eviolite. Passimian and Tsareena can use Knock Off so that Doublade cannot easily stop them from cleaning late-game and spinning, respectively, and Tsareena is also immune to Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Powerful special attackers can easily prey on Doublade's awful Special Defense. Salazzle and Inteleon can both OHKO it after Stealth Rock with their STAB moves, and Heliolisk and Rotom-C can exploit it for pivoting opportunities. Strong resisted special STAB moves from the likes of Exploud and Choice Specs Sylveon also potentially 2HKO Doublade.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Mantine, Weezing, and Talonflame are excellent answers to Doublade, as they can all take hits from +2 Doublade and turn it into fodder by burning it. The uncommon Arcanine fully counters Doublade, taking any hit with ease due to Intimidate and hitting back hard with Flamethrower. While Vaporeon does not appreciate taking +2 Close Combat, it is also a workable check in a pinch if it can produce a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Mudsdale checks Doublade well at full health due to Stamina, but it can be a shaky answer because it is easily worn down and can only 3HKO with Earthquake. Quagsire is totally unbothered by Doublade due to Unaware and its resistance to Iron Head, and it can burn Doublade or chip it down with Earthquake. Golurk can survive an unboosted Shadow Sneak and threaten huge damage with a STAB move, while Silvally-Ground easily takes a boosted Shadow Sneak and OHKOes Doublade with +2 Multi-Attack after Stealth Rock.</p> ",

Only a handful of Pokemon wall Decidueye's STAB attacks, and even fewer are fast enough that its teammates can't exploit them after U-turn uses or double switches. Furthermore, since Decidueye can use both physical and special sets to great success, finding defensive counterplay isn't so simple until you know its set. Despite these advantages, Decidueye isn't perfect, and its Speed is its most notable flaw. Even though its Shadow Sneak is strong when boosted, faster attackers like Talonflame and Drapion easily revenge kill it, with only the former being susceptible to Decidueye's priority attack. Decidueye also struggles in certain matchups, especially against Dark-types like Guzzlord, Scrafty, and Sneasel, since it's forced to use U-turn more often instead of wallbreak.

Nasty Plot is an alternative setup set that can bypass even the sturdiest of special walls like Scrafty and Mantine, but this set exposes Decidueye's average Speed quite a bit, as it lacks a priority move.

It has excellent bulk to check a plethora of incredibly menacing, top-tier Pokemon including Rotom-C, Salazzle, and Decidueye. Formidable base Attack, Beast Boost, and a colorful movepool with tons of utility make it an exceptionally capable attacker; STAB Knock Off punishes common switch-ins such as Talonflame and Mudsdale, for example, and Heavy Slam deals heavy damage to Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Diancie. Guzzlord's overall defensive properties give it a lot of opportunities to directly switch in and wallbreak. However, its low base Speed makes it prone to being revenge killed by common wallbreakers such as Sylveon, Tauros, and Toxicroak. Moreover, despite Guzzlord's typing's advantages, it's weak to common moves such as Body Press and U-turn. Furthermore, many of the foes Guzzlord tries to check can pivot out on it, such as Rotom-C and Decidueye, which makes it harder to truly capitalize on its positive matchup against them.</p> ",

Terrain Extender is preferred to give as much time to teammates as possible to sweep or wallbreak, but Shuca Berry can be used alongside Hydro Pump to lure in and heavily damage offensive Ground-types like Silvally-Ground and Rhydon.</p> <p>Although Pincurchin has coverage for Ground-types, it appreciates the support from Xatu to wall Mudsdale and also serve as a general pivot to safely get in Electric Terrain sweepers like Alolan Raichu and Sceptile. Xatu itself can make use of Electric Seed or Weakness Policy with Calm Mind to sweep teams or weaken shared checks between itself and Alolan Raichu such as Snorlax and Copperajah. Other setup sweepers that can function independently of Electric Terrain such as Omastar and Silvally-Ground also allow Pincurchin teams to not be entirely reliant on it while still taking advantage of its supportive capabilities.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Copperajah's blend of offense and defense makes it a potent wallbreaker that also offers teams an awful lot defensively. Teams typically will struggle to fit a reliable defensive switch-in to Copperajah because of its great coverage, which limits otherwise reasonable checks like Guzzlord and Mudsdale to being situational switch-ins. Copperajah is also a fine Stealth Rock setter because it retains a significant offensive presence even with minimal investment, giving it plenty of chances to force foes out and set its entry hazard. Copperajah's biggest flaw, however, is how poor its longevity is. It is heavily reliant on Wish support to stay healthy and is prone to getting repeatedly weakened by pivoting moves from foes like Rotom-C, Heliolisk, and Ninjask, forcing it to cede momentum. It's also incredibly slow, which greatly expands the list of foes that will threaten Copperajah and force it out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Head can be used over Heavy Slam on Stealth Rock sets so that Glastrier can't take advantage of Copperajah as easily. Sheer Force can be considered to boost its and Rock Slide's power further. Choice Band sets sacrifice longevity for incredible wallbreaking power, but because Copperajah's Speed tier is so poor, it appreciates the extra survivability Assault Vest provides more. Play Rough immediately removes Guzzlord and prevents Scrafty from setting up against Copperajah, but it's otherwise very limited in use. Protect + Leftovers sets are solid for scouting Choice item attackers like Exploud, Guzzlord, and Passimian and increase Copperajah's self sufficiency.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Arcanine reliably switches into even coverage attacks from Copperajah, outspeeds it, and threatens super effective damage in return. Talonflame is a riskier switch-in because of Rock-type coverage, but it can fish for burns when Copperajah uses its contact moves thanks to Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Pokemon like Mudsdale, Guzzlord, and Vileplume can contend with Copperajah but risk being hit really hard on the switch by a coverage move. Xatu stonewalls Stealth Rock Copperajah, although it can't keep up with the damage from Assault Vest variants.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Pokemon like Gallade, Toxicroak, and Passimian are ineffective at switching into Copperajah, but they can take it out with their STAB Fighting-type attacks.</p> ",

Its bulk is nothing to sneeze at either, and it can create extremely tanky Substitutes to protect itself from status and weaker hits from the likes of Vileplume and Vaporeon. Glastrier's two main problems are its poor defensive typing and very low Speed; these leave it vulnerable to the powerful STAB moves and coverage attacks of most other wallbreakers such as Passimian and Exploud, so its defensive utility is less than it appears on paper. Glastrier is also unable to make progress against certain answers such as Diamond Storm Diancie, Quagsire, and Arcanine without a lot of support.
