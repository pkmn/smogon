  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade sets itself apart from other Fighting-types in the metagame like Toxicroak and Passimian due to its part-Psychic typing, allowing it to threaten the tier's bulky Poison-types like Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor. It is an equally, if not even more, dangerous wallbreaker thanks to Knock Off and Swords Dance, letting it cripple and eventually muscle past common physically defensive Pokemon like Mudsdale and Quagsire. However, it matches up poorly against the tier's common offensive threats: Gallade's Speed tier is average at best and, considering its frailty, makes it very vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Talonflame, Tauros, and Aerodactyl. It also faces tough competition from the aforementioned Toxicroak and Passimian, which have better defensive profiles and viable set diversity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band gives Gallade the immediate power to cleanly 2HKO Quagsire; however, being Choice locked makes it easier to play around. Choice Scarf lets Gallade outspeed and revenge kill faster threats such as Salazzle, Toxicroak, and Tauros; however, it is generally outclassed by Passimian in this role due to it having U-turn. Assault Vest can make use of Gallade's solid special bulk to soft check special attackers like Salazzle, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk; Swords Dance is then dropped for Drain Punch to give Gallade a source of recovery, making more use of its added bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its middling Speed tier, Gallade is outsped and OHKOed by faster threats like Aerodactyl, Talonflame, and Tauros. Even though Talonflame hates getting its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, it has the bulk and typing to withstand any attacks thrown by Gallade, punish non-Protective Pads variants with a Flame Body burn, and gain momentum afterwards via U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Without a boosting item, Mudsdale, Quagsire, and Sylveon can comfortably tank a +2 attack from Gallade and retaliate with Toxic or, in the latter's case, a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Moreover, thanks to Unaware, Quagsire ignores any Swords Dance boosts Gallade tries to accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Non-Protective Pads variants can be extremely crippled by Talonflame's Flame Body, one of Gallade's best switch-ins. Poison-types like Vileplume, Weezing, and Garbodor that would otherwise lose to Gallade are more free to switch in on a predicted Fighting-type attack just to punish it with Effect Spore or Rocky Helmet and subsequently switch out to a Psychic-resistant teammate. The accumulated damage from Rocky Helmet and even Garbodor's Aftermath can easily put Gallade in range of being revenge killed, especially with the chip damage from Life Orb.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Knock Off targets Psychic-types like Xatu and Galarian Articuno; cripples walls like Quagsire, Sylveon, and Mudsdale; and reliably hits Ghost-types like Dhelmise, Decidueye, and Golurk without risking a Zen Headbutt miss. Protective Pads keeps Gallade safe from contact effects like Talonflame's Flame Body, Vileplume's Effect Spore, Weezing's Rocky Helmet, and Garbodor's Aftermath. Alternatively, Lum Berry lets it ignore Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Effect Spore once while enabling it to safely set up against status inducers like Vaporeon and Mudsdale. Life Orb allows +2 Gallade to OHKO Vaporeon and potentially 2HKO Mudsdale, as well as Quagsire, which would otherwise ignore any of its Swords Dance boosts with Unaware. If running Life Orb, Psycho Cut should be used over Zen Headbutt to give Gallade a non-contact attack for Vileplume and Weezing that still nails the OHKO at +2. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Tsareena, Tyrantrum, and Decidueye.</p> <p>Gallade fits well on offensive teams that appreciate its wallbreaking prowess. Pivots like Rotom-C, Tsareena, and Talonflame can bring Gallade into the field safely on their switch-ins like Vileplume, Weezing, and Stakataka. Talonflame in particular can also switch into faster threats like Tauros that would otherwise revenge kill Gallade. Swords Dance Silvally-Ground is a potent setup sweeper that can help threaten Talonflame with Rock Slide and enjoys Gallade pressuring Weezing and overwhelming shared checks in Mudsdale and Quagsire. Silvally-Ground can also run U-turn to bring Gallade in safely on Weezing.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sandslash is a notable sweeper thanks to Sand Rush doubling its Speed under sand, making it a staple on sand teams. Sandslash's good Attack and physical bulk give it several chances to set up Swords Dance and muscle through Pokemon like Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Escavalier. Sandslash also has good coverage in Knock Off and Leech Life to lure in and beat Grass-type checks like Dhelmise, Rotom-C, and Tsareena. However, Sandslash's low Special Defense hurts it against foes that can retaliate after taking an unboosted hit, like Vaporeon and Vileplume. Outside of sand, Sandslash is slow and easy to revenge kill, especially given its several common weaknesses. Sand is also niche due to how teams built around it require a lot of support to execute a sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rapid Spin enables Sandslash to outspeed Choice Scarf Heliolisk under sand while functioning as an emergency entry hazard remover. The Speed boost also allows Sandslash to outspeed threats like Tsareena and non-Choice Scarf Rotom-C outside of sand.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: In a one-on-one situation, Pokemon like Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Mudsdale are bulky enough to tank Earthquake and threaten heavy damage in return, especially if Sandslash is running Lum Berry. However, if Sandslash is running Life Orb and has obtained a Swords Dance boost, it can OHKO them with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: While Sandslash outspeeds the most common Choice Scarf users—Rotom-C and Passimian—under sand, Choice Scarf Heliolisk and Inteleon can outspeed and KO it with Hyper Voice after minor chip damage or OHKO with Surf, respectively. However, they cannot switch in reliably at all.</p> <p><strong>Snow Warning</strong>: Snow Warning users, like Vanilluxe and Aurorus, negate Sandslash's Speed boost and can stop it from sweeping by instantly setting hail. However, Aurorus gets outsped and OHKOed by Sandslash, and both cannot switch in reliably.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: The second sand turns are over, Sandslash becomes quite simple to revenge kill with Pokemon like Exploud, Starmie, and Rotom-C.</p>",

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great typing, amazing bulk, and numerous utility options, Vileplume acts as a check to common Pokemon in the tier such as Silvally-Ground, Dhelmise, and Guzzlord. Its great Poison / Grass typing and reliable recovery options make it difficult for opposing teams to wear down. With Effect Spore, it has a chance to passively punish physical attackers and pivots. Vileplume's natural strength and unique combination of STAB moves in Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb make it difficult to switch into. Vileplume can also serve as a great tool against bulky Steel-types like Copperajah and Stakataka, as Corrosive Gas removes their held items and Sleep Powder puts them to sleep. However, Vileplume is slow and vulnerable to Psychic- and Fire-types as well as strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Guzzlord, Galarian Articuno, and Exploud. Vileplume is also easily worn down by entry hazards, and it has difficulty switching into strong physical wallbreakers like Golurk and Tyrantrum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leech Seed inflicts residual damage on opposing Pokemon and gives Vileplume an option for more recovery. While having less PP than Leech Seed, Synthesis gives Vileplume consistent recovery. Moonblast can put out some extra damage on Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types like Passimian and Guzzlord. Aromatherapy can be used if the team needs a cleric option. Growth can turn Vileplume into a wincon late-game at the cost of its utility in Corrosive Gas or Sleep Powder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Starmie and Galarian Articuno threaten Vileplume with Psychic or Hurricane. They can force out Vileplume, but none of them want to get poisoned by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Aerodactyl can dish out huge damage with Dual Wingbeat. Ninjask and Braviary resist Giga Drain, and Braviary also gains a Defiant boost from Strength Sap. However, all of them have to be wary about switching into Sludge Bomb and getting poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle and Swords Dance Talonflame can threaten out Vileplume with their strong STAB options, but switching into Corrosive Gas is problematic, as it removes their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Choice Band users such as Tyrantrum and Golurk threaten Vileplume with Head Smash and Earthquake, respectively. Alolan Exeggutor, Guzzlord, and Exploud threaten Vileplume with their STAB moves and coverage.</p> <p><strong>Strength Sap Blockers</strong>: Xatu and Espeon can both block Vileplume's recovery from Strength Sap with Magic Bounce, limiting its ability to switch into Passimian and Silvally-Ground.</p>",

Corrosive Gas removes the item of common switch-ins like Escavalier, Copperajah, and Salazzle. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins to sleep, making it safer for Vileplume to switch out on them. Black Sludge gives Vileplume extra recovery, but running no item is better for checking Knock Off and Poltergeist users like Drapion and Golurk.</p> <p>Vileplume is weak to Flying-types, so Steel- and Rock-types such as Stakataka, Copperajah, and Diancie that can check Talonflame and Braviary are appreciated.

Vileplume struggles against strong Psychic-types such as Starmie and Galarian Articuno; therefore, partners like Escavalier and Copperajah are great. Vileplume in return checks Fighting-types such as Passimian for them. Vileplume dislikes Fire-types like Salazzle, so Mantine and Vaporeon are great partners for it. Vileplume and Guzzlord form a great core, since they are able to wall physical and special attackers while canceling out each other's weaknesses; Vileplume helps with Fighting- and Fairy-types, and Guzzlord helps with Psychic-types. Offensive teammates like Silvally-Ground and Starmie both target Poison-types and Arcanine, which Vileplume has trouble with.</p>"

It then functions as a defensive pivot with Teleport, allowing it to gain momentum against its switch-ins like Salazzle and Starmie. Arcanine's Teleport is also vital for teams with frail wallbreakers like Tyrantrum and Exploud, as it allows them to safely get in against Mantine and Sylveon without the risk of status and chip damage. However, Arcanine risks compromising its longevity when using Teleport on walls and is easily worn down by Toxic and Knock Off. Additionally, it fails in the face of common physical attackers like Tyrantrum, Golurk, and Silvally-Ground. Arcanine relies heavily on Teleport and supportive teammates to punish its checks, and if it loses this support late-game, its passivity becomes a glaring issue against foes like Drampa.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arcanine has a vast offensive movepool and mixed offensive stats to make it less passive, so attacks like Extreme Speed, Wild Charge, and Scorching Sands work as alternatives to Flamethrower or Toxic. Offensive sets enjoy this coverage as well but are inefficient due to being easy to wall and wear down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Drampa, Guzzlord, and Tyrantrum resist Flamethrower and threaten heavy damage to Arcanine. Guzzlord can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots, whereas Lum Berry Tyrantrum can safely set up against it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon are the hardest for Arcanine to deal with, and while defensive examples like Mantine and Vaporeon are checks as well, they are more manageable with Toxic and Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Arcanine fails to switch into and wall Silvally-Ground and Mudsdale, although it may have a better chance if it opts for Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Switching into attacks and following up with Teleport will wear Arcanine down, and it will lose momentum anytime it is forced to recover.

Wallbreakers like Golurk, Tyrantrum, and Grimmsnarl all find safe opportunities to switch into walls via Teleport support, and when they find themselves threatened by revenge killers such as Tauros and Decidueye, Arcanine again is a good defensive answer. Vileplume and Mudsdale cover Knock Off users that Arcanine is vulnerable to like Passimian and Guzzlord. For specially offensive threats, Mantine and Vaporeon will help, and so will Decidueye and Choice Scarf Heliolisk to offensively pressure Inteleon and Starmie.

Though specific, this niche can be highly valuable when used to support teammates like Exploud and Sylveon that desperately need Steel-types being gone. However, outside of trapping them, Magneton offers little to no defensive use or utility compared to the metagame's other Steel-types, making it outclassed by them for a teamslot. It is also dead-weight outside of the Steel-type matchup due to its overall poor offensive presence and passivity.</p>",

A fully offensive set with Thunderbolt, Flash Cannon, Volt Switch, and Tri Attack alongside Choice Specs can be used to still chip down the Steel-types significantly. If so, Analytic can also be used to turn Magneton into a potent wallbreaker that is even more difficult to switch into.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Mudsdale, Quagsire, and Gastrodon completely wall Magneton's attacks.

A physically defensive spread alongside Eviolite and Iron Defense lets it comfortably go toe-to-toe with the Steel-types it's supposed to beat such as Stakataka, Copperajah, and specially defensive Escavalier, notably letting it take on the former two's super effective Body Press and Superpower, respectively.

It also has Flamethrower to hit Steel-types like Copperajah, Doublade, and Escavalier, which would otherwise wall it, and it has some defensive utility by being an excellent switch-in to Rotom-C, Vaporeon, and Quagsire. While pivoting with Teleport is nice, the drawback is that Alolan Exeggutor is forced to move last, and it sometimes gets hurt as a result.

Harvest combined with Custap Berry + Endure can make Alolan Exeggutor an issue for faster threats, since it will usually be launching one more attack before it goes down. A Choice Specs set with proper prediction can be nearly impossible to switch into safely, due to the high Special Attack stat and high-Base Power moves Alolan Exeggutor boasts.

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon is a usable Stealth Rock setter courtesy of its good bulk with Eviolite and great offensive presence, letting it heavily pressure common forms of entry hazard prevention like Xatu and Dhelmise. Rhydon's good bulk with Eviolite makes it a strong check towards Salazzle and Aerodactyl. In addition to this, Rhydon's great Attack combined with Swords Dance and decent enough Speed let it break through defensive Pokemon like Vaporeon, Snorlax, and Weezing. However, Rhydon falls short defensively because of its typing, poor special bulk, and reliance on Eviolite. Its 4x weaknesses to Water and Grass are incredibly problematic, as NU is filled with fantastic Water- and Grass-types alike. Furthermore, Rhydon's a poor Volt Switch deterrent because Rotom-C and Heliolisk both OHKO it with super effective coverage moves, and many other Pokemon Rhydon would like to check like Xatu, Salazzle, and Drapion exploit its type weaknesses or vulnerability to Knock Off. Stakataka and Mudsdale are almost always better options because of their superior defensive typings. Both of these Pokemon also can afford to lose their items to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhydon can run Rock Polish + Swords Dance, fixing its relatively poor Speed to become a scary sweeper. However, this set faces competition from Stakataka as a Rock-type sweeper. Megahorn OHKOes Starmie and Alolan Exeggutor on the switch, but it otherwise overlaps in coverage with the more accurate Heat Crash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Decidueye, Alolan Exeggutor, and Dhelmise can switch in on a predicted Earthquake and threaten to OHKO Rhydon. Vileplume operates as a good check to Swords Dance variants, not fainting to +2 Earthquake, and in return it OHKOes with Giga Drain. However, Heat Crash Rhydon is able to effectively lure these threats in, 2HKOing all of the aforementioned Pokemon except Alolan Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types, namely Vaporeon and Quagsire, can switch into Rhydon and heavily threaten it with Scald. More offensively-oriented Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon, while not able to directly switch in, can easily OHKO Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Passimian and Toxicroak, while unable to switch in directly, can 2HKO Rhydon with Close Combat and Low Kick, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Rhydon's lack of reliable recovery, burn, poison, and entry hazards wear it down well. Burns from Talonflame and Weezing are exceptionally dangerous due to lowering Rhydon's Attack, making it much harder for it to break through defensive Pokemon like Vileplume and Vaporeon.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Due to Rhydon's reliance on Eviolite for bulk, it is quite susceptible to item removal, especially from Pokemon it otherwise checks well like Salazzle and Drapion.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Drapion, Tauros, and Aerodactyl can lure in and heavily damage Rhydon with their coverage attacks, making it a worse check to them than it otherwise would be.</p>",

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangela is coveted for two rare defensive qualities: high, Eviolite-boosted physical bulk and the ability Regenerator. These traits make it one of the best counters to Silvally-Ground, unfazed even after Swords Dance boosts, and a sponge against attacks from Copperajah, Tauros, and Golurk. With Knock Off and Sleep Powder, Tangela has enough disruptive utility to break down walls and prevent threats like Salazzle and Toxicroak from freely switching into it. These special attackers and more, however, easily force out Tangela once in, as its mediocre special bulk means even neutral special attacks are an issue. Tangela's walling capabilities are also often contingent on it retaining Eviolite, which is tough in the long term given some of the Pokemon it's meant to check, like Passimian, Tsareena, and Rotom-C, may cripple it with Knock Off and Trick.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leech Seed consolidates Sleep Powder and Synthesis, as it punishes switch-ins and nets Tangela recovery, albeit not as effectively as the prior options. Toxic is another status move to consider to hit Grass-types and walls alike. Leaf Storm's downside is mitigated by Tangela's incentive to switch for Regenerator, and it notably OHKOes Silvally-Ground and Golurk. Extra Speed investment is doable to outspeed the likes of Diancie, offensive Guzzlord, and Alolan Exeggutor, but these matchups are unreliable compared to the extra physical bulk to sponge attacks and scout.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>:  Specially offensive Poison-types like Salazzle, Vileplume, and Weezing are often the hardest for Tangela to deal with, as its coverage fails to deter them from switching in, while they threaten to OHKO it; Vileplume's immunity to Sleep Powder makes it a hard counter to Tangela. Physical Poison-types like Drapion and Toxicroak are also troublesome but are less immediately threatening.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Tangela's special bulk isn't that great and is exploited by strong attackers like Alolan Exeggutor, Exploud, and Duraludon. Even Nasty Plot Rotom-C can 2HKO Tangela at +2 with Leaf Storm. Walls like Diancie and Xatu may even run super effective coverage moves like Mystical Fire and Heat Wave to threaten Tangela more.</p> <p><strong>Escavalier</strong>: With Overcoat, Escavalier is a unique wall that tanks Tangela's attacks and ignores Sleep Powder to use it for setup fodder; losing Leftovers from Knock Off is a small price to pay for an otherwise safe Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Even if Tangela may switch into physical attackers like Tsareena and Passimian at first, it risks taking Knock Off from them and losing its invaluable Eviolite. The same goes for Choice Scarf Rotom-C's Trick. Without Eviolite, physical attackers like Tyrantrum and Choice Band Grimmsnarl reliably 2HKO Tangela.</p>",

Synthesis instead allows Tangela to perform well directly after taking a +2 Silvally-Ground's U-turn. 16 Special Defense EVs prevent Life Orb Starmie's Ice Beam from OHKOing at full health, and another 16 EVs into Speed let Tangela outpace Adamant Copperajah.</p> <p>Regenerator allows Tangela to scout for certain attacks and sets, so after sponging a hit, be ready to switch Tangela back out to its teammates. Mudsdale and Sylveon are good partners for taking Knock Off so that Tangela may retain its Eviolite.

Offensive teammates like Duraludon and Salazzle appreciate Tangela luring in walls like Vileplume and Weezing, which lets them get in safely.

It offers impressive utility in the lead slot by being able to both set Stealth Rock and clear opposing hazards with Rapid Spin while dissuading spinblockers and forcing progress with a strong Knock Off. Kabutops is also an offensive threat on its own, with Weak Armor and Rapid Spin to boost its Speed and a powerful STAB Stone Edge to bust through Pokemon that can prevent or ignore Stealth Rock, such as Xatu, Tsareena, and Heavy-Duty Boots users. These factors give Kabutops an edge when compared to leads such as Aerodactyl and Froslass, which are faster but far more passive and, unlike Kabutops, helpless to remove hazards on their own if an opponent can play around Taunt. However, because its typing is exploitable and it struggles to fit a Water-type move, Kabutops struggles one-on-one against bulky Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale, though it can cripple them in the long term by removing their Leftovers. In addition, Stealth Rock can be an inconsistent factor in many games: aside from the prevalence of Heavy-Duty Boots, many of the tier's walls, such as Mudsdale, Stakataka, and Copperajah, resist Stealth Rock. This can factor into the decision to choose Froslass over Kabutops, as Spikes is more impactful against these defensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Liquidation could be used in place of Stone Edge, improving Kabutops's matchup against Silvally-Ground and defensive Pokemon such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Mudsdale that otherwise give it significant trouble. However, it forfeits Kabutops's crucial ability to beat Tsareena and Mantine and also leaves it largely unable to dissuade Rotom-C and Toxicroak from taking advantage of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Stakataka and Mudsdale take a pittance from Kabutops's common attacks and can use Toxic to prevent it from continually spinning away their Stealth Rock. Silvally-Steel, on the other hand, can use Toxic alongside Defog to prevent Kabutops from getting Stealth Rock up. Sandaconda also performs well, as it can cripple Kabutops with Glare and OHKO it with Earthquake after Rocky Helmet chip, so a lucky Sandaconda could come away from the exchange with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Dhelmise can block Rapid Spin, take Kabutops's attacks reasonably well, and use its own Rapid Spin to clear away Kabutops's Stealth Rock. However, Stone Edge has a slight chance to 2HKO Dhelmise if it has no Defense investment. Tsareena is also equipped with Rapid Spin and can attempt to stall Kabutops out of Stone Edges with Synthesis, but it cannot switch in safely for fear of a 2HKO. Vileplume walls Kabutops and can defeat it with Giga Drain or render it useless with Sleep Powder or Effect Spore. Rotom-C can neutralize Kabutops with Trick or Will-O-Wisp and potentially clear its Stealth Rock with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Silvally-Ground</strong>: Barring Liquidation, Kabutops has nothing to effectively hit Silvally-Ground, which can proceed to begin a sweep by setting up against it with Swords Dance and possibly Flame Charge.</p>",

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Knock Off is a multifaceted tool for Kabutops, being its best way of making progress against defensive Pokemon such as Diancie and Mudsdale that rely on Leftovers and hitting Ghost-types such as Golurk and Doublade that may attempt to spinblock against it. Stone Edge is chosen over a Water-type attack because it gives Kabutops a way to threaten Tsareena, Mantine, and Dhelmise, all of which can otherwise wall and defeat Kabutops while preventing it from keeping up Stealth Rock. Stone Edge can also 2HKO common offensive Pokemon such as Rotom-C and Drapion, preventing them from setting up on Kabutops. Weak Armor lets Kabutops outspeed Tsareena after the latter Rapid Spins and helps it defeat Aerodactyl in the lead matchup.</p> <p>Offensive teammates especially weak to Stealth Rock, such as Acrobatics Ninjask and Focus Sash Salazzle, greatly appreciate Kabutops's ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field. Xatu can serve as additional support for these teammates, offering a backup form of hazard control against Pokemon such as Mudsdale that can keep Stealth Rock up against Kabutops or set the hazard easily once it faints. Xatu can also set up dual screens, which, in conjunction with Kabutops's Stealth Rock, can enable a myriad of powerful sweepers such as Salazzle, Decidueye, Toxicroak, and Kingdra. Kabutops's Knock Off support is especially appreciated by wallbreakers with similar checks such as Heliolisk and Tyrantrum. Lastly, Thwackey is an excellent yet very niche teammate for Kabutops, revenge killing Silvally-Ground and luring in Talonflame to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots, and together they can support dangerous Grassy Terrain-reliant sweepers such as Dhelmise and Uxie.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl's combination of Speed and good defensive typing is incredibly valuable for many teams, particularly offensive ones by providing them with a fast check to offensive Fire-types like Talonflame and Salazzle. Its utility goes beyond its Speed and defensive use, though; Aerodactyl can support its team as a Stealth Rock setter with a positive Xatu matchup or opt for Toxic to cripple the plethora of bulky Ground-types in NU, including Mudsdale, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Alternatively, Dragon Dance sets make Aerodactyl's average Attack more than enough to clean through weakened defensive checks like Mudsdale, Vaporeon, and Vileplume, and revenge killers like Rotom-C become inadequate. Aerodactyl is very easy to revenge kill with Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C, Passimian, and Heliolisk if lacking a Speed boost, though, and without significant chip damage, getting by checks like Mudsdale, Vaporeon, and Weezing can be an impossible task. Aerodactyl also faces notable competition from Talonflame, which fills a similar role as a fast Flying-type with useful defensive utility, and Tyrantrum, an even more potent Rock-type sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wallbreaker sets with Choice Band or Life Orb can make good use of Aerodactyl's coverage options and natural Speed, with Life Orb still allowing it to run Roost to offensively answer certain foes. However, these sets require better entry hazard control than Aerodactyl's more common ones. Aerodactyl can also run a lead set on hyper offense teams with Stealth Rock / Rock Blast / Taunt / Earthquake and a Focus Sash to guarantee its entry hazard and beat Froslass, a common lead on such teams. Hone Claws is another option for setup sets, and it makes Stone Edge perfectly accurate, but the Speed boost from Dragon Dance is crucial against Choice Scarf users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Quagsire shuts down any attempts at sweeping from Aerodactyl thanks to Unaware, whereas Mudsdale and Gastrodon must be severely weakened for Aerodactyl to ever pose a threat to them. Silvally-Ground's natural bulk is just enough to let it check Aerodactyl in a pinch and revenge kill it with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Foes like Vileplume, Weezing, and Vaporeon don't resist Aerodactyl's attacks, but their natural bulk and utility moves are enough to let them handle it even when boosted. Before boosting, bulky attackers like Alolan Exeggutor, Passimian, and Escavalier force out Aerodactyl because of its lacking power and bulk.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: If Aerodactyl can't secure a boost, then foes like Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Tyrantrum, and Passimian can revenge kill it because of its poor bulk. Rotom-C, Tyrantrum, and Passimian even possess enough bulk to take a boosted Stone Edge and KO it in return if necessary, though Rotom-C must be at full.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's good Xatu matchup in addition to its Stone Edge heavily pressuring other entry hazard removers like Rotom-C, Tsareena, and Mantine make it a solid offensive Stealth Rock setter. However, its ability to lure in and poison bulky Ground-types like Gastrodon and Mudsdale with Toxic is also valuable, with Roost further amplifying its supportive presence and letting it consistently check Talonflame and Salazzle. None of Aerodactyl's abilities are too helpful, but Pressure can help stall out certain moves from weaker attackers, such as Sylveon's Moonblast. Unnerve has niche use against the occasional Shuca Berry Toxicroak or Stakataka, but neither is very common.</p> <p>Aerodactyl cedes a lot of momentum to foes like Mudsdale, Vileplume, and Weezing; pairing it with strong special attackers like Exploud, Salazzle, and Choice Specs Decidueye is a good way to minimize that momentum loss with double switches. Aerodactyl is good at drawing in and weakening physically defensive foes, with Toxic variants being even better at crippling bulky Ground-types. Setup sweepers like Snorlax and Silvally-Ground benefit immensely from this, especially in matchups against Quagsire. Aerodactyl is very likely to end up being burned by Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp if it keeps switching into Talonflame; clerics like Vaporeon and Sylveon are useful to remove the status infliction. Grass-types like Rotom-C and Dhelmise are also good teammates; they pressure bulky Water- and Ground-types that Aerodactyl struggles with, while it takes on Fire- and Flying-types.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aqua Tail makes beating certain Ground-types such as Mudsdale, Silvally-Ground, and Rhydon easier, whereas Dual Wingbeat hits Fighting- and Grass-types like Scrafty, Passimian, Alolan Exeggutor, and Dhelmise. Roost gives Aerodactyl more utility before setting up, making use of its ability to check foes like Salazzle and Talonflame and letting it more safely throw out attacks before attempting a sweep. However, a coverage move is usually preferred. A Jolly nature is preferred to let Aerodactyl outrun foes like Starmie, Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, and Choice Specs Inteleon before boosting, but Adamant offers more power, and only Choice Scarf Inteleon outspeeds Adamant Aerodactyl after Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Ground-types pose the biggest roadblock to Aerodactyl, especially Quagsire and Mudsdale, so attackers like Silvally-Ground, Choice Band Guzzlord, and Copperajah that can force damage onto or potentially KO them are fantastic partners. Aerodactyl can even attempt to wallbreak for Silvally-Ground instead, giving it a chance at sweeping after foes like Mudsdale, Weezing, and Vaporeon are weakened. Aerodactyl is prone to being statused by foes like Talonflame and Weezing; make sure to support it with a cleric like Sylveon or Vaporeon so it doesn't lose its ability to sweep late-game. Similarly, Aerodactyl's vulnerability to being revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C and Passimian before it boosts makes pairing it with defensive answers like Copperajah, Vileplume, and Weezing ideal.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Phenomenal bulk, good Attack, excellent coverage, and access to Curse make Snorlax a formidable setup sweeper in NU, capable of decimating many teams once afforded a chance to set up. Snorlax's longevity gives it the edge in many matchups, able to survive hits from powerful physical attackers like Tauros and Guzzlord with a few Defense boosts and healing with Rest. In addition, Snorlax finds setup chances often due to its great natural bulk turning defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, Sylveon, and Vaporeon into setup fodder. Even in matchups where sweeping is unlikely, this bulk and Body Slam's paralysis chance give Snorlax good general utility. However, Snorlax's reliance on Rest for recovery leaves it open to a variety of Pokemon that can stop its sweep. Its dismal Speed leaves it very vulnerable to item removal, status, and a slew of dangerous wallbreakers, all of which can force it to use Rest early or negate its sweeping potential entirely. On top of this, Snorlax's typing gives it almost no relevant defensive benefits, even if it opts to use Thick Fat, and gives it a very common and exploitable weakness in Fighting. Snorlax's sweeping ability can be highly matchup reliant, as it will rarely get past certain threats such as Vileplume, Golurk, Escavalier, and Diancie without the right coverage move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Darkest Lariat allows Snorlax to hit Golurk, Decidueye, and Psychic-types such as Xatu in the same moveslot, and it provides great neutral coverage. However, it comes at the cost of either super effective damage on Steel-types or the utility of Body Slam, making it a generally subpar option. Heavy Slam can be used to let Snorlax lure in Diancie, but it is rarely worthwhile because it targets little else of note. Snorlax can also surprise its checks with more offensive sets: Assault Vest increases Snorlax's coverage while retaining its special walling capabilities, Choice Band can hit traditional walls like Mudsdale, Diancie, and Escavalier very hard, and a set with three attacks, Protect or Rest, and Leftovers allows Snorlax to both increase its immediate offense and preserve its longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Toxicroak, Gallade, Scrafty, and Passimian can all force huge damage on Snorlax, even after it has begun to set up. The former two especially can OHKO Snorlax with Choice Band Close Combat, even after a Curse. Several physical attackers that naturally check Snorlax, such as Escavalier and Tauros, commonly run Close Combat to deal with it. Snorlax is also prone to being caught off guard by coverage moves such as Focus Blast from Heliolisk and Superpower from Copperajah, which 2HKO it on the switch or force it to use Rest early.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick users, including Rotom-C, can almost totally negate Snorlax's usefulness by locking it into one move. This prevents Snorlax from setting up, deprives it of valuable Leftovers recovery, and leaves it only able to fire off weak, unboosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Snorlax's extreme vulnerability while using Rest, any special attacker that can 3HKO it during that time threatens to stop a boosted Snorlax in its tracks. Very strong Choice Specs users like Exploud and Sylveon are notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Diancie and Mudsdale can use Snorlax to boost their Defense with Diamond Storm or Stamina and hit it with Body Press. Weezing can burn Snorlax, take advantage of its enormous HP with Pain Split, and shut it down with Taunt. Doublade can switch in and set up Swords Dance easily against Snorlax, forcing it out with the threat of Close Combat. Vileplume can disrupt Snorlax with Corrosive Gas and Strength Sap but falters against Fire Punch sets. Due to Unaware, Quagsire can completely prevent Snorlax from sweeping.</p>",

Fire Punch can be used instead to hit Escavalier and Grass-types such as Vileplume and Rotom-C, but it leaves Snorlax walled by dangerous Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Diancie, and Golurk. Immunity allows Snorlax to nullify Toxic from defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Mudsdale, lessening the need to use Rest often. Alternatively, Thick Fat can help Snorlax take Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Salazzle and Vanilluxe. The given EV spread maximizes Snorlax's mixed bulk, notably letting it avoid the 2HKO from Exploud's Focus Blast at full health. However, Snorlax's EVs are fairly customizable, especially if its team can adequately deal with these threats.</p> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon that can take on Fighting-types, such as Sylveon, Xatu, Talonflame, and Weezing, are excellent partners for Snorlax, and in return it can handle the special attackers that threaten them, such as Salazzle and Starmie.

Since Snorlax struggles to break through certain physical walls, particularly Diancie, Mudsdale, and Vileplume, wallbreakers such as Starmie, Silvally-Ground, and Duraludon are great teammates. Because Trick is so debilitating for Snorlax, it appreciates partners like the aforementioned Silvally-Ground and Choice item users such as Heliolisk, which are unaffected or mostly unbothered by Trick, respectively.</p>"

Defensively, though, Galarian Articuno often falls short. It's not a reliable check to Fighting- or Ground-types because of its poor physical bulk, and coverage attacks from the likes of Tsareena and Virizion limit its chances to switch in too. Galarian Articuno is also very prone to being statused by foes like Vileplume, Mudsdale, and Quagsire as it switches in to set Future Sight, which may force it to waste turns recovering health instead of pivoting or attacking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Galarian Articuno can run a sweeper set on hyper offense teams with Stored Power, Agility, and Weakness Policy, differentiating itself from Xatu with its superior natural power and strong secondary STAB attack in Hurricane.

A Choice Specs set makes great use of Galarian Articuno's spammable STAB attacks and puts extra pressure on generic special walls that may attempt to switch into it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Galarian Articuno itself is incapable of beating Steel-types such as Stakataka, Copperajah, and Escavalier. The former two can use it as setup fodder for Stealth Rock, while Escavalier can freely cripple the opponent's switch-in with Knock Off or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Guzzlord</strong>: Bulky Guzzlord both blocks Future Sight and is a solid switch-in to Galarian Articuno's Hurricane, avoiding even a 3HKO. It's quite slow, though, making it easy to exploit with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Sneasel, and Heliolisk easily outspeed and OHKO Galarian Articuno with their STAB attacks, although the latter requires some chip damage to consistently do so. Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch can also revenge kill a weakened Galarian Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Future Sight isn't set, Rock-types like Diancie, Tyrantrum, and Aerodactyl easily take on Galarian Articuno.

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu is a defensive pivot with Magic Bounce, meaning it can switch into and deny entry hazards and other harmful status moves and then follow up with Teleport to gain momentum. Most notably, Mudsdale fails to set up Stealth Rock, Vileplume cannot recover with Strength Sap, and other walls like Talonflame are unable to spread status. Xatu is great at checking Fighting- and Ground-types like Passimian, Silvally-Ground, and Mudsdale, and its expansive movepool lets it accomplish different roles or include additional coverage as needed. However, it often fails to excel in these roles. In particular, most Stealth Rock users like Stakataka, Diancie, and Rhydon carry strong STAB attacks that deter Xatu from switching in. These matchups show off Xatu's middling bulk and relevant weaknesses; while Xatu nets safe switches on certain moves with the right reads, it can fold to strong coverage like Passimian's Knock Off and +2 Silvally-Ground's Rock Slide. Even if Xatu is played well, it is still too passive to adequately deal with some offensive threats like Drapion, Starmie, and Grimmsnarl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu is customizable with its coverage and EVs. Night Shade provides consistent damage output from an otherwise weak Pokemon, whereas Heat Wave threatens Steel-types like Escavalier and Togedemaru. U-turn is an option over Teleport for faster pivoting, keeping Xatu safe from incoming attacks rather than its teammates. Future Sight and Teleport work together, especially if paired with Fighting-types like Passimian, which appreciate the extra firepower versus Poison-types and physical walls. Thunder Wave offers speed control and widens the pool of Pokemon that Xatu's Teleport can bring in to revenge kill the foe. At the cost of Teleport, Defog is warranted when Xatu is the team's only answer to entry hazards. Dazzling Gleam can be used to lure in and severely damage certain Dark-types like Guzzlord and Scrafty.</p> <p>Running no item allows Xatu to avoid Poltergeist while also weakening Knock Off. Eject Button gets Xatu off the field when entry hazard setters like Stakataka and Copperajah attack it, helping with pivoting and maintaining Magic Bounce's threat. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Xatu the ability to switch in unhindered if the team uses no other entry hazard control. Xatu may opt for a Bold nature and more Defense investment at the cost of reaching worse Speed tiers. With Bold, 16 Speed EVs let Xatu outspeed Golurk, while 64 Speed EVs outpace Adamant Tyrantrum. Extra bulk lets Xatu more effectively check some threats like Copperajah and Tsareena. Conversely, greater Speed investment can allow it to outspeed some mid-Speed wallbreakers like positive-nature Decidueye and neutral-nature Toxicroak.</p> <p>Dual screens are used on some hyper offense teams, largely thanks to Thunder Wave + Teleport creating safe setup opportunities. Xatu itself can be a setup sweeper with Cosmic Power + Stored Power, with Magic Bounce providing a necessary defense against Toxic. Alongside Cosmic Power, Weakness Policy can make Xatu much more threatening. Choice Scarf sets work mostly for the surprise factor and access to Trick: this move debilitates Xatu's defensive counters.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Offensive Rock-types like Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum break through Xatu with ease, and they can even afford to set up on it and tank its boosted Foul Play. Defensive Rock-types are a problem too, as Stakataka, Diancie, and Rhydon are Stealth Rock users that deter Xatu from coming in due to their STAB attacks; the former two also wall Xatu and outdamage the recovery from Roost with the perfectly accurate Gyro Ball and Moonblast, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Xatu struggles to deter Dark-types like Grimmsnarl, Guzzlord, and Drapion from switching in, relying on its ability to pivot into a strong teammate to avoid losing its team momentum.

However, itemless and Foul Play Xatu has more manageable matchups against them.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Sweepers</strong>: Many wallbreakers like Starmie, Exploud, and Duraludon can force out Xatu due to its passivity. Additionally, Swords Dance users like Silvally-Ground and Toxicroak can breeze past Xatu with little to no chip damage needed to score a KO.

Quagsire doesn't only stare down offensive threats, though, as it can pester many defensive Pokemon with moves like Encore, Toxic, and Yawn. While Quagsire is typically the go-to option to take on setup sweepers, its below-average stats leave it struggling to deal with strong wallbreakers such as Tauros, Choice Band Passimian, and Golurk. Quagsire also has to fear Grass-type coverage such as Power Whip from Copperajah and powerful Grass-types such as Rotom-C and Tsareena, which can come in on Quagsire very easily and force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots can help Quagsire pivot into threats, especially when facing Toxic Spikes, but the loss of Leftovers can make a lot of matchups more difficult than they need to be. Quagsire can viably run a Curse set, potentially even with Ice Punch or Avalanche to snipe incoming Grass-types, although special wallbreakers are far too common, and the set's initial damage output is far too low to be worth it in most cases. There are many other utility moves Quagsire can use, such as Yawn, Haze, and Infestation, but the ones listed in the main set are most useful overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Vileplume, Tsareena, Rotom-C, and Decidueye are all fairly common Grass-types that easily threaten an OHKO on Quagsire. Grass-type coverage like Power Whip from Copperajah and Grass Knot from Heliolisk also destroys Quagsire.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers that don't rely on setting up can cleave through Quagsire quite easily; Exploud, Sylveon, and Vanilluxe are all capable of coming in on Quagsire and threatening a near OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Despite its great defensive typing and ability, Quagsire's stats often leave much to be desired, meaning that entry hazards, status, and item removal can leave it overwhelmed by Pokemon it's meant to check. Some examples of Pokemon that do this effectively are Drapion with Knock Off, Salazzle with Toxic, and Spikers.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon that can muscle past Quagsire with raw power such as Passimian and Choice Band Golurk can be problematic if it is the sole physical wall on a team.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Sneasel's main qualities are its excellent Speed and wallbreaking potential enabled by its superb offensive typing. Sneasel outspeeds and threatens common metagame staples like Vileplume, Heliolisk, and Xatu and can use this chance to set up with Swords Dance. Despite having numerous useful offensive qualities, though, it sometimes lacks the power to break through teams even when boosted. This issue in particular can have major consequences; common defensive Pokemon like Escavalier, Sylveon, and Copperajah OHKO Sneasel if they manage to survive its hits. Sneasel's frailty and awful defensive typing hold it back, too. Common Pokemon like Talonflame, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Salazzle outspeed and threaten Sneasel with their STAB moves, making it harder to effectively sweep teams. Moreover, the former two can gain momentum by threatening Sneasel out and using U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band gives Sneasel immediate breaking power but leaves it more vulnerable to entry hazards. Low Kick can be used to immediately remove bulky Pokemon like Snorlax, Glastrier, and Copperajah at +2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Salazzle, and Inteleon outspeed and threaten to KO Sneasel.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Diancie and Sylveon both take a hit from Sneasel and force it out. Comfey can revenge kill Sneasel with priority Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Mantine can usually take a hit from Sneasel while threatening it back with a potential burn from Scald. Quagsire completely shuts down Sneasel thanks to Unaware and easily beats it one-on-one. Doublade cares little about Sneasel's Ice-type attacks and OHKOes back with Iron Head.

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine's excellent typing, good special bulk, and various utility options allow it to handle many of NU's top offensive and defensive Pokemon, such as Inteleon, Salazzle, Mudsdale, and Talonflame. Immunities to Ground and Water and a resistance to Fighting define Mantine's defensive presence, allowing it to come in on Choice-locked threats such as Passimian and Golurk and pivot well against other defensive Water-types such as Quagsire. Mantine's Scald and Toxic ensure it isn't overly passive, and it can more easily check physical attackers such as Silvally-Ground and Copperajah by crippling them with a burn. In addition, Mantine is not a sitting duck against traditional Water-type answers such as Toxicroak, Heliolisk, and Vileplume; its access to Hurricane and ability to easily fit Toxic set it apart from Vaporeon, which cannot viably run much to circumvent these checks due to its more restricted moveslots. However, Mantine's physical bulk is less than impressive, allowing threats such as Golurk and Tauros to easily muscle past it with the right coverage. Mantine is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off from many of the physical attackers it wants to pivot into, as its Stealth Rock weakness means it struggles even more to take hits after losing its item. Finally, though Mantine seems like it would be a good Defog user, it has difficulty effectively removing hazards because it is threatened by most of the tier's common Stealth Rock setters: Diancie and Stakataka can defeat it with their Rock-type STAB attacks, and Copperajah can muscle through it with Rock Slide and Power Whip.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Slash can be used over Hurricane for a far more reliable Flying-type STAB move, but it is much weaker, notably against Vileplume and Passimian. Haze can be used over Toxic or Defog to help Mantine deal with setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Snorlax more easily, but it can generally deal with these Pokemon regardless. Water Veil makes Mantine immune to Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp and is especially good on teams that already possess good Water-type counterplay, but Water Absorb is usually preferred to beat Inteleon even more consistently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-C and Heliolisk can switch into Mantine and gain momentum with Volt Switch as Mantine is forced out, and Heliolisk is also immune to Scald. However, both of these Pokemon dislike Toxic, and Rotom-C is hit fairly hard by Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic forces Mantine to use Roost and switch out constantly to avoid taking major damage, which can rack up quickly with Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots has been removed. As such, Mantine needs to be careful when attempting to switch into defensive Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Mudsdale, and Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: The vast majority of physical attackers have little trouble breaking past Mantine due to its low physical bulk. For example, Choice Band Passimian can 2HKO Mantine with Rock Slide. Poltergeist users such as Golurk and Decidueye prey on Mantine due to its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots. Other strong attackers like Tsareena, Grimmsnarl, and Toxicroak can easily 2HKO Mantine as well, while Snorlax can use it as setup fodder. However, all of these Pokemon bar Snorlax are threatened by Hurricane or Scald.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Several physical attackers that Mantine checks, namely Escavalier and Passimian, carry Knock Off to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Very powerful special attackers, such as Sylveon and Exploud, can easily 2HKO Mantine with their STAB moves. These Pokemon all have respectable special bulk as well and can therefore switch directly into Mantine if needed. Starmie can heal off Hurricane damage and nearly OHKO Mantine with Thunderbolt.</p>",

Toxic allows Mantine to cripple defensive Pokemon like Vaporeon, Guzzlord, and opposing Mantine. If these threats are accounted for elsewhere, Defog can be used to allow Mantine to remove hazards, especially if it can manage to weaken the opposing Stealth Rock setter with a Scald burn. The given EVs allow Mantine to outspeed Adamant Golurk and maximize its physical bulk. Mantine can also run spreads with more special bulk if desired in order to take on Salazzle more easily.</p> <p>If it is not running Defog, Mantine appreciates partners such as Tsareena and Dhelmise that can remove Stealth Rock in case it has to take a Knock Off. These Grass-types also check Heliolisk and Golurk and appreciate Mantine's ability to deal with Fire-types. Mantine is a shaky check to Fighting-types on its own, so partners like Sylveon, Talonflame, and Xatu that can handle them are much appreciated; the former can additionally support Mantine with Heal Bell, while the latter can keep hazards off the field with Magic Bounce. Because Mantine is so vulnerable to Volt Switch users, partners that can absorb Volt Switch like Silvally-Ground, Togedemaru, and Mudsdale are necessary. The aforementioned Ground-types also take on Rock-types such as Tyrantrum, and Mantine absorbs Water-type attacks aimed at them. Bulky Steel-types, such as Copperajah and Stakataka, are greatly appreciated to handle powerful special attackers like Sylveon and Exploud that can overwhelm Mantine, and Mantine can pivot into the Fire- and Ground-type moves that threaten them.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra has insane late-game potential thanks to how strong its Sniper-boosted critical hits are. The amount of Pokemon in NU that can contend with Kingdra's Water + Dragon coverage is low, and the amount that can meaningfully threaten Kingdra in return is even lower. Kingdra suffers, though, from taking multiple turns to fully set up, which gives the opponent a bit of time to prevent it from taking the game over. Additionally, many of the Pokemon it'd like to set up against, namely Vaporeon, Talonflame, and Arcanine, commonly run Toxic, which severely compromises its ability to clean late-game. Lastly, despite being one of the few offensive checks to Inteleon and Starmie, Kingdra offers very little defensively compared to other Water- and Dragon-types like Vaporeon, Alolan Exeggutor, and Guzzlord, meaning it requires a good amount of defensive teambuilding support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs sets possess immense power, can provide pivot support with Flip Turn, and fit well on rain teams, but both Inteleon and Starmie are better dedicated wallbreakers, and rain teams aren't very consistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sylveon</strong>: Bulky Sylveon variants can stomach a critical hit from Surf and retaliate with Moonblast or Hyper Voice, the latter having a decent chance to OHKO Kingdra and bypassing Substitute. Even offensive variants can easily survive an attack from Kingdra and OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Despite being setup fodder for Kingdra, Vaporeon and Mantine can cripple it with Toxic and stall out turns and Draco Meteors by spamming their recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Kingdra isn't very strong nor fast before it boosts, and its bulk isn't very great; therefore, Pokemon like Rotom-C, Decidueye, and Silvally-Ghost can give it issues because Kingdra can't OHKO them without a critical hit, is slower than them without an Agility boost, and takes significant damage from their attacks, making it hard to safely set up when faced with such foes. Additionally, priority users like Choice Band Sneasel and Toxicroak can revenge kill Kingdra regardless of if it uses Agility.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hit-immune Foes</strong>: Shell Armor Escavalier counters Kingdra because of its bulk and can remove Kingdra's Scope Lens with Knock Off. Battle Armor Drapion is a much shakier answer, since Draco Meteor KOes it after Stealth Rock, but it can also weaken Kingdra's damage output with Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The combination of Focus Energy and Scope Lens ensures Kingdra can always critically hit, letting it ignore the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor. Alongside Agility, this severely limits overall counterplay to Kingdra once it sets up. Alternatively, Kingdra can use Substitute to avoid Toxics from Vaporeon, guaranteeing that Kingdra wins one-on-one. A Modest nature is used to guarantee an OHKO on Drapion after Stealth Rock and because Timid isn't necessary thanks to Agility.</p> <p>Because Kingdra has very few answers after boosting, much of the support it requires is related to easing setup. Dual screens from Xatu is one way to do this, making it harder for powerful attackers like Toxicroak and Heliolisk to take Kingdra out. Similarly, pivots like Talonflame and Arcanine that draw in Water-types help provide Kingdra with good setup opportunities. Sylveon is one of the few foes that Kingdra can't OHKO even with a critical hit; teammates like Scrafty and Passimian that can force damage onto it and push it into OHKO range are helpful as a result. Entry hazard support also works to force chip damage onto Pokemon that can stomach a hit, with Pokemon like Diancie, Copperajah, and Garbodor being good hazard setters.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrain teams rely on Sceptile as an Unburden Swords Dance sweeper. Sceptile's speed is unmatched once Unburden is activated, and it excels as a sweeper because it has the coverage to deal with traditional Grass-type checks like Vileplume and Talonflame. That said, sturdier Grass-type checks like Weezing, Escavalier, and Arcanine are much harder for Sceptile to sweep past, and phazers like Guzzlord foil its one-time Unburden boost. Sceptile is also not that strong, and as a result, it heavily relies on safe setup opportunities and super effective coverage for a chance to sweep. Without either of these two, Sceptile struggles to make a meaningful difference versus some defensive cores; walls like Talonflame, Guzzlord, and Garbodor easily prevent sweeps when Sceptile lacks adequate coverage for them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sceptile could go for more Speed investment over bulk to outrun threats like Silvally-Ground and Toxicroak without the Unburden boost. However, the likelihood that Sceptile will need the extra Speed is low, whereas the extra bulk allows extra setup opportunities like avoiding the 2HKO from Sylveon's Hyper Voice and the OHKO from Mantine's Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage. Substitute may net additional Sword Dance boosts against status users like Mudsdale and Quagsire, but the lack of another attack exasperates Sceptile's coverage issues, usually making it more harm than help.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Weezing is the hardest counter for Sceptile to muster through, as it is simply too bulky to be threatened by +2 Acrobatics. Other Poison-types like Vileplume and Garbodor are a problem if Sceptile lacks the coverage for them or lacks a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Arcanine's Intimidate and great bulk make it a tough foe for Sceptile to go up against. Talonflame is tough too if Sceptile forgoes Rock Slide, as Flame Body and Wil-O-Wisp shut down any attempt at sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Escavalier</strong>: Most walls struggle to take Sceptile's strong coverage, and if they can, they usually cannot KO it. Escavalier is the exception, as its typing, solid bulk, and nuclear Megahorn make it a hard counter to Sceptile.</p> <p><strong>Guzzlord</strong>: Even with Low Kick, physically defensive Guzzlord survives any +2 hit from Sceptile and phazes it with Dragon Tail. However, a worn-down or sleeping Guzzlord might not be as reliable at preventing sweeps.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Sceptile will often sustain considerable damage when setting up, which is a problem when compounded by entry hazards and status. Rocky Helmet Xatu and Toxic Mudsdale are bulky enough to trade hits with Sceptile and effectively prevent long-term sweeps.</p>",

Earthquake also works to hit Steel- and Poison-types like Stakataka and Garbodor, but it shouldn't be ran on Grassy Terrain teams. Drain Punch is another Fighting-type attack worth considering for its recovery, but the power drop off is noticeable; at +2, Sceptile fails to reliably OHKO Stakataka and never OHKOes Guzzlord.

They also complement Sceptile in their unique ways: Pincurchin sets Spikes to put Vileplume in range of a +2 Acrobatics, and Thwackey brings Sceptile on the field safely with U-turn and boosts Leaf Blade. Other Terrain sweepers such as Alolan Raichu and Cosmic Power Xatu complement Sceptile by dealing with Talonflame and Weezing.

Even options that switch into Ninjask, like Copperajah and Mudsdale, fear repeated U-turn damage and the threats that use such opportunities to come in. However, Ninjask's average Attack leaves a lot to be desired, and it will struggle to break through bulkier teams without a hefty helping of team support. Furthermore, Ninjask's terrible bulk gives it very limited opportunities to set up, as it will take massive damage even from uninvested attacks. Lastly, the use of Acrobatics precludes Ninjask from wearing Heavy-Duty Boots, requiring Ninjask users to run steady entry hazard removal to keep it in play throughout the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ninjask can opt to use Dual Wingbeat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Doing so greatly relieves the pressure to keep entry hazards off, making Ninjask easier to fit on teams and use. However, doing so sacrifices a lot of power, and Ninjask's sweeping potential and ability to force switches will sharply drop as a result.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock Users</strong>: Stealth Rock users like Diancie, Mudsdale, and Copperajah realistically won't drop to Acrobatics even with prior damage and easily take the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, making it hard for Ninjask to come in in the future. They also easily KO Ninjask with STAB moves or coverage.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Rock-types and Steel-types</strong>: Rock-types and Steel-types like Tyrantrum, Aerodactyl, Stakataka, and Escavalier use their STAB moves and coverage to force Ninjask to retreat while taking little from U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Flame Body and Intimidate users like bulky Talonflame and Arcanine can safely switch into Ninjask's unboosted attacks and proceed to threaten it with OHKOs or status. Furthermore, their slower pivoting options in U-turn and Teleport allow them to grab momentum from Ninjask. Note that Talonflame needs to be wary of a KO from +2 Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Users of Rocky Helmet or Aftermath such as Garbodor and Xatu can tack massive amounts of damage on Ninjask as it attacks, further reducing its ability to come in with Stealth Rock on the field. The extra damage also greatly hampers Ninjask's ability to sweep, as setting up becomes more dangerous and it becomes more susceptible to priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak users such as Arcanine, Toxicroak, and Decidueye can give Ninjask quite the headache, as its terrible bulk means it has a hard time enduring such moves.

However, Sableye's reliance on Prankster moves makes it a sitting duck against Dark-types such as Guzzlord and Scrafty, which can also shrug off Knock Off damage.

Furthermore, unlike other wallbreakers with a somewhat average Speed tier, Absol's access to Sucker Punch gives it extra security against frail revenge killers like Salazzle, Heliolisk, and Starmie. Defensively, though, Absol offers very little despite its typing being passable; it just lacks the bulk to make use of its resistances to Ghost and Dark as much as its main competition in Guzzlord, which is much bulkier and has an even better defensive typing. As a result, Absol also struggles getting into battle without aggressive play and pivot support, limiting the amount of chances it has to wallbreak. Absol also can have a rough time dealing with foes like Diancie, Sylveon, and Mudsdale if it lacks the proper coverage move or chance to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psycho Cut has good synergy with Super Luck and targets Toxicroak as well as other Fighting-types that may try pivoting into Knock Off, although Iron Tail is a vastly superior option if you desire more coverage. Focus Sash on dual screens teams works to guarantee Absol a Swords Dance boost. Choice Band sets cannot switch between moves but have great raw power and lack the constant chip damage of Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Toxicroak is one of the better offensive checks to Absol because it resists Dark and Fighting and easily dispatches Absol with Drain Punch. Other Fighting-types like Scrafty and Passimian can deal with Absol too, but they're much more vulnerable to Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mudsdale has the raw bulk to take multiple attacks from Absol and beat it one-on-one with Earthquake. Vileplume is a shakier answer, needing to be at full health to contend with Absol, but can take two Knock Offs and recover health back with Strength Sap. Arcanine detests losing its Heavy-Duty Boots, but its bulk combined with Intimidate lets it easily wall Absol.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon and Diancie are both good Knock Off switch-ins that threaten to KO Absol with their STAB attacks.

However, Swords Dance is still a great alternative that gives Absol more late-game potential and can severely limit offensive answers to it with the threat of +2 Sucker Punch. Do note, though, that because of how fragile Absol is, Iron Tail's miss chance is even more punishing and it's very hard to find good setup opportunities with Swords Dance. A Jolly nature is usually advised so Absol always outpaces Decidueye and Adamant Toxicroak, but Adamant lets it always OHKO Heliolisk with Sucker Punch and lowers the amount of chip damage necessary to secure a KO against other revenge killers like Salazzle.</p> <p>Because of Absol's poor defenses, it greatly appreciates the support of pivots to get it in safely. Xatu, Talonflame, and Rotom-C are some of the best available; Xatu's slow Teleport is particularly nice for guaranteeing safe entry, and Talonflame can help handle Sylveon for Absol. Additionally, Rotom-C is great at getting Absol in against Dhelmise and Guzzlord. Absol's ability to force damage onto Fairy-types works well alongside late-game cleaners like Ninjask and Choice Scarf Passimian, with all of these options also supplying Absol with pivot support.

Grass-types like Dhelmise, Tsareena, and Alolan Exeggutor can be problematic for Gastrodon, and it has to be worried about Grass-type coverage like Power Whip Copperajah and Grass Knot Heliolisk. Gastrodon's also quite weak, letting bulky setup sweepers like Snorlax and Scrafty completely take advantage of it, even shrugging off Toxic. Additionally, while Gastrodon's ability and typing make it a great wall, powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Exploud and Vanilluxe can expose its only-average bulk. Gastrodon also faces stiff competition from other bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Vaporeon, which are less susceptible to coverage moves from Pokemon they check.</p>",

Curse sets can make Gastrodon a decent offensive Pokemon with moves like Waterfall and Earthquake but remain outclassed by Snorlax, which is immune to Toxic and is a better defensive option to fall back on. Clear Smog helps against bulky setup sweepers like Snorlax and Scrafty.

On top of that, Toxicroak only needs minimal chip damage to finish off bulkier builds or clean up against offense ones thanks to its priority Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave. Toxicroak's main problems lie in its frailty, especially when coupled with Life Orb, giving it a hard time getting onto the field and setting up safely.

Choice Scarf sets are possible because of Toxicroak's great coverage and boosted Speed tier, letting it revenge kill foes like Salazzle, Nasty Plot Rotom-C, and Talonflame, but Toxicroak becomes a ton easier to take advantage of after locking into a move, and it's much weaker if it can't boost its offensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale will almost always stop a sweep, reliably tanking multiple hits in conjunction with Stamina, although sets with Low Kick can KO it.

Golurk can also help against Copperajah, and Toxicroak easily deals with Vaporeon, which otherwise easily scouts Rotom-C with Protect. Setup Grass-types like Decidueye and opposing Rotom-C can take advantage of Rotom-C locking into Leaf Storm, so checks to them like Assault Vest Copperajah, Drapion, and Guzzlord are necessary teammates.</p>"

Since Rotom-C is one of NU's most consistent pivots, it pairs well with other pivots like Talonflame, Silvally-Ground, and Passimian. Talonflame also switches into U-turns from foes like Ninjask, and it can bring Rotom-C in against Diancie. Rotom-C is poor at keeping Stealth Rock off the field against Copperajah; strong physical wallbreakers like Passimian, Golurk, and Guzzlord help mitigate this issue.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gigalith is the sole viable sand setter, enabling Sand Rush users like Sandslash and Lycanroc and racking up chip damage against defensive staples like Xatu, Sylveon, and Talonflame, as well as the opponent's team in general. Gigalith's great all-around defensive stats allow it multiple opportunities to set up sand. Furthermore, it can check Salazzle and Talonflame while having utility with moves like Stealth Rock and Toxic. However, its abysmal Speed usually means it must take a hit before moving. When combined with damage on the switch, status, and no reliable recovery, Gigalith can be worn down deceptively quickly, especially since it's weak to STAB or coverage moves from Pokemon such as Toxicroak, Exploud, and Diancie. Gigalith is also difficult to teambuild around due to almost exclusively fitting on dedicated sand teams, and these teams demand extensive support to execute a successful sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy Slam can punish defensive Sylveon for trying to stall out sand turns and heavily damage other Fairy-types like Diancie and Comfey. Explosion deals huge damage to most neutral targets and can keep up momentum for sand builds at the cost of sacrificing Gigalith.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Scrafty, Passimian, Gallade, and Toxicroak can massively damage Gigalith with their STAB moves and force it out. However, Toxicroak can be OHKOed by Earthquake after taking damage from Stealth Rock and sand.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon does not take much damage from any of Gigalith's attacks and can use it to pass Wish to its teammates, fish for burns with Scald, or remove status with Heal Bell. More offensive Water-types, like Starmie and Kingdra, can avoid the 2HKO from any of its attacks and use it as a chance to start wallbreaking or set up; however, the combination of Toxic poison and sand damage severely limits their sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vileplume's immunity to Toxic and great defensive stats mean it can easily recover from any of Gigalith's attacks via Strength Sap, whittle it down with Giga Drain, or even use it as setup fodder. Tsareena and Dhelmise can easily use Rapid Spin against it, while Decidueye can set up Swords Dance on it, but all of them dislike taking Toxic upon switching in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale and Palossand can cripple Gigalith with Toxic and set up Stealth Rock freely, while offensive Ground-types, like Golurk, Silvally-Ground, and Rhydon, can switch in on any of Gigalith's moves and fire off a powerful attack. None of them appreciate taking Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Although Gigalith does not mind paralysis due to its already terrible Speed, its longevity is severely hampered by poison and burn, with the latter also hurting its ability to damage Xatu as it switches in.

However, Scrafty is completely countered by defensive Sylveon, which makes it deadweight in that fairly common matchup. Additionally, it can be a sitting duck for the tier's many threatening Fighting-types and requires a lot of team support to make up for the switch-in opportunities it often gives Passimian and Toxicroak. It also struggles with other defensive staples such as Mantine and Vileplume and is generally slow to make progress.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Throat Chop is a niche option to defeat defensive Hyper Voice Sylveon; however, Scrafty sacrifices tons of utility by dropping Knock Off, and many Sylveons run Moonblast to bypass this. A Dragon Dance set with Knock Off, Close Combat, and Iron Head seems appealing at first glance, but Scrafty's low speed leaves it outsped by Talonflame, Salazzle, and every Choice Scarf user even after a boost; faster Choice Scarf users like Heliolisk can outspeed it even after two Speed boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon's access to recovery makes it a very reliable answer that can wall Scrafty all game long. Diancie is neutral to Fighting and lacks recovery, making it less effective, but it still forces Scrafty out with the threat of a faster Moonblast. More niche Fairy-types like Comfey and Ribombee can shut Scrafty down just as effectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Toxicroak, Gallade, and Passimian can switch into both of Scrafty's STAB attacks and force it out with their powerful Fighting-type attacks even if Scrafty has a Defense boost or two. However, they generally lack recovery, which can allow Scrafty to outlast them, particularly if it has Spikes support.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Mantine's Hurricane never 2HKOes, but it takes little damage from Scrafty's attacks and is faster, making it favored in that matchup. Defensive variants of Talonflame struggle against Scrafty due to Bulk Up, but offensive Talonflame and Braviary can threaten it even after a boost, while Taunt can also allow defensive Talonflame to emerge victorious.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Although they cannot switch directly into it, Trick users such as Choice Scarf Rotom-Mow can cripple Scrafty and prevent it from sweeping in most situations.</p>",

Rest restores Scrafty's HP to full and has good synergy with Shed Skin; this can prevent opposing wallbreakers from safely entering the field to threaten Scrafty on an anticipated use of Rest. 92 Speed EVs let Scrafty outspeed Jolly Copperajah and Glastrier and help it take on Vaporeon.</p> <p>Garbodor is an excellent partner for Scrafty; it can force out Sylveon, check Fighting-types, and set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to weaken the opposing team.

Garbodor can also check Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Passimian thanks to its good bulk, defensive typing, and ability Aftermath. Sadly, Garbodor's stats make it hard to keep up with wallbreakers like Copperajah, Tyrantrum, and Choice Band Guzzlord, whose STAB attacks it doesn't resist, and because of how prominent Spikes-immune entry hazard removers like Xatu, Rotom-C, and Talonflame are, its usefulness can often be minimal outside of disrupting teams with item removal or poison spreading. Additionally, it's very difficult to justify using Garbodor over other Fighting-resistant Pokemon and bulky Poison-types like Xatu, Talonflame, and Vileplume on teams that don't need Spikes support, which limits how easy it is to slot on teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes can be useful in certain matchups, but the ubiquity of grounded Poison-types in addition to entry hazard removers that are immune to them heavily limits their overall usefulness. Drain Punch gives Garbodor even more longevity and still hits Copperajah and Tyrantrum for decent damage, although its overall coverage is inferior to Stomping Tantrum. Offensive sets can more easily bypass Xatu to force Spikes up but offer much less to teams overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Moves</strong>: Although Garbodor can cripple them by removing their item or poisoning them, Ground-types like Mudsdale and Golurk still switch into it relatively freely and threaten with Earthquake. Similarly, physical attackers that commonly carry Earthquake like Aerodactyl, Drapion, and Toxicroak can easily bypass Garbodor too.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Garbodor's damage output isn't significant enough to threaten Xatu unless it poisons Xatu with Gunk Shot. Otherwise, Xatu can freely switch into it and bounce back Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Even when invested in, Garbodor's bulk isn't great enough to stand in the face of foes like Copperajah, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Alolan Exeggutor. Even Fighting-types like Choice Band Passimian and Gallade can brute force their way through Garbodor; it can only hope to trade KOs with them.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Garbodor's lackluster special bulk when uninvested leaves it quickly overwhelmed by Pokemon like Heliolisk, Starmie, and Salazzle.

Cursed Body can be quite useful into Choice-locked attackers and Pokemon with a single attack, especially with Jellicent's Taunt, but Water Absorb's utility in the tier is unmatched and gives Jellicent a lot of its viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Faster Grass-types like Alolan Exeggutor, Decidueye, and Tsareena threaten an OHKO with their powerful STAB moves and also have pivoting moves to take advantage of threatening Jellicent out.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk is immune to both of Jellicent's STAB moves, and Rotom-C easily comes in and gains momentum off Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-types</strong>: Jellicent may effectively shut down defensive Water-types like Vaporeon and Mantine, but it cannot effectively threaten stronger and faster ones like Inteleon and Starmie, and they both boast super effective coverage.</p>",

Scald + Toxic lets Jellicent spread status as effectively as possible and gives it the best matchup versus opposing bulky Water-types, whereas Will-O-Wisp + Hex lets it threaten Toxicroak as well as walls like Sylveon and Vileplume. Note, however, that each combination struggles with a different group of checks to bulky Water-types. 76 Speed EVs let Jellicent outpace even Jolly Copperajah and Glastrier, both of which can be quite threatening if not burned. A Colbur Berry lets Jellicent serve as a reliable switch-in to Fighting-types like Passimian, Toxicroak, and Gallade, even if they use Knock Off. This also lets Jellicent attempt to status Dark-types like Drapion and Guzzlord once before switching out, making it easier for its partners to manage them.</p> <p>Jellicent is quite proficient at shutting down defensively oriented teams, making it a great partner for Pokemon that need a little help getting past those teams like Choice Scarf Rotom-C and Heliolisk. In return, these Pokemon do quite well into the offensive teams Jellicent struggles against. Jellicent appreciates Vileplume's defensive qualities as both a Grass- and Electric-resistant Pokemon and a sturdy Knock Off switch-in. While very good at spreading status, Jellicent's vulnerability to it from faster Pokemon it cannot use Taunt on such as Toxic Mantine and Arcanine makes clerics like Sylveon and Diancie great partners. In return, Jellicent takes on Steel- and Poison-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Stunfisk makes use of its helpful typing and amazing natural bulk to be quite the wall, taking on metagame staples such as Sylveon, Exploud, and Rotom-C. It offers a lot of role compression to a team, boasting the highly coveted Steel typing, Stealth Rock, and a Volt Switch immunity. These traits allow for more offensive teambuilding with less regard for defensive integrity, as Galarian Stunfisk ticks a lot of boxes for what a team needs defensively by itself. Offensively, though, Galarian Stunfisk's attacking stats leave much to be desired, letting Pokemon with reliable recovery and decent natural bulk such as Xatu, Mantine, and Vileplume exploit Galarian Stunfisk for as long as they'd like. Wallbreakers such as Gallade, Silvally-Ground, and Starmie can also switch into Galarian Stunfisk without fear of taking too much damage, and they can threaten an OHKO or lasting damage due to Galarian Stunfisk's lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Galarian Stunfisk can dig deep into its utility movepool to fill its last moveslot, although the listed options often outclass other possibilities. Stone Edge can be used to pressure opposing Flying-types such as Mantine, Xatu, and Talonflame, although you'd find the damage output quite disappointing. Scald targets opposing Ground-types such as Silvally-Ground and Golurk, doing solid damage while also having a chance to burn them. Yawn in conjunction with Snap Trap can be a nasty combo, forcing an unsuspecting Pokemon to sleep. Even Yawn by itself can be great for making the foe switch and take Stealth Rock damage, which lets Galarian Stunfisk procure Leftovers recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Passimian, Virizion, and Gallade can come in on Galarian Stunfisk relatively safely and threaten an OHKO or close to one. Even Toxicroak, despite its weakness to Earthquake, can take one hit and use Swords Dance and Drain Punch to effectively beat Galarian Stunfisk one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Silvally-Ground, Mudsdale, and Golurk can very easily shrug off Galarian Stunfisk's weak attacks and respond with heavy damage or an OHKO, and they're often direct competition for the Ground-type slot on a teams.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Mantine, Gastrodon, and Starmie can all easily take Galarian Stunfisk's attacks and retaliate with a super effective Water-type move while having the reliable recovery to consistently do so. Offensive Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon make Galarian Stunfisk fall short as a special wall, boasting powerful Hydro Pumps to threaten an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers using Substitute or Rest can take advantage of Galarian Stunfisk's passivity and set up in its face, such as Glastrier, Curse Snorlax, and Bulk Up Scrafty.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's Magic Bounce ability and immunity to Earthquake let it pivot around Galarian Stunfisk, with its only fear being a mildly annoying Sludge Bomb poison.</p>",

Protect allows Galarian Stunfisk to scout its foes' moves while also gaining some HP with Leftovers. This can be especially useful against Rotom-C, which often attempts to debilitate Galarian Stunfisk with Trick. Alternatively, Thunder Wave allows Galarian Stunfisk to support its teammates by slowing down potential switch-ins such as Passimian and Alolan Exeggutor, while Foul Play hits physical attackers like Dhelmise and Golurk for great damage and punishes setup attempts from Swords Dance Silvally-Ground and Decidueye. Pain Split is another option to somewhat extend Galarian Stunfisk's longevity, although its massive HP stat often means it doesn't gain large pools of HP from using the move.</p> <p>Thanks to Galarian Stunfisk compressing defensive roles, common offense staples such as Inteleon and Heliolisk can be used in conjunction with each other, and Pokemon like Diancie and Duraludon can run non-Stealth Rock sets. Despite the ways Galarian Stunfisk assists more offensive teammates, it also appreciates clerical support from Vaporeon and Sylveon, along with their respective Water and Fighting resistances. Additional Fighting- and Ground-type checks like Mantine, Talonflame, and Vileplume appreciate their defensive synergy with Galarian Stunfisk.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Druddigon's claim to fame is Mold Breaker Stealth Rock, which completely ignores Xatu's Magic Bounce and punishes opposing teams that rely on it to keep Stealth Rock off the field. Additionally, it's a great team disruptor with Dragon Tail and status moves and can soft check a plethora of foes, including Salazzle, offensive Talonflame, and Scrafty. It also enables other common Stealth Rock setters like Diancie and Copperajah to use other, more offensive sets. However, Druddigon struggles to be a consistent check to wallbreakers with STAB attacks it doesn't resist, such as Copperajah, Tauros, and Choice Specs Starmie, and its poor Speed means other wallbreakers like Choice Specs Sylveon and Exploud are seldom threatened by it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sheer Force sets make use of Druddigon's incredible coverage options and can help it lure in and remove Fairy-types like Diancie and Sylveon. However, Druddigon is very slow and reliant on prediction, unlike other wallbreakers like Exploud and Tyrantrum. Druddigon can run an offensive Stealth Rock lead set on hyper offense teams with a moveset of Stealth Rock / Outrage / Earthquake / Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Choice Specs Exploud and Sylveon outspeed Druddigon and threaten to OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon and Diancie care little about what Druddigon can do outside of Toxic; even then, they often run Heal Bell to remove poison.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types like Mudsdale and Palossand wall most Druddigon sets without a problem but severely dislike Toxic. Vileplume can weaken Druddigon with Strength Sap and set up against it with Growth. Vaporeon can heal itself and its teammates of any status Druddigon inflicts with Heal Bell and cripple Druddigon with a Scald burn.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mold Breaker allows Druddigon to use Stealth Rock and other status moves in the face of Magic Bounce users like Xatu. However, Rough Skin, in conjunction with Rocky Helmet, is a viable option to punish contact attackers such as Copperajah and pivots like Talonflame, Ninjask, and Passimian. Dragon Tail lets Druddigon rack up Stealth Rock chip damage and phazes some setup users like Drapion and Braviary. Earthquake lets Druddigon hurt Steel-types like Copperajah and even Levitate Weezing when backed up by Mold Breaker. Glare and Toxic are both good status move options; Toxic in particular is a great move alongside Mold Breaker Earthquake. On Leftovers sets, Protect can be used over Dragon Tail to recover some extra HP and potentially rack up extra Toxic damage; it also lets Druddigon scout the moves of wallbreakers like Exploud. The given special bulk investment lets Druddigon tank attacks from +2 Salazzle, while the physical bulk investment is for foes like Toxicroak and +2 Talonflame. Maximum Defense investment is an option that better handles Copperajah and Tauros, but Druddigon isn't guaranteed to avoid being 2HKOed by either, even with the increase in physical tankiness.</p> <p>Mold Breaker Druddigon fits well on hazard-stacking teams that want to get Stealth Rock up without worrying about Xatu, so it accompanies Spikers like Garbodor and Froslass quite well. Physically defensive Pokemon like Mudsdale and Vileplume dislike Glare but otherwise wall Druddigon, so partners like Rotom-C and Life Orb Starmie are appreciated to take them on; Druddigon can pitch in to help these Pokemon using its resistances to Fire and Electric. Despite resisting their STAB moves, Druddigon is a poor answer to Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon as well as Salazzle; pair it with bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Mantine to compensate for this. Druddigon is greatly threatened by Fairy- and Dragon-type attackers, so Steel-types like Assault Vest Copperajah and Doublade can be beneficial partners.</p>"

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Golurk boasts a top-tier offensive STAB combination along with a useful pool of utility moves, making it very difficult to identify the set and safely play around. Additionally, it's one of the few viable Ground-types in the tier, letting it check Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum in a pinch as well as block Rotom-C's Volt Switch. Despite Golurk's colorful movepool and great Attack stat, its poor Speed and middling bulk make it quite easy to find midgrounds for once its set is successfully identified. Golurk also faces competition from the much superior Silvally-Ground and Mudsdale for a teamslot because they have significantly fewer flaws and are easier to build around; with Golurk, you lose a ton of defensive utility and cannot easily run item displacement such as Knock Off. As a wallbreaker, Golurk is slower than the likes of Exploud and Sylveon while only matching their damage output. Golurk's reliance on Poltergeist and Earthquake, two moves with common immunities in the tier, can make it quite prediction reliant to accomplish the same damage that the aforementioned wallbreakers and others accomplish simply by using their STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golurk's middling bulk can be supplemented by an Assault Vest, allowing it to effectively beat Pokemon like Rotom-C and Starmie one-on-one that it would otherwise lose to. The loss of wallbreaking power from not using a Choice Band is often not worth sacrificing Golurk's viability and most of its HP just to beat some special attackers. Just like its Sticky Barb and Assault Vest sets, Golurk can use a Choice Scarf to catch its foes off guard, although this has similar drawbacks to the Assault Vest set. Rock Polish Golurk makes for a solid late-game sweeper, although even after a Rock Polish it can find itself too weak and slower than some Choice Scarf users. Rindo Berry can be used with Rock Polish to always win the matchup against Choice Scarf Rotom-C.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Protect Scouting</strong>: Protect users such as Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Mudsdale, defensive pieces that Golurk would typically prey upon, can simply scout to see what Golurk will use and switch into an according check, as all of Golurk's moves, despite their great power, have common type resistances.</p> <p><strong>Itemless Pokemon</strong>: Although its Trick set can somewhat bypass this issue, Golurk's heavy reliance on Poltergeist makes it quite vulnerable to common itemless Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Vileplume.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Golurk is certainly on the slower end, even for wallbreaker standards, and with middling bulk, other wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Sylveon and Exploud coast past it and threaten an easy OHKO on it as well.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band Golurk hits like a train and 2HKOes almost everything assuming it locks into the right move, making it incredibly scary. Close Combat pairs perfectly with Poltergeist, nailing defensive Dark-types like Guzzlord and Scrafty as well as Snorlax, which can be 2HKOed even after a Curse boost. The final coverage move is often irrelevant due to the high-Base Power and flawless coverage Golurk's three main moves provide, although Stone Edge can OHKO Talonflame even if Golurk is burned and nails other Flying-types like Mantine and Braviary a little harder than Poltergeist or Close Combat would. Alternatively, Heat Crash hits itemless Grass-types such as Vileplume, Rotom-C, and Dhelmise.</p> <p>Due to Golurk's poor Speed and bulk, it greatly appreciates the momentum provided by great pivots such as Rotom-C and Choice Scarf Passimian, both of which can also easily clean up teams after Golurk punches holes in them. Despite being a Ground-type, it fails to check many Poison-types such as Toxicroak and Drapion, making alternative defensive pivots like Talonflame and Arcanine very useful. Physical attackers like Tauros and Toxicroak appreciate Golurk weakening physical walls like Mudsdale and Weezing. Tauros also provides a Ghost immunity, and Toxicroak's Dry Skin allows it to pivot into Water-type attacks.</p>"

Although Golurk is quite strong without a Choice Band, it's certainly noticeably weaker and appreciates stronger teammates like Exploud and Alolan Exeggutor to compensate.

    "overview": "<p>With its strong defensive typing and fantastic Eviolite-bolstered physical bulk, Doublade acts as a decent physical tank, able to take on a variety of physical attackers including Braviary, Snorlax, Tyrantrum, and Tauros. In addition, its good Attack, powerful coverage, and access to Swords Dance let it crush defensive staples such as Copperajah, Diancie, and Sylveon, while useful priority in Shadow Sneak lets it sufficiently threaten offensive teams. However, Doublade's meager Special Defense despite Eviolite means even powerful resisted STAB moves from the likes of Exploud and Sylveon can 2HKO it, making it awkward to fit on teams as a Steel-type, and its reliance on Eviolite makes it a poor answer to many physical attackers like Toxicroak, Escavalier, and Tsareena that run Knock Off. Doublade's total lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to common coverage makes it an ineffective long-term check and spinblocker to Tyrantrum, Copperajah, and Tsareena. While Doublade is powerful after Swords Dance, it is also not exceedingly difficult to wall, with bulky Pokemon like Mantine, Talonflame, and Mudsdale able to take it on, and it is easy to revenge kill due to its over-reliance on a relatively weak Shadow Sneak to handle faster threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Claw gives Doublade a stronger hit against Talonflame, Dhelmise, and Mantine and retains perfect coverage with Close Combat; however, Iron Head gives Doublade better matchups overall. Rock Slide Doublade can lure in and OHKO Talonflame without a boost, but fitting Rock Slide heavily compromises Doublade's overall coverage. Toxic punishes walls that Doublade baits in such as Mudsdale and Arcanine but diminishes its offensive potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Powerful Knock Off users such as Escavalier, Toxicroak, and Scrafty are very dangerous for Doublade to take on, opening it up by hitting it hard and removing its Eviolite. Passimian and Tsareena can use Knock Off so that Doublade cannot easily stop them from cleaning late-game and spinning, respectively, and Tsareena is also immune to Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers can easily prey on Doublade's awful Special Defense. Salazzle and Inteleon can both OHKO it after Stealth Rock with their STAB moves, and Heliolisk and Rotom-C can exploit it for pivoting opportunities. Strong resisted special STAB moves from the likes of Exploud and Choice Specs Sylveon also potentially 2HKO Doublade.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mantine, Weezing, and Talonflame are excellent answers to Doublade, as they can all take hits from +2 Doublade and turn it into fodder by burning it. The uncommon Arcanine fully counters Doublade, taking any hit with ease due to Intimidate and hitting back hard with Flamethrower. While Vaporeon does not appreciate taking +2 Close Combat, it is also a workable check in a pinch if it can produce a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale checks Doublade well at full health due to Stamina, but it can be a shaky answer because it is easily worn down and can only 3HKO with Earthquake. Quagsire is totally unbothered by Doublade due to Unaware and its resistance to Iron Head, and it can burn Doublade or chip it down with Earthquake. Golurk can survive an unboosted Shadow Sneak and threaten huge damage with a STAB move, while Silvally-Ground easily takes a boosted Shadow Sneak and OHKOes Doublade with +2 Multi-Attack after Stealth Rock.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Despite its limited coverage, Iron Head is important to threaten Fairy-types, particularly Diancie, and cover certain neutral targets such as Vileplume and Weezing. Shadow Sneak primarily hits faster Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Decidueye, Golurk, and Starmie, OHKOing all of them at +2 with Stealth Rock support, as well as weakened, frail Pokemon like Salazzle. Close Combat is a powerful weapon against Copperajah, Stakataka, and Snorlax and lets Doublade strike back against faster Dark-types like Guzzlord and Scrafty. The listed EVs allow Doublade to outspeed Dhelmise and defensive Copperajah.</p> <p>As chip damage is so detrimental to Doublade's walling ability, it needs to be paired with a Wish user such as Vaporeon or Sylveon. Vaporeon can also take on many of the Fire-, Water-, and Ground-types that trouble Doublade, while Sylveon can check Dark-types for it. Itemless Vileplume is a strong partner, absorbing Knock Off and Poltergeist and nailing Xatu with Sludge Bomb so Doublade can come in freely on a forced Roost. Weezing forms a potent physically defensive core with Doublade, handling Ground-types while also switching into Knock Off from foes like Tsareena and Toxicroak. As Doublade cannot reliably use its set of resistances against special attackers, Diancie, Guzzlord, and Snorlax are excellent teammates, checking Pokemon like Exploud, Heliolisk, and Salazzle, respectively. Doublade appreciates a partner that can deal with faster Pokemon unbothered by Shadow Sneak, such as Heliolisk, Exploud, and Tsareena; Passimian is a good candidate and also brings Doublade in with U-turn.</p>"

Heliolisk can also run multiple sets, like Choice Specs to break through Electric-resistant Pokemon like Alolan Exeggutor and Guzzlord and Choice Scarf to outspeed Salazzle, Talonflame, and Choice Scarf Passimian. Its coverage from Hyper Voice, Surf, and Grass Knot also gives many ways to target checks like Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Decidueye. However, its poor defenses can leave it revenge killed by physical attackers and priority users like Passimian, Toxicroak, and Absol, and other fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Tauros, and Salazzle can outspeed it if it does not run Choice Scarf.

Priority users like Toxicroak and Absol can also revenge kill Heliolisk after chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Without Heavy-Duty Boots, Heliolisk is worn down tremendously by entry hazards, and it's vulnerable to Toxic poison from bulky Water-types like Mantine and Vaporeon.</p>",

Because of this, Tyrantrum loves the plethora of pivoting options in the tier to reliably bring it in, and, when coupled with its good Speed tier for a wallbreaker, teams rarely have a consistent defensive answer. Tyrantrum also has Scale Shot, allowing sweeper sets to outspeed more offensive teams and revenge killers. Tyrantrum's main drawback offensively lies in its reliance on Head Smash, making Tyrantrum predictable for teams to switch into with a defensive Steel- or Ground-type. On top of that, Head Smash has low accuracy, making Tyrantrum unreliable at throwing out huge damage. Faster revenge killers, such as Passimian, Rotom-C, and Inteleon, can also take advantage of Tyrantrum, forcing it out to grab back momentum or break massive holes in your team.</p>",

Lum Berry is the most common item, letting Tyrantrum set up in the face of status users such as Mantine and Talonflame. Life Orb gives it an immediate power boost that can pick up the KO versus certain Pokemon such as Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Diancie when at +1 Attack. Hone Claws is a solid secondary option over Dragon Dance to boost accuracy for Head Smash and Scale Shot, but Dragon Dance is usually preferred because of its higher sweeping potential. A Jolly nature is prefered specifically for speeding past Talonflame, Inteleon, and Aerodactyl at +1 Speed.</p> <p>Getting rid of or chipping Ground-types is necessary to letting Tyrantrum sweep. Grass-type partners such as Rotom-C, itemless Vileplume, and Decidueye do a great job switching into and punishing Ground-types such as Mudsdale, Golurk, Gastrodon, and Rhydon. Spikes support from Garbodor or Qwilfish also helps chip down Pokemon such as Diancie, Sylveon, and Vaporeon into Head Smash range. Grass- and Water-type setup sweepers such as Decidueye and Kingdra are fantastic partners, setting up on the Ground-types Tyrantrum wants gone.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf can be an alternative option on Tyrantrum, letting it be a revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner while improving its matchup against offensive teams, but this set struggles to break through defensive cores with its significantly lower power level and needs heavy support.

Furthermore, it can use Rock Polish to negate one of its biggest weaknesses: lacking Speed. Beyond its offensive capabilities, Aurorus also has an amazing support movepool, using Aurora Veil, Stealth Rock, Encore, and Thunder Wave to greatly help itself and its teammates. Despite its Speed advantage over other wallbreakers like Golurk and Alolan Exeggutor, though, Aurorus is generally quite slow, exposing its horrible defensive profile and leaving it vulnerable to a multitude of revenge killers like Silvally-Steel, Tsareena, and Duraludon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aurorus can forgo Power Herb and Meteor Beam and use Heavy-Duty Boots to consistently hit the field. This results in a significant loss of wallbreaking power, though. Aurorus can also rock Choice Specs for even stronger Blizzard spam, but this hinders it from making the best use of its coverage and is often not needed to reliably wallbreak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Aurorus is quite dependent on Meteor Beam to muscle past special walls like Snorlax, Vaporeon, Scrafty. Should it use Meteor Beam too early or encounter multiple of these special walls that resist Blizzard, it can struggle to break them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types must be chipped thoroughly before they can be OHKOed by Earth Power, with the exception of Stakataka. Silvally-Steel outspeeds and OHKOes Aurorus, and Escavalier and Copperajah must be hit by a Meteor Beam before they can go down to a boosted Earth Power. If Aurorus cannot get its Meteor Beam boost, it will likely fail to beat specially defensive Steel-types.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Faster wallbreakers like Silvally-Ground, Decidueye, and Starmie all boast super effective attacks and threaten to OHKO Aurorus before it can accomplish anything.

  "Decidueye": {
    "overview": "<p>Decidueye's fantastic STAB combo and offensive versatility make it a great wallbreaker in NU. Only a handful of Pokemon wall Decidueye's STAB attacks, and even fewer are fast enough that its teammates can't exploit them after U-turn uses or double switches. Furthermore, since Decidueye can use both physical and special sets to great success, finding defensive counterplay isn't so simple until you know its set. Despite these advantages, Decidueye isn't perfect, and its Speed is its most notable flaw. Even though its Shadow Sneak is strong when boosted, faster attackers like Talonflame and Drapion easily revenge kill it, with only the former being susceptible to Decidueye's priority attack. Decidueye also struggles in certain matchups, especially against Dark-types like Guzzlord, Scrafty, and Sneasel, since it's forced to use U-turn more often instead of wallbreak. Lastly, because there are so many great Grass-types in NU, Decidueye can sometimes be hard to justify using over other options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Utility sets with Defog and bulk investment are useable, turning Decidueye into a good answer to foes like Silvally-Ground, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk. However, Dhelmise is usually the better option because its overall bulk and natural power are superior. Nasty Plot is an alternative setup set that can bypass even the sturdiest of special walls like Scrafty and Mantine, but this set exposes Decidueye's average Speed quite a bit, as it lacks a priority move. Decidueye's Flying-type coverage moves like Acrobatics, Brave Bird, and Hurricane have some use in immediately breaking past Grass- and Fighting-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, Scrafty, and Passimian, but its STAB moves still get the job done.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Drapion can tank physical Decidueye's attacks quite well and easily revenge kill it regardless of set. Guzzlord takes a lot from Choice Band Decidueye's U-turn but otherwise blanks it completely. Scrafty can switch into Choice item Decidueye's Ghost-type attacks and use it as setup fodder afterwards. Sneasel is simply faster, resists Shadow Sneak, and OHKOes Decidueye with Knock Off, although it's no switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Sap Sipper Drampa completely walls Decidueye's STAB attacks, although because it's so slow, switching into U-turn can cost its team momentum. Tauros outspeeds Decidueye and beats it with Throat Chop.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Certain Pokemon like Talonflame, Tsareena, and Passimian can contend with even a boosted Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and OHKO it in return.</p>",

Long Reach prevents adverse contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Flame Body from harming Decidueye.

Under sand, it easily outspeeds some of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, including Choice Scarf users like Passimian, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk. Coverage like Close Combat and Psychic Fangs means that Lycanroc beats offensive Pokemon like Tyrantrum and Toxicroak, and it also threatens a good chunk of the defensive metagame like Talonflame, Copperajah, and Xatu with its overall offensive toolkit. However, Lycanroc won't sweep so long as there are physically bulky Pokemon and Ground-types left that can tank its hits, like Mudsdale, Silvally-Ground, and Doublade. Lycanroc's general frailty also makes safely getting it in difficult, as well as its reliance on Gigalith for activating Sand Rush. On top of requiring sand, Lycanroc also relies on Life Orb, Stone Edge, and Swords Dance for sweeping, making it heavily conditional and unreliable in the long term as a sweeper if it misses or lacks setup opportunities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lum Berry facilitates Swords Dance usage against status spreaders like Talonflame and Weezing, but this advantage is less important than the wallbreaking perks of Life Orb. Choice Band forgoes setup for some extra strength, though it is unlikely for Lycanroc to clean if locked into a single attack. Crunch hits Ghost-types like Golurk and Doublade that resist Stone Edge and is used if the team cannot check these threats elsewhere.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Silvally-Ground, Mudsdale, Golurk, and Quagsire all stop Lycanroc sweeps and switch into Stone Edge without an issue.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: If sand is gone, then faster attackers like Starmie and Choice Scarf Passimian will revenge kill Lycanroc. Even with sand present, bulkier attackers like Guzzlord, Toxicroak, and Tsareena are capable of surviving an unboosted hit from full and OHKOing in retaliation.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Outside of Weezing, Doublade, and the prior Ground-types, most physically bulky Pokemon cannot afford switching into Stone Edge. However, walls like Vileplume and Vaporeon still deter Swords Dance usage and can force out Lycanroc given a safe switch in.</p>",

Mudsdale's solid physical bulk, ability in Stamina, and typing help it match offensive power with defensive might to check these wallbreakers. Mudsdale also lacks passivity issues thanks to its high Attack and strong moves in STAB Earthquake and Body Press, the latter of which can take advantage of Stamina boosts. Mudsdale is otherwise far too easily to overwhelm with common special attackers like Starmie, Alolan Exeggutor, and Nasty Plot Salazzle. Additionally, Mudsdale is an ineffective Volt Switch deterrent because the most common Volt Switch users, Rotom-C and Heliolisk, can easily OHKO it with Leaf Storm and Grass Knot, respectively, and it's also very slow.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar prevents Substitute users like Braviary and Araquanid from taking advantage of Mudsdale as easily as well as bulkier setup sweepers like Scrafty and Snorlax. Iron Defense is similar, although limited to physical setup sweepers, and makes Mudsdale a potent bulky setup sweeper. Payback helps against foes like Decidueye and Dhelmise, but Toxic gets the job done well enough. Choice Band sets make use of Mudsdale's incredible Attack stat and solid coverage moves to turn it into a good wallbreaker, although it's very prediction reliant and at risk of being setup fodder for foes like Rotom-C and Decidueye.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Rotom-C and Decidueye are immune to or resist Earthquake, force Mudsdale out, and can set up with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance. Vileplume has immense physical bulk augmented by Strength Sap, and it's immune to Toxic. Dhelmise can spin away Mudsdale's Stealth Rock, although doing so may negatively affect its ability to beat Toxic + Protect Mudsdale one-on-one due to Stamina.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types such as Mantine and Vaporeon have little issue taking on Mudsdale, only disliking being poisoned by Toxic. Offensive Water-types like Starmie and Inteleon, meanwhile, can easily dispatch Mudsdale.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Braviary can fairly easily set up against Mudsdale, especially if it has Substitute, although it must use Bulk Up a couple of times before attacking because of Mudsdale's Stamina. Levitate Weezing has a good matchup against Mudsdale with its combination of Will-O-Wisp + Taunt, preventing Mudsdale from doing significant damage to it with Earthquake and denying Stealth Rock. Xatu simply denies any Mudsdale variant from setting Stealth Rock.</p>",

Alternatively, Body Press has good synergy with Stamina and helps against Guzzlord and Braviary. You can consider running 64 Special Defense EVs to avoid Salazzle from OHKOing Mudsdale with +2 Fire Blast, although this benchmark is rarely necessary.

However, its low base Attack and Speed leave it outmatched by opposing wallbreakers like Golurk and Toxicroak, and it struggles if the opposition lacks Pokemon for it to use Substitute on.

Additionally, Salazzle possesses a very convenient defensive typing, which helps it avoid being revenge killed by Rotom-C's Leaf Storm and Passimian's Close Combat.

Despite offering so much role compression, though, Tsareena faces heavy competition from Rotom-C, a Pokemon that fills many of the same roles as it but with more efficiency and defensive utility. Many teams opt for Choice Scarf Rotom-C as their entry hazard remover because it can double as a revenge killer too, and Tsareena lacking that function makes building with it awkward at times. Also, Tsareena can't make very good use of its resistances because Pokemon it'd otherwise switch into well, like Silvally-Ground and Starmie, simply outspeed and heavily damage or KO it the following turn with their coverage.</p>",

Formidable base Attack, Beast Boost, and a colorful movepool with tons of utility make it an exceptionally capable attacker; STAB Knock Off punishes common switch-ins such as Talonflame and Mudsdale, for example, and Heavy Slam deals heavy damage to Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Diancie. Guzzlord's overall defensive properties give it a lot of opportunities to directly switch in and wallbreak. However, its low base Speed makes it prone to being revenge killed by common wallbreakers such as Sylveon, Tauros, and Toxicroak. Moreover, despite Guzzlord's typing's advantages, it's weak to common moves such as Body Press and U-turn. Furthermore, many of the foes Guzzlord tries to check can pivot out on it, such as Rotom-C and Decidueye, which makes it harder to truly capitalize on its positive matchup against them.</p>",

Earthquake is a spammable coverage option that nails Steel-types such as Copperajah and Stakataka. Heat Crash may also be used to harshly punish the likes of Vileplume and Escavalier.

Garbodor, Talonflame, and Salazzle are also potent partners for Guzzlord, as they can take U-turn directed at it and beat its Fairy- and Fighting-type checks in Passimian, Toxicroak, and Sylveon.

    "overview": "<p>Stakataka is a great defensive Pokemon thanks to its incredible bulk, great utility, and strong defensive typing, which let it check Pokemon like Salazzle, Talonflame, and Sylveon. Unlike other Steel-types, it's neutral to Fire and can threaten Fire-types like Salazzle and Talonflame with its STAB Rock-type moves. Offensively, Stakataka has a good Attack stat, which, in tandem with its low Speed, gives it an extremely powerful Gyro Ball. This makes Trick Room variants quite lethal. If Stakataka claims one KO, Beast Boost can allow it snowball through the opposing team. However, its typing does leave it 4x weak to both Fighting and Ground. Also, Stakataka is more vulnerable than other Steel-types to bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Quagsire.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stakataka can forgo Trick Room and equip a Choice Band for immediate power that is very difficult to wall. While this is often not worth the long-term benefits a Trick Room set can reap, the surprise factor can turn the tides of a game. A Chople Berry or Shuca Berry can be used to survive a potentially fatal Fighting- or Ground-type attack, turning around an otherwise unfavorable matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types like Passimian, Scrafty, and Toxicroak can scare Stakataka out with ease and set up on it. However, they dislike switching into it, as they can be hit quite hard due to Stakataka's sky-high Attack stat. Superpower Copperajah and Close Combat Braviary are just a few threats that carry Fighting-type coverage to exploit this weakness.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Golurk, and Silvally-Ground have little to fear from Stakataka, and they easily force it out; this lets the latter two set up and proceed to threaten Stakataka's team. Aerodactyl, Guzzlord, and Tauros are only a few Pokemon that can lure Stakataka in to smash it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can come in on Stakataka without fearing any of its attacks and consistently threaten it with their STAB moves.

Stakataka also gains a +1 Defense boost after KOing a Pokemon, which further strengthens Body Press. Toxic takes care of bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Quagsire, which otherwise can easily shrug off Stakataka's attacks, while Rock Blast handles Focus Sash leads and circumvents Pokemon that use Substitute like Salazzle, Araquanid, and Braviary. 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature ensure that Gyro Ball hits as hard as possible.</p> <p>Because of Stakataka's glaring weakness to both Fighting- and Ground-types and its low Speed, it needs teammates that can handle Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Silvally-Ground. Therefore, Weezing and Vileplume are great defensive partners, while Salazzle and Starmie are great offensive checks to the aforementioned threats. Vaporeon and Sylveon deal with Ground- and Fighting-types, respectively, while having Heal Bell and Wish to keep Stakataka healthy. Flying-types like Talonflame and Xatu can switch in on incoming Fighting- and Ground-type attacks while appreciating Stakataka's resistance to Rock. Xatu, in particular, can wall Mudsdale and Quagsire, two very common Stakataka checks.

In return, they deal with opposing Steel- and Rock-types more easily than Stakataka can. The same goes for Grass-types like Decidueye and Rotom-C; they appreciate Stakataka's ability to come in on Arcanine, Talonflame, and Escavalier and, in return, they finish off the Ground- and Water-types that give Stakataka problems.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Trick Room with Stakataka's insanely low Speed ensures it will almost always go first and launch high-Base Power moves. Stone Edge is preferred over Rock Blast for its consistent wallbreaking power. Superpower hits Steel-types that resist both of Stakataka's STAB attacks, but it has the severe drawback of lowering Stakataka's Attack and Defense. Stakataka can forgo Superpower for Earthquake, which hits Doublade and Drapion but misses out on OHKOing Silvally-Steel. 0 Speed IVs ensure Stakataka moves first under Trick Room and maximize Gyro Ball's power, and 15 Defense IVs with a Lonely nature cause Beast Boost to increase Attack. Life Orb is preferred to reach important benchmarks such as always OHKOing Silvally-Ground with Gyro Ball, although Iron Ball could be used to win the mirror matchup against opposing Stakataka without needing to lose a Speed tie. Weakness Policy allows Stakataka to capitalize on its great natural bulk by taking weak super effective attacks, like a Vaporeon's Scald or Snorlax's Earthquake, while setting up Trick Room to become even more powerful than Life Orb sets. Air Balloon is another option to set up on Tauros, Silvally-Ground, and Tyrantrum, but it causes Stakataka to miss out on the important KOs Life Orb offers.</p> <p>Partners that can lure in and soften up Mudsdale, like Power Whip Copperajah and Grimmsnarl and Choice Band Passimian, make for amazing partners. Vaporeon and Mantine can come in on Water-type attacks and take care of Ground-types. Talonflame weakens physical attackers, especially Fighting- and Ground-types, with Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body, while Stakataka clears the Rock-types that threaten Talonflame. Pivots like Rotom-C and Heliolisk can check Starmie and bring Stakataka in safely on physical attackers. This allows Stakataka to force a switch and then set Trick Room. Xatu is another notable pivot, as it can bring Stakataka in safely with Teleport. Defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume, Quagsire, Vaporeon, and Mudsdale can all stall Stakataka's Trick Room turns, so teammates that can threaten them like Alolan Exeggutor, Rotom-C, and Vileplume are amazing. The former two also can pivot Stakataka in safely. In return, Stakataka clears Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that threaten them and helps wear down shared checks like Escavalier and Vileplume.</p>"

Additionally, its Speed leaves it with limited offensive counterplay and makes it a good revenge killer; it outpaces other fast foes like Salazzle, Tauros, and Starmie and can easily KO them with its attacks. Inteleon does face strong competition from other offensive Water-types, though. Starmie can break through its checks thanks to its superior coverage and Analytic, whereas Kingdra is capable of setting up on Vaporeon and Mantine.</p>",

Its typing alongside passable natural bulk means it can check offensive threats like Silvally-Ground, Heliolisk, and non-Ice Beam Starmie as well as switch into common bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. However, its shallow offensive movepool and lack of damage output make it a sitting duck most of the time; it gives free entry to common threats like Salazzle, Alolan Exeggutor, and Talonflame, and it also can't threaten spinblockers like Dhelmise and Decidueye. Eldegoss is also outclassed by other Grass-types such as Rotom-C, Tsareena, and Vileplume, which can do one of the few things Eldegoss can but better, as well as possessing more offensive presence and relevant support options.</p>",

In addition, Decidueye and Dhelmise can spinblock Eldegoss. Alolan Exeggutor can be threatened with Pollen Puff, though.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Talonflame, Mantine, and Galarian Articuno can threaten Eldegoss out with their super effective STAB attacks and heal off any damage from it with their recovery move.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Drapion, Garbodor, Weezing, and Salazzle don't mind any of Eldegoss's attacks and can pressure it with their STAB attacks.

Moreover, after the item's consumption, it can check Poltergeist and Knock Off users like Golurk and Guzzlord more reliably. Leaf Storm also nets a guaranteed OHKO against Gastrodon, Starmie, and Inteleon. If another cleric is present on the team, Pollen Puff is an alternative option to threaten Grass-types like Rotom-C, Alolan Exeggutor, and Tsareena that would otherwise wall Eldegoss completely. A recovery move in Leech Seed has the added benefit of chipping down switch-ins like Salazzle, Talonflame, and Escavalier and lets Eldegoss go toe-to-toe with Stealth Rock setters like Copperajah and Stakataka, while Synthesis gives it an instant healing option. Sleep Powder can be used to punish switch-ins looking to take advantage of Eldegoss's passivity and potentially gives it opportunities to switch in later on in the battle, which compensates for its lack of a recovery move. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it act as a more reliable pivot and spinner by preventing it from being overwhelmed by entry hazards. The EVs let it outspeed Adamant Copperajah and give it more Special Defense, with everything else dumped into Defense to check Silvally-Ground better.</p> <p>Due to its valuable defensive presence, utility options, and role compression, Eldegoss fits nicely in balance and stall teams, the latter of which can also tolerate its lack of offensive presence. Other defensive staples like Talonflame, Mantine, and Guzzlord make for great teammates, as they can cover its defensive shortcomings; Talonflame checks Tauros and Gallade, Mantine deals with Alolan Exeggutor and Salazzle, and Guzzlord helps against Decidueye and Rotom-C. In return, Talonflame and Mantine appreciate Eldegoss removing Stealth Rock as they tend to have their Heavy-Duty Boots removed by foes like Escavalier and Gallade. It also checks bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Quagsire and reliably switches into Swords Dance Silvally-Ground. Aromatherapy also removes stray poison from Toxic that they often catch and wakes up Guzzlord from Rest. With Eldegoss as a spinner, Talonflame and Mantine can forgo Defog for other utility moves or form a strong entry hazard removal core with it to support Stealth Rock-weak teammates like Life Orb Aerodactyl and Choice Band Sneasel.</p>"

The STAB combination of Darkest Lariat and Play Rough hits most of the tier for significant damage, while the few that can survive such as Stakataka and Mudsdale have to be wary of coverage in Superpower and Power Whip. The main problems for Grimmsnarl lie in its mediocre Speed, bulk, and move power, all limiting its wallbreaking capabilities and entry points onto the field. Its low-Base Power moves make it prediction reliant to effectively wallbreak while still having trouble breaking through physical walls such as Mudsdale, Weezing, and Sylveon. Its typing also provides few resistances to supplement its already average defensive stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Utilizing Prankster and Trick on Choice Band variants is a viable option to immediately cripple a threat like Vileplume or Weezing. However, while it may be useful to weaken a foe, Grimmsnarl afterwards will lack even more wallbreaking power, making it less of a threat itself.</p> <p>Prankster dual screens works on hyper offense teams to support setup sweepers like Salazzle and Silvally-Ground, and Grimmsnarl can also provide speed control with Thunder Wave. However, such teams are inconsistent because of dual screens' limited duration.</p> <p>Taunt with three attacks allows Grimmsnarl to still weaken the walls it normally forces in, such as Sylveon and Mudsdale, with Taunt restricting their potential utility moves. However, it requires adequate prediction to use more effectively. Protective Pads means a cleric isn't as necessary, as Grimmsnarl no longer fears potential Flame Body and Effect Spore effects from Talonflame and Vileplume while also bypassing Rocky Helmet users.</p> <p>Substitute + Bulk Up makes Grimmsnarl harder to KO, especially because of Prankster giving it fast Substitutes to scout Choice item foes like Passimian and Rotom-C, but Grimmsnarl is heavily outclassed by Scrafty, as it's much bulkier, has Knock Off to soften up checks, and has better longevity with Rest + Shed Skin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types in Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor can reliably switch into most of Grimmsnarl's attacks and threaten it with their STAB moves. Though, Darkest Lariat can 2HKO them with small chip damage, so they need to be cautious.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: The most common Fire-type, Talonflame, can switch into any non-Darkest Lariat move with ease, threatening a burn with each turn Grimmsnarl attacks. While Salazzle cannot switch in, it can easily revenge kill or set up on a Choice-locked Grimmsnarl. Meanwhile, while less common, Arcanine is a reliable counter, as it is not threatened by any of Grimmsnarl's moves and is able to threaten back with status or pivot to a different Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Besides the bulky Poison-types, many other common physical walls in Diancie, Sylveon, and Mudsdale can all limit Grimmsnarl's offensive capabilities.

Teams typically will struggle to fit a reliable defensive switch-in to Copperajah because of its great coverage, which limits otherwise reasonable checks like Guzzlord and Mudsdale to being situational switch-ins. Copperajah is also a fine Stealth Rock setter because it retains a significant offensive presence even with minimal investment, giving it plenty of chances to force foes out and set its entry hazard. Copperajah's biggest flaw, however, is how poor its longevity is. It is heavily reliant on Wish support to stay healthy and is prone to getting repeatedly weakened by pivoting moves from foes like Rotom-C, Heliolisk, and Ninjask, forcing it to cede momentum. It's also incredibly slow, which greatly expands the list of foes that will threaten Copperajah and force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head can be used over Heavy Slam on Stealth Rock sets so that Glastrier can't take advantage of Copperajah as easily. Sheer Force can be considered to boost its and Rock Slide's power further. Choice Band sets sacrifice longevity for incredible wallbreaking power, but because Copperajah's Speed tier is so poor, it appreciates the extra survivability Assault Vest provides more. Play Rough immediately removes Guzzlord and prevents Scrafty from setting up against Copperajah, but it's otherwise very limited in use.

Stone Edge prevents Talonflame from safely switching in, OHKOes Salazzle, and is Copperajah's best move to hit Arcanine with. Superpower hits other Copperajah hard and chunks Guzzlord and Glastrier, although Heat Crash smashes foes like Rotom-C, Vileplume, and Escavalier.</p> <p>Wish and cleric support from Vaporeon or Sylveon is almost necessary, as without it, Copperajah is a much worse standalone defensive option and more vulnerable to status from the likes of Talonflame. Additionally, Vaporeon checks Fire-types like Salazzle and Talonflame, while Sylveon helps against certain Fighting-types like Gallade and Passimian. Although Copperajah's great special bulk helps it find its own chances to switch in, pivot support from Pokemon like Talonflame, Rotom-C, and Xatu ensures safer entry onto the field. Copperajah is great at forcing damage onto foes like Mudsdale, Mantine, and Guzzlord; setup sweepers like Salazzle and Silvally-Ground benefit from this. Lastly, other slow wallbreakers like Golurk and Exploud benefit from Copperajah answering faster special attackers like Rotom-C, Starmie, and Inteleon and can form a strong wallbreaking core with it.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Power Whip lets Copperajah take on Water-types like Starmie and Vaporeon and prevents Ground-types like Silvally-Ground, Golurk, and Mudsdale from switching in as easily. Rock Slide is needed to take out Talonflame, although Heat Crash can be considered for Rotom-C and Escavalier. The Speed investment gives Copperajah the jump on Dhelmise, but Copperajah's Speed is very flexible.</p> <p>Copperajah is easily walled and exploited by Fire-types like Talonflame and Arcanine, so the support of Water- and Dragon-types like Starmie, Vaporeon, and Alolan Exeggutor is good to have. In addition, Starmie can soft check Fighting-types, Vaporeon provides Wish and cleric support, and Alolan Exeggutor breaks down physical walls that Copperajah draws in. In return, Copperajah checks Grass-types for the former two and Fairy-types for the latter. Copperajah forms solid defensive cores with physically defensive Pokemon like Xatu, Talonflame, and Sylveon; additionally, the former two appreciate Copperajah checking Electric-types such as Rotom-C and Heliolisk, whereas the latter enjoys help against Exploud. Copperajah's inability to force Stealth Rock up against Xatu mandates the support of teammates like Rotom-C, Decidueye, and Silvally-Ghost that can break past it.</p>"

  "Duraludon": {
    "overview": "<p>Duraludon's wallbreaking capabilities are defined by its excellent coverage, which makes it a great Expert Belt user. Thanks to Duraludon's good Speed and Draco Meteor + Eject Pack combo, it's also able to act as a decent one-time pivot and wallbreaker. Even in unfavorable matchups against walls it can't get past alone, Duraludon is still able to safely make progress against Copperajah, Vaporeon, and Escavalier. Its serviceable physical bulk and Steel typing allow it to switch into the likes of Talonflame, Ninjask, and bulky Poison-types. However, Duraludon has very poor Special Defense, making it very vulnerable to faster special attackers such as Salazzle, Starmie, and Volt Switch users. Duraludon also faces large competition with other Dragon- and Steel-type wallbreakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Copperajah because it's unable to properly check Pokemon a typical Dragon- or Steel-type would check, such as Rotom-C, Exploud, Sylveon, and more, leading to its team requiring type stacking and more compensation.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used to increase Duraludon's already decent wallbreaking power, scoring more OHKOs and 2HKOing Pokemon such as Vaporeon. Choice Specs Duraludon is more prediction reliant, however, than Expert Belt variants.</p> <p>While more matchup dependent, Iron Defense + Body Press Duraludon can serve as a usable sweeper. It's able to use its decent bulk and Steel typing to set up on Mantine, Copperajah, and other passive Pokemon. It also has more longevity utilizing Leftovers, allowing it to better answer Pokemon like Ninjask long-term.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Escavalier doesn't mind anything Duraludon throws its way and can potentially threaten it with a super effective Close Combat. Other Steel-types like Copperajah and Stakataka can switch into Draco Meteor but are threatened by Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Unless it gets very favorable damage rolls with Thunderbolt, Vaporeon has a chance to PP stall Duraludon and win one-on-one. Snorlax has the raw bulk to handle any attack from Duraludon and KO it with Earthquake. Scrafty can use Duraludon as setup fodder with Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Salazzle, Heliolisk, Rotom-C, and Starmie are all able to OHKO or heavily chunk Duraludon with their resisted attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>When boosted by Expert Belt, Body Press 2HKOes Assault Vest Copperajah. Thunderbolt targets Water- and Flying-type walls like Vaporeon, Talonflame, and Mantine, and Duraludon's bulk and typing let it switch into such foes and beat them one-on-one. A Modest nature is necessary to have a chance to 2HKO Vaporeon, though a Timid nature with entry hazard support can also achieve this benchmark.</p> <p>Physical attackers like Drapion, Toxicroak, and Passimian can break through special walls like Copperajah and Escavalier that Duraludon struggles with. Their Knock Off support is also crucial so that walls like Vaporeon and Mudsdale are worn down enough to be threatened by Duraludon. In return, they rely on Duraludon as a switch-in to walls like Talonflame and Vileplume. Pivots like Rotom-C, Xatu, and Heliolisk work well to bring Duraludon in safely against the likes of Vileplume, Guzzlord, and Dhelmise. After a Draco Meteor, Duraludon is susceptible to setup sweepers, so make sure to have a good revenge killer saved; Heliolisk and Passimian are good Choice Scarf users, and priority from Toxicroak also works.</p>"

      "Eject Pack": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eject Pack allows Duraludon to gain momentum for its teammates, oftentimes after claiming a KO. Body Press hits Copperajah and Stakataka, helping teammates such as offensive Talonflame sweep later on. Duraludon's good matchup against common entry hazard removal options like Talonflame and Xatu makes it a decent Stealth Rock setter. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used to better pressure bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Mantine. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed base 80s such as Braviary and tie at worst with Toxicroak.</p> <p>Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Passimian take advantage of Duraludon's checks such as Copperajah, Vaporeon, and Escavalier. They are also able to weaken and pressure shared checks in Mudsdale and Mantine. In return, Duraludon is able to threaten bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Vileplume. Duraludon is easily revenge killed and chunked by faster special attackers such as Salazzle, Starmie, and Electric-types, and unable to properly check Fire- and Fairy-types. Pokemon such as Diancie and Snorlax pair nicely with Duraludon as a result. In return, Duraludon helps force damage onto Steel-types like Copperajah, Stakataka, and Escavalier, which these Pokemon can struggle with.</p>"

  "Glastrier": {
    "overview": "<p>Glastrier's immense Attack stat, backed up by a good STAB move and extremely useful coverage options, makes it capable of breaking through most foes. Its bulk is nothing to sneeze at either, and it can create extremely tanky Substitutes to protect itself from status and weaker hits from the likes of Vileplume and Vaporeon. Glastrier's two main problems are its poor defensive typing and very low Speed; these leave it vulnerable to the powerful STAB moves and coverage attacks of most other wallbreakers such as Passimian and Exploud, so its defensive utility is less than it appears on paper. Glastrier is also unable to make progress against certain answers such as Diamond Storm Diancie, Quagsire, and Arcanine without a lot of support. Worse yet, other stallbreakers like Salazzle and Growth Vileplume boast superior typings and Speed, so it is hard to justify Glastrier on teams given it offers little in comparison.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Defense + Body Press is another way to sweep and is better versus Mudsdale and Copperajah in exchange for being worse versus Sylveon and Vileplume. Glastrier can run a brutal Choice Band set to immediately pressure the opposition; however, such a set is very prone to getting forced out due to Glastrier's low Speed and common weaknesses as an Ice-type. Offensive sets can drop Substitute for an extra attack, making Glastrier very hard to wall, but losing Substitute makes Glastrier more vulnerable to status and revenge killers. Taunt can be used to deny the recovery and utility moves of Pokemon like Quagsire at the cost of setting up. Endure + Custap Berry can also be used over Substitute for a surprise KO versus revenge killers. High Horsepower provides coverage for Doublade, Salazzle, and Arcanine but is otherwise inferior to Close Combat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie is a huge concern for Glastrier given Diamond Storm breaks its Substitute and can increase Diancie's Defense. This attack can stop Glastrier sweeps while allowing Diancie itself to sweep with Body Press. Other Rock-types like Tyrantrum and Aerodactyl are threatening revenge killers with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Not all walls succumb to Glastrier's boosted attacks; Unaware Quagsire especially stops all sweeps. Running into Haze Mantine, Arcanine, Doublade, or Weezing is bad news, too, given their typings and access to status moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Wallbreakers like Passimian, Toxicroak, and Scrafty are tough for Glastrier to deal with without a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Utilizing powerful STAB moves or super effective coverage, Pokemon like Duraludon, Sylveon, and Exploud are all capable of putting decent amounts of pressure on Glastrier; the latter two even go through Substitute with their sound-based STAB attacks. Others like Salazzle and Starmie resist all of Glastrier's moves if it opts for Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status Ailments</strong>: All entry hazards wear down Glastrier, making it harder to rely on its bulk to beat revenge killers. Similarly, being inflicted with status makes sweeping nigh impossible.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Glastrier should use Substitute on forced switches or in front of passive Pokemon; the given EV spread allows Glastrier to make beefy 101 HP Substitutes that Vaporeon's Scald won't break. The EV spread also allows it to outspeed Vaporeon and other uninvested walls such as Guzzlord and Vileplume. Close Combat is the overall best coverage move available, blasting through Steel-types like Copperajah and Escavalier and hitting Water-types like Vaporeon for good neutral damage.</p> <p>Partners like Talonflame and Passimian easily draw in targets like Vaporeon and Mudsdale for Glastrier to safely set up versus; their status moves and Knock Off support, respectively, give Glastrier an easier time breaking through foes and performing a late-game sweep.

In return, Glastrier can take advantage of Pokemon that like to switch into Vaporeon like Vileplume. Glastrier is threatened by Fighting-types, so partners like Garbodor, Talonflame, and Xatu are appreciated; the latter two also provide entry hazard control.</p>"
