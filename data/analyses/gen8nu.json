    "overview": "<p>Sandslash is a notable sweeper thanks to Sand Rush doubling its Speed under sand, making it a staple on sand teams. Sandslash's good Attack and physical bulk give it several chances to set up Swords Dance and muscle through Pokemon like Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Escavalier. Sandslash also has good coverage in Knock Off and Leech Life to lure in and beat Grass-type checks like Dhelmise, Rotom-C, and Tsareena. However, Sandslash's low Special Defense hurts it against foes that can retaliate after taking an unboosted hit, like Vaporeon and Blastoise. Outside of sand, Sandslash is slow and easy to revenge kill, especially given its several common weaknesses. Sand is also niche due to how teams built around it require a lot of support to execute a sweep.</p> ",

However, if Sandslash is running Life Orb and has obtained a Swords Dance boost, it can OHKO them with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users: While Sandslash outspeeds the most common Choice Scarf users—Rotom-C and Passimian—under sand, Choice Scarf Heliolisk and Inteleon can outspeed and KO it with Hyper Voice after minor chip damage or OHKO with Surf, respectively. However, they cannot switch in reliably at all.</p> <p><strong>Snow Warning: Snow Warning users, like Vanilluxe and Aurorus, negate Sandslash's Speed boost and can stop it from sweeping by instantly setting hail. However, Aurorus gets outsped and OHKOed by Sandslash, and both cannot switch in reliably.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: The second sand turns are over, Sandslash becomes quite simple to revenge kill with Pokemon like Exploud, Starmie, and Rotom-C.</p> ",

Vileplume can also serve as a great tool against bulky Steel-types like Copperajah and Stakataka, as Corrosive Gas removes their held items and Sleep Powder puts them to sleep. However, Vileplume is slow and vulnerable to Psychic- and Fire-types as well as strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Guzzlord, Indeedee-F, and Exploud.

In addition, Stealth Rock can be an inconsistent factor in many games: aside from the prevalence of Heavy-Duty Boots, many of the tier's walls, such as Mudsdale, Stakataka, and Copperajah, resist Stealth Rock.

Snorlax's sweeping ability can be highly matchup reliant, as it will rarely get past certain threats such as Vileplume, Golurk, Escavalier, and Diancie without the right coverage move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Darkest Lariat allows Snorlax to hit Golurk, Decidueye, and Psychic-types such as Xatu in the same moveslot, and it provides great neutral coverage. However, it comes at the cost of either super effective damage on Steel-types or the utility of Body Slam, making it a generally subpar option. Heavy Slam can be used to let Snorlax lure in Diancie, but it is rarely worthwhile because it targets little else of note. Snorlax can also surprise its checks with more offensive sets: Assault Vest increases Snorlax's coverage while retaining its special walling capabilities, Choice Band can hit traditional walls like Mudsdale, Diancie, and Escavalier very hard, and a set with three attacks, Protect or Rest, and Leftovers allows Snorlax to both increase its immediate offense and preserve its longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Sirfetch'd, Machamp, Toxicroak, and Passimian can all force huge damage on Snorlax, even after it has begun to set up. The former two especially can OHKO Snorlax with Choice Band- or Guts-boosted Close Combat, even after a Curse. Several physical attackers that naturally check Snorlax, such as Escavalier and Tauros, commonly run Close Combat to deal with it. Snorlax is also prone to being caught off guard by coverage moves such as Focus Blast from Heliolisk and Superpower from Copperajah, which 2HKO it on the switch or force it to use Rest early.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Trick users, including Rotom-C and Indeedee-F, can almost totally negate Snorlax's usefulness by locking it into one move. This prevents Snorlax from setting up, deprives it of valuable Leftovers recovery, and leaves it only able to fire off weak, unboosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Due to Snorlax's extreme vulnerability while using Rest, any special attacker that can 3HKO it during that time threatens to stop a boosted Snorlax in its tracks. Very strong Choice Specs users like Exploud, Indeedee-F, and Sylveon are notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Diancie and Mudsdale can use Snorlax to boost their Defense with Diamond Storm or Stamina and hit it with Body Press. Weezing can burn Snorlax, take advantage of its enormous HP with Pain Split, and shut it down with Taunt. Doublade can switch in and set up Swords Dance easily against Snorlax, forcing it out with the threat of Close Combat. Vileplume can disrupt Snorlax with Corrosive Gas and Strength Sap but falters against Fire Punch sets. Due to Unaware, Quagsire can completely prevent Snorlax from sweeping.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Earthquake allows Snorlax to hit the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Body Slam, especially Stakataka, Copperajah, and Diancie. Fire Punch can be used instead to hit Escavalier and Grass-types such as Vileplume and Rotom-C, but it leaves Snorlax walled by dangerous Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Diancie, and Golurk. Immunity allows Snorlax to nullify Toxic from defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Mudsdale and more easily take Dragalge's Sludge Bomb, lessening the need to use Rest often. Alternatively, Thick Fat can help Snorlax take Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Salazzle and Vanilluxe. The given EV spread maximizes Snorlax's mixed bulk, notably letting it avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Indeedee-F's Expanding Force and Exploud's Focus Blast at full health. However, Snorlax's EVs are fairly customizable, especially if its team can adequately deal with these threats. For example, a spread of 76 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def / 172 SpD with a Careful nature better optimizes the Blastoise matchup, letting Snorlax always 2HKO Blastoise with +1 Body Slam and almost always avoid the 2HKO from +2 Surf. It also lets Snorlax survive Choice Band Tyrantrum's Head Smash from full health.</p> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon that can take on Fighting-types, such as Sylveon, Xatu, Talonflame, and Weezing, are excellent partners for Snorlax, and in return it can handle the special attackers that threaten them, such as Salazzle and Starmie. Snorlax's risky recovery and lack of resistances can cause it to struggle alone against pivots and very powerful special attackers, so it benefits from being paired with other special walls such as Copperajah, Diancie, and Dragalge; it additionally covers their weaknesses to threats like Blastoise and, especially if running Thick Fat, Vanilluxe. Since Snorlax struggles to break through certain physical walls, particularly Diancie, Mudsdale, and Vileplume, wallbreakers such as Starmie, Silvally-Ground, and Duraludon are great teammates. Because Trick is so debilitating for Snorlax, it appreciates partners like the aforementioned Silvally-Ground and Choice item users such as Heliolisk, which are unaffected or mostly unbothered by Trick, respectively.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Xatu is a defensive pivot with Magic Bounce, meaning it can switch into and deny entry hazards and other harmful status moves and then follow up with Teleport to gain momentum. Most notably, Mudsdale fails to set up Stealth Rock, Vileplume cannot recover with Strength Sap, and other walls like Talonflame are unable to spread status. Xatu is great at checking Fighting- and Ground-types like Passimian, Silvally-Ground, and Mudsdale, and its expansive movepool lets it accomplish different roles or include additional coverage as needed. However, it often fails to excel in these roles. In particular, most Stealth Rock users like Stakataka, Diancie, and Rhydon carry strong STAB attacks that deter Xatu from switching in. These matchups show off Xatu's middling bulk and relevant weaknesses; while Xatu nets safe switches on certain moves with the right reads, it can fold to strong coverage like Sirfetch'd's Knock Off and +2 Silvally-Ground's Rock Slide. Even if Xatu is played well, it is still too passive to adequately deal with some offensive threats like Drapion, Starmie, and Grimmsnarl.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Xatu is customizable with its coverage and EVs. Night Shade provides consistent damage output from an otherwise weak Pokemon, whereas Heat Wave threatens Steel-types like Escavalier and Togedemaru. U-turn is an option over Teleport for faster pivoting, keeping Xatu safe from incoming attacks rather than its teammates. Future Sight and Teleport work together, especially if paired with Fighting-types like Sirfetch'd, which appreciate the extra firepower versus Poison-types and physical walls. Thunder Wave offers speed control and widens the pool of Pokemon that Xatu's Teleport can bring in to revenge kill the foe. At the cost of Teleport, Defog is warranted when Xatu is the team's only answer to entry hazards. Dazzling Gleam can be used to lure in and severely damage certain Dark-types like Guzzlord and Scrafty.</p> <p>Running no item allows Xatu to avoid Poltergeist while also weakening Knock Off. Eject Button gets Xatu off the field when entry hazard setters like Stakataka and Copperajah attack it, helping with pivoting and maintaining Magic Bounce's threat. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Xatu the ability to switch in unhindered if the team uses no other entry hazard control. Xatu may opt for a Bold nature and more Defense investment at the cost of reaching worse Speed tiers below Jolly Sirfetch'd; with Bold, 16 Speed EVs let Xatu outspeed Golurk, while 64 Speed EVs outpace Adamant Tyrantrum. Extra bulk lets Xatu more effectively check some threats like Copperajah and Tsareena. Conversely, greater Speed investment can allow it to outspeed some mid-Speed wallbreakers like positive-nature Decidueye and neutral-nature Toxicroak.</p> <p>Dual screens are used on some hyper offense teams, largely thanks to Thunder Wave + Teleport creating safe setup opportunities. Xatu itself can be a setup sweeper with Cosmic Power + Stored Power, with Magic Bounce providing a necessary defense against Toxic. Alongside Cosmic Power, Weakness Policy can make Xatu much more threatening. Choice Scarf sets work mostly for the surprise factor and access to Trick: this move debilitates Xatu's defensive counters.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Offensive Rock-types like Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum break through Xatu with ease, and they can even afford to set up on it and tank its boosted Foul Play. Defensive Rock-types are a problem too, as Stakataka, Diancie, and Rhydon are Stealth Rock users that deter Xatu from coming in due to their STAB attacks; the former two also wall Xatu and outdamage the recovery from Roost with the perfectly accurate Gyro Ball and Moonblast, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage: Xatu struggles to deter Dark-types like Grimmsnarl, Guzzlord, and Drapion from switching in, relying on its ability to pivot into a strong teammate to avoid losing its team momentum. When Xatu opts for Rocky Helmet, it endangers itself against Knock Off users like Sirfetch'd, Tsareena, and Passimian.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Volt Switch users like Rotom-C and Heliolisk outspeed Xatu and force it out, gaining momentum while they do so.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Xatu fails as a physical wall versus strong Ghost-types like Golurk and Decidueye. However, itemless and Foul Play Xatu has more manageable matchups against them.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Sweepers</strong>: Many wallbreakers like Starmie, Exploud, and Duraludon can force out Xatu due to its passivity. Additionally, Swords Dance users like Silvally-Ground and Toxicroak can breeze past Xatu with little to no chip damage needed to score a KO.

Quagsire doesn't only stare down offensive threats, though, as it can pester many defensive Pokemon with moves like Encore, Toxic, and Yawn. While Quagsire is typically the go-to option to take on setup sweepers, its below-average stats leave it struggling to deal with strong wallbreakers such as Tauros, Sirfetch'd, and Golurk.

Immunities to Ground and Water and a resistance to Fighting define Mantine's defensive presence, allowing it to come in on Choice-locked threats such as Passimian and Golurk and pivot well against other defensive Water-types such as Quagsire. Mantine's Scald and Toxic ensure it isn't overly passive, and it can more easily check physical attackers such as Silvally-Ground and Copperajah by crippling them with a burn. In addition, Mantine is not a sitting duck against traditional Water-type answers such as Toxicroak, Heliolisk, and Vileplume; its access to Hurricane and ability to easily fit Toxic set it apart from Vaporeon, which cannot viably run much to circumvent these checks due to its more restricted moveslots. However, Mantine's physical bulk is less than impressive, allowing threats such as Golurk and Tauros to easily muscle past it with the right coverage. Mantine is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off from many of the physical attackers it wants to pivot into, as its Stealth Rock weakness means it struggles even more to take hits after losing its item. Finally, though Mantine seems like it would be a good Defog user, it has difficulty effectively removing hazards because it is threatened by most of the tier's common Stealth Rock setters: Diancie and Stakataka can defeat it with their Rock-type STAB attacks, and Copperajah can muscle through it with Rock Slide and Power Whip.</p> ",

Water Veil makes Mantine immune to Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp and is especially good on teams that already possess good Water-type counterplay, but Water Absorb is usually preferred to beat Inteleon even more consistently.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-C and Heliolisk can switch into Mantine and gain momentum with Volt Switch as Mantine is forced out, and Heliolisk is also immune to Scald.

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninjask distinguishes itself with amazing Speed backed up by Speed Boost, making it an effective revenge killer and late-game cleaner, especially when combined with Swords Dance. Ninjask's STAB options also allow it to threaten massive damage or outright KOs on offensive Pokemon like Salazzle, Starmie, and Rotom-C. Even options that switch into Ninjask, like Copperajah and Mudsdale, fear repeated U-turn damage and the threats that use such opportunities to come in. However, Ninjask's average Attack leaves a lot to be desired, and it will struggle to break through bulkier teams without a hefty helping of team support. Furthermore, Ninjask's terrible bulk gives it very limited opportunities to set up, as it will take massive damage even from uninvested attacks. Lastly, the use of Acrobatics precludes Ninjask from wearing Heavy-Duty Boots, requiring Ninjask users to run steady entry hazard removal to keep it in play throughout the game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ninjask can opt to use Dual Wingbeat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Doing so greatly relieves the pressure to keep entry hazards off, making Ninjask easier to fit on teams and use. However, doing so sacrifices a lot of power, and Ninjask's sweeping potential and ability to force switches will sharply drop as a result.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock Users</strong>: Stealth Rock users like Diancie, Mudsdale, and Copperajah realistically won't drop to Acrobatics even with prior damage and easily take the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, making it hard for Ninjask to come in in the future. They also easily KO Ninjask with STAB moves or coverage.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Rock-types and Steel-types: Rock-types and Steel-types like Tyrantrum, Aerodactyl, and Escavalier use their STAB moves and coverage to force Ninjask to retreat while taking little from U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Flame Body and Intimidate users like bulky Talonflame and Arcanine can safely switch into Ninjask's unboosted attacks and proceed to threaten it with OHKOs or status. Furthermore, their slower pivoting options in U-turn and Teleport allow them to grab momentum from Ninjask. Note that Talonflame needs to be wary of a KO from +2 Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet: Users of Rocky Helmet or Aftermath such as Garbodor and Xatu can tack massive amounts of damage on Ninjask as it attacks, further reducing its ability to come in with Stealth Rock on the field. The extra damage also greatly hampers Ninjask's ability to sweep, as setting up becomes more dangerous and it becomes more susceptible to priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak users such as Arcanine, Toxicroak, and Decidueye can give Ninjask quite the headache, as its terrible bulk means it has a hard time enduring such moves. Fake Out and First Impression are ineffective, though, as Ninjask will just block these moves with Protect.</p> ",

Protect is useful for scouting the moves of Choice Scarf users such as Passimian and Rotom-C; the Speed Boost accumulated on such turns allows Ninjask to outpace them. 168 EVs allow Ninjask to outpace Choice Scarf Tyrantrum without needing to use Protect; with this Speed, Ninjask is also able to outspeed certain threats at +2, such as Agility Kingdra.

Furthermore, unlike other wallbreakers with a somewhat average Speed tier, Absol's access to Sucker Punch gives it extra security against frail revenge killers like Salazzle, Heliolisk, and Starmie. Defensively, though, Absol offers very little despite its typing being passable; it just lacks the bulk to make use of its resistances to Ghost and Dark as much as its main competition in Guzzlord, which is much bulkier and has an even better defensive typing. As a result, Absol also struggles getting into battle without aggressive play and pivot support, limiting the amount of chances it has to wallbreak.

Choice Band sets cannot switch between moves but have great raw power and lack the constant chip damage of Life Orb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Toxicroak is one of the better offensive checks to Absol because it resists Dark and Fighting and easily dispatches Absol with Drain Punch. Other Fighting-types like Sirfetch'd, Machamp, and Passimian can deal with Absol too, with the former also having First Impression to avoid sustaining major damage from Absol, but they're much more vulnerable to Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Mudsdale has the raw bulk to take multiple attacks from Absol and beat it one-on-one with Earthquake.

Do note, though, that because of how fragile Absol is, Iron Tail's miss chance is even more punishing and it's very hard to find good setup opportunities with Swords Dance. A Jolly nature is usually advised so Absol always outpaces Decidueye and Sirfetch'd, but Adamant lets it always OHKO Heliolisk with Sucker Punch and lowers the amount of chip damage necessary to secure a KO against other revenge killers like Salazzle.</p> <p>Because of Absol's poor defenses, it greatly appreciates the support of pivots to get it in safely.

Gigalith's great all-around defensive stats allow it multiple opportunities to set up sand. Furthermore, it can check Salazzle, Dragalge, and Talonflame while having utility with moves like Stealth Rock and Toxic. However, its abysmal Speed usually means it must take a hit before moving. When combined with damage on the switch, status, and no reliable recovery, Gigalith can be worn down deceptively quickly, especially since it's weak to STAB or coverage moves from Pokemon such as Machamp, Blastoise, and Diancie. Gigalith is also difficult to teambuild around due to almost exclusively fitting on dedicated sand teams, and these teams demand extensive support to execute a successful sweep.</p> ",

However, Toxicroak can be OHKOed by Earthquake after taking damage from Stealth Rock and sand.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Vaporeon does not take much damage from any of Gigalith's attacks and can use it to pass Wish to its teammates, fish for burns with Scald, or remove status with Heal Bell. More offensive Water-types, like Blastoise and Kingdra, can avoid the 2HKO from any of its attacks and use it to set up; however, the combination of Toxic poison and sand damage severely limits their sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Vileplume's immunity to Toxic and great defensive stats mean it can easily recover from any of Gigalith's attacks via Strength Sap, whittle it down with Giga Drain, or even use it as setup fodder. Tsareena and Dhelmise can easily use Rapid Spin against it, while Decidueye can set up Swords Dance on it, but all of them dislike taking Toxic upon switching in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Mudsdale and Palossand can cripple Gigalith with Toxic and set up Stealth Rock freely, while offensive Ground-types, like Golurk, Silvally-Ground, and Rhydon, can switch in on any of Gigalith's moves and fire off a powerful attack. None of them appreciate taking Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Although Gigalith does not mind paralysis due to its already terrible Speed, its longevity is severely hampered by poison and burn, with the latter also hurting its ability to damage Xatu as it switches in.

However, Scrafty is completely countered by defensive Sylveon, which makes it deadweight in that fairly common matchup. Additionally, it can be a sitting duck for the tier's many threatening Fighting-types and requires a lot of team support to make up for the switch-in opportunities it often gives Sirfetch'd, Toxicroak, and Machamp.

While Doublade is powerful after Swords Dance, it is also not exceedingly difficult to wall, with bulky Pokemon like Mantine, Talonflame, and Mudsdale able to take it on, and it is easy to revenge kill due to its over-reliance on a relatively weak Shadow Sneak to handle faster threats.</p> ",

Toxic punishes walls that Doublade baits in such as Mudsdale and Arcanine but diminishes its offensive potential.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off: Powerful Knock Off users such as Escavalier, Toxicroak, and Machamp are very dangerous for Doublade to take on, opening it up by hitting it hard and removing its Eviolite.

Salazzle and Inteleon can both OHKO it after Stealth Rock with their STAB moves, and Heliolisk and Rotom-C can exploit it for pivoting opportunities. Strong resisted special STAB moves from the likes of Dragalge, Exploud, and Choice Specs Sylveon also potentially 2HKO Doublade. Indeedee-F is especially problematic, 2HKOing Doublade with Expanding Force or a coverage move, disrupting it with Trick, and nullifying Shadow Sneak with Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Mantine, Weezing, and Talonflame are excellent answers to Doublade, as they can all take hits from +2 Doublade and turn it into fodder by burning it. The uncommon Arcanine fully counters Doublade, taking any hit with ease due to Intimidate and hitting back hard with Flamethrower. While Vaporeon does not appreciate taking +2 Close Combat, it is also a workable check in a pinch if it can produce a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Mudsdale checks Doublade well at full health due to Stamina, but it can be a shaky answer because it is easily worn down and can only 3HKO with Earthquake.

Golurk can survive an unboosted Shadow Sneak and threaten huge damage with a STAB move, while Silvally-Ground easily takes a boosted Shadow Sneak and OHKOes Doublade with +2 Multi-Attack after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Sirfetch'd: In addition to carrying Knock Off, Sirfetch'd is the only physical attacker in the tier that can outright OHKO Doublade through Eviolite thanks to Scrappy and its nuclear Choice Band-boosted or critical hit Close Combat.

    "overview": "<p>Tsareena's an incredible spinner and matches up well against common Stealth Rock setters like Mudsdale and Diancie. In addition, it's very effective at forcing in Talonflame and removing its Heavy-Duty Boots and a great pivot that synergizes with some of NU's best wallbreakers because of the Pokemon it draws in. Despite offering so much role compression, though, Tsareena faces heavy competition from Rotom-C, a Pokemon that fills many of the same roles as it but with more efficiency and defensive utility. Many teams opt for Choice Scarf Rotom-C as their entry hazard remover because it can double as a revenge killer too, and Tsareena lacking that function makes building with it awkward at times. Also, Tsareena can't make very good use of its resistances because Pokemon it'd otherwise switch into well, like Silvally-Ground and Starmie, simply outspeed and heavily damage or KO it the following turn with their coverage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aromatherapy can be used if your team is particularly weak to status ailments, but Tsareena loses to common status inflictors like Talonflame and Vileplume, which makes it an inconsistent cleric. High Jump Kick fits well on sets more dedicated to maximizing Tsareena's coverage while hitting Stakataka and Copperajah extremely hard; a set of Power Whip / Triple Axel / High Jump Kick / Rapid Spin with Wide Lens is a good example of this, but losing Knock Off's utility is very punishing against foes like Weezing and Talonflame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types: Weezing completely shuts down Tsareena, chipping at it with Rocky Helmet and maintaining Toxic Spikes against it. Toxicroak and Drapion outspeed it and can take a hit if needed. Vileplume can switch into any move other than Triple Axel and beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Salazzle and Talonflame switch into Power Whip easily, but Knock Off severely cripples them both; in addition, Salazzle is at risk of losing to Tsareena after minimal chip damage if it switches in on Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Other than Copperajah, Tsareena struggles against most Steel-types. Escavalier walls it with ease and wins any exchange, although Knock Off is bothersome for Toxic + Protect variants. Stakataka takes even Power Whip well and can keep Stealth Rock up against Tsareena because of how much damage its Gyro Ball does. Even Duraludon can be problematic for Tsareena because it outspeeds and heavily damages Tsareena with Draco Meteor.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Knock Off prevents Rocky Helmet users like Xatu, Weezing, and Vileplume from constantly punishing Tsareena for pivoting, denies foes like Escavalier their Leftovers recovery, and greatly cripples Talonflame. It also prevents Dhelmise and Decidueye from safely spinblocking Tsareena. U-turn keeps momentum up against common defensive answers like Vileplume and Escavalier, applying constant pressure with offensive teammates like Indeedee-F and Salazzle that beat them. Alternatively, Triple Axel makes Tsareena a good lure for Dragon- and Grass-types like Guzzlord and Vileplume, although it mandates Protective Pads as Tsareena's item for foes like Flame Body Talonflame and Rocky Helmet users. Synthesis is another option that helps keep Tsareena healthy, staving off damage from pivots like Rotom-C and Silvally-Ground and making it easier to run other items. In particular, Yache Berry makes Tsareena an effective emergency check to Blastoise and other offensive Water-types, whereas forgoing an item gives Tsareena an immunity to Golurk's and Decidueye's Poltergeists.</p> <p>Indeedee-F and Silvally-Ground are great teammates, capitalizing on Tsareena drawing in Poison-types and pivoting them in with U-turn. Indeedee-F pairs particularly well with it because of Healing Wish, which reduces the need to run Synthesis. Other pivots like Talonflame, Silvally-Ground, and Togedemaru are good partners too, creating VoltTurn loops that can do a great job of swinging momentum in your favor. Talonflame also benefits from Tsareena's Rapid Spin support making Knock Off less detrimental to its longevity. Tsareena's a bad defensive answer to Water-types like Starmie, Blastoise, and Araquanid because of its middling bulk and vulnerability to their coverage, so make sure to pair it with Pokemon like Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Dragalge; the former two also provide it much-wanted cleric support.</p> "

Copperajah is also a fine Stealth Rock setter because it retains a significant offensive presence even with minimal investment, giving it plenty of chances to force foes out and set its entry hazard. Copperajah's biggest flaw, however, is how poor its longevity is. It is heavily reliant on Wish support to stay healthy and is prone to getting repeatedly weakened by pivoting moves from foes like Rotom-C, Heliolisk, and Ninjask, forcing it to cede momentum.
