Adaptability Luster Purge consistently OHKOes common slower offensive Pokemon like Zapdos without dropping Latios's Special Attack, but Trick can cripple an opposing Chansey or Deoxys-D or disrupt a setup sweeper like Cresselia. Adaptability provides the most overall power to the set, letting it reliably 2HKO common RegenVest pivots like Swampert and Manaphy with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens lets it 2HKO Meloetta and Empoleon with Psyshock and have a good chance to OHKO Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor. Latios pairs well with fast cleaners like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Electrode, as they can readily take advantage of the opposing RegenVest user being removed from the match. Strong physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and the Ogerpon formes appreciate Latios bringing them in safely with Flip Turn and even chunking their checks like Corviknight that may try to eat a predicted Psyshock. Latios invites in powerful Dark-type revenge killers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao, making robust checks to these such as Fluffy Corviknight and Regenerator Primarina mandatory.

Adaptability is more consistent, as it is always active and does not announce itself, while Hadron Engine can support Electric-types and Surge Surfer users, disrupt opposing terrain from the likes of Azelf and Deoxys-S, and let Latios OHKO Corviknight with Thunderbolt. Trick is an option in the last slot to shut down bulky setup sweepers like Cresselia and cripple walls like Deoxys-D. Latios works best with slow pivots like Corviknight and Swampert that can get it onto the field in advantageous positions; similarly, Latios often provides easy entry to slow, wallbreaking teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge with Flip Turn. Latios is heavily threatened by Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, as they discourage it from using its Psychic-type moves and can even threaten it thanks to priority moves and Choice Scarf, respectively.

Recover provides additional longevity, allowing Latios to switch in against foes such as Heatran and Pecharunt and threaten to wallbreak multiple times in a single game. Calm Mind allows Latios to set up against passive foes such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Soul Dew notably makes Adaptability Draco Meteor a guaranteed 2HKO on Corviknight after a Calm Mind, but Leftovers is an option to give Latios more longevity. Adaptability is the preferred ability for consistent high damage, allowing Latios to reliably 2HKO Blissey and RegenVest Swampert with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens is an option to threaten an OHKO on Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor after a Calm Mind and 2HKO Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with Psyshock after a boost. Latios works fantastically with other powerful special attackers such as Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Azelf, as they all appreciate RegenVest users and Blissey being weakened. Latios also appreciates slow, physically bulky pivots such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and physically defensive Manaphy, who which can both pivot it in safely and effectively check the offensive Dark-types that threaten Latios such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao.

Many of the best physical walls such as Corviknight and Manaphy survive by barely avoiding 2HKOs, which they fail to when switching into Future Sight as well, while others like Iron Hands, Great Tusk, and Pecharunt take far too much damage from Future Sight anyway. Doom Desire is an alternative with no immunities that also hits Scream Tail harder but otherwise has worse coverage against relevant targets. Psychic Noise denies recovery to Empoleon and Corviknight and punishes aggressive Iron Moth and Great Tusk switch ins. The last moveslot is extremely flexible; Thunderbolt for Corviknight, Iron Head for Scream Tail, Ice Punch for Dragonite, and Body Slam to fish for paralysis are some of the most notable options. Jirachi should be paired with physical wallbreakers on more offensive teams, as they best take advantage of its combination of slow pivoting and Future Sight. Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Zamazenta, Ceruledge, and the Ogerpon formes are excellent teammates that also appreciate Jirachi switching into fast Psychic-types like Deoxys-S and Azelf attempting to revenge kill them. Jirachi is weak to several common special attackers, most notably primal weather users like Iron Moth and Primarina, and Ghost-types such as Gengar and Gholdengo, so teammates that can offensively check them like other primal weather users and Roaring Moon are greatly appreciated. Since Jirachi is wholly dependent on Regenerator for recovery, it appreciates entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight to maximize that recovery.</p>"

Teleport can be used in conjunction with Deoxys-D's low Speed to safely switch Pokemon in, while Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Iron Boulder and Dragonite. Leftovers is the preferred item for extra longevity, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on Teleport sets to enable easier pivoting. On teams that do not need setup control, Fluffy and Intimidate dramatically increase its physical bulk versus key targets like Iron Boulder. Defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Mandibuzz appreciate Deoxys-D being able to take on setup threats such as Iron Hands and Iron Boulder, allowing them to better handle Dark-types like Roaring Moon. Offensive Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Chien-Pao, and Ceruledge appreciate Deoxys-D being able to weaken opposing walls with hazards or Knock Off, as well as potentially getting them in safely if it's running Teleport.

Psychic works well with Sheer Force variants, but Psycho Boost can be used when going with Hadron Engine; the former's reliability and spammability can be forgone for the latter's immediate sheer power, reaching feats such as straight up OHKOing the Ogerpon formes, Moltres, and potentially Garganacl. Ice Beam reliably hits Latios and otherwise problematic Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, Meowscarada, and Mandibuzz super effectively while additionally being capable of OHKOing Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Zapdos without suffering Psycho Boost drops, especially since the last two can withstand a Psychic. Thunderbolt hits non-Volt Absorb Empoleon and Corviknight, while Energy Ball handles RegenVest Swampert, with either move covering for RegenVest Manaphy and Primarina. Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, non-Bulletproof Empoleon, and Kingambit and pressures Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu better than Ice Beam, notably OHKOing the former and potentially the latter. Shadow Ball deals with non-Bullet Proof Gholdengo and Scream Tail. Sheer Force works well in tandem with Life Orb, keeping Deoxys-S healthy to repeatedly wallbreak. On top of the slightly higher power boost, Hadron Engine is an alternative that trades longevity for Electric Terrain-boosted Thunderbolts; notably, it makes sure that the move can OHKO physically defensive Corviknight and Mandibuzz, has significant odds to 2HKO even specially defensive RegenVest Manaphy, and is strong enough to 2HKO Scream Tail after minor chip damage and defensive Gholdengo, especially Bulletproof variants of the latter.</p> <p>Deoxys-S finds a home on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking and cleaning prowess. Slow defensive pivots like Swampert, Manaphy, and Corviknight are valuable supporting pieces; aside from bringing Deoxys-S into the field safely, they can switch into and check Choice Scarf and priority users like Roaring Moon, Latios, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit looking to revenge kill it. Additionally, Swampert and Manaphy can use Knock Off to make opposing RegenVest users like Manaphy and Swampert easier for Deoxys-S to break down, while Corviknight provides entry hazard removal to let Deoxys-S come in repeatedly. Other hazard removal options include Great Tusk and Iron Treads; the former can also check Kingambit, Ceruledge, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon that can revenge kill Deoxys-S, while the latter switches into Gholdengo and Scream Tail if Deoxys-S lacks the appropriate coverage to threaten them. Offensive pivots like Roaring Moon, Cinderace, and Meowscarada are similarly useful to bring Deoxys-S in safely, as they tend to invite in physical walls like Great Tusk, Pecharunt, and Skarmory that it feasts on. What they lack in defensive profile is made up for by their ability to pressure common Deoxys-S checks like Gholdengo, Heatran, and RegenVest Swampert, especially if it lacks the corresponding coverage; other physical wallbreakers like Zamazenta and Chien-Pao are thus similarly helpful in this regard. These offensive threats can also overwhelm shared checks in Scream Tail, Ting-Lu, and Mandibuzz together with Deoxys-S, letting either of them take over the game more easily. Entry hazards from setters like Garchomp, Heatran, and Great Tusk can take advantage of the switches Deoxys-S forces and are great at chipping down its checks, namely the RegenVest users that cannot afford Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

RegenVest Manaphy can afford to use a different EV spread than the maximized ones here if looking to survive specific rolls. A physically defensive set with 200 Speed EVs may be considered to outspeed and better check Great Tusk, but it is usually not worth losing the slower U-turn or the extra bulk investment. Dazzling Gleam is interchangeable with Alluring Voice; the former checks Throat Chop Roaring Moon, and the latter dissuades setup sweepers and hits Substitute users. Psychic is an option in the final moveslot to dissuade Iron Moth and Pecharunt from switching in while still hitting Zamazenta, whereas Ice Beam can be used to hit Zapdos and Desolate Land Landorus, but the other options are generally considered better. Alternatively, a physically defensive Regenerator set with Rocky Helmet and Take Heart is an option to act as a bulky wincon while still checking physical attackers, but this Manaphy set is easily forced out by special attackers without a boost and may struggle to find setup opportunities. Tail Glow sets may consider running Primordial Sea and Weather Ball for the additional power and being able to hit Desolate Land users, but this set becomes extremely slow and easier to switch around or pressure out. Tail Glow sets can also consider running Scald, trading some damage for additional utility and the chance to burn something before fainting, but the drop in power isn't worth sacrificing for. Hydro Pump is another option on these sets for additional power, notably 3HKOing Empoleon after a Tail Glow boost, but the reduced PP and accuracy is usually not worth it. Alternatively, hyper offense teams can run a potent set with Fluffy, Unaware, or an immunity ability alongside Take Heart, Acid Armor, and Stored Power to muscle through checks like even opposing RegenVest users, Heatran, and Empoleon after enough boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Moves</strong>: Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Pokemon with Electric-type moves like Deoxys-S, Latios, and Gholdengo are often able to muscle through non-Motor Drive Manaphy even with an Assault Vest and maximum Special Defense investment.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land Users</strong>: Aside from Knock Off, most Manaphy sets lack any effective tools against Desolate Land users like Iron Moth, Moltres, and Heatran, giving them free switch-in opportunities to either set up entry hazards or threaten Manaphy with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Even the most physically defensive Manaphy sets can't reliably deal with Meowscarada or the Ogerpon formes, and Hisuian Electrode is a major annoyance for any spread.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Without Take Heart, Manaphy is extremely vulnerable to passive damage in the form of Toxic from Iron Moth, Pecharunt, or Mandibuzz. Likewise, Manaphy is worn down extremely quickly by entry hazards set by the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Scream Tail.</p>",

Manaphy is able to comfortably switch in and scout dangerous special attackers like Scream Tail, Azelf, and Gholdengo and, when running the more physically bulky spread, powerful wallbreakers like Chien-Pao, Cinderace, and Great Tusk. Knock Off is notable for threatening decent damage against Gholdengo and removing key items like Assault Vest and Heavy-Duty Boots from would-be switch-ins like opposing Manaphy, Iron Moth, and Moltres. While obviously used for slow pivoting, U-turn is also able to threaten an OHKO on Meowscarada, which would otherwise switch in easily. Alluring Voice is the most common final move for its ability to threaten Latios, Zamazenta, and non-Throat Chop Roaring Moon, but Energy Ball is an option to smack opposing Manaphy, Swampert, and Primarina. An EV spread with full Defense investment is the most common spread, turning Manaphy into a potent mixed wall that can check Cinderace, Great Tusk, and non-Choice Band Roaring Moon while still acting as a solid secondary check to special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Primarina, and Gholdengo; it can also choose to run a full Special Defense-invested set to more solidly check these nuclear special attackers.</p> <p>RegenVest Manaphy is renowned for being able to sturdy up the defensive backbone of almost any team style, but balance and bulky offense teams tend to benefit the most from its presence. Manaphy is excellent at taking hits from powerful wallbreakers like Roaring Moon, Primarina, and Gholdengo and pivoting out with U-turn, so frail wallbreakers like Chien-Pao, Sandy Shocks, and Deoxys-S naturally appreciate its ability to eat a hit then bring them in damage-free. Similarly, Manaphy can be an asset to slower wallbreakers like Gholdengo and Primarina that appreciate its hit-taking capability. Corviknight is the most classic pairing with Manaphy, with both defensive and specially defensive sets able to shore up Manaphy's less-invested stat. If running physically defensive Manaphy, a sturdier check to powerful Choice Band users like Roaring Moon, Zamazenta, and Meowscarada is necessary; consider Skarmory, Great Tusk, or especially Pecharunt as a teammate. Similarly, any RegenVest Manaphy set appreciates a Steel-type special wall like Heatran, Iron Treads, or specially defensive Gholdengo that can help versus threats like Zapdos, Sheer Force Deoxys-S, and Latios. Manaphy is especially vulnerable to getting worn down by entry hazards and being overwhelmed by foes if it loses its Assault Vest, so hazard removers like Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Great Tusk are mandatory teammates, with the latter two doubling as Knock Off absorbers.</p>"

Protosynthesis + Booster Energy grants Manaphy a one-time Speed boost, preventing would-be revenge killers in Roaring Moon, Scream Tail, and Zamazenta from forcing it out. Surge Surfer allows Manaphy to gain a greater Speed boost, allowing it to outspeed even Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Azelf while electric terrain is active at the caveat of requiring teammates with Hadron Engine. Electric Seed makes it harder to revenge kill Manaphy when using Surge Surfer, while Life Orb boosts Manaphy's damage output. Motor Drive allows Manaphy to surprise and turn the tables on Electric-types like Sandy Shocks and Regieleki and gain a free Speed boost, trading in consistency for the potential of multiple activations and defensive utility.</p> <p>Tail Glow Manaphy fits best on hyper offensive teams due to their nature of being fast-paced and possessing strong setup sweepers. Although Manaphy has immense damage potential, it is unable to muscle past counters like RegenVest Hisuian Goodra, Desolate Land Heatran, and if not using Psychic, Iron Moth. Thus, teammates who can threaten them and use them as setup fodder pair well with Manaphy, making IronPress Zamazenta, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, and Double Dance Iron Crown good partners. Manaphy also appreciates dedicated leads that hyper offense teams employ, like Ribombee and Dual Screens Corviknight; the former shutting down revenge killing attempts from foes like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Azelf, which would outspeed Manaphy even after a Speed boost, and the latter allowing Manaphy to set up safely, allowing it to brute force its way through the opposing team.

Will-O-Wisp further weakens these special walls, forcing them to be worn down over time and notably enabling Hisuian Zoroark's Hex to break past them; it also cripples physical threats like Great Tusk and Iron Hands. U-turn allows Hisuian Zoroark to generate free momentum for its team while forcing its switch-ins to take chip damage from entry hazards as it pivots out, whereas Taunt denies Blissey and Empoleon recovery. Hisuian Zoroark should be paired with offensive entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks, Pixilate Scream Tail, and Galvanize Kommo-o that can keep up the pressure on hazard removers to maximize its ability to wear the opposing team down over time. Sturdy checks to offensive threats that force Hisuian Zoroark out like Roaring Moon, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Azelf are needed, so good teammates that can stave them off like Great Tusk and Empoleon are recommended.</p>"

Cinderace can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple would-be switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Garchomp, Swampert, and Dragonite, pivot out on them with U-turn, or carry Gunk Shot for maximum coverage. Swords Dance helps Cinderace wallbreak, while Taunt prevents foes from inflicting status, recovering, or controlling entry hazards, which Cinderace can control itself with Court Change. In particular, Taunt improves Cinderace's matchup against Unaware users such as Mandibuzz and Scream Tail by prohibiting their recovery. Life Orb amplifies Cinderace's damage output, while Focus Sash provides recourse against Pokemon that would otherwise OHKO it, allowing it to score surprise KOs or get off valuable utility moves in a pinch. Magic Guard removes Life Orb recoil, the chance for Focus Sash to be broken by indirect damage, and Cinderace's vulnerability to Entry Hazard damage. Cinderace's ability to pressure Corviknight and Skarmory is appreciated by other wallbreakers that can struggle to deal with them like Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, and Barraskewda, all of which Cinderace can help enter the field with U-turn. Cinderace is threatened by faster Pokemon like Zamazenta and Deoxys-S, so defensive Pokemon that can switch into these such as Empoleon, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz are helpful partners. Well-Baked Body Gholdengo completely walls Cinderace, making partners that can force out or eliminate it like Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Gengar valuable teammates.</p>"

Prankster-boosted Taunt allows Corviknight to shut down foes like Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Regieleki from setting their entry hazards or own dual screens; stop Cinderace and opposing Corviknight from removing its dual screens with Court Change and Defog; prevent offensive threats like Zamazenta, all Ogerpon formes, and Iron Boulder from using it as setup fodder; block Trick from Choice item users like Scream Tail and Gholdengo from crippling it; and additionally stop defensive Pokemon like Gholdengo, Scream Tail, and non-Prankster Pecharunt from healing freely, letting its teammates overwhelm them more easily. U-turn makes use of Corviknight's middling Speed tier to support its teammates by bringing them in safely after stomaching an attack, and it's especially valuable against Dark-type foes like Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Taunt Roaring Moon that can otherwise set up in front of or even shut down Corviknight.</p> <p>Corviknight is exclusively found on dual screens hyper offense teams. As a result, high caliber offensive threats like Tail Glow Manaphy, IronPress Zamazenta, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon pair well with it, as they appreciate Corviknight bringing them in safely through U-turn and its dual screens to set up more easily. However, Double Dance sweepers such as Iron Crown and Galarian Moltres benefit from said dual screens even more, as they require multiple turns of setup before wreaking havoc. Other setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Iron Hands, and Kingambit have the added benefit of threatening Cinderace and Defoggers like opposing Corviknight and Mandibuzz—especially since Mandibuzz can use Defog freely even in the face of Corviknight—preventing them any free opportunities of ever removing Corviknight's dual screens. Since other foes like Zapdos, Iron Moth, and Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit can also use Corviknight as entry points, teammates that can come in afterwards to either threaten or use them as setup fodder are also beneficial, with the aforementioned Iron Boulder, Deoxys-S, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk capable of doing so.

Corviknight can also be overwhelmed by neutral special attacks from Gholdengo and Primarina, so it needs backup from RegenVest users like Manaphy and Swampert.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Attack boosted further by Sword of Ruin, strong STAB combination, and access to priority moves, Choice Band Chien-Pao is one of the metagame's deadliest wallbreakers and revenge killers. On top of a valuable Speed tier to threaten and chase out common tier staples like Roaring Moon, Cinderace, and Iron Boulder, it has the immediate power to 2HKO walls like physically defensive Manaphy as well as Fluffy Corviknight and Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Sacred Sword immediately threatens Steel-type foes such as Kingambit, Cobalion, Heatran, and Iron Treads. Either priority move allows Chien-Pao to revenge kill faster threats like Hisuian Electrode and Choice Scarf Latios; Sucker Punch is more punishable but targets non-Psychic Surge Deoxys-S, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Agility Iron Crown hard, while Ice Shard handles foes like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and weakened Zamazenta.</p> <p>Though it can function on a wide range of team styles, Chien-Pao fits best on fast-paced offensive teams that can best take advantage of its wallbreaking prowess while mitigating its lack of defensive utility. Powerful special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Gholdengo, and Primarine stand out as star teammates for their ability to immediately threaten physical walls like physically defensive Manaphy, Skarmory, and Iron Hands that can give Chien-Pao trouble. Also notable are Latios, Iron Moth, and Iron Crown, which are powerful special pivots able to bring Chien-Pao in to threaten their switch-ins like Swampert, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon. Chien-Pao also works well in tandem with other powerful wallbreakers like Roaring Moon, Zamazenta, and Iron Boulder, with Chien-Pao wearing down their checks like non-Intimidate Corviknight, Landorus, and Pecharunt, while its teammates pressure Manaphy, Iron Hands, and defensive Primarina. Bulky pivots like Pecharunt, Swampert, and Corviknight can also make good teammates, tanking hits and allowing the frail Chien-Pao to more easily get on the field against foes like Roaring Moon, Zapdos, and Scream Tail; Pecharunt is especially notable for its ability to wall Zamazenta, which is otherwise a great check to Chien-Pao, while Corviknight alongside Great Tusk and Iron Treads are noteworthy for their entry hazard removing capabilities, making it far easier for Chien-Pao to repeatedly hit the field.</p>"

Acrobatics is an additional option with Weakness Policy or a Terrain Seed to nail Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Lash Out is an option to punish Intimidate users like Corviknight and Skarmory, while Fire Blast and Fire Fang can heavily threaten Fluffy users, but usually, Knock Off and U-turn threaten them enough with entry hazard support. Offensive sets can run Roost to provide longevity and offset chip damage, Taunt to shut down Corviknight, or Iron Head to nail Scream Tail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Zamazenta, Deoxys-S, and Meowscarada outspeed non-Choice Scarf Roaring Moon variants and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dark-resistant Foes</strong>: Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Kingambit all can take Roaring Moon's STAB attacks and threaten it back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Non-Magic Guard Roaring Moon variants struggle heavily with chip damage, as they frequently switch and typically lack recovery.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Roaring Moon is crippled by burn and must be exceedingly cautions of switching into Fire-types that may carry Will-O-Wisp such as Heatran and Cinderace, as well as fearing Scald from Manaphy and Steam Eruption from Volcanion. It also fears the rare but punishing Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Roaring Moon relies heavily on its Speed tier and can be punished by Thunder Wave from Gholdengo and Hisuian Electrode, which it would otherwise switch in freely on. Zapdos can also threaten it with paralysis from Thunder or Zap Cannon. Roaring Moon is also greatly punished by the rare Static.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Roaring Moon's excellent Attack, Speed, and STAB coverage along with U-turn make it the premiere Choice item attacker. With Choice Scarf, Roaring Moon outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon, even Regieleki, and dangerous threats such Choice Scarf Latios and Gholdengo; only Choice Scarf Meowscarada outspeeds it. Choice Band Roaring Moon, on the other hand, is a ferocious wallbreaker that still outspeeds the crowded base 110 Speed tier, forcing out common Pokemon like the Ogerpon formes, Sandy Shocks, and Zapdos. Knock Off threatens to KO most offensive Pokemon while punishing switch-ins like Corviknight and Great Tusk with item removal. Outrage is an excellent late-game sweeping tool once Steel- and Fairy-types like Kingambit and Scream Tail have been weakened or removed. U-turn allows Roaring Moon to pivot out of bad matchups like Corviknight, safely revenge kill weakened offensive threats without prediction, and force switches from the opponent, hopefully through entry hazards after removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Earthquake hits Iron Hands and Kingambit, while Stone Edge hits Moltres and Zapdos and lets Choice Band sets do non-negligible damage to Fluffy Corviknight. Sword of Ruin provides the most damage and impacts all of Roaring Moon's moves, while Tough Claws retains its power against opposing Sword of Ruin users, namely Zamazenta, and does not reveal itself on the switch in.</p> <p>Roaring Moon fits best on balance and offensive teams that can take advantage of its power, Speed, and pivoting abilities and may also appreciate its defensive profile to help slow down certain key threats like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Electrode, and Gholdengo. Due to its frequent pivoting and lack of recovery, Roaring Moon abhors entry hazards, making Corviknight, Iron Treads, or Great Tusk nearly required as a teammate. Special walls like Manaphy can switch into special attacks aimed at Roaring Moon and appreciate its resistances to Electric, Ghost, and Psychic taking some of the pressure off of them as well. On the flip side, Roaring Moon forces frequent switches and removes Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, making hazard-stacking teammates like Sandy Shocks, Great Tusk, and Skarmory excellent options. Fluffy walls, especially Corviknight, can give Roaring Moon a hard time, so strong Fire-type teammates like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge are excellent options. Roaring Moon does not appreciate bulky Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta, so it appreciates teammates that threaten them like Scream Tail and Deoxys-S. Roaring Moon pairs extremely well with other offensive pivots; it can team with special pivots like Iron Moth and Latios to bring each other in in favorable matchups or with physical pivots like Meowscarada and Cinderace to wear down their shared checks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Roaring Moon leverages a solid defensive typing with plenty of resistances alongside great Speed, Attack, bulk, and access to U-turn to be a great offensive RegenVest pivot, gluing together balance and bulky offense teams while bringing extra utility in the form of Knock Off. Earthquake is a solid coverage option that threatens Steel-type foes like Heatran, Iron Treads, and Hisuian Goodra as well as Iron Hands. Stone Edge is preferred as the final move for its ability to hit Zapdos and Moltres super effectively and Corviknight neutrally, but Dragon Tail gives Roaring Moon extra utility against setup sweepers like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Ursaluna-B, forcing them out. Throat Chop is an option as a secondary STAB move that notably disables Boomburst from Pixilate Scream Tail and Parting Shot from Pecharunt. 192 Speed EVs guarantee that Roaring Moon will outspeed Thundurus and non-Choice Scarf Scream Tail, with the rest put into Special Defense to increase Roaring Moon's bulk. Alternatively, a set with maximum Speed investment can be used to Speed tie with Cinderace and opposing Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Roaring Moon fits best on pivot-heavy balance and offense teams that can take advantage of its typing and Speed to form potent VoltTurn cores while making its only decent bulk less of an issue. Roaring Moon struggles to check powerful Dragon- and Fairy-types like Latios, Primarina, and, if not running Throat Chop, Scream Tail, making a secondary specially defensive Pokemon like Iron Treads, Empoleon, or Heatran a great partner; in return, Roaring Moon naturally walls foes like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Sandy Shocks that can give these Steel-types issues. Roaring Moon is also easily forced out by powerful physical attackers like Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and opposing offensive variants of Roaring Moon, making a physical wall like Pecharunt, Corviknight, or your own Great Tusk perfect partners. The last two are also notable for being the tier's best entry hazard removal options, helping to shore up Roaring Moon's relative weakness to entry hazards. Powerful offensive threats like Great Tusk, Latios, and Gholdengo all appreciate Roaring Moon's ability to aggressively scout the opponent's move and pivot them in safely, with the last two especially appreciating Roaring Moon's ability to remove Assault Vest from opposing Manaphy ​and Swampert.</p>"

Knock Off lets it threaten Desolate Land users such as Iron Moth, Ceruledge, and Heatran, while Play Rough picks off Dragon-types such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Latios.

Ogerpon-W pairs well with fast cleaners such as Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, as they appreciate its ability to pressure Fluffy users such as Corviknight and Great Tusk thanks to Ivy Cudgel not making contact.

Knock Off can hinder switch-ins like Intimidate Corviknight and Dragonite. Play Rough stops Dragonite from being a safe switch-in, as well as surprising Roaring Moon that try to switch in with an OHKO. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out on bad matchups like the aforementioned Intimidate Corviknight and Dragonite. Stomping Tantrum hits Water-immune foes such as Water Absorb Heatran and Desolate Land Iron Moth and Ceruledge. Primordial Sea boosts Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels, consistently 2HKOing non-Intimidate Corviknight while also giving Ogerpon-W a Fire immunity. Sword of Ruin is an alternative option to boost the power of all of Ogerpon-W's moves, notably OHKOing physically defensive Manaphy with Power Whip. Ogerpon-W pairs well with teammates like Zamazenta and Iron Boulder that can break through non-Fluffy Corviknight. It also appreciates Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk and Scream Tail, as they discourage Pokemon like Dragonite from switching in and help chip down defensive Pokemon. While Ogerpon-W's Speed tier is good, it can still get easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta, so a strong defensive core featuring teammates such as Manaphy and Corviknight is appreciated.

Alternatively, Iron Defense benefits Body Press's damage output and renders Archaludon's matchup against physical setup sweepers better. As Archaludon forces switches with Dragon Tail, Stealth Rock further increases the chip damage it deals to the opposing team. Rocky Helmet lets Archaludon wear down pivots such as Barraskewda, Cinderace, and Roaring Moon. Archaludon covers a variety of physical attackers such as all Ogerpon formes, Roaring Moon, and Barraskewda, but it is overwhelmed by offensive wallbreakers like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Galarian Zapdos, so allies such as Fluffy Corviknight and Skarmory are much appreciated. Archaludon also appreciates Pokemon like Hisuian Electrode and the Ogerpon formes beating Swampert, which it can't make much progress against.

Earthquake smacks Desolate Land Iron Moth and Heatran attempting to come in on Electro Shot, while Body Press chunks checks like Blissey and Volt Absorb Empoleon. Primordial Sea allows Archaludon to offensively counter Iron Moth and grants it a one-turn Electro Shot. Additionally, Archaludon's good typing and natural physical bulk allow it to take on Zapdos and all Ogerpon formes in a pinch, but it should never be relied on to check them. Archaludon greatly struggles with its lack of Speed; as a result, fast offensive pivots that can bring it in safely like Roaring Moon, Azelf, and Walking Wake pair well with it, especially considering its ability to force hazard damage on their switch-ins, like Corviknight, Empoleon, and Manaphy. Archaludon's low Special Defense and Speed cause it to be susceptible to special attackers like Walking Wake, Azelf, and Pixilate Scream Tail, making pivots that can safely switch in to them like Empoleon, RegenVest Manaphy, and Swampert good partners.</p>"

Nasty Plot is an option to provide a bulky wincon on slower teams, but Pecharunt is extremely easy to force out by most special attackers.

Pecharunt is able to come in against a myriad of physical threats like Iron Hands, Zamazenta, and the Ogerpon formes to absorb their attacks and then pivot in a teammate safely with Parting Shot. It can even come in aggressively against foes like Great Tusk and Iron Boulder that pack super effective STAB moves; even if they used the correct move and deal significant damage, it can safely pivot out thanks to Prankster and Recover next time it comes in. Destiny Bond provides insurance against setup sweepers, especially Speed-boosting ones like Roaring Moon, and allows Pecharunt to trade itself at low health or in a poor matchup. Malignant Chain is the best attack due to its power and poison chance, which deters Dark-types like Meowscarada and non-Magic Guard Roaring Moon from switching in, but Shadow Ball and Night Shade are options to hit Steel-types and have significantly more PP for longer games. Since it should be pivoting frequently, Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item to dodge entry hazard chip damage. 0 Speed IVs allow Pecharunt to alternate between fast Destiny Bonds and slow attacks to almost always keep the effect active.</p> <p>Prankster Pecharunt works best on balance and offensive teams that want to safely switch in their offensive threats but still have some semblance of a defensive backbone. Frail but powerful teammates like Deoxys-S, Chien-Pao, and Iron Boulder love the relatively free switch ins Pecharunt provides after Parting Shot. Pecharunt pairs very well with RegenVest users like Manaphy and Swampert, as they both provide pivoting and blanket check special attackers; Parting Shot also gives them more opportunities to switch into weak attacks to heal with Regenerator. Pecharunt's bulk, Parting Shot, and Destiny Bond all force frequent switches, making entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Skarmory good teammates. Pecharunt struggles with Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao, as they block Parting Shot and can hit it hard, so a strong physically defensive switch-in like Intimidate Corviknight is recommended; powerful Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Great Tusk can also deter them. It is also worth noting that Prankster Pecharunt has extremely poor synergy with Psychic Surge users like Azelf and Deoxys-S, as they will block Parting Shot, so it should not be run with them.</p>"
