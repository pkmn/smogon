  "Necturna": {
    "overview": "<p>Necturna is CAP's most versatile Pokemon thanks to its access to one Sketch move, allowing it to perform a variety of roles, from spreading status to setting up entry hazards to being an offensive sweeper. With the addition of Sticky Web, King's Shield, and Spiky Shield in XY and Precipice Blades and Dragon Ascent in ORAS, Necturna got a whole host of new and dangerous toys to play with, giving the opponent even less of a chance of guessing which set it is running. It has the joint-second highest base stat total of all CAP Pokemon with an impressive base 120 Attack and Special Defense, which are complimented by a decent base 100 Defense. In addition, its base 81 Speed allows it to outspeed common base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Tomohawk, although it is still rather slow in comparison to most of the tier, which means it can be outsped and KOed by many common threats such as Colossoil and Cawmodore.</p> <p>However, its only ability, Forewarn, is rather poor; it allows you to see the foe's highest Base Power move. Although this does have some competitive use in that it allows you to scout to an extent, it can be tricked by moves with variable Base Power, most notably Knock Off, and it is often useless. Moreover, Necturna has a very mediocre base 85 Special Attack, preventing it from being able to take full advantage of its specially offensive Sketch moves. Most of all, it suffers from being weak to four forms of priority as well as Knock Off, limiting its use as a sweeper and allowing slower Pokemon to deal large amounts of damage to it. Lastly, it has a meager base 64 HP, meaning that its good defense stats are somewhat wasted.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially attacking set with Geomancy and Power Herb can also be used to boost Necturna's mediocre Special Attack to good levels, as well as give it insane Special Defense while still allowing it to outspeed most of the metagame. However, it is outclassed by Necturna's physical sets due to Necturna's superior Attack stat. Belly Drum is also an option, boosting Necturna's already impressive base 120 Attack to insane levels. However, Necturna is too slow pull it off as well as, for example, Cawmodore, and it is much easier to shut it down, especially if the opponent knows that it is running Belly Drum, unlike Necturna's other sets.</p> <p>King's Shield halves the foe's Attack and Spiky Shield hurts the foe when it tries to attack Necturna. These moves can force switches, stop sweeps, and get KOs if used correctly, although they are generally outclassed by other moves. Parting Shot gives Necturna the ability to carry momentum while also crippling opposing attackers, with the exception of Defiant Bisharp. Dark Void can be used instead of Spore to give Necturna the ability to send Grass-types to sleep at the cost of lower accuracy and no longer being immune to Magic Bounced or Rebounded sleep-inducing moves.</p> <p>Necturna also has options which do not use up its precious Sketch move; Gravity gives Necturna's teammates some support, allowing Ground-type moves to hit Flying-types, most notably Skarmory and Cawmodore, while Thunder Fang and Stone Edge provide Necturna with coverage. Pain Split can be used on the bulky sets as a viable form of recovery, and Necturna can also set up Toxic Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Cyclohm, Skarmory, and Tomohawk can wall Necturna's STAB moves with relative ease and can potentially stop Necturna's sweep or force it to switch out, allowing them to take control of the flow of the battle.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops Necturna's defensive variants from doing their job, preventing them from spreading status or setting up entry hazards and limiting them to just using Super Fang or other not very powerful STAB moves, more or less stopping them in their tracks.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority Moves</strong>: Flying-type spam, Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak are common priority moves that can stop Necturna in its tracks, severely damaging or KOing all variants, with the exception of Colbur Berry against Sucker Punch. Flying-type spam in particular, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, can cause massive problems for Necturna.</p>",

      "Defensive Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is extremely useful, as it slows down opposing threats and allows your Pokemon to win what would otherwise be Speed ties. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical sweepers, most notably Cawmodore, that try to use Necturna as setup bait, and it can be used on any physical threats in general. Shadow Sneak is a STAB priority move that allows Necturna to potentially KO Pokemon and avoid Sucker Punch. Power Whip is Necturna's strongest STAB, while Horn Leech can be used as an alternative as it gives Necturna a form of recovery, but the lower Base Power makes it much harder to KO Colossoil. Super Fang halves the HP of any Pokemon that isn't a Ghost-type, and can annoy Pokémon such as Chansey which would otherwise wall Necturna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Necturna is arguably the best Sticky Web setter in the CAP metagame, as it can also take advantage of its Ghost typing to block Rapid Spin. The 4 Speed EVs allow it to Speed creep other Necturna, while the Colbur Berry in tandem with 252 Defense EVs allow Necturna to set up Sticky Web even against Colossoil, as a Knock Off from Colossoil does less than 50% with Colbur Berry. Colbur Berry also gives Necturna an opportunity to hurt Colossoil back with Power Whip, which does around 85% even without any Attack investment.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe, a Calm nature, and Leftovers could be used, as Will-O-Wisp already deals with physical threats, but without the great physical investment, Necturna cannot stomach attacks from Colossoil.</p> <p>Focus Sash is one option, as it guarantees that Necturna can set up Sticky Web, but it is liable to getting broken by the ever-present Stealth Rock and other entry hazards. On the other hand, Focus Sash also allows Necturna to stop sweepers. Leftovers could be used to give Necturna passive recovery, but at the cost of Colbur Berry, which is essential against Colossoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Players will often predict a Sticky Web Necturna to lead and send in a Pokemon to lure the Sticky Web and then switch to Colossoil to Rebound it back, leaving you with Sticky Web on your side, as well as a potentially bad matchup. Predicting this correctly and hitting Colossoil with Power Whip on the switch-in allows you to set up Sticky Web and then potentially tank the second Knock Off and KO Colossoil. Similarly, Magic Bounce users, most notably Mega Sableye, can bounce back Sticky Web and Will-O-Wisp. Note that other Magic Bouncers do not appreciate being hit by Power Whip and Shadow Sneak, so they take a risk if they switch in.</p> <p>Predicting a Sucker Punch from Colossoil and other Sucker Punch users allows you to set up Sticky Web for free or cripple the opposing Colossoil with Will-O-Wisp, assuming it has Rebound and not Guts. On that note, be careful when using Will-O-Wisp on Colossoil, as you will gift them a 50% increase in Attack if they have Guts. On the other hand, many Pokemon that wall Necturna, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Cyclohm, don't appreciate a burn grinding down their health and, in some cases, crippling their attacking moves, so burning them on the switch-in can be a great nuisance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Obviously, Sticky Web Necturna is best on a team that appreciates Sticky Web, so Pokemon that lack a little bit of Speed, such as Choice Specs Sylveon and bulky offensive Pokemon, will benefit from the Speed drop that Sticky Web brings.</p> <p>Bisharp can be a good partner, as it covers four of Necturna's weaknesses while Necturna covers two of Bisharp's, although they are both weak to Fire, and Bisharp is rather frail. Bisharp discourages Defoggers from removing Sticky Web, as it can get a +2 Attack boost if it switches into Defog, and in return, Bisharp benefits from the Sticky Web Necturna sets up. Because opposing Bisharp can get a free +2 Attack boost through Sticky Web, it might be advisable to run a Bisharp counter, such as Haze Tomohawk or Unaware Arghonaut, which can take any of Bisharp's boosted attacks and/or counter it; Tomohawk also completely walls Colossoil, Necturna's arch-nemesis.</p> <p>Fire types such as Heatran and Mollux resist Power Whip and can absorb Will-O-Wisp (Heatran also gets the Flash Fire boost), allowing them to completely wall Necturna and KO it with their super effective Fire-type STAB moves, although they can't stop it from setting up Sticky Web. Therefore, a Mollux and Heatran counter may also be useful, the most prominent being Guts Colossoil which can also take out Chansey and other Fire-types that can take a Power Whip and heal off any burns that Necturna may have inflicted.</p> <p>Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as Sylveon, can help to counter the stronger specially attacking threats, which can KO Necturna and are not affected by burn's Attack drop. Necturna has a nasty weakness to Knock Off, but that can be alleviated by having a teammate that can take Knock Off, such as a Fairy- or Fighting-type. Necturna is weak to four forms of priority, and the most worrying of these is Flying-type spam, so a Flying-type spam check such as Cyclohm or Rotom-W, can be a great partner.</p>"

      "Bulky Band / Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The first moveslot contains your choice of a Grass-type STAB move: Power Whip is devastating but at the price of 85% accuracy, while Horn Leech gives recovery. Leaf Blade is a kind of compromise, with more power than Horn Leech but without the lowered accuracy of Power Whip. Shadow Sneak is a STAB priority move that is good for revenge killing and avoiding priority attacks from opposing Pokemon, while Shadow Claw is Necturna's only other physical Ghost-type STAB move.</p> <p>The Sketch moveslot is a choice between V-Create, Sacred Fire, and Dragon Ascent. Choice Banded V-Create allows Necturna to get some important KOs, such as OHKOs on Mega Metagross, Skarmory (ignoring Sturdy), and Kyurem-B (after Stealth Rock) and 2HKOs on Chansey and physically defensive Mega Venusaur. However, this comes at the cost of drops in both defenses and Speed and a lower accuracy than Sacred Fire. Dragon Ascent can used to lure in and OHKO Necturna's arch-nemesis, Tomohawk. Lastly, Sacred Fire works better on Life Orb sets and gives burn utility in return for losing some power.</p> <p>Precipice Blades or Earthquake can be used as alternatives to lure in and 2HKO Cyclohm and Heatran, both of which can deal with Necturna quite well otherwise. Bolt Strike can be used instead of Dragon Ascent, as Choice Band Bolt Strike has a 62.5% chance to OHKO Tomohawk after Stealth Rock and will 2HKO even if Tomohawk uses Reflect or Roost, although it has an unreliable 85% accuracy. It has the added advantages of beating Skarmory as well as Tomohawk with no defense drop at the cost of OHKOing Tomohawk and lower accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Necturna's good Attack stat and decent 64 / 100 / 120 bulk to be able to take hits and hit very hard. 116 EVs in Speed allow Necturna to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, most notably Colossoil, as well as maximum Speed Azumarill.</p> <p>Choice Band allows Necturna to hit extremely hard at the cost of being trapped into a single move, while Life Orb allows Necturna to change moves but provides residual damage and less power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sets without Horn Leech have no recovery, so only switch Necturna in when you are sure it won't get hurt too much or after one of its teammates has fainted, allowing it to revenge kill. Choice Banded V-Create hits anything that doesn't resist incredibly hard and pretty much guarantees KOs, but it lowers Necturna's defenses and Speed. If it is run, use V-Create to punch holes in the opposing team, then switch Necturna out. Dragon Ascent is in a similar position, except that it doesn't lower Necturna's Speed.</p> <p>Defensive walls such as Cyclohm, Skarmory, and Tomohawk can switch in and wall Necturna, as they all resist Necturna's Grass-type STAB moves and can take Shadow Claw fairly well too, although they don't like getting hit by Necturna's powerful Sketch moves. Cyclohm dislikes Precipice Blades, while Skarmory doesn't appreciate Bolt Strike, V-Create, and Sacred Fire, and Tomohawk hates Dragon Ascent and Bolt Strike.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Necturna appreciates Gothitelle, which can trap and remove physical walls such as Cyclohm, Skarmory, and non-Shed Shell/Baton Pass Tomohawk. Similarly, Magnezone can trap and remove Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Necturna also appreciates powerful special attackers such as Syclant and Stratagem. Bisharp can outspeed and easily revenge kill Necturna with its STAB Knock Off or Pursuit, although it can't switch in on anything it doesn't resist. This means Pokemon that can take Knock Off and other powerful Dark-type STAB moves, such as Fighting- and Fairy-types and most Mega Evolutions, are good partners. Entry hazards are also very useful for Necturna, as they break Sturdy and Focus Sash and allow it to get more KOs, most notably on Kyurem-B and Tomohawk. Lastly, Flying-type spam is everywhere, so a counter to it, such as Rotom-W or Cyclohm, will do wonders for Necturna.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash and Shift Gear allow Necturna to double its Speed, as well as giving its already respectable Attack a boost. Shell Smash gives it a bigger boost but at the cost of lowered defenses or the loss of an item. Shadow Sneak is a priority attack, and Shadow Claw is a stronger Ghost-type STAB move. Horn Leech gives recovery, while Power Whip is devastating but at the price of 85% accuracy, and Leaf Blade is a kind of compromise, with more power than Horn Leech but without the lowered accuracy of Power Whip.</p> <p>Stone Edge is a powerful alternative that provides coverage against Ice-, Flying-, and Fire-types. Thunder Fang works in much the same way with higher accuracy and lower Base Power, although a boosted Shadow Claw will usually deal with most Pokemon anyway.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>168 Speed EVs and a Jolly Nature allow Necturna to outspeed everything relevant in the CAP metagame, including Choice Scarf Kitsunoh, Latias, and Latios as well as Timid Mega Aerodactyl, at +2. 108 Speed EVs with a Jolly Nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Plasmanta if outspeeding Choice Scarf base 110 Speed Pokemon at +2 doesn't matter to you. If you want an Adamant Nature for more power, 252 Speed EVs just miss out on outspeeding Choice Scarf base 110 Speed Pokemon, but they allow Necturna to outspeed Choice Scarf Keldeo; 192 EVs let Necturna outspeed Choice Scarf Plasmanta. A mixed set with Shadow Ball can be used to hit physical walls such as Skarmory and Tomohawk slightly harder; moving the 88 HP EVs into Special Attack allows you to 2HKO both after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Focus Sash allows Necturna to take a hit when needed, and White Herb can be used to offset the stat drops of Shell Smash.(period) Alternatively, Life Orb lets Necturna hit very hard and get some important KOs, most notably an OHKO on Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock and an OHKO on 252 HP Kitsunoh, but at the cost of residual damage, which can really grind down Necturna's already mediocre HP. Colbur Berry is really only useful for Shift Gear sets, because it lets Necturna reliably beat Colossoil and isn't broken by entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure Shadow Sneak can KO, because if it doesn't, Necturna is susceptible to getting hurt quite badly by common priority attacks, especially Ice Shard and Shadow Sneak, which are super effective. Necturna is also hurt badly by Sucker Punch if it doesn't use Shadow Sneak.</p> <p>Focus Sash and Colbur Berry sets can be used to bait and KO Colossoil while possibly regaining Necturna's health back through Horn Leech. Other sets shouldn't be put near Colossoil, as it is resistant to Shadow Sneak and will OHKO them with Sucker Punch.</p> <p>After setting up, with the ability to outspeed more or less the entire metagame at +2 Speed, especially with a boosted 120 Base Power attack in Power Whip, Necturna can take out a variety of Pokemon. Necturna is better for late-game sweeps, when its counters are gone and it can operate much more freely. Much like with any setup sweeper, make sure you set up at a time when Necturna is not in danger of getting seriously damaged.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothitelle and Magnezone can trap the physical walls that stop Necturna's sweep, while specially offensive Pokemon can take them out; Landorus is a particularly good partner, as it can deal with the stall cores that trouble Necturna. Tomohawk can deal with Colossoil and Bisharp, while offensive variants can heavily damage Cyclohm and Skarmory with Earth Power and Aura Sphere, respectively. Tomohawk can also set up Stealth Rock, which allows Necturna to OHKO Talonflame at +2 and offensive Kitsunoh without Life Orb, as well as Mega Pinsir with it. Pokemon such as physically defensive Rotom-W and Cyclohm can be helpful teammates, as they can take care of Ice Shard and Sucker Punch users and Flying-types, which can annoy Necturna with their super effective STAB priority moves.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is the Sketch move of choice here and the focus of the set, allowing Necturna to put foes to sleep with 100% accuracy. Will-O-Wisp allows Necturna to burn foes, most notably due to the switches that Spore will force, crippling their Attack and whittling down their HP. This, along with maximum HP and Special Defense EVs, allows Necturna to wall all non-super effective STAB moves quite effectively. Horn Leech is a STAB move that also gives Necturna some form of recovery, while Super Fang allows Necturna to halve the foe's HP and gives Necturna some wallbreaking ability. Shadow Claw can be used for a Ghost-type STAB move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The set is aimed at crippling one foe with sleep while still retaining the ability to burn others if the foe switches out. Leftovers gives Necturna the passive recovery that it needs, increasing its longevity so it can spread more status. The EV spread and a Careful nature maximize Necturna's special bulk, while Will-O-Wisp halves the foe's Attack. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 Spe can be used to outspeed Bisharp and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Necturna isn't fast and struggles to take physical attacks, so you need to be prudent about when you are switching it in. However, Spore allows you to put a foe to sleep, essentially removing it from the battle until it wakes up. Often as a result, the opponent will switch it out in order to not give away free turns, allowing Necturna to either cripple the new foe with a burn or halve its health with Super Fang.</p> <p>Beware of Necturna's nemesis, Colossoil, which is not KOed by a weak, uninvested Horn Leech and can Rebound Spore and Will-O-Wisp (although Necturna's Grass typing stops it from being sent to sleep itself) or absorb Will-O-Wisp with Guts. Of course, this also applies to other Guts users, although Colossoil is really the only prominent one in the CAP metagame. Fire-types are immune to Will-O-Wisp, while Grass-types and Overcoat users are immune to Spore, so the opponent can get a free switch-in if they predict correctly. Also, note that Pyorak completely walls this set. Magic Bouncers, most notably Mega Sableye, can bounce both Spore and Will-O-Wisp, while Super Fang doesn't hit Mega Sableye, although Mega Diancie doesn't like getting hit with super effective STAB Horn Leech and can't hit Necturna super effectively with anything other than Hidden Power Fire. Therefore, be careful when spreading priority with a team that has a Magic Bounce. Chansey can come in and take a Spore or a Will-O-Wisp thanks to Natural Cure and Wish pass to a teammate, most notably Colossoil. Chansey can also Toxic Necturna, although it doesn't particularly like getting hit with Super Fang. Therefore, it is advisable to switch out against Chansey with this set, preferably into a Pokémon which is immune to Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spore and Will-O-Wisp can force a lot of switches, so an entry hazard setter such as Tomohawk or Ferrothorn is useful for wearing down the opposing Pokemon and luring in Colossoil and the Magic Bounce users that stop Necturna from spreading status. Tomohawk is also a sure counter to Colossoil, and it can set up Reflect, which boosts Necturna's ability to take physical attacks, as well as Haze Mega Sableye that try to set up Calm Mind after switching into Necturna.</p> <p>Hard-hitting Pokemon such as Colossoil or Shadow Tag users such as Gothitelle can take out or trap Chansey and other clerics, which can come in and use Heal Bell or Aromatherapy to get rid of the status that Necturna spreads or Wish pass to get rid of the pesky Super Fang damage. Necturna is easily KOed by super effective moves, most notably from Fire-types such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X which can predict a Will-O-Wisp and get a free switch-in, so physcially defensive walls such as Cyclohm and Rotom-W are great teammates.</p>"

  "Malaconda": {
    "overview": "<p>Malaconda has very high special bulk, which enables it to check threats like Manaphy, Stratagem, Krilowatt, Slowbro, Latios, and Latias. This is further compounded by Harvest, which, depending on what Berry Malaconda is holding, can give it semi-reliable recovery or status removal. Its support movepool also has some gems like Glare and Rapid Spin, and its base 100 Attack is decent for a defensive Pokemon. However, it has atrocious Defense, which is compounded by a weakness to types like Fairy, Fire, and Flying, meaning that Talonflame, Cawmodore, both Mega Charizard formes, and Mega Altaria can prey on it. It also has an exploitable 4x weakness to Bug, rendering it vulnerable to U-turn users. Its offensive movepool is very shallow, mainly consisting of only STAB attacks and niche coverage options. It also suffers from low Speed, meaning it will often take a hit before it can deal any damage. Finally, it faces stiff competition from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Pyroak, and Mega Venusaur as a defensive Grass-type, as they have roles that are typically more desirable for the CAP metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Malaconda can run a Choice Band set with Infiltrator for more offensive power. However, other Pokemon like Weavile, Bisharp, and Colossoil are better offensive Dark-types that can run Pursuit due to their greater offensive power. Malaconda also has access to Heal Bell. Though this is typically done better by Pyroak, it can remove status on sets running Sitrus Berry. Malaconda has a few coverage options like Wild Charge for Flying-types and Iron Tail for Fairy-types, though they are hard to fit in onto its sets.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Tomohawk and Skarmory can wall Malaconda due to their great physical bulk and can retaliate with their STAB attacks and Taunt. Tomohawk, however, has to watch out for Glare and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mollux, Victini, both Mega Charizard formes, Heatran, and Pyroak can switch into Power Whip and hit back hard with their own STAB attacks, though they are crippled by Glare. Volkraken and Volcanion can also threaten Malaconda with their STAB attacks should they get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Malaconda has no way of dealing with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Klefki, which can set up entry hazards on it or, in Klefki's case, hit hard with a Fairy-type STAB move. Cawmodore can set up on any Malaconda lacking Glare, Foul Play, or Roar.</p> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Pokemon that pack U-turn, like Scizor, Landorus-T, Colossoil, Diggersby, Tornadus-T, Kitsunoh, Jirachi, Mega Beedrill, and Syclant, can force out Malaconda, though the latter four are hit hard by Sucker Punch, and most U-turn users do not like Glare.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable, Togekiss, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon can shrug off Malaconda's attacks due to their typing and bulk and can retaliate with their STAB attacks. Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie can also threaten weakened Malaconda. However, Mega Altaria and Togekiss are crippled by Glare, and Mega Diancie cannot switch in for fear of Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Talonflame, Tomohawk, Tornadus-T, and Mega Pinsir can overwhelm Malaconda with their STAB attacks, though they hate Glare.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Aurumoth, Mega Crucibelle, Dragalge, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, Mega Venusaur, Kyurem-B, and Keldeo can OHKO or severely dent Malaconda with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Garchomp, Dragonite, Breloom, and Landorus-T can set up on Malaconda lacking Glare, Foul Play, or Roar.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a reliable STAB move that hits anything that does not resist it fairly hard and can remove the foe's item. Sucker Punch can be used instead to pressure fast, frail offensive threats like Syclant, Kitsunoh, and Mega Beedrill. Power Whip is a more powerful STAB attack to hit Water-types like Keldeo and Krilowatt, Rock-types like Stratagem and Tyranitar, and Ground-types like Colossoil and Hippowdon. Glare is used to induce paralysis, mainly on switch-ins and setup sweepers to cripple them. If the team needs a hazard remover, Rapid Spin can be run instead. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple defensive threats such as Tomohawk. U-turn is used to give the team momentum, letting Malaconda pivot out of its checks. Pursuit can be used to trap Psychic-types like Latios and Latias and Ghost-types like Kitsunoh lacking U-turn and Necturna lacking Will-O-Wisp or super effective moves. Foul Play can be used to hit physical attackers hard and deters setup from Pokemon like Cawmodore. Roar also is an option, as it can phaze setup sweepers like Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment makes Malaconda as specially bulky as possible, allowing it to take hits such as a +3 Ice Beam from Manaphy in order to hit back with Power Whip or Glare. Sitrus Berry is used for passive recovery and has synergy with Harvest, giving it a chance to regenerate the Berry and making it tough to take down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Malaconda should be switched in on special attackers that cannot threaten it, such as Latios, Latias, Krilowatt, and Stratagem. Knock Off is a safe move to use most of the time, as the utility of item removal can come in handy along with chip damage. If running Sucker Punch, try to find the perfect opportunity to use it, as it has limited PP; surprising a faster foe can help turn the tables of the game. Use Glare or Toxic when predicting switch-ins to cripple them, or use U-turn to pivot out into a check. If running Pursuit, anticipate when the foe will switch to severely dent or KO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types like Skarmory and Heatran can take Fairy-, Flying-, Bug-, Poison-, and, in Heatran's case, Fire-type attacks, while they appreciate Malaconda taking Ground-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks, and they can also set up entry hazards. Heatran can also threaten Steel-types and burn physical attackers with Lava Plume. Mega Charizard Y threatens Steel-types and can set up sun, and in return Malaconda can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock for it. Flying-types like Talonflame, Tomohawk, Tornadus-T, and Togekiss can help remove Bug- and Fighting-types. Other Ground- and Fire-types like Mollux, Volkraken, Volcanion, Excadrill, Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can also take out Steel-types. Cyclohm is also a great partner, as it can handle Flying-types. Pokemon that carry Rocky Helmet like Ferrothorn and Garchomp can help deter U-turn users.</p>"

      "Rest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest is used for a source of recovery, which is very helpful when combined with Lum Berry to remove sleep. Knock Off or Power Whip can be run depending on the team's needs. Knock Off is a safer STAB attack that can hit Psychic-types like Latios and Latias and Ghost-types like Necturna and Kitsunoh, while Power Whip is a more powerful STAB move to hit Water-types like Keldeo and Krilowatt, Rock-types like Stratagem and Tyranitar, and Ground-types like Colossoil and Hippowdon. Glare is for paralyzing switch-ins and setup sweepers, Rapid Spin is used for entry hazard removal should the team need it, and Toxic is used to hit defensive switch-ins like Tomohawk. U-turn is used to pivot out of checks and maintain momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment maximizes Malaconda's special bulk. Lum Berry is used to cure Malaconda of status conditions, particularly waking it up from sleep after it uses Rest, and with Harvest, it has a chance to regenerate. A Chesto Berry can be used to ensure that the Berry does not get lost before using Rest, but then Malaconda will be more exposed to status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful about Malaconda's Berry; since Harvest can be inconsistent, its Berry might not regenerate to get a crucial cure from status, so don't play too recklessly. This set can switch into status moves like Toxic if Malaconda's Berry is still intact. Try to find an opportunity to use Rest in order to preserve Malaconda's health while not potentially risking giving the foe a free turn of setup. Switching into Pokemon that cannot threaten it, like Latios, Latias, Krilowatt, and Stratagem, then crippling switch-ins with Glare or Toxic or pivoting out of them with U-turn is a great way to maximize Malaconda's use on a team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types like Skarmory and Heatran take Fairy-, Flying-, Bug-, Poison-, and, in Heatran's case, Fire-type attacks, and in return, Malaconda can take Ground-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks for them. Heatran also has Lava Plume to threaten Steel-types and burn physical attackers. Mega Charizard Y sets up sun to guarantee regeneration of Malaconda's Berry and threatens Steel-types, and it appreciates Malaconda using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. Flying-types like Talonflame, Togekiss, Tornadus-T, and Tomohawk can help eliminate Bug- and Fighting-types. Other Fire- and Ground-types like Mollux, Volkraken, Volcanion, Excadrill, Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp are also good partners that threaten Steel-types. Cyclohm walls most Flying-types due to its high physical bulk. Rocky Helmet users like Garchomp and Ferrothorn also make great partners to punish U-turn users.</p>"

  "Naviathan": {
    "overview": "<p>Naviathan was engineered to make use of two different boosting moves, Calm Mind and Dragon Dance. Naviathan's solid set of resistances and an immunity from its Water / Steel typing, along with its decent physical bulk and access to Scald, give Naviathan the ability to set up on a plethora of Pokemon, including top-tier threats such as Mega Scizor and Talonflame. Naviathan was also designed to be wholly resistant to status through an immunity to Poison and a resistance or immunity to burn damage through Heatproof or Water Veil, which greatly contribute to its ability to set up on passive walls. Besides its Calm Mind and Dragon Dance sets, Naviathan's general resistance to chip damage, access to reliable recovery, and a Taunt faster than most defensive Pokemon allow Naviathan to function as a decent stallbreaker.</p> <p>Despite these favorable traits, Naviathan is limited in its setup opportunities by its lackluster Special Defense. This particularly hinders the effectiveness of the Calm Mind set against powerful special attackers. Additionally, Naviathan's Dragon Dance set faces stiff competition from other Dragon Dance users such as Feraligatr and Mega Gyarados, both of which possess greater power and coverage. Naviathan's Dragon Dance set is, in fact, always walled by some metagame threat due to the lack of perfect neutral coverage between its STAB and coverage moves, although Naviathan's immunity to Scald burns and ability to shrug off Talonflame give the Dragon Dance set a notable niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Calm Mind set utilizing Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Flash Cannon, and even Hurricane can be used to put more immediate pressure on the opposing team, but it can't stallbreak well. Flash Cannon can be used on the Calm Mind set to get past Clefable, but Taunt does this already. Ice Punch and Thunder Punch can be used instead of Icicle Crash and Wild Charge, respectively, at a serious cost of power in exchange for their higher accuracy and lack of recoil. Icicle Spear can be used for Ice-type coverage as well, since it is perfectly accurate and can break through Focus Sash and Substitute, and on average it hits as hard as Ice Punch, although it can hit for significantly less or more damage depending on the number of hits. Iron Defense can be used on the Calm Mind set to better set up on physical attackers at the cost of stallbreaking ability and coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric, Plasmanta, Cyclohm, and Thundurus can all OHKO an unboosted Naviathan, and Mega Manectric and Plasmanta can take any one hit from the Dragon Dance set and OHKO back. Thundurus has trouble tanking hits but can cripple Dragon Dance sets with Thunder Wave. Cyclohm is a very dependable check to Dragon Dance Naviathan but is unable to threaten Calm Mind Naviathan after it attains multiple boosts outside of Discharge paralysis and Roar. Rotom-W counters the Dragon Dance set but is unable to break through the Calm Mind set due to the overall low damage output of Volt Switch and Naviathan's resistance to burn damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Keldeo, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Arghonaut can all OHKO or heavily damage Naviathan with their STAB moves. None of them can take Drill Peck, however, and Keldeo and Breloom also fear Wild Charge and Icicle Crash, respectively. Arghonaut in particular can check the Dragon Dance set well thanks to Unaware, but it hates burns from Scald, while Choice Scarf Keldeo is a foolproof check to either set.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Faster Ground-types such as Garchomp, offensive Landorus-T, and Colossoil can outspeed and threaten to OHKO Calm Mind Naviathan, while Choice Scarf Garchomp can outspeed and OHKO either set. None of those Pokemon enjoy switching into Scald, Waterfall, or Icicle Crash, though.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can wall the Dragon Dance set, although Mega Venusaur does not appreciate Drill Peck. Serperior can outdamage and outboost Calm Mind sets with Contrary Leaf Storms, but it has trouble beating boosted Dragon Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Hoopa-U, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Charizard Y can all overwhelm Calm Mind Naviathan before it sets up, and the latter two can outspeed and OHKO Dragon Dance Naviathan. None of them can afford to switch into a boosted Naviathan, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Naviathan to serve as a powerful wincon by setting up on and beating Pokemon such as Slowbro and Ferrothorn. Slack Off provides reliable recovery and significantly increase Naviathan's longevity, which is vital for accumulating Calm Mind boosts. Scald is Naviathan's most reliable STAB move on this set, and its burn chance helps Naviathan break through bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Latias, as well as neuter physical attackers such as Mega Scizor. In the last moveslot, Taunt allows Naviathan to stallbreak effectively and set up on common walls such as Clefable, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Pyroak with ease. Taunt also allows Naviathan to avoid phazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind. If Naviathan's ability to stallbreak is not needed, Hidden Power Ground allows Naviathan get to past Mollux and, to some extent, Plasmanta, which would otherwise wall it completely, and it also helps handle grounded Electric-types such as Cyclohm and Magnezone.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread grants Naviathan as much physical bulk as possible, allowing it to set up on Pokemon such as Talonflame and Mega Scizor with ease. Naviathan's lackluster special bulk is mitigated by consecutive Calm Mind boosts. A much faster spread of 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 Spe lets it outpace positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon at a significant cost of bulk. This prevents Breloom from crippling Naviathan with Spore, allowing Naviathan to outlast and beat it unless it gets multiple high Bullet Seed rolls, and it lets Naviathan attempt to land a Scald burn on Bisharp before it can use Knock Off. Leftovers is the item of choice to provide passive recovery. Heatproof gives Naviathan a pseudo Fire-type resistance and eases setup on Pokemon such as Heatran and Talonflame while decreasing the amount of residual damage dealt by burns so that it can be negated by Leftovers. Water Veil can be used to avoid burns altogether to keep Leftovers's residual recovery no matter what.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Naviathan is best used on bulkier teams as a wincon against opposing stall or balanced teams. Naviathan can be used on offensive teams as their main stallbreaker because it can check Talonflame more consistently than Manaphy. Use passive Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Pyroak, and Clefable as setup bait. If lacking Taunt, be wary of Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Clefable, as the reduced Speed will severely hinder Naviathan's effectiveness. Keep Hidden Power Ground hidden until you can guarantee that the opposing Mollux or Plasmanta will stay in; even consider switching out of them several times in order to trick your opponent into predicting Taunt. If your opponent still has checks to Naviathan in play, spam Scald to burn any potential switch-ins, such as Latias.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types and other Pokemon that can remove Mollux and Plasmanta from play are essential teammates to Naviathan, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Ground. Colossoil in particular can switch into either Pokemon with relative ease and gradually remove them from play through Pursuit. Garchomp can switch into Mollux, only fearing a burn from Lava Plume, and proceed to use it as Stealth Rock fodder. Other Ground-types such as Hippowdon also check the Electric-types that can pressure Naviathan. Mega Sableye can check Fighting-types that trouble Naviathan as well as spread burn damage. Checks to Keldeo, such as Mollux and Latios, are appreciated by Naviathan, as Keldeo can switch into Scald safely and threaten Naviathan with Secret Sword. In return, Naviathan can use Talonflame as setup fodder. Special walls such as Clefable can help handle special attackers that would otherwise overwhelm unboosted Naviathan.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance is needed to give Naviathan a chance to sweep opposing teams, allowing it to KO weakened Pokemon after a boost. Waterfall is Naviathan's most powerful Water-type STAB move and gives Naviathan good neutral coverage against threats such as Aurumoth and Mega Scizor. Iron Head allows Naviathan to get past Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria and Unaware Clefable, which would otherwise stop it cold. Wild Charge can be used over Iron Head if Unaware Clefable is not a concern for the team, as it allows Naviathan to force its way past bulky Water-types that would otherwise wall it, as well as Mollux. It also has provides pseudo-BoltBeam coverage in tandem with Icicle Crash. If Iron Head is used, Wild Charge should be used in the last slot to target bulky Water-types. Icicle Crash gives Naviathan a way to damage Cyclohm and is Naviathan's most powerful option against Plasmanta and Grass-types such as Serperior and Necturna. Drill Peck can be used instead to retain coverage on Grass-types while allowing Naviathan to threaten Fighting-types such as Tomohawk, Mega Lopunny, and Keldeo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and a Jolly nature allow Naviathan to outspeed anything up to Choice Scarf Volkraken while giving Naviathan maximum Attack. The rest of the EVs are put into HP for extra bulk. Life Orb gives Naviathan a needed boost to its damage output, notably allowing it to 2HKO Cyclohm with Icicle Crash after a boost, 2HKO defensive Tomohawk with Drill Peck, and OHKO Keldeo with Wild Charge. It also allows Naviathan to OHKO offensive Tomohawk with all three of Wild Charge, Icicle Crash, and Drill Peck. Leftovers can be used to help recover chip damage on Naviathan, allowing it to take priority moves better after a boost at the cost of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above, not to mention hitting for significantly less damage in general. Likewise, Expert Belt can be used to compromise between power and mitigating residual damage, while Lum Berry can be used to ease setup versus Thunder Wave users, such as Clefable, and to prevent Thundurus and Klefki from crippling Naviathan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Naviathan on as wincon on offensive teams that are particularly susceptible to Talonflame. Naviathan functions best in the late-game once Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Cyclohm have been removed or severely weakened. Set up on Fairy-types such as Clefable or Fire-types such as Talonflame. Take advantage of Naviathan's burn immunity to set up on bulky Water-types that rely on Scald such as Slowbro and Manaphy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the coverage issues Dragon Dance Naviathan has, it requires team synergy to be used effectively. Therefore, Naviathan functions best with partners that can deal with its checks and counters to allow it a chance to sweep. Power Herb + Solar Beam Heatran can surprise and heavily damage Rotom-W, Arghonaut, and Keldeo, all of which can give Naviathan trouble. Hidden Power Fire Latios and Mega Diancie can remove Ferrothorn, which tanks every move Dragon Dance Naviathan has to throw at it. Offensive Water-types such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Crawdaunt can help batter down Naviathan's checks; Jolly Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Crawdaunt in particular can put Cyclohm into KO range for Naviathan. Offensive Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross can help weaken Cyclohm and other Naviathan checks. In return, Naviathan can set up on and threaten the Fire-types they fear. Ground-types such as Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can provide entry hazard control and check opposing Electric-types and Mollux, which would otherwise give Naviathan trouble. Grass-types such as Serperior appreciate Naviathan's ability to set up on Talonflame. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Gardevoir and Hoopa-U can help break down defensive cores and weaken teams so that Naviathan can sweep late-game.</p>"

  "Syclant": {
    "overview": "<p>Syclant is a versatile mixed attacker thanks to its respectable base 116 Attack, base 114 Special Attack, and great base 121 Speed tier, which leaves it outsped only by Stratagem, some speedy Mega Evolutions, and a few others. Syclant's Mountaineer is a unique ability that renders it immune to Rock-type damage when switching in, which grants Syclant a greatly appreciated immunity to Stealth Rock. Overall, Syclant is able to function as an effective revenge killer, and its access to different boosting moves creates a bit of a guessing game for the opponent. However, Syclant suffers from a poor defensive typing and is quite frail and taken out by many forms of priority. It struggles to defeat many dedicated walls and is often stretched thin when trying to set up. Overall, Syclant's offensive prowess is notable not for its sheer power but for its great speed and versatility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch may be considered as a replacement for Ice Shard on the mixed sets, but the fact that it leaves Syclant without priority is pretty detrimental. Focus Blast may be considered instead of Earth Power, as it has high power along with the ability to hit threats such as Stratagem. Compound Eyes is not as useful as Mountaineer in most situations, but it at least boosts the accuracy of more powerful moves like Blizzard. A Swords Dance set is usable to power up Syclant's physical attacks, but it is generally outclassed by the other sets. Choice Band is also somewhat viable, as it makes U-turn quite powerful, but it can hinder Syclant's unpredictability. Hidden Power Fire may be used to damage Scizor on the switch, which is useful, but Syclant generally won't want to stay in against most Steel-types to start with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Most powerful priority moves, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Scizor's Bullet Punch, can easily defeat Syclant if its Focus Sash is broken or seriously maim it otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis ruins Syclant's Speed, allowing many slower threats to outspeed and KO it easily.</p> <p><strong>Arghonaut</strong>: Arghonaut can wall Syclant thanks to resistances to its STAB types. This in turn gives Arghonaut precious time to set up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sweepers</strong>: Stratagem and other faster Pokemon, including Choice Scarf Pokemon, can KO Syclant by outspeeding it and taking advantage of its thin defenses.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Sylveon tank most of Syclant's moves and can proceed to stall or damage it. However, Chansey needs to watch out for Superpower variants, and Tail Glow can let Syclant overpower most special roadblocks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Kyurem-B, Keldeo, Azumarill, and similar attackers can survive a hit from Syclant and KO back. However, Kyurem-B needs to watch out for Superpower variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is Syclant's most reliable offensive option, as it hits common Pokemon such as Cyclohm and Tomohawk for massive damage. Bug Buzz is Syclant's strongest Bug-type STAB move, and its ability to hit through Substitute is extremely useful. It also provides decent coverage against common CAP Pokemon such as Aurumoth. U-turn is a safe scouting move that can deal sufficient damage thanks to STAB. Earthquake and Earth Power are both coverage moves and do a good amount of damage to Heatran, Mollux, and other Fire-types. Earthquake is often better for use against specially defensive Mollux and Heatran, though Earth Power can hit Plasmanta harder. Superpower is great to use against Tyranitar and Chansey, while Spikes punishes the opponent for switching.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs provide maximum Speed and enough Attack to 2HKO Chansey with Superpower, with the rest in Special Attack. Life Orb gives Syclant a bit of extra power, which compensates for its mediocre offensive stats. Mountaineer is Syclant's best ability in conjunction with scouting and switching via U-turn, as it makes Syclant immune to Stealth Rock. A Naive nature is run to preserve Syclant's offensive stats while allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Cawmodore, which can outspeed and KO neutral-natured Syclant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions best after Pokemon with priority are removed. Due to Syclant's bad defenses, you should never send it out on a hit if it isn't resisted; it should usually be brought in to revenge kill or by a slow U-turn or Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any bulky Pokemon that resists common priority attacks, such as Cyclohm, can be a very good teammate for Syclant. Pokemon that benefit from Syclant's ability to defeat the likes of Dragon-, Dark-, and Psychic-types, such as Mollux and Plasmanta, are good teammates. Pokemon with Heal Bell such as Cyclohm and Sylveon can provide support in case Syclant is crippled by paralysis. Pokemon that resist the Fire- and Rock-type moves that target Syclant, such as Colossoil and Arghonaut, make for good partners as well. Lastly, slow U-turn users such as Colossoil, Mega Scizor, and Rotom-W are also appreciated as partners, as they can allow Syclant to switch in safely.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is Syclant's reliable Ice-type STAB move, and U-turn gives nice momentum against Chansey and other formidable forces. Ice Shard and Spikes can be used to play around Sucker Punch Colossoil; Ice Shard is a useful priority move that makes revenge killing even easier and can target threats such as Landorus-T and even net damage against Prankster Tomohawk before it uses Roost, while Spikes can specifically be used to set up an entry hazard when Syclant has been knocked down to its Focus Sash and can't do much more. Earthquake and Earth Power are Syclant's best coverage moves and can hit many Fire- and Electric-types; Earthquake hits the more specially defensive Mollux and Heatran, whereas Earth Power is usually better against Plasmanta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash is used for surviving strong hits with 1 HP, while Mountaineer is for the extremely useful immunity to Stealth Rock. Syclant's EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed in order to maximize its capabilities as a revenge killer. An alternate EV spread of 88 Atk / 158 SpA / 252 Spe can be used in order to OHKO Heatran with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. A Naive nature is used for outspeeding Pokemon like Cawmodore, which would otherwise easily KO Syclant, with the added benefit of not compromising either of Syclant's offensive stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its bad defenses, Syclant should not be switched in against an unresisted hit and should only be brought in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or to revenge kill. This set can act as an emergency check to a setup sweeper, being able to always survive with 1 HP and retaliate unless there are Spikes on the field or Syclant has taken prior damage. As a result, preserving Syclant's Focus Sash is extremely valuable. If running Spikes, this set also proves sufficient as a suicide lead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As U-turn can gain good momentum against Chansey, Syclant pairs well with Gothitelle, which can trap Chansey and cripple it with Trick or damage it. Syclant greatly appreciates support from spinners or Defoggers, such as Tomohawk, Kitsunoh, Colossoil, Zapdos, and Skarmory, as they can remove Spikes, which would break Syclant's Focus Sash. Cyclohm and Chansey can take attacks from speedy threats such as Talonflame and Stratagem. Syclant's ability to defeat Psychic- and Dragon-types is in turn appreciated by Pokemon such as Mollux. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are greatly appreciated as well.</p>"
      },
      "Tail Glow": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow gives Sylcant a massive Special Attack boost, which quickly turns it into a specially offensive powerhouse. Bug Buzz is the most powerful Bug-type move Syclant learns, and it's notable for hitting through Substitute as well. Ice Beam is Syclant's reliable Ice-type STAB move that provides good neutral coverage with Earth Power, as well as heavily damaging Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Cyclohm. Earth Power is Syclant's coverage move to deal with Pokemon like Heatran and Mollux, which would otherwise wall it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash gives Syclant more setup opportunities, whereas Babiri Berry is only notable for making sure that Cawmodore doesn't come in and KO Syclant with Bullet Punch after it has set up. Mountaineer is used for the extremely handy immunity to Stealth Rock to preserve Focus Sash, and the EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature allows Syclant to outspeed Cawmodore and base 120 Speed Pokemon, such as Alakazam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before sending out Syclant, be sure to eliminate any Pokemon that may have a priority move or a paralyzing move, as both can cripple Syclant and stop its sweep. Syclant proves efficient as a wallbreaker with this set, and it can 2HKO Chansey after two Tail Glows. This set can also act as an emergency check to an opposing setup sweeper, allowing Syclant to survive with 1 HP thanks to Focus Sash and retaliate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A good partner for Syclant is any Pokemon that can handle common priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet, and Talonflame's Brave Bird; in this regard, Cyclohm makes for a great partner. Cyclohm and other Heal Bell users can help rid Syclant of crippling status, and Wish passers can restore Syclant to full HP in order to keep Focus Sash useful. Spinners or Defoggers such Colossoil and Skarmory can get rid of Spikes and are also great partners. Gothitelle is also useful, as it can cripple special walls such as Chansey by Tricking them its Choice item.</p>"

  "Revenankh": {
    "overview": "<p>Revenankh was a Pokemon made to be the perfect Bulk Up user, and while it might have taken a hit in viability due to the addition of the Fairy type, it is still one of the best users of the move. Revenankh's excellent Ghost / Fighting STAB combination allows it to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage, allowing it to forgo coverage moves. Revenankh's decent base 105 Attack isn't the most ground-shaking, but it is more than enough for a Bulk Up user. It also has great natural bulk of 90 /90 /110, and that in combination with reliable recovery and STAB Drain Punch allows Revenankh to tank most neutral hits, greatly contributing to its ability to set up. Revenankh also has a fantastic ability in Shed Skin, which allows it to shrug off damaging status such as poison or burn, and reliably set up in the face of Scald. Ghost / Fighting is a decent defensive typing, as it gives Revenankh an immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves and neutrality to Knock Off, which makes it one of the few Pokemon able to spinblock Colossoil reliably.</p> <p>While Revenankh is a phenomenal Bulk Up user, its low Speed and average starting Attack stat mean its Bulk Up set is by far its best set, and as a result, it is predictable. Shadow Sneak is necessary for it to strike first, and without several boosts under its belt, it can be underwhelming. Revenankh's typing also leaves it weak to Fairy- and Flying-type moves, two types that are very common in the metagame, and its reliance on Bulk Up to deal damage leaves it walled by Unaware users, most notably Clefable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Punch or Hammer Arm can be used for their higher Base Power but are generally inferior to Drain Punch and Shadow Sneak as they lack both recovery and priority. Knock Off, Power Whip, or Rock Slide can be run as a third attack option in the last move slot, but none of them add anything noticeable to Revenankh's already good neutral coverage. Knock Off has redundant coverage with Shadow Sneak, but it can remove items such as Eviolite and Leftovers. It's worth noting that the biggest user of Eviolite, Chansey, and the biggest user of Assault Vest, Colossoil, are already hit super effectively by Revenankh's Fighting-type STAB move. Power Whip's main niche is that it can hit Mega Slowbro and Quagsire harder than anything else, but aside from those two, it hits nothing else noticeable. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types, such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, hard. Taunt or Glare can be used in the last moveslot as well, but does not offer much in terms of supporting Bulk Up. Taunt can be used to better set up on walls or to prevent phazing, but considering that it requires either dropping a STAB move or recovery, it is a niche option. Glare can be useful for shoring up Revenankh's poor Speed and crippling switch-ins, but has no use aside from that. Toxic can be run in the last slot to cripple some switch-ins but it has no use otherwise. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def can be used to allow Revenankh to switch into Colossoil with impunity, but this is only ever necessary on teams that need a reliable spinblocker to Colossoil, namely Sticky Web teams. A Choice Band set can be used, as it allows Revenankh to hit hard without the need for boosts, but this set leaves Revenankh locked into moves and is in generally a niche option. Its biggest selling point is Trick, which can be used to cripple most physical walls, such as Tomohawk, Cyclohm, and Pyroak.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Unaware users, the most prominent being Clefable, are the most reliable checks to Revenankh. Quagsire and Arghonaut fear nothing short of Power Whip from Revenankh, and Clefable can hard counter Revenankh completely.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are almost impossible for Revenankh to beat, as most, such as Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, and Sylveon, can take a +6 Shadow Sneak and either KO or deal heavy damage to Revenankh. Mega Gardevoir can tank a +2 Shadow Sneak from full health and OHKO Revenankh with Hyper Voice, but it will take a large amount of damage in the process. Clefable can completely counter Revenankh by virtue of its good bulk and Unaware.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame can threaten Revenankh out with their powerful STAB moves, and Revenankh requires many Bulk Up boosts on to even consider beating them. Tomohawk can completely counter Revenankh if it runs Haze, negating any Bulk Up boosts Revenankh had accumulated. Even if Tomohawk lacks Haze, Revenankh will need to boost many times to beat it, and because Air Slash is a clean 3HKO, Revenankh will be under heavy pressure to do so. Offensive Tomohawk sets will also cleanly OHKO Revenankh with a Life Orb-boosted Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Due to its Dark / Ghost typing, Mega Sableye can only be hit by Shadow Sneak or a coverage move, and it can use Taunt to prevent Revenankh from boosting or healing. Metal Burst variants can severely limit Revenankh. Calm Mind sets can also set up and hit Revenankh hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Stat Boost Removal</strong>: Haze and Clear Smog can completely reset Revenankh's boosts, preventing it from sweeping and taking away most of the pressure it can put on a team. The most effective users would be Tomohawk and Quagsire, which can already wall Revenankh. Amoonguss can also stop Revenankh variants that don't run a third attacking move, as can Plasmanta.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: Phazing moves can stop a Revenankh sweep short, and Pokemon with high Defense, such as Skarmory, Cyclohm, and Pyroak, can reliably use them, although they will have to take heavy damage from a fully boosted Revenankh, and they fail outright if Revenankh carries Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that can take a Shadow Sneak and hit hard, such as Mega Charizard Y, Landorus, and Mega Pidgeot, will be able to severely damage Revenankh with super effective or powerful STAB attacks, but they must be wary of Revenankh when it has accumulated multiple boosts.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up will allow Revenankh to set up on physical attackers, and after several boosts it can deal heavy damage to most Pokemon. Drain Punch is Revenankh's best Fighting-type STAB move, as it has decent Base Power and helps prolong Revenankh's longevity by recovering HP. Shadow Sneak is the recommended secondary STAB attack, as it achieves perfect neutral coverage with Drain Punch and is necessary to hit faster threats first. It can be used to get that last bit of damage on a sweeper such as Aurumoth, but it won't be doing any major damage without a couple boosts. The last moveslot is used either for healing or additional coverage; reliable recovery helps with setting up, whereas additional coverage lets Revenankh get past its would-be checks reliably. Moonlight is preferred, as it provides Revenankh with a reliable source of recovery, but Rest can also be used, as it has more PP and heals more HP. The two potential turns lost can leave Revenankh susceptible to being worn down by powerful attackers, but Shed Skin can help mitigate this. Earthquake is also an option, as it allows Revenankh to beat Mollux and Plasmanta, which can otherwise be difficult for Revenankh to beat. Ice Punch allows Revenankh to beat Tomohawk lacking Taunt or Haze, as well as deal heavy damage to Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature give Revenankh the highest possible special bulk, because Revenankh can boost its Defense by itself. The spread also allows Revenankh to act as a reliable check to special attackers such as Syclant and Levitate Stratagem, especially when running a recovery move to heal off the damage it'll take in the process. Leftovers gives Revenankh passive recovery and is very important for sets running a third attack. Shed Skin is the best ability for this set, as it allows Revenankh to shrug off status with a little luck, letting Revenankh set up in the face of Toxic and Scald users. This is especially helpful versus passive walls, such as Chansey, and also allows Revenankh to sometimes wake up early from Rest sleep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Revenankh does not have the stats to deal heavy hits without boosting, so try to boost up as much as possible without leaving Revenankh vulnerable to being knocked out. Revenankh is fully capable of 2HKOing or OHKOing Pokemon after several boosts. The boosts are also vital in preventing Revenankh from being revenge killed by physical attackers. As Revenankh's main use is as a win condition, it is vital that you weaken or KO the foes that can stop it, mainly Fairy-types, Tomohawk, and phazers, or else any attempt at sweeping will be stopped short. The ideal Pokemon for Revenankh to set up on are either passive walls, such as Chansey, or physical attackers that cannot hit it super effectively or boost up alongside it, such as Landorus-T, Mega Sharpedo, and Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support is much-appreciated, as it helps wear down the Flying-types that can check Revenankh. Pyroak can set up Stealth Rock and is able to beat or at least wall most Fairy-types, and while they do stack a Flying weakness, Revenankh can reliably check some Stratagem and other Rock-types that threaten Pyroak. Steel-types also make for good teammates, as they are generally able to take the Fairy- and Flying-type attacks aimed at Revenankh, and in return Revenankh can take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at them. Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Scizor all make for notable teammates, as the first two can reliably set up Stealth Rock while all three can punish Fairy-types. Pokemon that can reliably remove Tomohawk are essential, as it can put a hard stop to Revenankh, so Gothitelle and Fairy-types make good for teammates. Clefable in particular can set up Stealth Rock and beat opposing setup sweepers by virtue of Unaware. Pokemon that can handle Flying-type spam, such as Cyclohm, Skarmory, and Plasmanta, make for good partners as well, especially because Cawmodore and Talonflame can use Revenankh as setup bait if it is lacks a Bulk Up boost. Colossoil, along with other Dark-types, can be used to help alleviate Revenankh's Psychic weakness, but they stack a Fairy-type weakness and Revenankh can beat most Psychic-types itself after several boosts.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch allows Revenankh to take advantage of its bulk by regaining HP; it OHKOes many common threats such as Colossoil and Stratagem and can even 2HKO defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Ferrothorn. Shadow Sneak's Ghost typing provides useful coverage when combined with Drain Punch and allows Revenankh to check many threats such as Mega Gardevoir, which it can OHKO after Stealth Rock damage; Aurumoth, which takes over 50% damage; Gengar, which it OHKOes; and Latios, which takes almost 90% damage. It also allows Revenankh to pick off weakened threats or frailer Pokemon. For example, it can be used as a stop to Mega Alakazam, Kerfluffle, many weakened setup sweepers like Manaphy and Serperior, and Pokemon with a broken Focus Sash. Ice Punch helps Revenankh overcome defensive Ground-type Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and it deals more damage to Flying-type Pokemon like Thundurus and Dragonite and Grass-type Pokemon like Serperior. It is also the most powerful option against Tomohawk and can OHKO Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Earthquake makes Revenankh a much better check to Mega Crucibelle, especially Coil variants that it would otherwise struggle against. It also lets it deal more damage to Electric-type threats like Krilowatt, Cyclohm, and Raikou, and it OHKOes specially defensive Heatran, which Drain Punch is not guaranteed to do, as well as Mollux. Another option is Power Whip, which deals with bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon well, OHKOing Politoed, Mega Swampert, Manaphy, Quagsire, and Krilowatt, as well as 2HKOing Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Slowbro, and +1 Arghonaut. Another option to consider is Rock Slide, which OHKOes Mega Charizard Y, Charizard, Talonflame, and Volcarona, which is useful for predicting a switch, and it can also potentially OHKO Tornadus-T. In the fourth slot, Trick allows Revenankh to give its Choice Band to the foe, letting it use all of its moves freely while burdening the foe with the item. It is best used on hard counters to Bulk Up Revenankh, such Haze Tomohawk and Unaware Clefable, to greatly diminish their utility and longevity; it can also be used on special attackers to make them useless and force them out. However, be wary of Tricking a Choice Band onto a Pokemon that can benefit from it, such as physical attackers. Moreover, using Trick when a Mega Pokemon switches in gives it a free turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs increase Revenankh's longevity while allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock one extra time. Maximum Attack EVs allow Revenankh to deal maximum damage, and Adamant is the preferred nature so that Revenankh can attack with more power. Choice Band allows Revenankh to deal as much damage as possible and potentially burden the foe with Trick. Air Lock allows Revenankh to perform better against weather teams, especially rain and sun, allowing it to take more hits against them and potentially outlast Pokemon on the former with Drain Punch. For example, Drain Punch is a potential 2HKO on Mega Swampert, and Mega Swampert's Earthquake can do about 66.5%. However, Waterfall does a minimum of that in rain.</p> <p>Teammates also appreciate being more resistant to common weather users, such as Mega Charizard Y and Swift Swim Pokemon. Shed Skin is still a viable option, though, but it is unnecessary because this set is based on attacking as opposed to setting up and surviving for a long time. Nevertheless, it can help Revenankh switch into Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Heatran if it is poisoned, paralyzed, or burned, although it isn't the most reliable option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Revenankh is most useful early- and mid-game. Focus on using it to cripple or remove walls with its offensive moves or Trick, making it easier for its teammates to take out the opposing team without the worry of being hard countered. Shadow Sneak can be used to check a faster foe that may be on a path to sweep your team. If you are predicting the opponent to switch to a specially oriented check or counter, use Trick to force it into a move. For example, if your opponent currently has Mega Crucibelle out against your Revenankh but has a cleric Clefable, there is a fair chance of that Clefable being sent out, in which case Revenankh can use Trick and force its Choice Band on the Clefable, making it a less effective cleric while Revenankh gets the useful Leftovers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Aurumoth are perfect teammates for Choice Band Revenankh because of its ability to support them by removing Pokemon that stop them from setting up, such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. Pokemon like Cawmodore and Mega Altaria appreciate Haze Tomohawk, Klefki, and Clefable being crippled by Trick. Choice Scarf Mollux, Choice Scarf Volkraken, and Talonflame are able to counter or check Cawmodore, which uses Revenankh as setup bait. In return, Revenankh removes walls like Chansey and Ice Punch Garchomp. Mollux appreciates Revenankh's ability to handle Colossoil, Crucibelle, Stratagem, and Tyranitar. Finally, Ice-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Weavile can help Revenankh by beating Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Tomohawk.</p>"

  "Pyroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyroak's great bulk and unique type combination allow it to check Pokemon like Sylveon, Mega Metagross, and Mega Altaria. It also has a huge support movepool with options such as Leech Seed, Roar, Stealth Rock, and Aromatherapy. However, it does not have that much offensive presence, which is further hindered by its low Speed. Its weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to passive damage wear it down, especially as common attacking types in Poison, Rock, and Flying can easily force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pyroak can use Will-O-Wisp to get a guaranteed burn on the foe. Earthquake can be used to hit specially defensive Heatran and Mollux, though it requires a Relaxed nature, which is often not worth the loss in Speed. Substitute can be used on sets with Leech Seed to take advantage of the switches Leech Seed forces and thus make Pyroak annoying to take out. Ancient Power hits both Mega Charizard formes and Talonflame, but those are its only two targets. It may be tempting to run a Swords Dance set with Wood Hammer and Flare Blitz due to Pyroak's access to Rock Head. However, this set is mediocre, as Pyroak has a pitiful base 70 Attack.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Toxic limits Pyroak's stalling capabilities by placing a timer on it. Note that Toxic users that are slower than Pyroak risk Substitute blocking Toxic, though faster Toxic users can cripple Pyroak no matter what move it is running. However, Pyroak does have access to Aromatherapy to remove status ailments. Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, can quickly reduce Pyroak's lifespan.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Magic Guard Clefable, Calm Mind Latias, Hoopa-U, Manaphy, and Refresh Mega Altaria can set up on any Pyroak lacking Roar.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo Users</strong>: Being locked into one move via a Choice item completely cripples Pyroak, as it relies on status moves to fulfill its job. Gothitelle is a solid user of Trick due to Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran can switch into Lava Plume—and if it is holding an Air Balloon, Earth Power as well—and can Taunt Pyroak. Mega Charizard Y does not care about anything Pyroak throws at it aside from Leech Seed or Ancient Power and can retaliate with a sun-boosted Fire Blast. Mega Charizard X can use any Pyroak lacking Earth Power, Ancient Power, or Roar as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Special Poison-types</strong>: Although both Mollux and Plasmanta fear Earth Power, they can take any of Pyroak's other moves and nail it with Sludge Wave or cripple it with Trick and Taunt, respectively. Mega Venusaur can tank Lava Plume due to Thick Fat and retaliate with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Rock-types</strong>: Stratagem forces out Pyroak with its STAB moves, and it can switch into Earth Power if it has Levitate. Mega Diancie can force out Pyroak with Diamond Storm and can bounce back Leech Seed, Roar, and Stealth Rock. Tyranitar and Terrakion also hit Pyroak hard, though they are crippled by burns and can be hit hard by Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Flying-types</strong>: Togekiss has Air Slash to strike Pyroak hard, and its 60% flinch chance due to Serene Grace can help wear it down. Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Staraptor can severely dent Pyroak with their STAB attacks. Talonflame can even set up on Pyroak due to its Fire typing preventing a burn, only caring about Leech Seed and Roar.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye can set up on Pyroak due to its strong special bulk and Magic Bounce blocking Leech Seed and Roar.</p> <p><strong>Tomohawk</strong>: Tomohawk can Taunt Pyroak, cripple it with Toxic, or just strike it hard with Air Slash, while all Pyroak can hope to do is hit Tomohawk with Leech Seed on the switch or burn it.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Naviathan</strong>: Calm Mind Naviathan can set up on Pyroak lacking Earth Power or Roar due to Heatproof reducing damage from Lava Plume and burns, and it can also use Substitute or Taunt to stop Leech Seed and Roar.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis allows Pyroak to reliably recover health, enabling it to survive longer against many of the threats in the CAP metagame. Lava Plume is the main STAB move on this set and has a 30% chance to burn the foe. The listed secondary attacks make sure that Pyroak is not completely countered by Mega Diancie. Earth Power hits Electric-types such as Cyclohm and Plasmanta, Poison-types such as Mollux, and Steel-types such as Heatran, while Giga Drain hits foes such as Colossoil, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Stratagem, and Slowbro. The last move is dependent on the team. Stealth Rock is used if none of Pyroak's teammates can fit it into their movesets. Leech Seed capitalizes on Pyroak's bulk and ability to force switches to pressure the foe with passive damage. Aromatherapy can be used to remove status ailments from the team, while Roar can phaze setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. This set typically runs two attacks to make Pyroak more self-sufficient and cover more of the metagame. However, running only Lava Plume and two utility moves is an option, sacrificing Pyroak's ability to hit some of its switch-ins like Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta for more support for Pyroak's teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 248 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximizes Pyroak's physical bulk, allowing it to wall any physical attacker that cannot 2HKO it and reducing Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers is used because Pyroak needs all the health it can get. Battle Armor is used to prevent critical hits. Pyroak can also run a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD to handle special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Syclant, although it becomes more reliant on burns to wall powerful physical attackers. If Pyroak needs to take on both physical and special attackers, a mixed spread of 248 HP / 192 Def / 68 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Metagross's Zen Headbutt after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pyroak fits on bulkier teams, as they are usually not too concerned about losing offensive momentum. Teams that need its resistances, particularly those that need a check to Mega Metagross and Mega Altaria, appreciate Pyroak's support. Switch Pyroak in on these threats and anything else that cannot deal much damage to it. When Pyroak needs to attack, it should use Lava Plume to spread burns and its coverage to surprise switch-ins. If running Giga Drain, try to determine when to use Synthesis or Giga Drain as the method of recovery. Pyroak should use Stealth Rock if the opposing team does not have entry hazard control. Leech Seed should be used on predicted switch-ins to wear them down. If running Aromatherapy, use it sparingly and at the most crucial moments, as it has limited PP. If Roar is being used, take advantage of Pyroak's ability to stop setup sweepers and phaze switch-ins for increased entry hazard damage on the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon are great partners for Pyroak, as they can pass Wishes to it. Chansey can also handle Plasmanta, Mega Charizard Y, and Stratagem, while Clefable and Sylveon can deal with Tomohawk and Mega Sableye. As Pyroak is vulnerable to entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, a Rapid Spin or Defog user is an excellent partner for Pyroak. Tomohawk, Excadrill, Starmie, and Colossoil provide Rapid Spin support, while Mega Scizor, Kitsunoh, Skarmory, Zapdos, Latias, Latios, and Mew provide Defog support. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Medicham, and Hoopa-U can break through Pyroak's defensive answers such as Mollux, Heatran, and Plasmanta. Cyclohm can check Flying-types that threaten Pyroak, and in return it appreciates Pyroak's ability to check Fairy-types. Water-types such as Arghonaut, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can check Fire-types, while Pyroak checks Grass-types and Electric-types in return. Arghonaut in particular can also check Rock-types.</p>"

  "Fidgit": {
    "overview": "<p>Fidgit is one of the more overlooked Pokemon in this metagame, shining as one of the best supporters in the tier. It has an enormous support movepool, with options including Stealth Rock, Spikes, Encore, Whirlwind, and Taunt. Fidgit is also the cornerstone of Trick Room teams thanks to Persistent. Fidgit also has the stats to pull off its supporting capabilities, with strong defensive stats and a good Speed tier.</p> <p>However, Fidgit is also very hard to fit into a team. Many other support Pokemon, such as Tomohawk, outclass Fidgit in some of its roles. Because it is very passive, most powerful attackers are able to switch in freely on Fidgit. Fidgit also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome due to the large amount of supportive options that Fidgit wishes it could use at once. Its defenses, while not as frail as some other fast supporters, are often lacking due to its typing, which leaves it weak to common Ground- and Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sludge Bomb is an option to hit Fairy- and Grass-types hard, but it does pitiful damage when coming off of an uninvested Special Attack stat. Moreover, many of the targets hit by Sludge Bomb are also hindered by Taunt, making it hard to justify using. Earth Power can be used to nail Metagross, Heatran, and Mollux for decent damage. Gravity is a another supporting option to let Ground-types sweep much more efficiently and is extended by Persistent. Safeguard can be used to prevent Thunder Wave and Toxic from hurting your team for seven turns. Toxic can be used to stall out foes, but Toxic Spikes is typically better. The last move affected by Persistent is Heal Block, but Taunt is much more useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye shut down Fidgit's entry hazards as well as Taunt and Encore. However, Trick Room and Tailwind Fidgit can still get around Magic Bounce users.</p> <p><strong>Tomohawk</strong>: Tomohawk has the potential to shut down Fidgit with a priority Taunt, as well as being able to use a super effective Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Talonflame and Sableye shut down Fidgit's ability to support its team, forcing it to U-turn away uselessly.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Fidgit is ruined by Choice Scarf Trick users such as Mollux and Rotom. On Trick Room teams, you need to be especially careful to not let one of Fidgit's teammates be crippled.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Excadrill and Skarmory can easily remove Fidgit's entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Colossoil</strong>: Colossoil is a great check to Fidgit, as it is able to threaten it with Earthquake, remove Fidgit's entry hazards, and bounce back Fidgit's moves with Rebound. However, Fidgit is faster, so it can U-turn out easily and gain momentum against Colossoil.</p> <p><strong>Syclant</strong>: Fidgit greatly struggles against Syclant due to it's Ice-type STAB attacks, and the potential to set up with Tail Glow or Spikes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Persistent": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room and Tailwind both take advantage of Fidgit's Persistent. Trick Room works best for slow teams that utilize many powerful Pokemon, while Tailwind is especially useful for moderately fast attackers. U-turn is a valuable pivot move for Fidgit, allowing a Trick Room attacker to switch in for free. Tailwind allows Fidgit to escape unscathed, switching to another Pokemon to tank the attack. The third slot's moves depend on the support your team appreciates best; if you desperately need entry hazard removal, Rapid Spin is the best option. Spikes can be used to apply more pressure to the opposing team, while breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy. Wish can be used to pass decent amounts of HP to Fidgit's teammates. Encore can create lots of set up opportunities against set up sweepers and supporting Pokemon, while Taunt can prevent both from setting up their boosting moves and entry hazards, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Persistent extends the duration of Trick Room and Tailwind. The EV spread maximizes Speed while giving Fidgit as much bulk as possible. Maximum HP EVs also lets Fidgit pass larger Wishes, should it be running the move. Black Sludge is used to give Fidgit passive recovery.</p> <p>Two alternate spreads can be used, neither of which maximize Speed. 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature can be used for maximum physical bulk, and 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def with a Careful nature can be used for maximum special bulk. These spreads are more useful if your team needs multiple Speed control setups in order to function.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fidgit should often be used as a lead unless the opponent has dangerous attackers such as Aurumoth, which can force Fidgit out. Trick Room or Tailwind should often be the first move used, as Fidgit will rarely be doing anything else. Fidgit's team may rely on multiple uses of Trick Room or Tailwind, so keeping it healthy is vital for success.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room Fidgit should be used with slow Pokemon that can hit extremely hard, such as Mega Camerupt, Sylveon, Crawdaunt, and Azumarill. Tailwind Fidgit works well alongside moderately fast Pokemon that appreciate an extra speed boost, such as Victini, Mega Garchomp, Landorus, and Mega Gardevoir. Fidgit synergizes well with Flying-type Pokemon, which attract Electric attacks for Fidgit while being immune to Ground-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Hazard Layer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is Fidgit's main niche with this set, as it is one of the most reliable Spikes setters in the tier. If Fidgit is the only capable Stealth Rock user on your team, then Stealth Rock should be chosen for the enormous benefits that it provides. Toxic Spikes should be used if you already have a Stealth Rock user and if Toxic stalling is beneficial. U-turn is a very important pivot move for Fidgit, as it allows Fidgit to escape Gothitelle and Colossoil and not be Taunt bait. Whirlwind is a good phazing move that can take advantage of the entry hazards set by Fidgit, but it requires Fidgit to take a hit. Encore can shut down setup sweepers and supporting Pokemon, giving Fidgit opportunities to set up entry hazards. Lastly, Taunt can prevent status moves and boosting moves, which is especially potent against passive Pokemon such as Chansey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Vital Spirit prevents sleep from moves such as Breloom's Spore. Black Sludge is a great source of passive recovery, increasing Fidgit's longevity. Focus Sash can be used if Fidgit is intended to be used as a suicide lead, letting it set up entry hazards against opposing Colossoil and Landorus-Therian. If you choose to run Focus Sash, it is best to use Encore or Taunt over Whirlwind. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature lets Fidgit avoid slower Taunt users and be able to set up entry hazards against slower attackers. Maximum HP investment makes Fidgit as bulky as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be utilized like a lead, setting up entry hazards early on for your team. However, Rebound Colossoil can pose a problem, as can Pokemon with Magic Bounce. If either of these are spotted on the opposing team, spamming U-turn is a great idea in order to gain chip damage and momentum against foes. This set can attempt to force out set up sweepers, but don't count on it to use Whirlwind multiple times in a match, as Fidgit is not a formidable wall. Switching in on slower Electric-types can be very rewarding if Fidgit has Encore, though it might be risky should you mispredict.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fidgit fits onto any team that appreciates entry hazards, especially stall and hyper offense teams. Fidgit pairs well with Flying-type Pokemon, as they have excellent type synergy, and they are immune to the Ground-type attacks that Fidgit attracts, while Fidgit resists Rock-type attacks and is immune to the Electric-type attacks aimed at Flying-types. Many offensive Flying-types also love the entry hazard support. Spinblockers and Defiant users are almost mandatory partners to prevent and discourage entry hazard removal. Revenankh gets a special mention for handling Colossoil, though it must be physically defensive to counter it. Setup sweepers also enjoy the entry hazard support that this set provides. Cawmodore, Aurumoth, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Altaria are just a few examples.</p>"

  "Stratagem": {
    "overview": "<p>With great Special Attack and Speed and a wide array of coverage moves, Stratagem is a fearsome attacker in the CAP metagame. Its Rock typing combined with its power allows it to shut down staples of hyper offense teams, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Kyurem-B. The ability for Stratagem to land super effective hits on its would-be checks such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Heatran is a godsend to its sweeping capabilities. Most importantly, Stratagem's blistering base 130 Speed allows it to outspeed almost the entire CAP metagame, making it a perfect choice for a late-game cleaner. Alternatively, Stratagem can set up with Calm Mind to become a great mid-game wallbreaker. However, Stratagem is fairly frail and possesses a below-average defensive typing, so it is hard-pressed to switch into opposing offensive pressure. A Rock typing might be perfect for offense, but it also gives Stratagem crippling weaknesses to a myriad of priority attacks, such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Bullet Punch. Stratagem also falls flat in the face of stall, as its base 120 Special Attack is not quite enough to break down dedicated special walls. Stratagem's lack of Taunt means that even its Calm Mind set has trouble breaking stall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if reliability is desired over power. Hidden Power Ice will hit Garchomp and Landorus, as well as Tomohawk before it uses Roost, for massive damage. Trick is an option if Stratagem is holding Choice Specs, as the move will cripple defensive threats such as Chansey and Tomohawk. Focus Sash allows Stratagem to survive a single powerful attack, such as Hydro Pump from Rotom-W or Bullet Punch from a Cawmodore that has used Belly Drum. Shadow Ball and Ominous Wind provide Ghost-type coverage to hit Mega Gardevoir, Gothitelle, Latios, and Latias for decent damage, but Stratagem is already hard-pressed to fit all of its coverage moves on one set. Stealth Rock can be an option due to Stratagem's high Speed, but Stratagem has better things to do than to act as a suicide lead. Moreover, Stratagem's below-average bulk means that it will struggle to set up Stealth Rock more than once per game. Babiri Berry allows Stratagem to survive a Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and subsequently OHKO Mega Scizor with Fire Blast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Sylveon can switch into any attack that Stratagem has, forcing it out and crippling its team's momentum.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users</strong>: Colossoil, Azumarill, Arghonaut, and Conkeldurr can use Assault Vest to soften Stratagem's super effective attacks, allowing them to switch in and hit Stratagem super effectively right back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky, powerful Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Necturna can check Stratagem by surviving a super effective attack and OHKOing Stratagem in return because of its low bulk. However, most bulky attackers have trouble switching into a super effective attack from Stratagem without the aid of Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Stratagem's defensive typing leaves it very vulnerable to priority attacks such as Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet, and Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Because Stratagem is not that bulky, super effective attacks will often OHKO or 2HKO it.</p>",

      "Technician Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ancient Power is Stratagem's reliable STAB attack that is boosted to 90 Base Power with Technician. Its chance to raise all of Stratagem's stats at once can give Stratagem the ability to muscle past its checks more easily as well. Earth Power hits Mollux, Heatran, and Cyclohm for super effective damage and gives Stratagem the coveted offensive combination of Rock and Ground. Vacuum Wave allows Stratagem to pick off opposing priority attackers and Choice Scarf users, such as Cawmodore and Terrakion, respectively. Moreover, Technician boosts the Base Power of Vacuum Wave to 60, making it a decently powerful priority move. Hidden Power Flying is boosted to 90 Base Power by Technician and allows Stratagem to hit Mega Venusaur and Tomohawk hard; do not use Hidden Power Psychic, as it lowers Stratagem's Speed IV to 30. Fire Blast provides strong coverage against Steel- and Grass-types such as Mega Scizor and Necturna, respectively, while Energy Ball is used to hit bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Arghonaut and Colossoil, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Stratagem to hit as quickly and as hard as possible. A Timid nature allows Stratagem to outspeed Pokemon with more than base 120 Speed, particularly Talonflame and Syclant. Life Orb is the best option to boost Stratagem's offensive power while giving it the freedom to change moves. Choice Specs allows Stratagem to hit harder, but being locked into a single move can easily allow a tank to switch in and force Stratagem out. Technician raises the power of Stratagem's Ancient Power and its specific coverage moves in Hidden Power Flying and Vacuum Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions very well as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer due to Stratagem's high Speed and the lack of a boosting move on this set. Bring Stratagem into the battlefield on free switches whenever possible, as even resisted hits take away a decent amount of its health. Additionally, be sure to significantly weaken opposing special walls before bringing in Stratagem, as Stratagem is not a very good wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass-types such as Necturna and Mega Venusaur resist the Water-type moves that Stratagem is weak to; they also sport resistances to Fighting by virtue of their secondary types. Flying-types such as Tomohawk can easily switch into the Ground-type moves that Stratagem lures in. This is important because this Stratagem set lacks Levitate. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scizor and Rotom-W can bring Stratagem into the battlefield safely. Entry hazard support from the likes of Landorus-T and Heatran allows Stratagem to break stall more easily and land some KOs that it normally would not. For example, Choice Specs Stratagem will OHKO Tomohawk with Hidden Power Flying after Stealth Rock damage. Gothitelle can trap and KO special walls such as Chansey, while Magnezone can trap Steel-types if Stratagem lacks Fire-type coverage. Physical attackers such as Mega Metagross and Dragon Dance Aurumoth can break down the special walls that give Stratagem a hard time sweeping.</p>"

      "Levitate Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Paleo Wave is a reliable STAB attack that hits Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Syclant for massive damage. Earth Power gives Stratagem a fighting chance against Mollux, Heatran, and Cyclohm while providing vast neutral coverage alongside Paleo Wave. Fire Blast hits Steel- and Grass-types, such as Mega Scizor, Kitsunoh, Cawmodore, Ferrothorn, and Necturna, for massive damage. Energy Ball hits bulky Ground- and Water-types super effectively, such as Colossoil, Mega Gyarados, Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Stratagem needs full investment in its Special Attack and Speed in order to become as powerful and as fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to get the jump on Pokemon with more than base 120 Speed. Life Orb boosts the power of Stratagem's moves while allowing Stratagem to freely change attacks. On the other hand, Choice Specs grants Stratagem more power and does not inflict recoil damage; however, a foe that walls Stratagem can switch in easily and force Stratagem out. Levitate allows Stratagem to switch into Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and stray Ground-type moves, lessening the amount of team support it needs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to take advantage of Levitate granting Stratagem immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type attacks. This allows Stratagem to switch into battle much more easily than it normally would. However, be careful for coverage moves that Ground-type attackers might be carrying, such as Superpower from Landorus-T. As this Stratagem lacks Vacuum Wave, take caution if the opponent's priority attackers are still healthy. Even without priority, however, Stratagem still functions as a great late-game cleaner and revenge killer due to its high Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stratagem is a great stand-alone Pokemon, so it can mesh well with nearly any offensive team. It has great defensive synergy with Necturna and Mollux because they can take the Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Steel-type attacks that take a large chunk out of Stratagem's health. Necturna in particular can provide Sticky Web support, helping against Choice Scarf users and naturally faster Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile. Stratagem should also be paired with a physical attacker in order to prevent special walls from dominating your team. In particular, Colossoil and Cawmodore make for great checks to Chansey and Sylveon, respectively. Entry hazard support from the likes of Tomohawk and Heatran allows Stratagem to have an easier time landing KOs. Trappers such as Gothitelle and Magnezone can remove opposing threats to Stratagem; Gothitelle can cripple special walls with Trick, while Magnezone takes on the Steel-types that resist Stratagem's Paleo Wave.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind raises Stratagem's Special Attack to high levels and its Special Defense to decent levels, turning it from a revenge killer into a bulky wallbreaker. Paleo Wave should be used over Ancient Power as a STAB attack because this Stratagem lacks Technician. Earth Power breaks down Mollux and Heatran, two would-be special walls that don't mind taking a Paleo Wave. Fire Blast can be used in the last slot to heavily damage Grass-types and Steel-types neutral to Ground, such as Necturna and Mega Scizor, respectively. Energy Ball breaks down Arghonaut, Mega Gyarados, Colossoil, and Rotom-W; alternatively, Giga Drain is an option if you opt to run Life Orb, as it heals off some of the Life Orb recoil and allows Stratagem to break walls longer. Substitute can also be used to give Stratagem a shield against weaker special attacks and status moves, thus allowing it to break stall; however, Stratagem usually prefers extra coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed, Stratagem hits as hard and as fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to get the jump on Pokemon with more than base 120 Speed. Leftovers promotes longevity by keeping Stratagem healthy, allowing it to use Calm Mind multiple times throughout the match. Life Orb is an option to boost Stratagem's offensive power, though Stratagem forgoes quite a bit of its durability because of the resulting recoil damage. Levitate allows Stratagem to switch into Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and stray Ground-type moves easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Though Stratagem seems extremely frail due to its poor defensive typing, it actually has a decent HP stat. This set takes advantage of Stratagem's decent HP by allowing Stratagem to function as a mid-game wallbreaker in addition to a late-game cleaner. Despite the ability to set up, Stratagem often needs several Calm Mind boosts to be able to break down dedicated special walls effectively. Moreover, finding the right setup bait can be tricky due to Stratagem's poor defensive typing and iffy bulk. Passive, defensive Pokemon as well as Pokemon Choice-locked into moves that Stratagem resists are Stratagem's best options for setup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stratagem needs a lot of support from its teammates if it wants to find setup opportunities. Physical tanks such as Tomohawk can handle the physical attackers that Stratagem cannot set up on. Sand support from Tyranitar increases Stratagem's Special Defense, thus allowing it to take special attacks more easily as it sets up. Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap specially bulky Pokemon, particularly Latios, Latias, and Gothitelle. Stealth Rock users such as Pyroak and Landorus-T will wear down foes with passive damage, giving Stratagem an easier time sweeping. Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Colossoil can remove Assault Vests from the likes of Arghonaut, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr. Grass-types such as Necturna and Breloom appreciate Stratagem's ability to beat Fire-types, particularly Heatran, Talonflame, Mollux, and Mega Charizard X and Y. In addition, Necturna can take the Water-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Stratagem. Gothitelle can trap dedicated special walls, particularly Chansey and Sylveon, and cripple them with Trick, thus paving the way for Stratagem to attempt a sweep.</p>"

  "Kitsunoh": {
    "overview": "<p>Kitsunoh is one of the most versatile CAPs around and can perform well in both offensive and utility roles thanks to its combination of unique traits and desirable move options. It can also act as a scout or a lead, as it did in the DPP era, even with the introduction of Team Preview. Most importantly, Kitsunoh has a solid defensive typing, with a whopping twelve resistances, which allows it to check various CAP metagame staples, including Kyurem-B and Aurumoth. In addition, Kitsunoh's base 110 Speed allows it to outpace threats such as Keldeo, while its fast Defog and resistance to Stealth Rock almost always ensure it can switch in and clear the field of hazards safely. Finally, with a wide array of coverage moves, including its signature move, Shadow Strike, it can function as a fast physical sweeper as well. Also, unlike other sweepers, Kitsunoh does not suffer unduly from four-moveslot syndrome; it can deal with everything it needs to with 2 STAB moves and 2 coverage moves.</p> <p>However, the Steel-type nerf and the Knock Off buff mean Kitsunoh's typing is not as good as it used to be. The rise of Colossoil does it no favors either, as Kitsunoh is unable to take anything Colossoil has to throw at it. Additionally, its defensive typing can go to waste in practice due to Kitsunoh's low 80 / 85 / 80 bulk. Finally, even with its vast offensive movepool, it still has only a modest base 103 Attack and lacks a boosting move. Nonetheless, Kitsunoh's versatility makes it a great fit for teams looking for a Pokemon that can handle Fairy-types, a reliable hazard remover, a dedicated lead, or some combination thereof.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash lets Kitsunoh survive an attack from Colossoil, Talonflame, both Mega Charizards, or Choice Scarf users, but is dependent on entry hazards being off the field. Assault Vest looks great on paper, but it is not that viable because of Kitsunoh's below-average bulk and poor offense if you invest in bulk. Roar is actually a decent option to force out Clefable if it accumulates too many boosts. Make sure you do not run Roar alongside Defog, as you will clear away any entry hazards that have been set up earlier in the battle, thereby reducing the effectiveness of Kitsunoh's phazing. An Expert Belt can be used on offensive sets, as it does not lock Kitsunoh into a move like a Choice Band and takes advantage of its plethora of resistances and good coverage despite its iffy bulk. Finally, Taunt can be nice to stallbreak and prevent status moves, but typically Tomohawk and Thundurus do the Taunt shenanigans better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Colossoil</strong>: Thanks to the Steel-type nerf, Kitsunoh no longer takes neutral damage to Dark-type moves and as such loses to Colossoil nearly every time. All the Colossoil user has to do is to click Sucker Punch, and Kitsunoh is done for the battle.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame makes Kitsunoh literally toast. Kitsunoh is completely unable to take a Flare Blitz, even when it invests in bulk.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: If Kitsunoh is not holding Choice Scarf itself, then it gets demolished by the likes of Landorus-T, Victini, and Volkraken, which all have STAB moves that it is weak to.</p> <p><strong>Tomohawk and Skarmory</strong>: These two defensive birds wall all of Kitsunoh's sets and often carry Rocky Helmet to deal chip damage to Kitsunoh.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Kitsunoh cannot hit Mega Charizard Y super effectively, while Charizard OHKOes it. Though it can use Earthquake on Mega Charizard X, the move won't OHKO Charizard all the time and Kitsunoh will lose if Earthquake fails to OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Physical walls</strong>: Kitsunoh's average 103 Attack leaves a lot to be desired against Cyclohm, Cawmodore, Mega Scizor, and even Revenankh, despite hitting the last super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur, particularly the physically defensive variant, walls Kitsunoh to no end. Fortunately, it can do little in return because Kitsunoh resists Grass and is immune to Poison.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With this set, not only does Kitsunoh have a very fast U-turn to keep your team's momentum going, but it can also use Trick to cripple opposing leads such as Tomohawk or staples of stall teams such as Chansey. Shadow Strike is Kitsunoh's Ghost-type STAB move which includes a nifty 50% chance to lower the foe's Defense stat by one stage. As such, the move is extremely spammable and can either gradually make Kitsunoh hit that much harder or force the foe out if it accumulates too many Defense drops. Finally, Kitsunoh has a choice between two Steel-type STAB moves, Meteor Mash and Iron Head. Meteor Mash has slightly more immediate power and its chance to raise Kitsunoh's Attack can come in very handy at times. Alternatively, Iron Head is more reliable due to its perfect accuracy and its high flinch rate can give slower foes headaches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set highlights what Kitsunoh was built to be: a scout. Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allow Kitsunoh to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Limber is usually the better choice of ability, as immunity to paralysis from the likes of Thundurus and Chansey is more valuable than Frisk's utility. However, if you are to use this Kitsunoh as a dedicated lead, Frisk can work to ensure you do not waste your use of Trick by using it on another Choice-locked foe. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Kitsunoh will outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Keldeo, and will be able to U-turn out of bad match-ups easily. Repeated usage of Shadow Strike will also force switches and cripple opposing Pokemon if they stay in for too long. This can win free turns for Kitsunoh, or more importantly, its teammates. Though the Choice Scarf does little for Kitsunoh's utility in defeating Fairies, as all of them are naturally slower, it does allow Kitsunoh to beat Stratagem one-on-one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Kitsunoh set works well as a dedicated lead, stripping the precious items from opposing Pokemon. When in doubt, you should always click U-turn to kill off opposing momentum while maintaining your own. Additionally, unless Kitsunoh is facing Stratagem, it should not use its Steel-type STAB move until it Tricks away its Scarf, as it's a poor type to be locked into and can easily be taken advantage of. Even if you don't use this set as a dedicated lead, TrickScarf works wonders against defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Chansey, and Skarmory. Keep in mind, however, that you can only use it once!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Kitsunoh isn't a wallbreaker, you should pack special attackers to deal with physical walls that threaten it. Aurumoth is a good partner, as it is able to take on Mega Venusaur and Tomohawk, both of which are thorough stops to Kitsunoh. Stratagem can deal with Syclant, Ferrothorn, Cawmodore, and, to a certain extent, Colossoil. But if Colossoil remains too much trouble for you, a Fairy-type such Sylveon or Mega Gardevoir is great for beating it. Fairies have the added bonus of being able to defeat Tomohawk more easily than Aurumoth can, as well as countering nearly all variants of Cyclohm.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A fast Will-O-Wisp allows Kitsunoh to easily spread burns and patch up its subpar Defense. Shadow Strike is the best choice for a reliable STAB move, as the ability to cause constant Defense drops and vast neutral coverage far outclasses Steel-type coverage on Ice-, Rock- and Fairy-types. U-turn and Knock Off are utility attacks; U-turn is useful to gain and maintain momentum and Knock Off can relieve foes of their items. Defog adds to the utility of this set by keeping entry hazards off the field. Kitsunoh makes for a good Defogger because it resists Stealth Rock and is immune to Toxic Spikes, meaning it can switch into hazards several times without worry.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As this set is not entirely offensive, you want to maximize Kitsunoh's HP and Speed to make it as bulky and fast as possible. Leftovers add to Kitsunoh's overall longevity, while Air Balloon lets it freely switch into Ground-type moves as well as Spikes, making Kitsunoh an even better entry hazard remover. As a fast support Pokemon, Kitsunoh hates being inflicted with paralysis, so you should always use Limber over Frisk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>No matter how much you invest in Kitsunoh's HP, it still has merely average bulk. Moreover, you're not sweeping teams with nearly zero investment in offense, so don't use Kitsunoh as your team's main attacker. U-turn and Knock Off should not be thought of as offensive tools, either; they are there for utility more than anything else. These attacks do, however, prevent Kitsunoh from being Taunt bait, as does Shadow Strike.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Kitsunoh is a supporter, so you need offensive teammates that it can support. Pokemon that aren't very physically bulky, such Sylveon, appreciate Kitsunoh's burn support. Offensive teammates also appreciate such support, so it would be wise to surround Kitsunoh with an offensive core; Stratagem and Aurumoth are great Pokemon to build around here because they are usable on a wide variety of teams. You should also have a Pokemon that can handle Fairy-types; Cawmodore and Mollux work well in this role. Pokemon that appreciate Defog and don't overly require hazard support of their own, such as Gyarados, also make good partners.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kitsunoh's STAB attacks have good neutral coverage, and together they hit everything for at least neutral damage bar Bibarel, Bisharp, Crawdaunt, Mega Gyarados, Heliolisk, Houndoom, Pyroar, and Sharpedo. Earthquake often provides the best secondary coverage, hitting Mega Charizard X, Cyclohm, Bisharp, Heatran, Mollux, Volkraken, Krilowatt, Excadrill, and Klefki for super effective damage. Ice Punch, on the other hand, hits Landorus, Mega Pinsir, Thundurus, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Gliscor. Superpower is an option if Kitsunoh absolutely needs to beat Chansey, Blissey, Colossoil, and Ferrothorn. A strong U-turn maintains momentum and deals damage when Kitsunoh needs to switch, and with Attack investment, U-turn actually has use as a main source of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Even with a modest base 103 Attack, this spread is all about dealing damage with the proper coverage. Full investment in Attack and Speed ensure that Kitsunoh can deal the most damage as quickly as possible. A Choice Band is often the best item for this set, as it maximizes Kitsunoh's damage output and its move-locking side effects reset if Kitsunoh U-turns out. But if you choose not to run U-turn, a Life Orb becomes Kitsunoh's best bet. Limber is the better ability, as it saves Kitsunoh from stray Thunder Waves, and allows it to beat Static Cyclohm should you forego Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using a Choice Band, choose your move carefully. If a threat to Kitsunoh is still on the opposing side, make sure you U-turn out to preserve Kitsunoh for later. This offensive set is most useful a late-game cleaner, especially considering that Kitsunoh resists many forms of priority. It is also great for killing Fairies and allows you to not have to use a teamslot on Mollux or Cawmodore. But beware of Rocky Helmet Tomohawk and Skarmory; it would be unwise to even U-turn out against them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special attackers such as Aurumoth and Keldeo can destroy the physical walls that force Kitsunoh out. U-turning into Cyclohm or Stratagem can help protect Kitsunoh from Fire-types such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon will destroy Tomohawk, Cyclohm, and Colossoil, all of which are strong checks to Kitsunoh. Dragon-types such as Garchomp appreciate Kitsunoh's ability to beat Fairy-types. Entry hazard support from the likes of Tomohawk and Landorus-T will give Kitsunoh an easier time landing KOs.</p>"

  "Cyclohm": {
    "overview": "<p>Cyclohm is one of the best physical walls in the CAP metagame, as it has solid HP and Defense as well as handy resistances to common attacking types in Water, Grass, Steel, Fire, Electric, and Flying. Cyclohm's high bulk and resistance to Flying allow it to serve as one of the best counters to Cawmodore and Talonflame. It is not weak offensively, either, as a base 112 Special Attack prevents it from being taken advantage of by setup sweepers and Taunt. Its wide special movepool grants it the options it needs to handle most threats in the metagame. In addition, it has two great abilities: Static punishes foes using contact moves, and Shield Dust blocks the secondary effects of moves. However, Cyclohm's Special Defense is merely average, allowing special attackers to prey on it. It also has some annoying weaknesses to common attacking types in Dragon, Fairy, Ground, and Ice. Its vulnerability to entry hazards also threatens to reduce its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cyclohm can use Light Screen with maximum investment in Special Defense and a Calm nature to tank hits from Volkraken, Mega Charizard Y, Krilowatt, and Stratagem. Charge Beam can be used to set up a sweep, but common threats such as Colossoil and Unaware Clefable can easily force Cyclohm out. Thunder Wave is an option to cripple faster Pokemon. Rain Dance can be used to take advantage of Cyclohm's bulk by using it as a supporter for rain teams. Power Gem can be used to hit Pyroak and Mollux, though it has no other uses. Substitute can be used for more insurance against switch-ins.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey, Cresselia, and Mollux can take hits from Cyclohm by virtue of their special bulk and can cripple Cyclohm with Toxic or strike it with super effective moves. Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed to whittle down Cyclohm's health, though it can't do much else. Heatran takes on any set lacking Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Not only are Fairy-types immune to Cyclohm's Dragon-type STAB attacks, but most of them also have enough bulk to take Cyclohm's other attacks. Clefable, Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Mega Altaria can inflict a considerable amount of damage onto Cyclohm or even OHKO it with their own STAB attacks. However, physical Mega Altaria has to set up Dragon Dance before it can OHKO Cyclohm, and Cyclohm can run Hydro Pump to discourage Diancie from switching in and Mega Evolving.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mamoswine, Excadrill, Diggersby, Garchomp, Colossoil, Mega Swampert, Mega Camerupt, and Landorus-T force Cyclohm out with Earthquake or Earth Power. Colossoil can even come in on Toxic to bounce it back at Cyclohm with Rebound or gain an Attack boost with Guts.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Syclant, Stratagem, Krilowatt, Latias, Latios, Noivern, Mega Sceptile, opposing Cyclohm, and Kyurem-B prey on Cyclohm's weaker Special Defense with super effective moves. However, aside from Krilowatt, none of them are safe switch-ins; Syclant gets taken down by Fire Blast, Stratagem falls to Hydro Pump, and Kyurem-B, Mega Sceptile, Cyclohm, Noivern, Latios, and Latias do not like Dragon Pulse or Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: Gothitelle can trap Cyclohm and wear it down to the point where it will have a hard time dealing with the Pokemon it is meant to check.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off is a reliable form of recovery that enables Cyclohm to hold its own against many physical attackers. An Electric-type STAB attack is used to hit anything that does not resist it for decent damage. Discharge is preferred due to its higher chance to paralyze threats, while Thunderbolt can be an alternative if Toxic is used to prevent clashing status. Fire Blast and Flamethrower hit Grass-, Ice-, Bug-, and Steel-types, such as Necturna, Kitsunoh, Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and, most notably, Cawmodore. Fire Blast should be used on any set with Shield Dust due to its chance of OHKOing Cawmodore, but if Static is chosen, Flamethrower is an option for a more accurate Fire-type move. Whirlwind allows Cyclohm to phaze setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage on foes. Heal Bell turns Cyclohm into a cleric that can cure the team of status and free up a moveslot for a teammate. Toxic can be used to place a timer on walls and hit switch-ins that can otherwise threaten Cyclohm, such as Mega Gardevoir. A Water-type attack such as Surf or Hydro Pump can hit Landorus-T, Colossoil, Mega Diancie, and Gliscor, though there is little room for it in this set. Surf is more reliable than Hydro Pump and does not miss out on any important KOs, while Hydro Pump is an option for more power. Dragon Pulse can also be used for coverage against Dragon-types, but it is hard to fit in this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature maximizes Cyclohm's physical bulk. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, further increasing Cyclohm's longevity. Static allows Cyclohm to punish attackers using contact moves, especially Talonflame and Cawmodore, while Shield Dust is an alternative to prevent secondary effects such as burns from Scald and Lava Plume, poison from Sludge Bomb, and Defense drops from Shadow Strike. Static is notable in that it allows any set lacking Whirlwind to repeatedly use Slack Off until Cawmodore gets paralyzed, leaving it vulnerable to Flamethrower. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 116 Def / 140 SpD can be used to enable Cyclohm to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, Keldeo's Hydro Pump, Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, and uninvested Heatran's Earth Power, allowing Cyclohm to use Slack Off against these foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is more suited for defensive and balanced teams that need a wall to deal with Cawmodore and Talonflame. Cyclohm should switch in on Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it. Due to Cyclohm's high physical bulk, it is a good switch-in to physical attackers, especially Talonflame and Cawmodore. If Cyclohm is up against a setup sweeper, it should use Whirlwind to phaze it. If running Heal Bell, Cyclohm should use it whenever the team needs status ailments removed. If running Toxic, it should be used on a predicted switch-in to put it on a timer. Cyclohm should use Slack Off when needed to avoid getting KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon can pass Wishes to Cyclohm and also cure it of any status inflicted onto it with Heal Bell. Chansey can take on any special attacker lacking Psyshock or Secret Sword, while Clefable and Sylveon deal with Dark-types, Fighting-types, and Dragon-types. Tomohawk and Skarmory are also good teammates, as they can switch into Ground-types such as Colossoil and Landorus-T. Colossoil and Bisharp make for good teammates as well, as they can trap Gothitelle with Pursuit and revenge kill Syclant with Sucker Punch. Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Arghonaut, and Slowbro as well as Mega Scizor can switch into Ice-type moves aimed at Cyclohm, and Arghonaut and Mega Scizor can also check Syclant. Mega Venusaur, Mega Scizor, Mollux, Pyroak, Ferrothorn, and Heatran are also great partners to Cyclohm, as they can deal with Fairy-types. Any sweeper that appreciates Talonflame and Cawmodore removed is a good option as well; Aurumoth and Revenankh are some great sweepers in the metagame that can set up once Talonflame and Cawmodore are removed from the game.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move that deals decent damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it. Thunder can be used on a rain team for more power. Draco Meteor is used to hit Dragon-types for super effective damage; however, Dragon Pulse is an alternative to prevent Cyclohm's Special Attack from being lowered. Hydro Pump hits Ground-types such as Colossoil and Landorus-T, Fire-types such as Heatran and Victini, and Rock-types such as Stratagem and Mega Diancie, 2HKOing specially defensive Heatran and having a chance to OHKO Cawmodore after Stealth Rock. Fire Blast is used to hit Grass-, Ice-, Bug-, and Steel-types such as Necturna, Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Cawmodore. Ice Beam can be used instead to hit Mega Altaria, which can otherwise wall Cyclohm. Slack Off is an option alongside Life Orb to negate recoil damage and increase Cyclohm's longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shield Dust is the preferred ability to prevent secondary effects such as poison from Sludge Bomb, burn from Scald and Lava Plume, and Defense drops from Shadow Strike. Static is an option to punish foes that use contact moves, such as Talonflame and Cawmodore. Both Choice Specs and Life Orb increase Cyclohm's damage output , with Choice Specs offering no recoil damage and more power and Life Orb enabling Cyclohm to switch moves. A Choice Scarf gives a different role to this set, enabling Cyclohm to lure in and deal with a few faster threats such as Stratagem and be a decent revenge killer. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to hit as hard and as fast as possible; with Choice Specs or Life Orb, Cyclohm can outspeed Tomohawk, uninvested Landorus-T, uninvested Kyurem-B, and Assault Vest Colossoil. A Modest nature can be used for more power on sets with Life Orb and Choice Specs, as it only loses out on outspeeding Timid Togekiss, Mega Scizor, Mega Altaria, 232 Speed Landorus-T, 224 Speed Gliscor, and 200 Speed Kyurem-B. An alternate spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe with a Modest nature can be used on sets with Choice Specs or Life Orb for more bulk while still outspeeding uninvested Tomohawk. When using a Choice Scarf, it is vital to run a Timid nature with maximum Speed investment to be able to outspeed and revenge kill Stratagem, Mega Lopunny, +1 Adamant Mega Gyarados, and Adamant Mega Beedrill. Note that no matter what item Cyclohm is holding, it will fail to OHKO Assault Vest Colossoil, and prior damage is needed for sets with Choice Scarf to guarantee an OHKO on Mega Diancie if running a Timid nature. The shared quality between all three items is the extra power of this set to surprise an unsuspecting opponent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is more effective on offensive teams, though it can work on balanced teams as well. When using offensive Cyclohm, try to find the perfect opportunity to surprise the opponent, such as when the opponent's current Pokemon tries to attack Cyclohm or set up on it, expecting to survive an incoming attack from Cyclohm. If using Choice Specs or Life Orb, Cyclohm should be used early- and mid-game to punch holes in teams for Cyclohm's teammates to clean up late-game. If using Choice Scarf, Cyclohm should come in once a teammate is KOed, as it can then revenge kill the foe. The Choice Scarf set can also clean up late-game once its checks and counters are removed. If Cyclohm can take a hit from the foe, it should switch in to deal with the threat. Cawmodore, Talonflame, and Kitsunoh are good targets for Cyclohm to switch in on and take advantage of. Cyclohm should use the appropriate coverage moves to hit the foe hard, taking advantage of its ability to lure in common switch-ins such as Colossoil and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon can offer Wish support to Cyclohm and also remove its status ailment should it have one. Chansey can also deal with special attackers, while Clefable and Sylveon are better answers to Dragon-types, Fighting-types, and Dark-types. A teammate that can deal with Ground-types such as Colossoil is also helpful; Keldeo, Tomohawk, and Skarmory are good options. Keldeo is notable, as it can fit on rain teams due to rain boosting its Water-type STAB attacks. A wallbreaker that can remove special walls such as Chansey and Sylveon is helpful; Mega Gardevoir, Kyurem-B, and Mega Metagross are useful wallbreakers. Mollux, Ferrothorn, Plasmanta, Mega Scizor, Heatran, and Kitsunoh are also great teammates, as they can check Fairy-types, and Mollux can also fit on rain teams due to Dry Skin increasing its longevity. Clefable, Mega Diancie, Sylveon, and Ferrothorn are also great partners because they can handle Dragon-types. Necturna is also a good partner, as it can use Sticky Web to allow Cyclohm to outspeed the majority of grounded threats. Politoed and Rain Dance Tomohawk can set up rain to power up Hydro Pump and make Thunder more reliable. Sweepers that appreciate having Talonflame and Cawmodore removed, such as Aurumoth and Revenankh, are great partners to Cyclohm, as it helps open the way for them to set up.</p>"

  "Colossoil": {
    "overview": "<p>Out of the many additional Pokemon that roam free in CAP, it's no stretch to say that Colossoil is a creation that has had one of the most significant impacts on the metagame as a whole. For starters, Colossoil's capabilities as a spinner are nearly unmatched; it's one of only two Dark-type users of Rapid Spin (the other being Malaconda) and has a powerful STAB Knock Off coming off of an impressive base 122 Attack, which is enough to heavily deter nearly any Ghost-type from trying to spinblock it. Colossoil is notable for much more than just Rapid Spin, though; it has several other powerful STAB options such as Earthquake, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit, broadening its capabilities as an offensive Pokemon. Having access to U-turn is also incredibly helpful for more offensively oriented teams, as it allows Colossoil to act as a much more effective pivot and preserve momentum for its team. Colossoil also has access to two useful abilities, including its signature ability, Rebound, which can bounce back status moves, entry hazards, and basketballs on the turn it switches in, and Guts, which makes it a threatening status absorber. Finally, Colossoil's unique stat spread makes running either defensive spreads or offensive spreads both feasible and viable. All of these defining traits make it a versatile and useful addition to numerous team archetypes.</p> <p>As influential and threatening as Colossoil is, it still has some fairly notable flaws that can be exploited. For instance, although Colossoil's Dark / Ground typing gives it four resistances and two immunities, it's also plagued with six weaknesses, many of which are prevalent attacking types in the metagame. Having weaknesses to the common Fairy-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks is never a great attribute to have, hampering Colossoil's ability to pivot and support the team. Offensively, Colossoil's typing can leave it struggling to do much of anything against some prominent physical walls, the most notable of which is Tomohawk, which hard walls Colossoil with ease thanks to its typing and access to Prankster Roost. Furthermore, Colossoil's STAB combination often isn't enough to prevent opposing setup sweepers such as Mega Altaria and Mega Scizor from using it as easy setup fodder, which can prove detrimental to Colossoil and its teammates. In spite of Colossoil's shortcomings, its numerous strengths and versatility have secured its niche as one of the best spinners CAP has to offer, a potent offensive pivot, and a surprisingly talented basketball player.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf allows Colossoil to act as a revenge killer and potentially a late-game wincon if its checks and counters are removed. Stone Edge provides strong coverage against Flying-types and certain Fire-types such as Pyroak and Talonflame, but Colossoil generally doesn't have room for the move, and it doesn't help with its issue with Tomohawk at all. Fire Fang does a hefty chunk of damage to Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, but Colossoil struggles finding a moveslot for it and is usually better off using U-turn to switch to a partner in these cases. Iron Tail allows Colossoil to 2HKO Fairy-types it lures in such as Mega Altaria, Sylveon, and Clefable, but its shaky 75% accuracy makes this a subpar option. Toxic can be used to put opposing Tomohawk on a timer. Finally, a set with Flame Orb and moves like Fake Out and Facade utilizes Guts to its fullest potential, but it is generally worn down too quickly to be truly effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tomohawk</strong>: Tomohawk can switch into any of Colossoil's moves and heal off any damage done with Roost. From there, Tomohawk can wear it down with Air Slash or Aura Sphere, set up entry hazards, set up Substitute, or use a boosting move.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory walls all of Colossoil's common moves thanks to its typing and can heal off any damage taken with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor's typing allows it to switch into Colossoil's common moves and heal off damage taken with Roost. It works well as a Knock Off absorber, as its Mega Stone can't be removed. Bulky Swords Dance variants of Mega Scizor can easily set up on Colossoil as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Mega Venusaur heavily threaten Colossoil with their STAB moves, while Colossoil can't do too much in return besides U-turn out.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, especially physically oriented ones such as Mega Altaria and Azumarill, easily force Colossoil out with their STAB moves and can use the opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many Fighting-types, most notably Mega Heracross, can easily switch into Colossoil or simply revenge kill it, as they resist Knock Off and aren't threatened by Sucker Punch or Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Arghonaut, Gyarados, and Keldeo can stomach an attack from Colossoil and threaten it back with their STAB moves. Gyarados in particular can weaken Colossoil's Attack with Intimidate, is immune to Earthquake, and resists U-turn before it Mega Evolves, allowing it to check Colossoil quite easily throughout the match and Mega Evolve once Colossoil is defeated.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Point Guard (Assault Vest)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The first two moveslots are just about mandatory for any of Colossoil's sets to ensure that it can fully take advantage of its high Attack and potent STAB combination. Earthquake is Colossoil's strongest and most reliable STAB move, hitting any foe that isn't resistant or immune to the move for solid damage. Knock Off is also quite strong with the STAB boost, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types for high damage, and it is also useful for its ability to remove the foe's item.</p> <p>There's more room for variety in Colossoil's third and fourth moveslots, however, as the choice of moves highly depends on which type of role Colossoil is required to play on its team. Rapid Spin allows Colossoil to clear entry hazards, and it's an excellent user of the move thanks to its Dark-type STAB moves deterring Ghost-types from attempting to spinblock it. Sucker Punch gives Colossoil strong priority and a method of checking faster threats. U-turn allows Colossoil to pivot out of its checks and counters as they switch into it, allowing one of Colossoil's teammates to switch in safely. Pursuit is used to trap and KO Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Kitsunoh, that could otherwise escape from Colossoil by switching out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to let Colossoil hit hard with its STAB moves. Most of the remaining EV investment goes towards bolstering Colossoil's special bulk, which, when combined with Assault Vest, allows it to easily sponge special hits and support its team. The 36 EVs in Defense are used to avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Syclant's Superpower after Stealth Rock damage. At the cost of some bulk, Colossoil can opt to invest 236 EVs in Speed to outpace Hasty Hoopa-U and hit it hard with Earthquake or U-turn before it can strike back.</p> <p>The ability choice is largely dependent on the team Colossoil is on. Guts provides Colossoil with a hefty boost to its Attack if it is crippled with status, allowing it to act as a potent status absorber for its team, and is often the superior choice for more balanced or bulky offensive teams. Rebound, however, can be used to bounce back status moves and entry hazards on the turn Colossoil switches in, which is often more useful for faster-paced teams that appreciate the ability to more aggressively pressure opposing status inducers and entry hazard setters. Rebound is also a good option if Colossoil isn't running Rapid Spin, as it retains some of its potential for controlling entry hazards with this ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Colossoil should come in on Pokemon it forces out, such as Cyclohm and Mega Manectric, so that it can easily pressure the foe and perform its duties for the team, be it through Knock Off, Rapid Spin, or simply grabbing momentum with U-turn. If using Guts, switching in on a potential status user allows Colossoil to gain an Attack boost from the move, putting even more power behind its attacks. If using Rebound, switch in on potential entry hazard setters and status users, as this turns the foe's moves against them. Don't switch in on Leech Seed users, however, as the Grass-type users of the move are immune to it themselves and threaten Colossoil with their Grass-type STAB attacks. Rebound can also be used to bounce back Roar and Whirlwind, which can potentially bring in a Pokemon that Colossoil has a favorable matchup against, such as a Ghost- or Psychic-type, which Colossoil can then remove from the game with Pursuit. Use Sucker Punch to revenge kill weakened faster threats. Beware of faster priority users such as Syclant, Talonflame, and Cawmodore, however, as well as potential Substitute users. Also, be cautious around Pokemon such as Necturna and Aurumoth, as they occasionally run Colbur Berry to weaken Colossoil's Dark-type STAB moves and can hit Colossoil hard with their own STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying-types such as Talonflame, Cawmodore, and Tomohawk pair well with Colossoil, as they love the Rapid Spin support that it provides, and in return, they can easily dispatch of the Grass- and Fighting-types that threaten Colossoil. Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon can easily handle Fighting-types, namely Tomohawk, for it, while Colossoil can beat Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types for them in return. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Heatran can handle opposing Fairy-types for Colossoil. Wish support from the likes of Chansey, Clefable, and Sylveon is useful to keep Colossoil healthy, as it has no reliable recovery and could otherwise be easily worn down over time.</p>"
      },
      "Power Forward (Offensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a powerful STAB move and hits impressively hard thanks to the boosts from STAB and Life Orb, allowing it to heavily dent any foe that isn't resistant or immune to the move. Knock Off gives Colossoil a powerful method of dealing with opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types, removes the foe's item, and can benefit from either Life Orb or Black Glasses. U-turn is necessary to allow Colossoil to pivot out of foes it can't heavily damage, such as Tomohawk and Mega Altaria, allowing a teammate better equipped to handle the situation to switch in. Sucker Punch provides Colossoil with priority, allowing it to act as a revenge killer for faster Pokemon. Pursuit hits Psychic- and Ghost-types hard if they try to switch out of Colossoil, such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Kitsunoh.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed are used to maximize Colossoil's offensive potential. A Jolly nature lets Colossoil make the best use of its base 95 Speed, ensuring that it outspeeds all non-Choice Scarf variants of Aurumoth. An Adamant nature can be used to let Colossoil hit even harder and still have enough Speed to outpace Jolly Necturna. Life Orb gives Colossoil a significant increase to its damage output but can leave it prone to being worn down rather quickly; Black Glasses can be used instead if Colossoil's longevity is of high importance, as it still provides a decent boost to Knock Off as well as its other Dark-type attacks. Guts allows Colossoil to function as a status absorber, providing it with an Attack boost should it become inflicted with a status ailment. Rebound, on the other hand, can be used to completely deflect status moves as well as entry hazards, but it only works on the turn Colossoil switches in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Colossoil can be utilized as an all-out attacker with its powerful STAB moves, provide Knock Off support for the team, or simply act as a pivot with U-turn. If using Guts, try to switch in on potential Will-O-Wisp or Toxic users to give Colossoil a large boost to its Attack. If using Rebound, Colossoil can freely switch in on many status, Stealth Rock, and Spikes users and bounce the moves back at the foe. Sucker Punch should be used to revenge kill faster Pokemon; just beware of faster priority users such as Syclant, Talonflame, and Cawmodore. Be cautious around potential Colbur Berry users as well, notably Necturna and Aurumoth, as they can easily survive a hit from Colossoil and retaliate with their STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying-types such as Talonflame, Cawmodore, and Tomohawk can easily deal with Grass- and Fighting-types for Colossoil. Offensive Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon can easily handle Fighting-types for it, while Colossoil can take care of Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types in return. Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, Kitsunoh, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory can all take on opposing Fairy-types for Colossoil. Wish support from Pokemon like Chansey, Sylveon, and Clefable is incredibly helpful to keep Colossoil healthy, as it otherwise will be worn down rather quickly from entry hazard damage, potential status damage, and potential Life Orb recoil.</p>"

  "Krilowatt": {
    "overview": "<p>Krilowatt acts as one of CAP's greatest special cleaners. It has excellent bulk, allowing it to switch into neutral attacks multiple times throughout the battle. Krilowatt also has great coverage with access to Electric-, Water-, Ground-, and Ice-type moves that lets it hit most of the metagame super effectively despite its low offensive stats. It also has great utility options in Heart Swap, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. It lies in a decent Speed tier, Speed tying with Mega Pinsir and outspeeding anything slower. Magic Guard is a blessing for Krilowatt, as it nullifies entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil and allows Krilowatt to absorb status.</p> <p>However, due to Krilowatt's middling Special Attack and lack of boosting moves, foes with decent Special Defense, such as Chansey, specially defensive Jirachi, and Mega Venusaur, wall it due to their natural bulk. It also has to hit foes super effectively to take them down, so foes that resist its moves, such as Ferrothorn and Pyroak, also wall it. Additionally, even though Krilowatt has wide physical coverage, its physical STAB moves are weak, making physical sets largely unviable. Despite Krilowatt's access to Earthquake and Low Kick, many of these moves' targets, like Cyclohm and Ferrothorn, have high Defense, which lowers physical Krilowatt's effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Krilowatt can run a bulky set with Discharge, Surf, Ice Beam, and a filler move and Leftovers with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe, which takes advantage of Krilowatt's massive HP stat. 252 Speed EVs let it outspeed maximum Speed Garchomp and Crucibelle and Speed tie with Mega Pinsir, and 252 HP EVs max out Krilowatt's HP stat. Substitute + Toxic is also an option for this bulkier spread, as it allows Krilowatt to work around Chansey, one of its intended counters. Trace can copy some cool abilities, most notably Rotom-W's Levitate and Tornadus-T's Regenerator. However, Magic Guard is more useful in most cases. Counter and Mirror Coat can deal massive damage with Krilowatt's high HP stat and low defenses and allow Krilowatt to work around would-be checks such as Kyurem-B and Mega Venusaur, but its lack of recovery sets limits on this strategy. Thunder Wave is a good option to let Krilowatt slow down faster threats for its teammates, but Krilowatt has a hard time giving up coverage for it. Heart Swap can steal boosts from Calm Mind wincons such as Mega Slowbro and Mega Sableye. It can also steal Cawmodore's Belly Drum; to take full advantage of the massive Attack boost, Krilowatt should run Waterfall / Thunderbolt / Ice Beam / Heart Swap with an EV spread of 20 Atk / 44 Def / 192 SpA / 252 Spe and a Naive nature. However, situations where Heart Swap is useful are very uncommon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Chansey, Clefable, Sylveon, and specially defensive Jirachi can tank anything that Krilowatt throws at them and heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled or Wish.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Pyroak, and Ferrothorn can all tank Ice Beam with ease, although Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Ferrothorn. Mega Venusaur and Pyroak can heal off the damage with Synthesis and retaliate with Giga Drain, while Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards and 2HKO Krilowatt with Power Whip. Necturna checks Krilowatt with Power Whip, but it gets 2HKOed with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B's special bulk allows it to Roost off any damage that Krilowatt deals out and wear down Krilowatt with Fusion Bolt and Earth Power, only fearing the uncommon Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Powerful Ground-type coverage usually OHKOes Krilowatt, but most Earthquake users like Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir and most Earth Power users like Tomohawk, Stratagem, Mega Diancie, and Heatran have a hard time switching into it. Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Heatran have to be Choice Scarf variants in order to outspeed it. Serperior can OHKO Krilowatt with Leaf Storm, and Mega Crucibelle can OHKO it with Wood Hammer after some prior damage; however, they have a hard time switching into Krilowatt's coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Cleaner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Surf hits Colossoil, Stratagem, Mega Diancie, Talonflame, and Cawmodore and is generally a safe move to use, as Krilowatt can follow up with Earth Power if Mollux or Plasmanta absorbs Surf with Dry Skin or Storm Drain, respectively. Thunderbolt hits Talonflame, Tornadus-T, Tomohawk, Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, Skarmory, Slowbro, and Volkraken hard. Earth Power OHKOes Choice Scarf Mollux and 2HKOes Heatran and Mega Crucibelle. Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor and 2HKOes Necturna, Latios, Serperior, and Mega Altaria. Because Krilowatt lures in Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which would normally wall or set up on it, Krilowatt can run Hidden Power Fire to 2HKO them, but Krilowatt struggles to find a moveslot for it. Low Kick is another option to allow Krilowatt to lure in and 2HKO Kyurem-B, even with an Attack-lowering nature. Low Kick also lands a guaranteed 2HKO on bulkier variants of Assault Vest Colossoil, while Surf has only a chance to 2HKO them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Krilowatt's Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with Mega Pinsir and outspeed Crucibelle and Garchomp. 252 Special Attack EVs let Krilowatt hit as hard as possible with the given nature. Magic Guard nullifies Life Orb recoil, poison and burn damage, and entry hazard damage, which would otherwise wear down Krilowatt. Life Orb gives a much needed boost to the power of Krilowatt's attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Krilowatt functions best as a late-gate cleaner and revenge killer, but it can switch in easily on Scald, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and weak neutral hits. It absorbs status well, with its Electric typing giving it an immunity to paralysis and Magic Guard nullifying poison and burn damage. Since Krilowatt is reliant on Life Orb for its damage output, it shouldn't be switching into Knock Off. Its wide coverage lets it break through type synergy cores, such as the core of Tomohawk, Colossoil, and Cyclohm, with adequate prediction.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame forms a great offensive core with Krilowatt, being immune to the Ground-type moves and resistant to the Grass-type moves aimed at Krilowatt and beating Jirachi, Mega Venusaur, Chansey, Pyroak, and Ferrothorn. In return, Krilowatt eliminates Electric-types and Heatran with Earth Power and Water-types with Thunderbolt. Illusion Aurumoth can disguise itself as Krilowatt effectively, as it resists Grass- and Ground-type moves and can work around some of Krilowatt's checks and counters, such as Colossoil, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur. Jirachi provides Wish or Healing Wish support and can deal with Mega Venusaur and Chansey. Krilowatt appreciates wallbreakers such as offensive Swords Dance Scizor and Tail Glow Aurumoth to wear down the opposing team so that it can clean easily. Magnezone and Magneton can trap Ferrothorn, Cawmodore, and Mega Scizor and eliminate them for Krilowatt. The first hard walls Krilowatt, while the latter two can set up on it.</p>"

  "Voodoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Voodoom's greatest asset is its base 110 Speed, which allows it to Speed tie with Latios, Latias, Kitsunoh, and Mega Metagross, all of which Voodoom threatens with its Dark-type STAB moves. Additionally, Voodoom's two abilities, Lightning Rod and Volt Absorb, along with a quadruple resistance to Dark and an immunity to Psychic, give Voodoom some opportunities to switch in. Voodoom has decent Special Attack and a STAB combination that is only resisted by Fairy-types, and in conjunction with Voodoom's good Speed, it has a niche as a fast special cleaner.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Voodoom's STAB combination and movepool leave it completely walled by Fairy-types, and its low Attack and just passable Special Attack leave it reliant on Life Orb for any meaningful damage output. Voodoom's relative frailty leaves it taking significant damage from every offensive Pokemon in the tier and makes it susceptible to revenge killing from fast attackers, Choice Scarf uses, and all forms of priority bar Sucker Punch. Lastly, Voodoom faces major competition from every other fast Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon in the tier, especially Weavile and Keldeo, and requires significant team support to function well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple switch-ins, but it is usually ineffective against Voodoom's most common switch-ins, Fairy-types; Sylveon, Clefable, and Mega Altaria have ways to remove status ailments and Azumarill is slow to begin with. However, it can help against some variants of Mega Altaria and can be bounced back by Mega Diancie for a Special Attack boost or some recovery. Earthquake can be used to OHKO offensive variants of Mollux and Heatran as well as bulkier sets with minor Attack investment and some prior damage. Knock Off can be used to remove the items of opposing Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf users, Chansey, and Colossoil. Baton Pass can be used to help gather momentum; Voodoom attracts Fairy-types to no end, so using Baton Pass on a predicted switch can put the foe in a disadvantageous position. Memento is an option to help a teammate get in good position for a sweep. Substitute and Pain Split can make use of Voodoom's high Speed to help wear down walls and to protect Voodoom from status conditions. Unfortunately, Substitute cannot protect Voodoom from Pixilate Hyper Voice from the likes of Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Every common Fairy-type can tank a hit from Voodoom and OHKO it with its STAB moves. Only Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie have anything to fear from Voodoom's attacks, and Sylveon, Clefable, and Mega Altaria can switch into Voodoom effortlessly.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Scizor, Talonflame, Technician Stratagem, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Azumarill can deal major damage to Voodoom with their priority attacks before it gets a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny can outspeed Voodoom and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf users such as Volkraken and Keldeo can also outspeed and KO Voodoom.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Due to the middling power of Voodoom's attacks and its relative frailty, anything that can take a hit and retaliate can feasibly check Voodoom. Scizor, Volkraken and both Mega Charizard formes can take a hit and OHKO or heavily damage Voodoom, and even Fighting-types, such as Keldeo and Revenankh, can take a Psychic and OHKO Voodoom.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Voodoom's most spammable move, as it hits neutral targets for decent damage. It also allows Voodoom to revenge kill Ghost- and Psychic-types. Close Combat hits Assault Vest Colossoil, Chansey, and specially defensive Heatran hard, 2HKOing all three. Aura Sphere can be used to provide Voodoom with a more powerful STAB option and hit Ferrothorn harder, but it is unable to 2HKO Chansey or Assault Vest Colossoil. Psychic is needed to hit Fighting-types super effectively and allows Voodoom to 2HKO all variants of Keldeo and Tomohawk, as well as hit Poison-types such as Plasmanta, Mollux, and Mega Venusaur hard. In the last moveslot, Taunt is preferred to prevent entry hazards, boosting moves, and Defog from being used. Taunt also helps wear down defensive Pokemon by denying them access to recovery or status removal. If stopping status moves is not a concern, Vacuum Wave can be used to give Voodoom access to a STAB priority move, allowing it to check faster threats such as Stratagem and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is needed to offset Voodoom's lackluster base Special Attack stat and guarantee the OHKO or 2HKO on several Pokemon. For example, Colossoil is only 2HKOed by an unboosted Close Combat, while a Life Orb-boosted one has a good chance to OHKO it, and Voodoom can't OHKO Latios or Latias without Life Orb. Lightning Rod is the preferred ability, as the potential boost to Voodoom's Special Attack significantly increases its damage output. Volt Absorb can be used to help offset entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil, but Voodoom appreciates the increase to its damage output more. The chosen EV spread gives Voodoom as much Special Attack and Speed as possible. A Speed-boosting nature is chosen to allow Voodoom to outspeed Keldeo and Speed tie with base 110 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Metagross, Kitsunoh, Latios, and Latias. A Hasty nature is preferred, as it allows Voodoom to switch into Electric-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types more easily due to them primarily being special attackers, although Naive is an option to better deal with Colossoil and take priority attacks, particularly Sucker Punch, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Voodoom's most spammable move and should be used as such. If the opponent has a Fairy-type on their team, you can expect them to switch to it. Predicting the switch and sending in your own Fairy-type check, such as Mega Scizor, can allow your team to grab momentum. Try to bait Electric-type moves through Pokemon weak to Electric, such as Gyarados, and then switch to Voodoom to activate its ability. Voodoom can also make for a decent anti-lead due to its access to a fast Taunt and ability to punish Volt Switch users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that can reliably check Fairy-types make for great teammates. Fire-types such as Heatran, Pyroak, and Talonflame are notable checks to Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria. Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Metagross help check Fairies as well. Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are also capable Mega Diancie checks and can provide Defog or entry hazard support. Cyclohm, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and other Electric-types can check Talonflame. Rock-types such as Stratagem and Tyranitar also check Talonflame. Fairy-types themselves can handle the Fighting-types that Voodoom attracts. Specially attacking Fairy-types, such as Mega Diancie and Togekiss, appreciate Voodoom's ability to check Chansey. Sylveon and Clefable can also keep Voodoom healthy with Wish and Heal Bell support. Pokemon that are weak to Electric-type attacks, such as Gyarados and Talonflame, can draw in Electric-types that Voodoom can capitalize on.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gardevoir is a defining force in the metagame, boasting the status of one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier thanks to a sky-high base 165 Special Attack stat as well as an incredible ability Pixilate, which makes her Hyper Voice dreadful to take. Although Mega Gardevoir is superb at breaking apart the tier's top walls, such as Tomohawk, it is no slouch against offensive Pokemon either with base 100 Speed and base 135 Special Defense. Gardevoir's non-attacking movepool includes Taunt and Calm Mind, which makes it even harder to stop with passive Pokemon such as Chansey.</p> <p>However, Gardevoir's physical bulk is pathetic in comparison to its Special Defense, with most physical attacks taking huge chunks out of Gardevoir's HP. This is problematic in a metagame infested with powerful physical attackers, such as Colossoil, Mega Altaria, and Mega Scizor. Gardevoir's weaknesses to Steel, Ghost, and Poison prey on its weak Defense, making Gardevoir easy prey for the likes of Mega Metagross.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Gardevoir can be used as a Wish passer if your team is desperate for healing, but Wish and Protect come at the cost of two of Mega Gardevoir's precious moveslots, and Mega Gardevoir is a poor Wish passer due to its low base HP. Psychic can be used over Psyshock to OHKO physically defensive Plasmanta, but Psyshock is more useful against specially defensive opponents. Substitute can used to ease prediction while also evading Toxic and Thunder Wave. Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor very hard and hits other Steel-types for decent damage. Shadow Ball can KO Kitsunoh and hit Metagross for good damage. Future Sight can apply tons of pressure to walls such as Pyroak; however, the opponent can play around it, and it means that Mega Gardevoir has to take a hit or give the foe a free switch. Destiny Bond is neat for grabbing a KO, but it's mostly useful for trading off with Colossoil and Bisharp. Memento can allow a teammate to set up easily, but it comes with the cost of Mega Gardevoir's life. Healing Wish is another sacrificial move that lets Mega Gardevoir fully heal a wounded teammate, but Mega Gardevoir does not have much room for it and prefers having its own Healing Wish support. Choice Scarf is an option if you need a Fairy-type revenge killer, but base Gardevoir is pathetic in comparison to its Mega Evolution.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor can KO Mega Gardevoir easily, though Will-O-Wisp cripples them if they switch into it. Kitsunoh can outspeed and KO Gardevoir with either of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Pyroak can come in on nearly any move that Mega Gardevoir has and can hit Mega Gardevoir with their STAB moves. Other Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame can survive a Hyper Voice, but they do not resist Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Though they fear Psyshock, Gengar, Mollux, and Plasmanta can KO Mega Gardevoir with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Nearly any physical attacker can maim Mega Gardevoir by targeting its low Defense. Landorus-T and Aurumoth can KO Mega Gardevoir with Earthquake and Megahorn, respectively, after just a small amount of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Many priority users, particularly Talonflame, Scizor, Colossoil, and Metagross, can deal heavy damage to Mega Gardevoir before it can react, spelling doom for it should it be weakened.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Any attacker that can outspeed Mega Gardevoir is able to revenge kill it, as Gardevoir is unable to boost its Speed on its own, and her bulk is low and easy to take advantage of. Physical attackers such as Kitsunoh and Weavile are especially troublesome, targeting Mega Gardevoir's middling Defense.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice is Mega Gardevoir's main STAB attack, reaching 175.5 Base Power with the boosts from Pixilate and STAB. With the great coverage that Fairy-type attacks have, many walls will struggle to withstand it. Psyshock is a secondary STAB attack that hits Poison-types very hard, pairing well with Hyper Voice's coverage. Psyshock is used instead of Psychic for hitting Chansey and Mollux on their weaker Defense stat. Focus Blast hits Steel-types that resist both of Mega Gardevoir's STAB attacks, hitting Heatran and Ferrothorn hard and hitting Scizor and Metagross harder than Mega Gardevoir's other attacks. Mega Gardevoir's support move helps it combat threats that it would struggle against otherwise. Will-O-Wisp allows Mega Gardevoir to cripple physical attackers that would otherwise threaten it, including Mega Metagross and Kitsunoh. Taunt is another option to prevent foes from healing or using status moves, letting Gardevoir handle Pokemon such as Pyroak more easily. With Calm Mind, Mega Gardevoir can set up against passive Pokemon, allowing her to breeze through walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Trace is useful for copying several useful abilities prior to Mega Evolving. Magnet Pull can be copied to trap Magnezone, Flash Fire grants an immunity to Heatran's Lava Plume, and Swift Swim lets Gardevoir revenge kill rain sweepers such as Kingdra. Maximum Special Attack with a Modest nature gives Mega Gardevoir full wallbreaking potential, and maximum Speed lets it outspeed passive walls and slower offensive Pokemon. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed or Speed tie with opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon, giving Mega Gardevoir more utility against offensive teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hyper Voice is a very powerful attack with no drawbacks, hitting a multitude of Pokemon extremely hard. Very few Pokemon can comfortably sponge it, such as Mollux and Mega Metagross. If the opponent has a Mollux or Plasmanta, it would be wise to scout for their sets first. If they are slow, defensive builds, Mega Gardevoir can easily combat them with Psyshock; if they are fast and offensive, they can be dangerous for Mega Gardevoir to face. Focus Blast and Will-O-Wisp are useful for predicting Mega Scizor or Mega Metagross switching in, as Gardevoir will struggle against them otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gardevoir is excellent at breaking down walls, especially physical ones. Talonflame, Cawmodore, and other physical attackers appreciate the removal of these threats. Special walls are also pressured by Mega Gardevoir's presence. Special attackers such as Stratagem love the pressure that Mega Gardevoir puts on special walls. Gardevoir's Steel weakness is easily handed by Heatran, Cyclohm, and Pyroak, making them great partners. Other Steel-types make for good defensive partners to absorb the Poison-type moves aimed at Gardevoir. Speed control is a great asset for Mega Gardevoir. Fidgit with Tailwind, Necturna with Sticky Web, or Thunder Wave from Thundurus and Klefki is essential if Mega Gardevoir wants to beat faster threats. Pursuit trappers are great for removing Kitsunoh and Mega Metagross. In a similar fashion, Magnezone can trap Steel-types such as Scizor, letting Mega Gardevoir attack much more easily. Healing Wish users such as Tomohawk and Latias make for good partners as well, letting Mega Gardevoir have a second chance at tearing apart the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a team slot at first until you look at its amazing ability to trap Steel-types like Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, which is useful because they can threaten a lot of the metagame's most dangerous sweepers like Mega Diancie and Tail Glow Syclant, meaning Magnezone can form dangerous offensive cores. This is further complemented by Magnezone's high Special Attack and two great STAB moves that give it good neutral coverage. Defensively, Electric / Steel typing also is wonderful for a pivot due to the many resistances it possesses, which let it get many safe switches against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Steel-types like Skarmory and Naviathan. Unfortunately, Magnezone is outshined by most Electric-types, which have more speed, coverage, and utility for teams. Magneton's higher Speed allows it to trap Cawmodore with a Choice Scarf; Zapdos and Cyclohm can serve as much better defensive pivots, with the former having Defog and the latter providing much more important resistances; and Mega Manectric has higher Speed even if Magnezone runs Choice Scarf, as well as access to more powerful Fire-type moves, allowing it to hit much harder. Krilowatt also gives Magnezone competition with its access to more powerful coverage moves and it not being forced to run a Choice item.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground is an alternative for the single purpose of trapping Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta and hitting them super effectively, while Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T; however, neither does much outside of that while also forfeiting important targets that you won't be able to KO without Hidden Power Fire. Leftovers can also be used in conjunction with Substitute, which allows Magnezone to set up Substitute on trapped Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Skarmory in order to not get revenge killed as easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Moves and Pokemon</strong>: Magnezone is especially vulnerable to these due to its 4x weakness to Ground. It must be wary of any Ground-type move like Earth Power or Earthquake from Pokemon such as Strategem and Colossoil. Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T can also switch into Magnezone pretty safely, especially if it has already locked itself into Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Fire-types like Mega Charizard X, Mollux, and Heatran resist half of Magnezone's moves and can threaten it with a Fire-type move or, in the case of Mega Charizard X, use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-types scare Magnezone if they outspeed it, as pretty much any of their STAB moves will knock out Magnezone. Examples are Pokemon like Mega Gallade, Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. These Pokemon generally do not appreciate switching into Magnezone's moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Chansey, Colossoil, and Pyroak can freely come in on most of Magnezone's attacks. They can then do whatever they would like, such as set up entry hazards, attack, or use Wish.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types resist Magnezone's STAB types and tend to carry a coverage move to hit Steel-types, such as Mega Manectric carrying Flamethrower or Overheat, Thundurus with Focus Blast, and Krilowatt with Earth Power. Raikou can outdamage Magnezone or set up Calm Mind on it, and Cychlohm can wall it with Slack Off and Fire-type coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Magnezone's primary STAB move, being able to catch momentum for your team while dealing large amounts of damage. Hidden Power Fire is Magnezone's best bet for KOing Steel-types that have a dual weakness to Fire or resist Electric like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor. Flash Cannon is Magnezone's next go-to option for damage, as it is boosted by STAB and can help deal with Fairy- and Ice-types such as Clefable and Kyurem-B more easily; it can even achieve a 2HKO on Gliscor and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage. Thunderbolt is a more powerful STAB attack than Volt Switch and doesn't force Magnezone to switch out while also securely 2HKOing Klefki and OHKOing +1 Mega Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment into Special Sttack and Speed with Choice Specs makes Magnezone have an easier time eliminating bulkier Steel-types; for example, it is able to 2HKO Klefki and OHKO bulky Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Magnet Pull is the best option for being able to trap Steel-types for your team members.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magnezone's main purpose is to remove Steel-types, and it can switch in to do so after a teammate has fallen or by switching in on a Steel-type that doesn't threaten it like Skarmory. Magnezone can also be used to threaten Fairy-types that haven't boosted their Speed like Clefable and specially offensive Mega Altaria; it should try to come in on an expected Fairy-type move. Thunderbolt should be used to threaten Water-types like Arghonaut and Starmie early-game while you wait for a chance to trap and KO Steel-types. Thunderbolt or Volt Switch can be used to pick off Scizor if it is weakened enough to the point where you don't have to forfeit power or momentum with Hidden Power Fire. U-turn, Volt Switch, and Shed Shell are all ways Pokemon can escape Magnet Pull, and Magnezone should be alert for these forms of escape. Some examples of Pokemon that run those options are Skarmory, Jirachi, and Scizor. Magnezone is used to switch into Pokemon it can threaten out and gain momentum with Volt Switch throughout the game, which will also help set up a sweeper for a late-game sweep by softening up the other team. You need to keep Magnezone healthy enough to trap and remove its intended target, so don't switch it in too many times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone works well on teams and cores that like having Steel-types removed in order to make sweeping or freeing up coverage easier. Some examples are Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Manaphy, and Weavile. As Magnezone's main goal is to KO Steel-types, Fairies are able to roam free more easily with its support; Choice Specs Sylveon, Mega Diancie, Calm Mind Clefable, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria are good options. Magnezone dislikes Ground-types and Ground-type coverage in general, so Water-types like Manaphy, Azumarill, and Arghonaut can help to deal with this. Furthermore, these Water-types can absorb Fire-type attacks, and Arghonaut also counters Colossoil, which gives Magnezone trouble. Flying-types as well as Ground-immune Pokemon, like Tomohawk and Rotom-W, also help give Magnezone a nice partner to switch into to escape Ground-type attacks. Magnezone also helps deal with Water-types, so teammates that appreciate that like Colossoil and Landorus-T work well. Magnezone fits fairly well on VoltTurn teams with partners like Landorus-T and Syclant (which especially dreads Steel-types), as the constant momentum can help Magnezone get in on Steel-types more easily. This also means entry hazard setters such as Fidgit and Klefki can help to get even more chip damage off as Magnezone and the other VoltTurn Pokemon on the team constantly apply pressure to the opponent's team. Dragon-types also appreciate Magnezone's presence due to them not having to run Ground-type coverage for Steel-types, with Dragonite and Mega Altaria being the most notable examples. Crucibelle likes having Steel-types gone, and it also helps Magnezone by pivoting with U-turn and KOing Fire-types, and getting Magnezone in when it needs to.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is an Electric-type STAB move that helps create momentum in conjunction with Choice Scarf to prevent the opponent from taking advantage of Magnezone's locked move. This is useful so it doesn't provide a free turn for any Electric-resistant Pokemon coming in the next turn. Hidden Power Fire is used so Magnezone can super effectively hit Steel-types that either are not hit very hard by Thunderbolt or have a 4x weakness to Fire, most importantly Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Cawmodore before it sets up Belly Drum. Flash Cannon is a nice secondary STAB move that allows Magnezone to deal with Fairy-types like Mega Gardevoir, Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Mega Altaria better as well as Rock-types such as Crucibelle. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most reliable way of spreading damage, as it doesn't force Magnezone to switch out, but should only be used if Volt Switch or Hidden Power Fire doesn't KO.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment into Special Attack and Speed with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature allows Magnezone to do its job of revenge killing and KOing trapped Pokemon a lot easier and also outspeed other Pokemon that are weak to Magnezone's attacks like Mega Diancie, Crucibelle, Manaphy, and non Choice Scarf Keldeo. Unfortunately, the limitations of Magnezone's Speed don't allow it to outspeed Pokemon like Cawmadore and Stratagem even with the Choice Scarf, which can use super effective moves like Drain Punch and Earth Power against it, respectively. Magnet Pull gives Magnezone the niche it needs to be viable, allowing it to trap Steel-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magnezone's main purpose is to remove Steel-types and specifically faster ones with this set. It can come in after a teammate has fallen or on a Steel-type that doesn't threaten it like Skarmory. Magnezone can also be used to threaten Fairy-types that haven't boosted their Speed; in this case, it should try to come in on an expected Fairy-type move. Volt Switch should be used most of the time rather than Thunderbolt, as being locked into one move can deprive your team of momentum. Note that Magnezone can't keep Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch trapped. Magnezone should also be aware of Shed Shell users like Skarmory, even though the item isn't too common. In order to get Magnezone in on Steel-types, you should attempt to pull double switches when you think your opponent might switch into a Steel-type. For example, you can switch Magnezone in when you have Clefable out to lure in Steel-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone works well on teams that need a way to remove Steel-types for sweepers. As Magnezone's main goal is to KO Steel-types, Fairies like Choice Specs Sylveon, Calm Mind Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria are able to roam free more easily with its support. Magnezone dislikes Ground-types and Ground-type coverage in general, so Water-types like Manaphy, Azumarill, and Arghonaut can help to deal with this; they can absorb Fire-type attacks as well. Ground-immune Pokemon like Tomohawk and Tornadus-T also fit well with Magnezone, giving it a partner that can come in when Magnezone is being threatened by an Earthquake or Earth Power. Crucibelle likes having Steel-types removed and also helps to form a VoltTurn core alongside Magnezone. Magnezone also helps deal with Water-types, so teammates that appreciate that like Colossoil and Landorus-T work well. Dragonite likes having Steel-types removed, as it makes it possible to ditch coverage for Steel-types like Earthquake in exchange for Roost or Iron Head. Weavile can also drop Low Kick with Steel-types covered; Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, which come in on Magnezone safely; and remove Ground-types, making it easier for Magnezone to use Thunderbolt. Magnezone also fits fairly well on VoltTurn teams, as the constant momentum can help Magnezone get in on Steel-types easier. This also means entry hazard setters such as Fidgit and Klefki can help to get even more chip damage off as Magnezone and the other VoltTurners on the team constantly apply pressure to the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran's nine resistances and two immunities give it a solid defensive niche and, combined with its bulk, let it take on popular Fairy- and Fire-type threats, such as Togekiss, Sylveon, and Mollux. Its movepool is nothing to scoff at either, letting Heatran pull off multiple sets, each with a different niche. With a Choice Scarf, Heatran is able to revenge kill many threats, such as Mega Metagross and Mollux. With a more offensive EV spread, Heatran is able to take advantage of moves such as Magma Storm and Solar Beam. However, Heatran's 4x weakness to Ground and weaknesses to Water and Fighting leave it vulnerable to many prominent threats, such as Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Keldeo, as well as being lured. Heatran's lack of recovery moves prevents it from walling threats forever and means it is easy to wear down over the course of a match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs Heatran is a viable option that can run Eruption to absolutely devastate the opposing team. Unfortunately, it is an event move and restricts Heatran to running a Quiet nature, which mainly limits it to Trick Room teams. Heatran can also run Power Herb + Solar Beam to nail Water-types such as Keldeo, Arghonaut, and Azumarill as they switch in for a fair amount of damage; however, it has only one-time use, so careful prediction is required.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Fast Ground-types are some of the best checks and counters to Heatran. Choice Scarf Excadrill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp can all outspeed Heatran and OHKO it with super effective Earthquake or Earth Power, making them the best checks. However, Landorus-T and Garchomp will have to be aware of Hidden Power Ice if they switch in. Assault Vest Colossoil is also a fantastic switch-in to Heatran; even though Heatran can pack Toxic, it can avoid getting crippled by status with Rebound, or it can use the boost in Attack from Guts to hit harder. Many other Pokemon also carry Ground-type coverage, such as Mega Diancie, Stratagem, Kyurem-B, Mollux, and Jirachi, and therefore are considered checks. There is also a tendency for unexpected Pokemon to carry Hidden Power Ground, which can be used against Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey can take anything Heatran throws at it due to its immense special bulk and can deal with Toxic with Natural Cure. Specially defensive Gliscor can also switch in fairly easily and thanks to Poison Heal can switch into a Toxic or avoid a burn from Lava Plume or Fire Blast. However, any other special wall that isn't Steel- or Poison-type won't like taking Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types can switch into almost any move, but they have to be wary of Toxic on specially defensive Heatran. Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Keldeo are all able to switch into Heatran and KO it. Faster Water-types such as Choice Scarf Volkraken can either switch into an appropriate move and KO Heatran or just revenge kill it easily.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Tomohawk can easily take a hit and force Heatran out with their STAB attacks. Tomohawk also has reliable recovery and can stop Toxic with Prankster Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume is a reliable STAB move that can occasionally cripple common switch-ins, such as Azumarill and Mega Venusaur. Toxic lets Heatran wear down opposing walls and put a timer on setup sweepers. Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sashes and provides hefty residual damage on Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Aurumoth, and both Mega Charizard formes. Earth Power hits possible switch-ins to Lava Plume or Toxic, most notably Mollux, Naviathan, and other Heatran. Roar racks up entry hazard damage and stops threats from setting up. Protect gives Heatran a safe turn for extra Leftovers recovery, allows you to scout moves, and works well in conjunction with Toxic. Taunt can stop slower Pokemon like Pyroak and Chansey from healing themselves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs lets Heatran act as a great special wall. Leftovers should be the only item used, as Heatran has no recovery moves outside of Rest. Flash Fire gives Heatran an immunity to Fire-type moves and can occasionally boost the power of its Lava Plume.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heatran can take many special attacks and use the opportunity to phaze, set up Stealth Rock, or spread status. Be cautious when using Protect, as repeated use of the move can prove to be predictable and can give the foe a free switch or chance to set up. While Roar can be used to phaze setup sweepers, switching Heatran into these Pokemon may not always be the best choice; for example, Heatran should avoid Scizor carrying Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Heatran set works well on balanced teams as part of a defensive core. Bulky Grass-types such as Necturna and Mega Venusaur are some of the best partners for Heatran, as they can deal with Ground- and Water-type Pokemon that Heatran struggles against, while it takes the Flying- and Fire-type attacks directed at them. Water-types can also be great partners, especially when also paired with a Ground-type Pokemon. Slowbro and Rotom-W act as more defensive partners, while Mega Gyarados can be used for a more offensive teammate. Tomohawk can also pitch in due to resisting Fighting and being immune to Ground, although it will need help dealing with Water-type moves. Wish passers such as Chansey, Jirachi, and Sylveon can also be incredibly valuable to Heatran as a way to recover lost HP without relying on Leftovers and Protect.</p>"
      },
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm traps opposing walls such as Chansey, Clefable, defensive Cyclohm, Mollux, defensive Tomohawk, and Pyroak and deals residual damage to them. However, its 75% accuracy can be extremely annoying, especially because it only has 8 PP. Additionally, Magic Guard Clefable doesn't take residual damage, while Tomohawk can escape with Baton Pass. Magma Storm can also be used to trap offensive Pokemon, which can give Heatran switch initiative, but the move's PP is best saved for trapping walls. Taunt shuts down trapped walls, with Clefable, Mollux, and Pyroak being able to do little back, while defensive Cyclohm and Chansey can put up a little bit of a fight with Discharge and Seismic Toss, respectively. Defensive Tomohawk can't do much back with Air Slash, but it can hit Heatran hard with Earth Power. Toxic wears down trapped walls, though Mollux is immune to it and Magic Guard Clefable doesn't take damage. The fourth moveslot is a bit customizable. Earth Power hits Mollux, Crucibelle, Plasmanta, and other Heatran for good damage. Flash Cannon lets Heatran 2HKO Magic Guard Clefable without having to waste precious Magma Storm PP. Heatran can also use Stealth Rock, which deals chip damage to opposing walls and other Pokemon for its teammates. Due to its high PP, it's also a nice move to use to burn turns against walls while Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic are in effect.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>224 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Heatran to outspeed offensive Tomohawk. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Heatran to hit as hard as possible. 32 HP EVs increase Heatran's bulk slightly. Leftovers grants Heatran passive recovery, allowing it to shrug off weak attacks more easily. Air Balloon improves Heatran's matchup against Earth Power Pyroak and offensive Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. However, it reduces Heatran's longevity and ability to stallbreak. Flash Fire gives Heatran a useful immunity to Fire-type moves like Pyroak's Lava Plume, Clefable's Flamethrower, Mollux's Lava Plume and Fire Blast, and defensive Cyclohm's Flamethrower and Fire Blast. Heatran's immunity to both burn and poison, two common methods stall Pokemon use to wear down opposing Pokemon, is one of the main draws of this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Heatran into stall threats, ideally on a predicted Fire-type move, Toxic, or resisted move. However, watch out for Clefable's Thunder Wave when switching in. In most instances, Heatran should use Magma Storm, then Taunt, and then Toxic. However, Heatran should use Taunt first against Clefable to avoid getting hit with Thunder Wave, especially because most Clefable that run Thunder Wave also run Magic Guard. Make sure Tomohawk, Mollux, and Pyroak aren't running a Ground-type coverage move and Cyclohm isn't running Hydro Pump, as they would otherwise beat this set. If Heatran traps an offensive Pokemon, it should generally switch to an appropriate check or counter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Heatran's ability to take walls out, and Heatran also has a good offensive presence. In particular, VoltTurn teams appreciate walls taken out, as walls do not mind the constant wearing down from VoltTurn teams; in return, Volt Switch and U-turn users attract walls, which they can switch out of into Heatran. Good users of these moves include Mega Scizor, Tornadus-T, Syclant, Mega Beedrill, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W. Mega Scizor, Syclant, and Mega Beedrill in particular appreciate Heatran's immunity to Fire. Cawmodore appreciates Heatran's ability to remove Haze Tomohawk, defensive Cyclohm, Choice Scarf Mollux, and Unaware Clefable, as well as its immunity to Fire-type moves such as Will-O-Wisp. Sweepers, such as Mega Lopunny, Stratagem, Mega Diancie, Mega Crucibelle, and Mega Manectric, appreciate having opposing walls taken out for them. Entry hazard setters such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Tomohawk make for good teammates, as the chip damage can reduce the number of turns Heatran needs to stall for.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is a reliable STAB move that can be useful for sweeping late-game. Overheat has a higher damage output at the cost of a Special Attack drop that can render Heatran useless. Flash Cannon can be used to hit Fairies, with Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie being two examples. Earth Power provides coverage on Pokemon that resist both of Heatran's STAB moves, such as Mollux and Cyclohm. Stone Edge can also be used to revenge kill Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Hidden Power Ice provides extra coverage against Dragon-types that resist Fire and can also be used to revenge kill Landorus-T and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment lets Heatran hit as hard as possible. With Choice Scarf, maximum Speed investment, and a Timid nature, Heatran can outspeed everything up to Mega Lopunny. Flash Fire gives it a safer switch in against Fire-types as well as a possible extra boost to its Fire-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Heatran can outspeed most of the metagame, careful prediction is still required, as being locked into the wrong move may make you lose momentum and consequently the game. There are many checks to Choice Scarf Heatran, so if it is needed to revenge kill a sweeper, such as Cawmodore, it should be preserved. Heatran should also have its teammates weaken its checks so it can come in and secure a safe KO later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Heatran is more viable on balanced teams due to its ability to clean late-game, but it can be used on hyper offensive teams as well. Bulky Grass- and Water-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Slowbro, and Rotom-W are the best teammates for Choice Scarf Heatran. They can take all Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves directed at Heatran and either stall out their users or directly KO them. Wish passers can be useful to keep Heatran at full health, allowing it to switch in repeatedly without worrying about entry hazard damage. Heatran's ability to soft check Fire-types and pressure Steel-types can be valuable to teammates such as Aurumoth and Syclant. Fairy-types also appreciate the removal of Steel-types, especially Mega Altaria, which then doesn't have to give up a moveslot for Earthquake.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is a consistent STAB move and the weapon of choice for punching holes in the opposition. Magma Storm can also be used for residual damage and to prevent double switches, which is useful for gaining the tactical advantage over your opponent; it can also be used in conjunction with Taunt to stop walls from recovering. Earth Power provides coverage against Rock-type switch-ins as well as Fire-types that resist Fire Blast and Flash Cannon, namely other Heatran and Mollux. Flash Cannon nails Rock-type switch-ins and hits Fairies. Stealth Rock helps get chip damage on foes, opening up more opportunities for sweepers as well as helping wear down Fire- and Flying-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are used to outspeed Taunt users that try to prevent Heatran from setting up Stealth Rock such as Mandibuzz. 252 HP / 176 SpA / 80 Spe can be run alongside Taunt if you want Heatran to tank hits better. Running 80 Speed EVs lets it beat neutral base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Suicune and Intimidate Tomohawk. With 252 Special Attack EVs, Heatran will hit fairly hard with its good STAB and coverage moves. Air Balloon is used on this set to be able to check threats that commonly carry Ground-type coverage, such as Mega Diancie, Stratagem, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock + three attacks Heatran fits nicely into hyper offensive or bulky offensive teams in need of a relatively fast Stealth Rock setter. Heatran can also utilize Taunt to stop support Pokemon. With strong STAB moves and good coverage, it has the ability to hit a fair portion of the metagame super effectively. Flash Fire gives Heatran the ability to switch freely into any Fire-type move and gain a boost to the power of its own Fire-type moves, letting it hit even harder. Another one of Heatran's roles is being an offensive Stealth Rock setter that can pressure Ground-types with a powerful STAB move and immunity to Ground thanks to Air Balloon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the residual damage from Stealth Rock, Pokemon such as Cawmodore, Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross are useful partners to finish off the opposing team. Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, and Gyarados can take Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves for Heatran. Bulky Wish passers will help Heatran survive multiple attacks so that it can continue to set up Stealth Rock if the opposing team has a spinner or Defogger. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Steel-types, such as Mega Crucibelle and Weavile, make for good partners for Heatran. Ice-types such as Syclant are useful for removing Landorus-T and Garchomp, two Pokemon that switch into Heatran easily. In return, Heatran can deal with Steel-types and set up Stealth Rock to help wear down Fire-types.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur, with its great bulk, can act as a great tank or wall in CAP. It is able to counter common Water-types in the metagame like Rotom-W, Krilowatt, Keldeo, Manaphy lacking Psychic, and Azumarill due to its typing. Its Poison typing also allows it to check Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Altaria, to get rid of Toxic Spikes, and hit common switch-ins like Charizard, Tomohawk, Aurumoth, and Talonflame hard with Sludge Bomb. Mega Venusaur's ability Thick Fat removes two of its prominent weaknesses, allowing it to switch into weaker Fire- and Ice-type moves. Mega Venusaur also beats common defensive walls such as Cyclohm, Pyroak, and Clefable, outspeeding and hitting the latter two super effectively with Sludge Bomb. Furthermore, Mega Venusaur's access to Synthesis lets it stay healthy throughout the match. Finally, Mega Venusaur deals with rain teams well because it is able to shrug off rain-boosted attacks like Hydro Pump and Thunder and can heal off damage with Giga Drain.</p> <p>However, Mega Venusaur is weak to the ever-present Flying- and Psychic-types, like Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Aurumoth. While its Speed is decent, it leaves Mega Venusaur outsped by many threats, including said Flying- and Psychic-types. Additionally, Mega Venusaur cannot deal with special walls aside from hitting them with Knock Off. To make things worse, it cannot hold Leftovers for passive recovery, and its Synthesis is weakened in rain and sandstorm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake hits Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta super effectively, which would otherwise wall Mega Venusaur. Sleep Powder can cripple a switch-in, but Mega Venusaur has a hard time finding a moveslot for it because it would rather run its STAB moves, Hidden Power Fire as a coverage move, and Synthesis for reliable recovery. Venusaur can run a Chlorophyll sweeper set with Life Orb and Growth; in this case, Mega Charizard Y and Sunny Day Tomohawk make for great teammates. However, a Chlorophyll sweeper set is not the best because Venusaur's damage output is mediocre, and it has a hard time setting up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Talonflame, Tomohawk, Tornadus-T, and Cawmodore annihilate Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves, although Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Fire can damage them on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types like Aurumoth, Latios, Latias, and Mega Gardevoir also destroy Mega Venusaur with their STAB moves. However, Sludge Bomb can damage these Pokemon on the switch, especially Mega Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Despite Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat, hard-hitting STAB Fire-type attacks, such as sun-boosted Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y, Flare Blitz from Mega Charizard X, and Fire Blast from Volkraken, can knock it down quickly, though these Pokemon should be aware of the possible Sludge Bomb or Sleep Powder when switching in. Heatran and Mollux wall Mega Venusaur unless it runs Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Aside from Knock Off, Chansey and specially defensive Jirachi can take anything that Mega Venusaur throws at it and stall out Synthesis PP with their own recovery as well as Seismic Toss and Iron Head, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Teravolt nullifies Thick Fat, which makes Ice Beam super effective on Mega Venusaur. Kyurem-B can always 2HKO Mega Venusaur with Ice Beam as well as OHKO offensive variants with Stealth Rock up, while Mega Venusaur can only 3HKO it at best with Sludge Bomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis gives Mega Venusaur reliable recovery, one key factor to its effectiveness. Giga Drain hits common Water-types, 2HKOing Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Krilowatt and having a small chance to OHKO Keldeo and Azumarill; Rock-types, OHKOing Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock and OHKOing Stratagem; and Ground-types, having a chance to 2HKO Colossoil. It also provides Mega Venusaur with semi-reliable recovery. Sludge Bomb 2HKOes common switch-ins like Mega Charizard X, Aurumoth, Life Orb Tornadus-T, and Talonflame as well as 2HKOing Mega Charizard Y, Volkraken, and Tomohawk after a bit of prior damage. It also hits prominent walls hard, 2HKOing Pyroak and Cyclohm and having a chance to OHKO Clefable. Hidden Power Fire rounds out Mega Venusaur's coverage, hitting Steel-types super effectively. It has an 81% chance to knock out standard Cawmodore after Belly Drum and Sitrus Berry recovery, achieves the 2HKO on Scizor and Ferrothorn, and nets the 3HKO on Kitsunoh, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Mega Metagross. Knock Off can be used to remove Tornadus-T's Assault Vest and Chansey's Eviolite and damages Psychic-type switch-ins like Aurumoth and Latios, but it leaves Mega Venusaur horribly walled by Cawmodore, Scizor, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Azumarill before it can OHKO Mega Venusaur with a +6 Play Rough. However, only 16 Speed EVs are required to hit this benchmark if you're not using Hidden Power Fire. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize Mega Venusaur's Special Attack stat, letting it pummel its foes with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb. Running 232 HP EVs maximizes Mega Venusaur's recovery from Synthesis while also reducing damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Chlorophyll is used for rare circumstances where sun is up, as it doubles Mega Venusaur's Speed on the turn it Mega Evolves. Even though Chlorophyll won't see much usage, Overgrow is completely useless, as Venusaur will want to Mega Evolve before it is at low health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venusaur should Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as its base forme has lower defenses and doesn't have Thick Fat. Switch into resisted hits or into moves to which Mega Venusaur is immune, such as Spore, Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, and Toxic. Use Giga Drain when Mega Venusaur needs the extra health while maintaining offensive pressure. Use Sludge Bomb if you predict the opponent to switch into a Pokemon that resists Grass, such as Charizard, Tomohawk, or Aurumoth. However, use Hidden Power Fire if it's a Steel-type switch-in, such as Ferrothorn or Scizor. Mega Venusaur does not appreciate residual damage, so it needs to avoid burns. Additionally, it can be worn down easily, especially on the switch, so try to keep its HP up at all times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heal Bell users like Cyclohm, Clefable, and Chansey can remove burns, which otherwise wear down Mega Venusaur and compromise its bulk. Spinners such as Tomohawk and Colossoil and Defoggers such as Scizor, Latios, and Skarmory are helpful to clear entry hazards off the field, which can wear down Mega Venusaur over the course of a match. Mega Venusaur appreciates teammates that resist Flying-type moves like Cyclohm, Krilowatt, Rotom-W, Heatran, and Skarmory as well as teammates that resist or are immune to Psychic-type moves like Heatran, Skarmory, Slowbro, and Colossoil. They appreciate Mega Venusaur's resistances to Fighting-, Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves. Strong physical attackers like Colossoil, Azumarill, and Scizor can take out specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey. Additionally, Scizor can remove Kyurem-B, which can bypass Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat with Teravolt and threaten it with Ice Beam. Pivots like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Colossoil, Scizor, and Rotom-W help Mega Venusaur switch in safely to get a free turn to use Synthesis. Pursuit trappers like Bisharp, Colossoil, and Tyranitar can remove Psychic-types; in return, Mega Venusaur can tank the Fighting-, Ground-, Grass-, Water-, and Fairy-type moves aimed towards them.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis heals 50% of Mega Venusaur's HP, which allows it to heal after taking powerful hits. Giga Drain provides Mega Venusaur with semi-reliable recovery, 2HKOing common Water-types like Rotom-W, Keldeo, Azumarill, Manaphy, and Krilowatt; 2HKOing Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Stratagem; and 3HKOing Colossoil. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's most powerful Poison-type move and, due to the lack of Special Attack investment, is used mostly to check Fairy-types like Clefable and Sylveon and Grass-types like Necturna, Pyroak, and Breloom, as well as 3HKOing Cyclohm. Hidden Power Fire is the preferred option in the last moveslot, as it 3HKOes Leftovers Ferrothorn and 2HKOes Scizor, as well as generally hitting Steel-types hard. Knock Off is another good option, as it removes items from Mega Venusaur's switch-ins, such as Mollux's Choice Scarf, Tornadus-T's Assault Vest, and Talonflame's Sharp Beak; punishes Psychic-types like Aurumoth and Latios; and wears down opposing walls. Leech Seed is also an option to wear down checks such as Heatran and Mollux and provide extra recovery for Mega Venusaur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Azumarill, as it could otherwise 2HKO Mega Venusaur with a +6 Play Rough. Only 16 Speed EVs are required if not using Hidden Power Fire, though. Running 248 HP EVs maximizes Mega Venusaur's HP stat while minimizing Stealth Rock damage. 96 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature let Mega Venusaur tank an Analytic Fire Blast followed by a non-Analytic Fire Blast from Choice Scarf Volkraken and heal off the damage taken. The 144 remaining EVs are invested into Defense to help Mega Venusaur tank physical hits better. Since Overgrow is completely useless, Chlorophyll is the preferred ability, which doubles Mega Venusaur's Speed for one turn in sun.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Mega Venusaur acts as a great wall and pivot; it can switch in, heal off damage, and force switches for its teammates. It can easily switch into Krilowatt, Rotom-W, Azumarill, Keldeo, Manaphy lacking Psychic, and Mega Diancie and fight back with Giga Drain; Mega Venusaur can also switch into Sylveon and hit back with Sludge Bomb. Giga Drain should be used as much as possible, as Mega Venusaur needs the recovery, while Sludge Bomb is mainly used to hit a Grass-, Flying-, Dragon-, or Fairy-type. Hidden Power Fire should be used to hit a Steel-type that's switching in, unless it's Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers like Skarmory, Scizor, Colossoil, and Tomohawk can rid the field of Stealth Rock, which Mega Venusaur does not like; Skarmory in particular appreciates Mega Venusaur's resistance to Electric-type moves and can take on some of Mega Venusaur's weaknesses in return. Heal Bell users such as Cyclohm, Clefable, and Chansey alleviate stray burns, which wear down Mega Venusaur a lot due to its lack of passive recovery. Colossoil and other Dark-types deal with incoming Psychic-types, while Mega Venusaur can check Fighting- and Fairy-types that give them trouble. Ground-types like Colossoil and Garchomp are helpful to eliminate Heatran, one of Mega Venusaur's counters, while Mega Venusaur can absorb Grass- and Water-type moves for them. Flying-types give Mega Venusaur problems, so Cyclohm and other physical walls that resist Flying-type moves are great teammates. Pivots like Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, Colossoil, and Scizor can be used to help Mega Venusaur switch in more easily when it is low on health and needs a chance to use Synthesis safely.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable has many helpful tools to fulfill the roles of a setup sweeper, a wall, and a cleric. Being a Fairy-type is a godsend, as it gives Clefable many helpful resistances to accomplish its jobs. Its movepool is vast, with access to useful coverage moves, such as Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam, an effective boosting move in Calm Mind, and excellent support moves, such as Soft-Boiled, Heal Bell, and Wish. Clefable also can choose between two excellent abilities: Magic Guard and Unaware. These traits also allow Clefable to check or counter some of the most common and threatening Pokemon in the metagame, including Colossoil, Cyclohm, Tomohawk, and Cawmodore.</p> <p>However, Clefable has issues getting past specially bulky foes, such as Chansey and Mollux, without numerous boosts. Also, Unaware variants of Clefable are susceptible to all forms of entry hazards as well as status, which can hamper its longevity. Clefable suffers from four-moveslot syndrome to an extent, which often forces it to choose between having better coverage and being able to better support its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable has access to other coverage options, such as Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. The former can smash bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, but it has poor synergy with Moonblast, allowing Fire- and Steel-types to counter Clefable easily. The latter can still nail the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Gyarados, and Talonflame, but it leaves Clefable vulnerable to dangerous sweepers such as Excadrill and generally has inferior coverage to Flamethrower. Fire Blast offers more power over Flamethrower, but Clefable generally prefers the reliable accuracy and higher PP of Flamethrower. Life Orb can provide extra damage on Magic Guard sets, but Clefable generally prefers Leftovers for the extra recovery. If you want Clefable to tank special hits more effectively, a Calm nature can be used with the EVs in Defense moved to Special Defense, but this can mitigate Clefable's ability to take on Colossoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Should Clefable not be carrying Flamethrower, most Steel-types can easily come in on Clefable's attacks. Their immunity to poison also renders Toxic useless. Heatran is perhaps the best Clefable counter in this regard: it is immune to Flamethrower, resists Moonblast, can phaze boosting Clefable with Roar, and can use Toxic to cripple Unaware variants. Mega Scizor can Roost off damage and threaten Clefable with Technician Bullet Punch, while Skarmory can tank any hit thanks to Sturdy and phaze Clefable out with Whirlwind. Ferrothorn resists Moonblast and can either stall out Clefable's recovery moves with Leech Seed or dent it with a super effective Gyro Ball. Cawmodore can stomach anything other than Flamethrower and can deal heavy damage after a Belly Drum with either Acrobatics or Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>:  Poison-types such as Mollux, Mega Crucibelle, Mega Venusaur, and Plasmanta resist Clefable's STAB moves, are immune to Toxic, and can deal heavy damage to Clefable with their own STAB moves. Mollux is a standout counter in this regard, resisting both Moonblast and Flamethrower while being able to retaliate with a super effective Sludge Wave. Mega Venusaur is another excellent counter, as it can easily tank an unboosted hit, heal off the damage, and either hit Clefable with Sludge Bomb or stall out Unaware variants with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Pyroak, Victini, Talonflame, and Heatran can all switch into Clefable with relative ease and either threaten it out with their STAB moves or wall it. Heatran and Talonflame can both Taunt Clefable and wear it down, and Pyroak can force out Calm Mind sets with Roar. Acid Spray Mollux can also check any Clefable set as it only fears the uncommon Psychic-type coverage move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Clefable's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing it to simultaneously hit harder and take more special hits. Moonblast is a reliable STAB move that hits the likes of Tomohawk, Colossoil, and Cyclohm super effectively; the move also has great neutral coverage on a large portion of the metagame. The 30% chance of dropping the foe's Special Attack can be useful against dangerous attackers such as Mega Gardevoir. Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery, greatly prolonging Clefable's lifespan. Moonlight should be used instead on Unaware sets if instant recovery is desired, as Soft-Boiled and Unaware are an illegal combination. Wish and Protect are usually preferred instead for the extra PP, and the combination provides more opportunities for Leftovers recovery and also allow Clefable to heal its teammates. Flamethrower provides great coverage with Moonblast, as it can OHKO or heavily damage many Steel-types. Thunder Wave is an option that cripples several of Clefable's switch-ins, such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Mollux. Heal Bell is also an option for Unaware sets to clear Clefable and its team of status, as it risks being worn down by Toxic without Magic Guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and a Bold nature maximize Clefable's physical bulk, as Clefable can boost its Special Defense with Calm Mind. Leftovers improves Clefable's longevity, allowing it to avoid 2HKOs from attacks such as Colossoil's Earthquake. Magic Guard prevents all forms of residual damage, preventing Clefable from being worn down by entry hazards and status ailments. If the ability to stop and set up on opposing setup sweepers is desired instead, then Unaware is an option over Magic Guard and Soft-Boiled.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used as a win condition once opposing Pokemon that resist Moonblast and the chosen coverage move are removed. Walls with minimal offensive presence such as Chansey are optimal to switch Clefable into, as Clefable doesn't care about being burned, poisoned, or paralyzed and can easily heal off any damage with Soft-Boiled. From there, Clefable can accumulate boosts and heal itself as needed while launching boosted attacks against the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable appreciates having teammates that can remove opposing Pokemon that could block a sweep. In particular, Excadrill and Colossoil can eliminate many of the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types that resist Clefable's selected coverage moves with their Ground-type STAB attacks. Entry hazard support is also appreciated, allowing Clefable to bring down bulkier targets with fewer boosts. Moreover, sweepers such as Cawmodore and Aurumoth appreciate having their checks worn down, allowing them to switch in and attempt to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is a reliable STAB move to hit Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Colossoil hard. Wish allows Clefable to heal itself and its teammates. Protect ensures that Clefable will be able to heal itself with Wish reliably and also allows it to gain another turn of Leftovers recovery and scout the foe's moves. Soft-Boiled can be used instead of Wish and Protect for instant recovery, which frees up a moveslot, allowing Clefable to run an additional supporting or attacking move. However, keep in mind that Soft-Boiled is not compatible with Unaware. Thanks to Clefable's useful defensive abilities and the large number of Pokemon it can check, Clefable acts as an effective Stealth Rock setter. Heal Bell clears Clefable and its teammates of status. Flamethrower may be used to deal with Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Cawmodore. Finally, Thunder Wave is an option for crippling threats that Clefable can't OHKO outright, such as Aurumoth and Mega Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unaware allows Clefable to check opposing setup sweepers, while Magic Guard prevents residual damage from the likes of poison and entry hazards, giving Clefable more opportunities to support its team throughout a match. Maximum EVs in HP and Defense and a Bold nature maximize Clefable's physical bulk. Leftovers provides Clefable with passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable's defensive abilities allow it to play differently than similar Fairy-types such as Sylveon. Unaware Clefable is best switched in against setup sweepers that lack super effective moves or are threatened by Clefable's Fairy-type STAB moves, such as Mega Gallade and Mega Sableye, while Magic Guard Clefable can freely switch into walls with low offensive presence, such as Chansey. From there, Clefable can use the free turn generated by the opponent's switch to heal itself with Soft-Boiled or Wish followed by Protect, lay down Stealth Rock, use Wish to prepare to pass it onto an injured teammate, or cure a teammate's status with Heal Bell. However, when attempting to use Stealth Rock, one should take care to ensure that the move is not potentially reflected by the ability of an incoming foe, such as Magic Bounce from Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye or Rebound from Colossoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most setup sweepers hate being afflicted by status, so they are natural partners for Clefable. In particular, Belly Drum users such as Cawmodore and Azumarill appreciate burn removal and Wish support to allow more opportunities to switch in and set up, increasing their ability to sweep the opponent's team. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Aurumoth and Charizard, also particularly like Wish support to negate damage from switching in, allowing them to focus on laying waste to the opposing team. Clefable appreciates teammates that can defeat Fire-types such as Talonflame; Taunt Talonflame in particular can prove to be a problem. Electric-types such as Cyclohm, Zapdos, and Rotom-W pair well with Clefable in this regard. Strategem, Aurumoth, and other sweepers looking for a bit of extra damage also appreciate Clefable's Stealth Rock support. Colossoil can also support Clefable by removing the Steel- and Poison-types that threaten it.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro is a huge defensive threat in the CAP Metagame. Mega Slowbro acts as a fantastic physical wall thanks to its huge 95 / 180 physical bulk. Slowbro can also be used as a bulky pivot before Mega Evolving thanks to its access to Regenerator. Mega Slowbro also has a good ability in Shell Armor, which prevents the foe from taking it down because of a lucky critical hit. Slowbro's base 130 Special Attack when Mega-Evolved and 100 in its base forme allow it to also net KOs against a great number of offensive Pokemon. Slowbro's typing is also great, as Water / Psychic gives it super effective STAB coverage on common Pokemon in the metagame such as Tomohawk, Talonflame, and Colossoil, as well as a plethora of resistances, particularly to common attacking types such as Fire and Fighting.</p> <p>However, Slowbro's pitiful base 30 Speed means that it will go last against most of the metagame. Slowbro is also very vulnerable to users of the move Taunt, as they can completely shut down most Slowbro sets. Due to its reliance on Slack Off and its lack of status-healing moves outside of Rest, Slowbro is also very vulnerable to status ailments, especially Toxic poison. Its 90 / 80 special bulk is, while not bad per se, can be pretty disappointing. Finally, while Slowbro's typing does grant it a good set of resistances, it also gives it some nasty weaknesses to Electric, Dark, and Bug, which are pretty common types in the CAP metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A RestTalk set with Calm Mind and Scald can be used in order to help patch up Slowbro's weakness to status ailments; however, because there are plenty of clerics available in the CAP Metagame and the set is hard countered by Mollux and Plasmanta, it is generally not worth it. If Slowbro is being used on a Trick Room team, it can function as a backup Trick Room setter in case Fidgit happens to fall in battle. Slowbro can also work as an Assault Vest user, patching up its lower Special Defense and allowing it to perform as a nice pivot by taking advantage of Regenerator. Mega Slowbro can also use a set that utilizes three attacks and Slack Off, giving it more options for coverage; however, Calm Mind is usually preferred thanks to the Special Defense boost it grants. Ice Beam can also be used to discourage Zapdos and Cyclohm from switching in on Slowbro; however, it usually is not worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is a huge threat to Slowbro because of Magic Guard and Unaware, which allow it to wall Slowbro by negating damage from Scald burns or turning it into setup fodder by completely ignoring the boosts that Slowbro has obtained from using Calm Mind, respectively. However, Magic Guard Clefable has a harder time beating Mega Slowbro thanks to Shell Armor.</p> <p><strong>Cyclohm</strong>: Cyclohm gets a special mention as a hard check to Slowbro thanks to its ability to hit it for super effective damage, immunity to Scald burns if it running Shield Dust, resistance to most of Slowbro's attacks, and ability to heal off Scald burns and Toxic poison if it is carrying Heal Bell, although sets without Heal Bell are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Unless Slowbro has already snagged a couple of Calm Mind boosts, strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Sylveon and Stratagem can easily take care of Slowbro; however, the latter doesn't like to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers</strong>: Special setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Aurumoth and Tail Glow Syclant can be problematic for Slowbro, as they can boost enough to negate some of the Calm Mind boosts from the more offensive sets and deal massive amounts of damage to Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Special Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Very specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey can switch into most, if not all, of Slowbro's moves and stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Necturna as they are able to either deal large amounts of damage to Slowbro or cripple it with status conditions and Leech Seed, although most Grass-types, including Ferrothorn and Necturna, don't want to take a Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric types such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Plasmanta are able to put large amounts of offensive pressure onto Slowbro, even as Mega Slowbro, thanks to their super effective STAB attacks, and they don't mind taking a couple of hits from Slowbro either, although Plasmanta does not want to take Psyshock and Zapdos and Rotom-W are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latias, Latios, and Hydreigon are able to apply large amounts of offensive pressure onto Slowbro while also resisting most of its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders</strong>: Unless Slowbro is using Rest, status spreaders such as Necturna and Tomohawk can severely hinder its longevity with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic respectively</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt almost completely shuts down Mega Slowbro, as it neuters its ability to wall certain threats; however, Slowbro can still deal a good amount of damage with Scald and its other attacks.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald functions as Slowbro's main attack thanks to its STAB boost and high chance to burn the foe. Slack Off is Mega Slowbro's only way to recover health. Calm Mind allows Slowbro to function as a setup sweeper, patching up its weaker Special Defense stat as well as boosting its already high Special Attack. Psyshock and Flamethrower are Slowbro's main coverage moves, and each one hits different Pokemon in the CAP metagame. Psyshock allows Slowbro to hit Pokemon such as Mollux, Plasmanta, Mega Venusaur, and Tomohawk for super effective damage and gives it both a secondary STAB move and a way to hit more specially defensive Pokemon. Alternatively, Flamethrower allows Slowbro to check Cawmodore more reliably and take on its common threats such as Syclant, Ferrothorn, Necturna, and unboosted Mega Scizor. If none of these Pokemon are a threat to your team, Iron Defense can be used instead to boost Slowbro's already high Defense to godly levels and allow it to set up on more powerful physical attackers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowbronite is used on this set in order to allow Slowbro to Mega Evolve. Regenerator allows Slowbro to function as a pivot before Mega Evolving by letting it switch in and out without needing to worry about entry hazards as much. 252 HP and 184 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Slowbro to patch up its lower Special Defense in order to avoid an OHKO from Syclant's Bug Buzz and a 2HKO from Technician Stratagem's Ancient Power and Mega Metagross's Grass Knot. The remaining 72 EVs are put into Defense in order to capitalize on Slowbro's high Defense stat, especially as Mega Slowbro. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used in order to allow Slowbro to wall physical attackers even better, allowing it to taking minimal damage from even super effective attacks from physical attackers such as Colossoil and Aurumoth in exchange for not being able to take special attacks as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best suited for more defensive and balanced teams thanks to its ability to both deal great amounts of damage and take physical hits very well. Oftentimes, it is better to wait to Mega Evolve Slowbro until it is needed in order to take on a powerful physical attacker or a super effective physical attack, as base Slowbro has much less physical bulk than Mega Slowbro. It can also find many opportunities to set up for a sweep thanks to its ability to act as a bulky pivot with Regenerator. If Slowbro does not need to take hits from physical attackers, it is recommended to use it as more of a late-game sweeper thanks to its ability to set up rather easily. When using Slowbro, be cautious when dealing with Pokemon that can run both physical and special sets such as Mega Altaria, Charizard, and Aurumoth because Slowbro has trouble dealing with the special sets of these Pokemon. Additionally, try to avoid letting Slowbro get hit by Taunt because it almost completely shuts down this set, and if Slowbro does happen to be hit by Taunt, switch out unless you feel that Slowbro can outlast the turns that Taunt is in effect, which usually won't be the case.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Heal Bell Cyclohm, Clefable, and Chansey make for great partners for Slowbro thanks to their ability to remove the status effects that severely hinder Slowbro's ability to sweep and wall. In return, Slowbro can help deal with the Ground-types that trouble Cyclohm, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Diggersby, and, to a lesser extent, Colossoil, and it can help deal with Steel- and Poison-types that cripple Clefable such as Heatran and Mollux without Thunderbolt, although it needs Psyshock to beat the latter. Chansey makes for an especially good partner thanks to its huge special bulk and its ability to provide Wish support for Slowbro, making a nice stall core. Status absorbers such as Mollux, Heatran, and Plasmanta are also great partners for Slowbro thanks to their ability to soak up Toxic and, in the case of the latter, Thunder Wave, both of which are commonly used against Slowbro. Colossoil gets a special mention thanks to its ability to threaten Latios, Latias, and Cyclohm, as well as soak up both status moves and, if running Rebound, Taunt. In return, Slowbro can deal with Pokemon such as Arghonaut and Azumarill. Slowbro also works well on a Trick Room team thanks to its low Speed and its ability to take on certain threats to Fidgit.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald functions as a reliable STAB move that can inflict burns and cripple physical attackers. Psyshock can be used as a secondary STAB move to hit threats such as Mollux, Plasmanta, and Mega Venusaur. Flamethrower and Fire Blast can both be used to check Cawmodore more reliably and hit Ferrothorn, Scylant, Necturna, and unboosted Mega Scizor for super effective damage. The choice between Flamethrower and Fire Blast comes down to preference. Flamethrower is more accurate , while Fire Blast 2HKOes Ferrothorn and gives Slowbro a chance to OHKO bulky Swords Dance Mega Scizor on the switch. Toxic can be used to cripple more defensively oriented Pokemon such as Pyroak and, to a lesser extent, Tomohawk. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, can be used to severely cripple setup sweepers. Slack Off functions as Slowbro's primary source of recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Slowbro to avoid an OHKO from Syclant's Bug Buzz and a 2HKO from Technician Strategem's Ancient Power and Mega Metagross's Grass Knot as well as allowing Slowbro function as a bulky pivot more effectively. Slowbronite is used in order to Mega Evolve Slowbro. If you plan on using a different Mega Evolution, Leftovers should be used in order to gradually restore Slowbro's health. If using Slowbronite, an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be used instead, which sacrifices some of Mega Slowbro's special bulk in order to increase its already large Defense to sky-high levels. A Calm nature can also be used on this spread, but Bold is generally preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Slowbro set works most effectively when used on a stall team. When you're using Slowbro, even though it can function as a pivot, it is going to be used primarily as a wall, so it is best to treat it that way. If running Slowbronite, it is best to wait to Mega Evolve until it needs to take a powerful attack, particularly a super effective physical one, as move because Slowbro's ability to function as a pivot is drastically reduced as Mega Slowbro due to the loss of Regenerator. When holding Leftovers, it is strongly recommended to avoid switching Slowbro into Pokemon that commonly use Knock Off such as Colossoil and Malaconda because of the large amount of damage Slowbro will take from it, not to mention that it will lose its passive recovery. Also, if using Toxic, be careful when using the move if your opponent has Colossoil, as it can either severely cripple Slowbro if Colossoil has Rebound or can power Colossoil up if it has Guts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tomohawk functions as a great partner for Slowbro, as they can form a great defensive core. Tomohawk can deal with the Bug- and Dark-type Pokemon that haunt Slowbro, while Slowbro can take the Psychic- and Ice-type attacks directed towards Tomohawk in return. Clerics such as Heal Bell Cyclohm and Clefable can patch up Slowbro's weakness to status ailments, while Slowbro can take on some of the Ground-types that Cyclohm fears as well as some of the Steel-types that Clefable fears in return. Status absorbers such as Mollux, Heatran,  and Colossoil are also recommended for to their ability to soak up status moves used against Mega Slowbro, such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. The latter two can also absorb Taunt, although Colossoil needs Rebound to do so.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>With Eviolite, Chansey has incredible special bulk and decent physical bulk, making her a very durable support Pokemon. Her enormous base 250 HP stat allows her to pass large Wishes to her teammates, often healing them back to full health. Access to numerous support options such as Heal Bell, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave means Chansey can support the team in many ways. Chansey's main flaw is that she is incredibly reliant on Eviolite, meaning she lacks the passive recovery of Leftovers and is quite vulnerable to users of Knock Off and Trick. Furthermore, she has no offensive presence outside of Seismic Toss, which can render her setup bait versus dangerous foes. Despite this, Chansey's excellent walling and support capabilities still make her an excellent choice for stall teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Chirpsy": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled gives Chansey reliable recovery, preventing her from being worn down. Toxic gives Chansey a way to wear down opposing Pokemon. Wish allows Chansey to heal herself as well as her teammates, which will often be restored to full health thanks to Chansey's incredible base 250 HP stat. Thunder Wave is another option to slow down the foe and cripple opposing setup sweepers. Heal Bell allows Chansey to rid herself and her teammates of status. Protect guarantees that Chansey can restore her own health with Wish and lets her stall out foes with Toxic if she runs the latter; it can also be handy to scout for moves such as Trick and Knock Off, which could otherwise cripple Chansey. If your team needs a Stealth Rock setter, Chansey can do so effectively thanks to her great bulk, which gives her plenty of chances to set it up. Seismic Toss is the move of choice in the last slot, as it allows Chansey to get chip damage on the foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is mandatory, as it gives Chansey immense special bulk while also shoring up her weaker Defense. Natural Cure is the preferred ability because it allows Chansey to recover from any status effects upon switching out. The EV spread boosts Chansey's Defense and Special Defense, maximizing the effect of Eviolite; in any case, her massive HP stat usually makes it unnecessary to invest in HP. A Bold nature is used to improve her physical bulk. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used to pass larger Wishes while still boosting her physical bulk, but this detracts from her special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chansey is best sent in against special attackers such as Stratagem so she can perform her supporting duties more easily. She lacks the passive recovery of Leftovers and is prone to being worn down by residual damage as a result, so it is important to play safe with Chansey and keep her healthy with Soft-Boiled so she can continue to check threats throughout the game. If using Protect, make sure to scout for potential users of Knock Off and Trick, as these moves heavily cripple Chansey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tomohawk is an amazing partner for Chansey. Chansey hates Knock Off and setup sweepers, both of which Tomohawk can handle with ease thanks to its Fighting typing, Prankster Haze, and reliable recovery; in return, Chansey can handle strong special attackers for Tomohawk. Cyclohm is another Pokemon that pairs well with Chansey, and it also forms an effective stall core alongside Tomohawk with its ability to take on physical attackers, especially Flying-types, which can trouble both Tomohawk and Chansey. Defoggers such as Zapdos and Skarmory tend to pair well with Chansey, as they can remove entry hazards and prevent Chansey from taking residual damage. A Rapid Spin user such as Colossoil is preferred if Chansey is using Stealth Rock on her set.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: Pokemon with Trick such as Mollux and Aurumoth can remove Chansey's Eviolite and cripple her with a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Pokemon that run Knock Off such as Colossoil, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor can all remove Chansey's Eviolite, significantly reducing her bulk.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Tomohawk, Kitsunoh, and Gengar can completely prevent Chansey from doing her job. Kitsunoh and Gengar in particular are immune to Seismic Toss thanks to their Ghost typing, rendering Chansey completely helpless against them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Revenankh can threaten to KO Chansey with their STAB Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Mega Altaria can easily use Chansey as setup bait.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir has an impressive base 155 Attack stat, which it can boost even further with Swords Dance, allowing it to shred past many walls after a boost and act as a fearsome late-game cleaner. Thanks to the switches Mega Pinsir can force and its surprisingly decent bulk, it can find opportunities to set up rather easily. Aerilate gives its Normal-type moves a power boost and makes them Flying-type, giving Mega Pinsir a ridiculously powerful, drawback-free move in Return to take advantage of. It also makes Quick Attack a viable option for picking off faster foes. Flying is a great offensive type in CAP, as it allows Mega Pinsir to break down many cores, including the Tomohawk + Chansey core and the Tomohawk + Cyclohm + Colossoil core. Mega Pinsir can take advantage of Pokemon that cannot do much back to it or passive Pokemon like Colossoil, Chansey, Mega Venusaur, Pyroak, specially defensive Gliscor, and Fidgit to set up a Swords Dance. Its decent coverage options in Earthquake and Close Combat complement its Flying-type STAB moves well, giving it the ability to sweep through plenty of common defensive cores in CAP.</p> <p>However, Mega Pinsir has a rather crippling Stealth Rock weakness, which limits the number of times it can switch in. It is heavily threatened by paralysis, burn, faster Pokemon that can pick it off, and faster priority users, making an outright sweep rather difficult for Mega Pinsir.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Since Mega Pinsir lures in Zapdos, a common counter, Mega Pinsir can run Stone Edge and 2HKO it at +2; however, Mega Pinsir has trouble finding a moveslot for Stone Edge. Feint could be used in place of Quick Attack to pick off heavily weakened Talonflame. The power drop makes it less than ideal, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Thundurus, Krilowatt, Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Cyclohm can serve as answers to Mega Pinsir thanks to their resistance to Flying-type moves and their ability to threaten it with their STAB moves. Thundurus resists or is immune to all of Mega Pinsir's common moves and can outspeed and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Krilowatt can also OHKO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt, but it only Speed ties with Mega Pinsir and risks taking a hefty chunk from Earthquake. Physically defensive Zapdos hard walls Mega Pinsir by courtesy of its typing, heals off the damage with Roost, and threatens it back with an Electric-type STAB move. Rotom-W and Cyclohm can check Mega Pinsir if they're healthy enough, but they take a hefty chunk of damage from +2 Close Combat and +2 Earthquake, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon can phaze Mega Pinsir or, in Hippowdon's case, KO it with Stone Edge. Skarmory's typing lets it wall Mega Pinsir quite easily, but Hippowdon takes considerable damage from +2 Return, so it must be healthy in order to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Stratagem outspeed Mega Pinsir and OHKO it with their Rock-type STAB moves. Mega Diancie can't switch into Earthquake, however, and Stratagem should generally stick to revenge killing Mega Pinsir, as its frailty makes it an unreliable switch-in (even a resisted Return does over 50%). Levitate Stratagem, which boasts an immunity to Earthquake, is a bit more reliable than Technician Stratagem in this sense, but it still fears Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame can't switch in very reliably, but it can safely revenge kill Mega Pinsir thanks to Gale Wings and its higher Speed, allowing it to strike with Brave Bird or Acrobatics before Mega Pinsir can use Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock cuts Pinsir's health by 25% and Mega Pinsir's health by 50%, putting a serious damper on its longevity and limiting its setup opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis hampers Mega Pinsir's Speed, which cripples it for the rest of the match. Burns halve Mega Pinsir's Attack, which will likely prevent a sweep. Additionally, Mega Pinsir doesn't appreciate the residual damage from burn or poison.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Pinsir's damage output even further, allowing it to break past walls or attempt a sweep late-game. With Mega Pinsir's high Attack stat and an Aerilate and STAB boost, Return hits incredibly hard with no drawbacks. Even some Pokemon that resist Flying will have trouble switching in. Quick Attack is used to revenge kill faster foes and hits decently hard with the STAB and Aerilate boost. It can also be used to clean up weakened offensive teams in tandem with Swords Dance. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Return, hitting Electric- and Steel-types that are not immune to Ground-type moves such as Cyclohm, Krilowatt, Magnezone, Kitsunoh, and Heatran super effectively. If running Mold Breaker, Pinsir can lure bulky Rotom-W and 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage with Earthquake. Close Combat provides stronger coverage against Tyranitar and Colossoil while retaining decent coverage against most Electric- and Steel-types. Close Combat notably allows Mega Pinsir to break past weakened Rotom-W. However, running Close Combat over Earthquake makes Mega Pinsir much more susceptible to Cyclohm, which can tank a +2 Close Combat much more easily than a +2 Earthquake and then OHKO -1 Special Defense Mega Pinsir with Discharge. Additionally, Kitsunoh can switch in and burn Mega Pinsir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs allow Mega Pinsir to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature allows Mega Pinsir to make the best use of its base 105 Speed, outspeeding the crowded base 100 Speed tier and Speed tying with opposing Krilowatt. All three of Pinsir's abilities are situational, but each can prove to be beneficial under the right circumstances. Hyper Cutter prevents Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Cawmodore, from switching in and lowering Pinsir's Attack on the turn it Mega Evolves. Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to lure and 2HKO bulky Rotom-W with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. Moxie could be used, as it allows Pinsir to get an Attack boost before Mega Evolving by KOing a foe. However, this means that Pinsir will be forced to stay in its slower base forme for an extra turn, leaving it susceptible to foes it could've otherwise outsped if it had Mega Evolved.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir can be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game, but it's generally most effective as a late-game cleaner once its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. For example, some prior damage on physically defensive Cyclohm ensures that Mega Pinsir can KO it with +2 Earthquake. If Mega Pinsir is brought in while its checks and counters are still healthy, it's quite likely that your opponent will switch to them. You can use this opportunity to double switch to a teammate that will have an advantage over their Zapdos, Skarmory, or Rotom-W. Alternatively, Mega Pinsir can set up Swords Dance as a check or counter switches in and heavily weaken it with a +2 Return or coverage move, allowing a teammate like Talonflame to come in and finish them off. Try not to switch Mega Pinsir directly in too much, especially if Stealth Rock is up, as its longevity isn't that great. Ideally, it should be kept healthy so that it can set up Swords Dance more easily late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other offensive Flying-types, such as Talonflame, Life Orb Tomohawk, and Cawmodore, make for good teammates, as they can wear down each other's similar checks and counters so that one may eventually sweep. Tomohawk and Latias can provide Healing Wish support, giving Mega Pinsir a second shot at setting up and sweeping if it has been heavily weakened. Rapid Spin or Defog support is crucial due to Mega Pinsir's Stealth Rock weakness, as it will have trouble coming in and setting up consistently otherwise. Colossoil is especially notable as a Rapid Spin user, as it can tank attacks from the faster Electric-types that Mega Pinsir fears, such as Mega Manectric and Thundurus. However, Latias, Latios, and Kitsunoh also make for good offensive Defog users. Bulky Ground-types such as tank Garchomp, Hippowdon, and bulky Landorus-T can tank Electric-type moves for Mega Pinsir, check Talonflame, and provide useful Stealth Rock support to help weaken the opposing team. Magnezone or Magneton can be used to trap and remove Skarmory, which Mega Pinsir struggles to get past on its own.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is an incredibly diverse Pokemon that can run a wide range of sets with varying coverage moves that allow it to fit onto multiple team styles with ease. Azumarill's near-exclusive access to Huge Power turns its pitiful base 50 Attack into one of the highest Attack stats in the metagame, especially when used alongside a Choice Band or Belly Drum. This allows Azumarill to function as a potent sweeper or wallbreaker, especially with its great STAB coverage in Water / Fairy, which hits the majority of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, including top-tier threats such as Colossoil, Tomohawk, and Landorus-T. Additionally, Azumarill's access to priority in Aqua Jet and great coverage moves in Knock Off, Superpower, and Bulldoze help it excel in offensive roles ranging from wallbreaker to revenge killer. Azumarill also has a great defensive typing in Water / Fairy, with important resistances to common attacking types such as Fire, Water, and Dark. This typing in combination with Azumarill's above-average 100 / 80 / 80 bulk helps it switch into and check threats. Unfortunately, a horrible base 50 Speed stat leaves Azumarill outsped by the majority of the metagame, including common walls such as Pyroak, Clefable, and Skarmory, which do not invest heavily in Speed. This low Speed and reliance on Aqua Jet cause it to be easily revenge killed by common Electric-, Grass-, and Poison-type Pokemon, notably Mollux and Plasmanta.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can be used to lock walls into status moves or deter Pokemon that may want to set up on Azumarill, but it is situational. Bulldoze can be used on sets other than Assault Vest to OHKO Mollux and Plasmanta on the switch in, but it offers far worse coverage than Knock Off and is a poor move to be locked into. Iron Tail can be used with Choice Band to OHKO even physically defensive Clefable after Stealth Rock damage. Life Orb can be used instead of Choice Band, but the power drop is noticeable and the recoil damage compromises Azumarill's longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur is perhaps the greatest counter to Azumarill, taking any attack from any set and KOing in return with its STAB moves. Furthermore, it can heal off residual damage through Synthesis, Leech Seed, and Giga Drain to ensure it can reliably switch into Azumarill multiple times throughout a match. Mollux and Plasmanta can easily check any Azumarill lacking Bulldoze, although they do have trouble switching into Knock Off from a boosted Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pyroak, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Plasmanta all have the bulk to switch into Azumarill multiple times and can proceed to threaten it with their STAB moves, or even use it as setup fodder in Mega Scizor's case. However, Plasmanta has trouble switching into Bulldoze, and everything else bar Mega Venusaur has trouble taking attacks from a Belly Drum-boosted Azumarill. Ferrothorn has trouble taking Superpower as well, particularly from the Choice Band set. Physically bulky attackers such as Mega Metagross can take a hit from Azumarill and threaten it out with their powerful STAB options.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Serperior, Breloom, Celebi, Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Kyurem-B all outspeed and threaten to heavily damage any Azumarill set with their STAB moves or, in Kyurem-B's case, Fusion Bolt. None of these Pokemon can switch into Azumarill reliably, though, and Thundurus and Mega Manectric take considerable damage from a boosted Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Due to Azumarill's reliance on physical attacks, Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Rotom-W, and Mew, as well as Scald and Lava Plume users such as Keldeo, Volkraken, Naviathan, Heatran, and Slowbro, will severely hamper Azumarill's effectiveness. However, due to the high power of Azumarill's attacks, many Pokemon are only given the chance to burn Azumarill when it switches in. Despite this, Mega Charizard, Rotom-W, and Mew are all able to take any attack from non-Belly Drum Azumarill and outspeed and burn it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Azumarill's strongest STAB move and has great coverage with Waterfall, hitting the majority of the tier for neutral damage. More importantly, it allows Azumarill to break through any bulky Water-type that may try to switch into it, such as Rotom-W and Krilowatt. Waterfall gives Azumarill a more reliable STAB option as well as a way to damage Steel-types such as Jirachi and Scizor, and it also helps break through Pokemon Aqua Jet cannot OHKO, such as Landorus-T and Colossoil. Aqua Jet helps offset Azumarill's poor Speed and, in combination with Huge Power and Choice Band, allows Azumarill to act as a powerful revenge killer, picking off frail Pokemon such as Syclant, Weavile, and Stratagem as well as weakened setup sweepers such as Mega Crucibelle. The last moveslot is dedicated to coverage against either Plasmanta and Mollux or Ferrothorn. Knock Off allows Azumarill to punish Mollux and Plasmanta that try to switch into its attacks, crippling any set through the loss of its item and potentially OHKOing Choice Scarf Mollux after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off also allows Azumarill to remove Leftovers from walls such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Skarmory to help wear them down later in the game. Superpower allows Azumarill to get past Ferrothorn, having a high chance to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage, as well as hit Magnezone and other Steel-types hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band, Huge Power, and an Adamant nature boost Azumarill's damage output to high levels and give it the firepower it needs to blow apart defensive cores. The EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, namely Skarmory, with the leftover EVs pumped into HP after Attack is maxed out. An EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used instead to outspeed up to uninvested base 81 Speed Pokemon, notably Cyclohm and Necturna. Huge Power is the ability of choice, as otherwise Azumarill has no offensive presence whatsoever.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set lends itself to a hit-and-run playstyle, coming in on Pokemon Azumarill can threaten early- and mid-game to help wear down defensive cores and put pressure on the opposing team to wall it. Try to preserve Azumarill for use in the late-game, as Aqua Jet has the firepower to clean weakened teams and is useful to ensure your opponent's setup sweepers can be checked. Likewise, use Azumarill throughout the game to revenge kill various Pokemon, especially setup sweepers such as Aurumoth and Mega Charizard- X. Try to avoid being locked into Waterfall or Aqua Jet if your opponent has Mollux or Plasmanta, as they will quickly steal any momentum Azumarill has built up. Knock Off or even a resisted Play Rough will go a long way in removing both of them due to the lack of recovery on Plasmanta and Choice Scarf Mollux.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azumarill fits best on more offensive teams in need of a powerful wallbreaker and revenge killer. Like most Choice users, entry hazard control is key to prevent Azumarill from being worn down, as it consistently switches in and out. Tomohawk and Colossoil are very capable Rapid Spin users, and Tomohawk can check Grass-types for Azumarill while Colossoil can check Electric- and Poison-types such as Mollux and Plasmanta. Speaking of Mollux and Plasmanta, Pokemon that can force them out or use them as setup bait are ideal to help maintain momentum. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and the previously mentioned Colossoil work well, with the former two setting Stealth Rock on them and Colossoil being able to wear them down with Pursuit. Thundurus, Plasmanta, and Mega Manectric appreciate Azumarill's ability to check Latias and bulky Ground-types such as Colossoil. In return, they can check bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W. Setup sweepers and powerful attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Stratagem appreciate the pressure Azumarill can put on defensive Pokemon, allowing them to sweep late-game after Azumarill weakens the opposing team.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum increases Azumarill's Attack to astronomical levels at the cost of halving its HP, turning Azumarill into a monstrous wallbreaker and sweeper. Aqua Jet helps remedy Azumarill's poor Speed stat and hits for massive amounts of damage, OHKOing Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Manectric. The sheer power of this move alone is usually sufficient to sweep most weakened teams. Play Rough is Azumarill's most powerful STAB move and is able to obliterate any Pokemon that does not resist it after a boost. Knock Off provides Azumarill with near-perfect coverage after a Belly Drum boost, allowing it to blow through almost everything Play Rough and Aqua Jet can't. The move OHKOes Pyroak, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sitrus Berry works well with Belly Drum and helps ease setting it up by providing recovery on the off chance Azumarill is forced to take a hit before it sets up. The item also allows Azumarill to act as a pivot in cases where using Belly Drum is not desirable by allowing it to take more damage. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are required for Azumarill to hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed up to uninvested base 81 Speed Pokemon, particularly Cyclohm and Necturna. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to get an even number so that Sitrus Berry is activated after using Belly Drum. Huge Power is the only viable ability on Azumarill, as it would be incredibly weak otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To get the most out of Azumarill, use Belly Drum late-game after Azumarill's potential checks and counters, notably Mollux and Plasmanta, have been removed. This way, Azumarill will be able to sweep unhindered, especially if the opposing team has been weakened prior. It's best to preserve Azumarill until it's able to use Belly Drum. Bring Azumarill in after one of your Pokemon is knocked out or on a safe switch through U-turn or Volt Switch. Defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Garchomp are great targets for Azumarill to set up on, as are Pokemon that are threatened out by Azumarill or otherwise can't damage it effectively, such as Keldeo and Syclant. Even if getting a Belly Drum off is not possible, Azumarill can take advantage of its good bulk and resistances to check Dragon- and Fighting-types, and Sitrus Berry will be able to extend Azumarill's longevity when doing this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can check Mollux and Plasmanta are necessary when using Azumarill. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Colossoil can check both of them reliably, as well as threaten the Steel-types that can trouble Azumarill. Colossoil in particular can use its good bulk and access to Pursuit to remove Plasmanta and Mollux, and it can also help keep entry hazards off Azumarill's side of the field. Entry hazard control is very important when using Azumarill, as Stealth Rock allows Azumarill to drop the majority of its defensive checks into KO range after a Belly Drum boost. Tomohawk, Heatran, and the above mentioned Garchomp and Landorus-T can all set Stealth Rock reliably and can cover some of Azumarill's weaknesses. A teammate that can lure in Pokemon that Azumarill can set up on is greatly appreciated. Special attackers such as Stratagem can lure in specially defensive walls like Chansey, and then Azumarill can come in, often forcing a switch, and use Belly Drum. Other wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Stratagem, and Aurumoth work well with Azumarill, as they can overwhelm the opponent's defensive cores or weaken the opposing team to allow Azumarill to sweep. Pokemon that can check bulky Water-types can help alleviate the pressure on Belly Drum for Azumarill. Serperior can easily break through most Water-types, and Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Plasmanta can check Talonflame. Fidgit in particular is a wonderful teammate for Azumarill, as it is the most effective Trick Room setter in the metagame. Azumarill makes for a powerful wincon when under Trick Room and is nearly impossible to stop if boosted, as otherwise sufficient checks such as Mollux and Plasmanta are OHKOed before they can attack and would-be revenge killers like Talonflame are demolished with Aqua Jet.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Azumarill's most powerful STAB move and lets it break past Tomohawk, Keldeo, Cyclohm, and other Fighting- and Dragon-types such as Mega Altaria. Waterfall gives Azumarill a powerful Water-type STAB move to better threaten Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Colossoil. Waterfall forms good coverage with Play Rough in general, as it hits Poison- and Steel-types neutrally. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a way to better check faster Pokemon such as Stratagem and Syclant and can be used to revenge kill or get chip damage on weakened sweepers such as Aurumoth. Knock Off is the preferred option for the last moveslot, allowing Azumarill to better threaten Slowbro and Jirachi while having the added utility of removing items from its switch-ins. Bulldoze can be used over Knock Off to allow Azumarill to beat Mollux and Plasmanta one-on-one, as Assault Vest allows it to tank any one attack from either Pokemon to then OHKO them with Bulldoze. Superpower can be used to ensure a strong hit on Ferrothorn but may be unable to 2HKO it if used consecutively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs give Azumarill enough health to avoid a 4HKO from Seismic Toss. An Adamant nature, 252 Attack EVs, and Huge Power are chosen to give Azumarill as much power behind its attacks as possible. The leftover 16 EVs are put into Special Defense to better complement Assault Vest, which turns Azumarill into a bulky tank and solid check to threats such as Keldeo and Syclant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Azumarill's boosted special bulk by switching into special attackers Azumarill can directly threaten, such as Latios, Latias, Syclant, Keldeo, and Volkraken. Take care not to switch into Scald from Pokemon such as Keldeo and Volkraken, as on the off chance the move burns Azumarill, it will be severely crippled. Azumarill should be used as an offensive tank, switching into Pokemon it threatens such as Mega Charizard X and forcing them out. Despite the lack of a boosting item, Azumarill is still able to do considerable damage, so be sure to take advantage of STAB Aqua Jet to revenge kill weakened Pokemon. Knock Off is an all-around useful move to spam and a great option to help wear down some of Azumarill's common switch-ins.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types such as Colossoil and Garchomp can help check the Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon Azumarill fears, most notably Plasmanta and Mollux, while Azumarill checks Syclant, Keldeo, and other Ice- and Water-types for them. Colossoil can also remove entry hazards for Azumarill with Rapid Spin, while Garchomp can help rack up residual damage with Stealth Rock and Rough Skin. Similarly, Flying-types such as Tomohawk and Talonflame can check Grass-types that may switch into Azumarill, especially Mega Venusaur, while Azumarill handles Ice-types well in return. Pokemon that threaten Steel-types that may try to wall Azumarill, such as Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Keldeo, work well as teammates.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor is a powerful and versatile Pokemon, and has an excellent Mega Evolution that increases its power further. Access to a wide movepool that includes a number of offensive and support options allows Scizor the ability to perform a variety of roles to a high standard, from defensive pivot to late-game sweeper. Technician turns Scizor's STAB priority move, Bullet Punch, into a force to be reckoned with, while STAB U-turn gives Scizor the ability to be a great pivot. With reliable recovery in Roost as well as access to boosting moves such as Swords Dance and support options such as Defog and Baton Pass, Scizor has the capability to excel both offensively and defensively. In addition, Scizor has an excellent base 130 Attack, which allows it to hit very hard, and a great defensive typing in Bug / Steel, giving it eight resistances and one immunity. Scizor's Bullet Punch makes it a useful check to the Fairy-types that are prominent in CAP, while Scizor's Steel typing gives it good team synergy with many CAP Pokemon that are weak to Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p>However, Scizor's poor base 65 Speed, boosted to a still mediocre 75 after Mega Evolution, means that it is outsped by many Pokemon that can wear it down, although this is somewhat mitigated by Scizor's powerful priority. This poor Speed is further compounded by a quadruple weakness to Fire, which means that Scizor can be KOed by most Fire-type attacks, limiting its defensive strength.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scizor has access to Baton Pass, along with a host of boosting moves including Iron Defense, Agility, and Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Tomohawk, Ferrothorn, Cyclohm, and Skarmory can stop Scizor from sweeping and force it out. However, Scizor can deal decent amounts of damage to some of these walls; for example, Tomohawk doesn't appreciate Aerial Ace or Acrobatics, Ferrothorn is checked by Superpower, and Cyclohm is hit fairly hard by Bug Bite. Additionally, Scizor can usually lure these Pokemon and U-turn away, although Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Cyclohm's Static can damage or paralyze Scizor, and many of these Pokemon often carry a Rocky Helmet, which can punish Scizor's U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns, sleep, and paralysis, in order of descending effectiveness, will cripple any Scizor set. Burn and, to a lesser extent, paralysis cripple the Swords Dance set especially by halving its Attack and Speed, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Scizor's 4x weakness to Fire leaves it at the mercy of even the weaker Fire-type attacks, meaning that Pokemon that run Fire-type coverage moves, such as Mega Manectric, Zapdos, and Latios, can inflict massive amounts of damage onto Scizor. Fire-type Pokemon can easily switch in on Scizor and KO it with their Fire-type STAB moves. For example, Heatran can check Scizor sets without Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Keldeo and Arghonaut</strong>: Keldeo and Arghonaut resist both of Scizor's STAB types and can counter any Scizor set without Aerial Ace or Acrobatics. Keldeo's STAB Hydro Pump hits even bulky Mega Scizor variants hard, while Scald has a chance of crippling Scizor with a burn. Thanks to Unaware, Arghonaut ignores any Swords Dance boosts Scizor might have, and physically defensive Arghonaut sets can take any hit, except Flying-type coverage moves, heal the damage off with Recover, and chip Scizor down with their STAB moves or even set up with Bulk Up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Mega Scizor's already impressive Attack, enabling it to sweep weakened teams. Bullet Punch is a priority move boosted by STAB and Technician, while Roost lets Mega Scizor set up on any Pokemon that doesn't 2HKO it, such as Colossoil or Krilowatt. Knock Off is Mega Scizor's best coverage move, having utility in removing items and allowing Mega Scizor to hit Ghost-types such as Kitsunoh and Necturna. Remember that its Base Power is halved if there is no item to Knock Off. On the other hand, Bug Bite is Mega Scizor's strongest and most consistent physical attack and allows it to hit Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Colossoil without switching out. Superpower is also an alternative to hit Steel-types such as Heatran super effectively, but the defense drops it brings hinder Mega Scizor's sweeping ability.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Special Defense EVs let Mega Scizor avoid getting 2HKOed by Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast and set up on Mega Diancie variants lacking Hidden Power Fire. An Impish nature allows Mega Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from maximum Attack Adamant Landorus-T, Colossoil, and +1 Mega Altaria. 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage from Stealth Rock while maximizing Mega Scizor's bulk, and the remaining EVs are put into Attack to give Mega Scizor more power. Light Metal ensures that Scizor takes less damage from weight-based moves such as Crucibelle's Low Kick before Mega Evolution.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scizor's impressive bulk, especially after Mega Evolution, and great defensive typing mean that it can set up on a multitude of Pokemon. However, like most sweepers, it should only set up when its counters are gone or weakened enough to be KOed by a +2 attack. In this regard, watching out for Fire-type coverage is essential, as Mega Scizor will often get OHKOed even by weaker Fire-type attacks such as Hidden Power Fire. Making sure Pokemon which commonly run Hidden Power Fire or any other Fire-type coverage move, as well as Fire-type Pokemon, are gone before you sweep is a necessity. Pokemon that have good Defense or resist Mega Scizor's STAB moves and can tank a Knock Off, such as Cyclohm, Tomohawk, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Heatran, can stop Mega Scizor's sweep. It is important to remove these kinds of Pokemon from the battle in order to allow Mega Scizor to sweep unhindered. Will-O-Wisp and, to a lesser extent, Thunder Wave users can cripple Mega Scizor and prevent it from sweeping. Note that Static users such as Cyclohm and Zapdos and Flame Body users such as Volcarona can also do this by means of their ability.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone traps and KOes the Steel-types that annoy Mega Scizor (with the exception of Heatran). Powerful special attackers such as Mollux and Choice Specs Sylveon can also deal with the physical walls that trouble Mega Scizor, while Mega Scizor can offer an answer to some of their counters in return. Pokemon that resist or can tank Fire-type attacks, such as Cyclohm, Heatran, and Rotom-W, are great partners for Mega Scizor, as they provide a reliable switch-in for Mega Scizor's counters, while Mega Scizor's bulk and good defensive typing often cover their weaknesses in return. Heatran is a particularly good partner, as it absorbs Fire-type attacks and Will-O-Wisp with Flash Fire. Heatran also has Fire-type STAB moves for the Steel-types that resist Mega Scizor's STAB moves, and Earth Power for the Fire-types that destroy Mega Scizor. Magic Bounce users and Rebound Colossoil can bounce back the status moves that threaten to cripple Mega Scizor, while Guts and Magic Guard users can absorb status. Heal Bell users can heal Mega Scizor from burns or paralysis.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Scizor's Attack to incredible levels, allowing it to hit even harder with its fully invested, item-boosted STAB and coverage moves. Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill faster foes such as Mega Altaria, Stratagem, and Syclant, as well as clean up weakened offensive teams after grabbing a Swords Dance boost. Bug Bite is Scizor's strongest wallbreaking tool, as it hits impressively hard with the STAB and Technician boosts. Bug Bite hits physically defensive foes that are neutral to Bug, such as Cyclohm, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon, for massive damage after a Swords Dance boost, and it is great for breaking past bulky foes that are weak to Bug such as Slowbro and Mega Latias. Superpower provides the best overall coverage with Scizor's STAB moves by hitting Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Naviathan super effectively. Alternatively, Knock Off may be used to prevent Kitsunoh from walling the set while also hitting Jirachi harder, and it still provides a decent neutral option against most Steel-types. Aerial Ace demolishes defensive behemoths such as Pyroak, Mega Venusaur, Arghonaut, and the omnipresent Tomohawk, but it leaves Scizor vulnerable to Steel-types. Acrobatics is an alternate option for Life Orb sets to ensure that Scizor still has strong Flying-type coverage in the event that its Life Orb is removed by Knock Off. Acrobatics still achieves many of the same KOs that Aerial Ace gets, but the power drop is notable against physically defensive Tomohawk, as +2 Acrobatics is not a guaranteed OHKO.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb, an Adamant nature, and maximum Attack investment are used so that Scizor hits as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment is preferred on this set so that Scizor can outspeed as many defensive threats as possible, including Rotom-W, Cyclohm, Tomohawk, and Mega Venusaur, as well as Speed tie with opposing Adamant Scizor. Scizorite may be used instead if your team needs a Mega Evolution; the increased bulk and lack of Life Orb recoil ease Mega Scizor's setup, and the higher base Speed allows Mega Scizor to strike bulky Mew with Bug Bite before it can use Will-O-Wisp. It is worth noting that Mega Scizor's damage output is slightly lower than that of Life Orb Scizor. For instance, unboosted Bullet Punch is no longer a guaranteed OHKO on Mega Crucibelle. Technician is the ability of choice for Life Orb sets to boost the power of Bullet Punch, Bug Bite, and Aerial Ace. If opting for Scizorite, Light Metal should be used instead, as Scizor's ability will become Technician upon Mega Evolution anyway, and Light Metal can help base Scizor in a few scenarios, such as switching into Crucibelle's Low Kick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Scizor's offensive capabilities, it's quite diverse in the ways it can be played, as it can function as a revenge killer, wallbreaker, or even late-game cleaner depending on the situation. A lot of the time, Scizor will be functioning as a fearsome revenge killer with its strong Bullet Punch. When Scizor finds itself up against physically frail foes, such as Mega Gardevoir, Syclant, and Stratagem, that it can force out, you can use the opportunity to set up Swords Dance on the predicted switch and apply heavy pressure to the switch-in. By weakening physically defensive switch-ins such as Cyclohm, Pyroak, and Rotom-W, Scizor can support its offensive teammates that appreciate having these threats weakened or removed. Late-game, Scizor has the potential to clean up offensive teams with +2 Bullet Punch if the appropriate checks, namely faster Pokemon that resist Steel, have been sufficiently weakened or removed first. Scizor is perhaps most effective when played aggressively and by setting up Swords Dance on forced switches; just be especially wary of Pokemon like Clefable and Stratagem that commonly run Fire-type coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor's best partners are Pokemon that appreciate having physical walls heavily weakened or removed. Fast offensive Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Cawmodore, and Kitsunoh fall into this category, as they share similar checks with Scizor. Serperior also appreciates Scizor's wallbreaking, as it enjoys having Tomohawk and Pyroak weakened before attempting to clean up with Leaf Storm. Heatran is a good teammate for Scizor, as it provides Stealth Rock support, a switch-in to the Fire-type attacks that force Scizor out, and a decent check to Steel-types, which is especially important for Aerial Ace Scizor. Tank Garchomp also provides Stealth Rock support and a check to Heatran and Talonflame. Opposing bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are annoying for Scizor to deal with, as they can check it and cause Life Orb recoil and Rocky Helmet damage to pile up on it quickly. Having a strong special attacker such as Syclant or Keldeo to check these Pokemon is important. Luring them works nicely as well; this can be accomplished by the likes of Hidden Power Ice Plasmanta and Natural Gift + Ganlon Berry Talonflame, paving the way for a Scizor sweep late-game. Offensive Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Thundurus can serve as offensive checks to opposing Keldeo, which checks Scizor, as well as hit opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp 4x super effectively. If Scizor is running Aerial Ace, it will really struggle to deal with Steel-types, so Magnezone is a helpful partner in this case to trap and remove these threats. Support Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Clefable, Thunder Wave Slowbro, Tailwind Fidgit, and Sticky Web Necturna can help Scizor take on faster foes that resist Bullet Punch thanks to their various methods of speed control.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn might miss out on the Technician boost, but it still gets STAB and gives Scizor's teammates massive momentum. Bullet Punch is a STAB priority move, allowing Scizor to revenge kill and check Fairy-types. Roost gives Scizor a form of reliable recovery, while Defog guarantees that entry hazards are cleared off the field. Alternatively, if the team already has hazard control, Knock Off can be used to annoy opposing Pokemon by disposing of their items.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This Scizor acts as a defensive pivot for the team, absorbing damage, most notably from Colossoil, and U-turning away to gain momentum. Scizor definitely prefers Scizorite for the important stat boosts and Knock Off immunity Mega Scizor gets, but Leftovers is an alternative for passive recovery if you already have a Mega Evolution. Note that Light Metal means Scizor takes less damage from Grass Knot and Low Kick before Mega Evolution, but sets without Scizorite should always use Technician. Maximum Defense investment means that Mega Scizor can easily absorb Colossoil's Knock Off and recover all the HP lost from Earthquake with Roost. However, a specially defensive set with 252 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature can be used if the team requires a specially defensive pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be prudent with Scizor—don't switch it into any special attacks or Fire-type moves—and remember that Scizor is not invincible and can still take a lot of damage from powerful attackers. For example, Colossoil's Earthquake has a 99.3% chance to 3HKO Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock. Make sure Scizor's HP doesn't get too low, because losing a pivot can be disastrous for many teams. On the other hand, Scizor's job is to absorb damage and Knock Offs and pivot with U-turn for the team, so don't be too afraid to send it in to absorb physical attackers, most notably Colossoil. Try to not Defog if the opponent has a Bisharp, because Bisharp gains a +2 Attack boost if it switches into Defog. Avoid burns, which take away from Scizor's bulk and longevity, as well as crippling its already uninvested Attack, but note that Scizor should still use U-turn even when burned for the momentum it gives.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor can be a very reliable entry hazard control Pokemon in VoltTurn cores, performing as a great physical wall, pivot, and check to Fairy-types. Therefore, common Pokemon with access to Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Rotom-W, Colossoil, Talonflame, and Volkraken, are great partners; excluding Colossoil, they also resist Scizor's horrible Fire weakness. Mega Beedrill and Syclant also have access to U-turn and appreciate the physical bulk that Scizor brings. Having said that, Scizor is a great defensive pivot even without VoltTurn shenanigans, so any team that appreciates an answer to powerful physical attackers won't mind Scizor as a teammate, and Scizor is not too hard to accommodate for. Pokemon that resist Fire or have the ability Flash Fire, most notably Heatran, are great partners for Scizor, which needs a teammate that can switch into Fire-type attacks. Assault Vest Colossoil is also an option, as it can take the more common special Fire-type attacks and hit their users back with Earthquake. Colossoil also has the advantage of having access to Guts and Rebound, so it can absorb or bounce back Will-O-Wisp for Scizor and switch into the common Lava Plume from Pokemon such as Mollux and Heatran.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Punch is Scizor's Steel-type STAB move and gets priority. Choice Band Scizor has the strongest U-turn in the CAP metagame, giving Scizor a powerful Bug-type STAB move that hits extremely hard and provides momentum for its teammates. Pursuit deters Pokemon such as Aurumoth and Necturna from switching and can remove them from play, as well as trapping Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Necturna, Slowbro, Latios, and Latias. Acrobatics provides Flying-type coverage, hitting common Fighting- and Grass- types such as Tomohawk, Revenankh, and Pyroak, and is able to secure many of the same KOs Aerial Ace does with the added benefit of more power should Scizor lose its Choice Band. Superpower gives an answer to common Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran and Ferrothorn and is also Scizor's strongest move for Rotom-W and Volkraken. Bug Bite is also an option in the last slot; it doesn't force Scizor out, but it comes at the cost of losing a lot of coverage</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Scizor's impressive base 130 Attack and wide movepool to deal with a whole host of Pokemon. 248 HP EVs give Scizor as much bulk as possible while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Maximum investment in Attack and an Adamant nature mean Scizor hits very hard, and the remaining 8 EVs are thrown into Special Defense, the weaker of Scizor's defenses. Choice Band is by far the best item for this set, as it gives Scizor the strongest power boost and Scizor doesn't usually need to change moves anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scizor's great defensive typing and good bulk mean it can find many opportunities to switch in. However, Choice Band Scizor lacks any recovery and can be worn down easily, especially if entry hazards are on the field, so be sure to conserve Scizor's HP when necessary. Scizor can get easily walled by strong physically defensive walls such as Cyclohm, Tomohawk, and Skarmory, so predicting these switch-ins and U-turning out can let Scizor provide momentum for its teammates. Note that Scizor can get paralyzed by Cyclohm's Static or hit by Rocky Helmet in the process, though. Early- and mid-game, Scizor will mostly only use U-turn to provide momentum, unless it needs to revenge kill with Bullet Punch or predict a switch and attack with its coverage moves. Later on in the match, Scizor can take advantage of its powerful Bullet Punch to clean up weakened teams. Switching in Scizor against Pokemon that are weak to Bug-type moves, such as Malaconda, Colossoil, and Aurumoth without Overheat, is a win-win situation, as Scizor will KO the Pokemon if it stays in and give momentum if it switches out. Be careful to not switch it into Fire-types and Pokemon that commonly have Fire-type coverage, as Scizor is KOed by even weaker Fire-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone can trap and remove Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory for Scizor. Powerful special attackers such as Mollux and Choice Specs Sylveon can deal with the physical walls that wall Scizor. Pokemon with Rapid Spin, such as Colossoil and Tomohawk, or Defog users such as Latias, are ideal partners for Scizor, as they can remove the entry hazards that wear it down. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Rotom-W, Colossoil, Landorus-T, Kitsunoh, and Talonflame, can all form a strong VoltTurn core with Scizor. If this is the case, a late-game cleaner such as Choice Band Talonflame or Mega Sharpedo is useful for sweeping teams that have been weakened by the VoltTurn core. Entry hazard users such as Heatran or Tomohawk are also good teammates, as entry hazards weaken many Scizor checks, such as Talonflame and Mollux, and can rack up damage through Scizor's ability to force switches. Lastly, clerics such as Sylveon, Clefairy, and Chansey can pass Wishes to Scizor to sustain its health and heal off any status ailments that it might pick up.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory's great defensive typing with eight resistances and two immunities, an immense Defense stat, and a fantastic utility movepool allow it to differentiate itself from other walls such as Cyclohm and Pyroak. Skarmory is able to naturally withstand potent attackers such as Mega Pinsir, and thanks to Sturdy, it is often able to stop many setup sweepers that other walls would fall victim to. Whirlwind, Defog, Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Taunt are all great support options that showcase Skarmory's role as a team player, and reliable recovery via Roost is able to keep Skarmory in top form throughout a match.</p> <p>However, while Skarmory has the tools to be a great physically defensive wall, its subpar HP and Special Defense do leave some things to be desired. Common special attackers such as Volkraken, Mollux, Heatran, Cyclohm, and even Stratagem all have the power to force Skarmory out or outright defeat it. Even powerful neutral special attacks from the likes of Keldeo and Gengar can wreak havoc on Skarmory. Magnezone not only threatens Skarmory with its STAB moves, but can also trap and eliminate it from the match altogether. Fast Taunt users, such as Thundurus and Tomohawk, can also stop Skarmory from using its great utility moves, rendering it almost useless. However, Skarmory's Steel typing allows it to get past many Fairy-types, even those that are special attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Custap Berry is useful for an extra turn of action before Skarmory is KOed, and it pairs well with Sturdy; this set is often used best as a lead. Shed Shell can be used to escape Magnezone; however, Rocky Helmet and Leftovers usually offer more utility. Red Card can be used to force out opposing Pokemon and allow Skarmory to set up more entry hazards. Thanks to Sturdy, Skarmory can even use Red Card as a one-time check to send away opposing setup sweepers even after they have accumulated a hefty amount of boosts. However, Red Card's utility is often covered by Whirlwind instead. Toxic can be effective against slower walls, but finding a slot for it often means that Skarmory will be susceptible to Taunt. Drill Peck can be used as an attacking move without recoil, which in turn helps to keep Sturdy intact more often, but the damage output is noticeably less than that of Brave Bird. Skarmory can run Tailwind if its team really needs a Speed boost. However, Skarmory's lack of a pivot move makes Tailwind usually a more attractive option on other Pokemon, such as Tornadus, Tornadus-T, and Fidgit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can trap and KO Skarmory, and there's nothing Skarmory can do to stop it if it gets caught without Shed Shell.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Electric-type moves</strong>: Skarmory can withstand most weaker physical Electric- and Fire-type moves, and the specially defensive set can do likewise for weaker special moves. However, strong STAB moves from threats such as both Mega Charizard formes, Mollux, and Life Orb Krilowatt will do massive damage even with heavy investment in the corresponding defensive stat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Thundurus, Mandibuzz, and Reflect Tomohawk can all outspeed and Taunt Skarmory before it can use a support move.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Keldeo, Gengar, and even Kyurem-B all offer neutral special attacking coverage on Skarmory and can often KO it, especially if Sturdy is already broken.</p> <p><strong>Rebound Colossoil and Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Rebound Colossoil can only bounce a single layer but can potentially spin away others. That said, if the switch is predicted correctly, Skarmory can hit and score some damage on these threats with Brave Bird or Iron Head. Mega Diancie can fairly effectively use Magic Bounce in a pinch versus physically defensive sets. However, specially defensive Skarmory can handle everything from Mega Diancie if at full health.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird deals respectable damage to foes weak to it such as Malaconda, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Pinsir. It also has the benefit of making sure Skarmory isn't forced out if crippled by Taunt. Alternatively, Counter works well with Sturdy and allows Skarmory to deal greater damage to hard-hitting physical attackers such as Colossoil, Cawmodore, and Mega Crucibelle. Roost is Skarmory's source of reliable recovery, and fortunately, it can be used against the faster Ground-types such as Colossoil. The last two moveslots are largely dependent on the needs of Skarmory's team. Spikes is the entry hazard with lower distribution, and Skarmory can use it to great effect to slowly chip away at the foe. Stealth Rock, however, is still a very viable option if Skarmory's team lacks a user of this move in order to weaken opposing Flying-, Fire-, Bug-, or Ice-types. Whirlwind is excellent for phazing setup sweepers such as Cawmodore and Gyarados. Defog can clear opposing entry hazards but runs the risk of making Skarmory have to reset its own. Lastly, Taunt is an option that lets Skarmory stop slower support Pokemon such as Chansey and Sylveon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and Defense EVs and an Impish nature maximize Skarmory's physical bulk. However, if Counter is used over Brave Bird, a Bold nature is preferable, since Counter doesn't deal damage based off of Skarmory's Attack stat and the decreased Attack means Skarmory will take less damage from Foul Play and confusion. Sturdy allows Skarmory to survive any attack from full health and respond with the appropriate move. Sturdy is particularly useful when using Counter or Whirlwind against an opposing Pokemon that has set up. For its item, Skarmory can use Rocky Helmet to discourage opposing physical attacks. Leftovers, however, can help keep Skarmory healthy and allows Sturdy to be intact more often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory's main roles are to set up entry hazards to support its team and to act as a physical check to attackers such as Colossoil, Mega Pinsir, and Gyarados. It can reliably set up entry hazards against either opposing physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Arghonaut or supporters such as Chansey. Skarmory should be kept at full health if planning to use Counter or Whirlwind against a foe that has set up so that Sturdy will remain intact. However, note that Mega Gyarados can negate Sturdy with Mold Breaker and KO Skarmory if it accumulates enough boosts. Due to it being slower than many offensive Ground-types, Skarmory is often able to use Roost without worry of being hit by Earthquake or Earth Power. If running Defog, Skarmory usually has the longevity to set up its own entry hazards after clearing the field, but the use of Defog should be determined on a case-by-case basis if it removes Skarmory's own hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Dragon-types such as Cyclohm and Latias work very well with Skarmory, as they cover its Fire- and Electric-type weaknesses. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Heatran, and Clefable can take the special attacks aimed at Skarmory. Even if running Defog, Skarmory usually appreciates a teammate that can use Rapid Spin or otherwise keep opposing entry hazards off the field; this eases the burden for Skarmory to use Defog and potentially clear the hazards that it set earlier. In general, Skarmory prefers to be used on stall or balanced teams, as it can potentially stop the momentum of teammates if used on offensive builds. However, a few good offensive partners include Mega Charizard X and Mega Altaria, as they can come in against a Fire- or Electric-type move aimed at Skarmory and potentially set up. Skarmory, in turn, can help remove Stealth Rock, which would significantly reduce their potential to set up effectively.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head's main selling point is to deal damage against Fairy-type foes such as Mega Diancie, and it also prevents Skarmory from being shut down by faster Taunt users. Roost allows for instant recovery and gives Skarmory the potential to be used throughout the match. Spikes is generally Skarmory's preferred entry hazard, since Stealth Rock is more common and can be used by a teammate. However, both moves provide entry hazard support and can weaken the opposing team to allow Skarmory's teammates to sweep more easily. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze threats that have set up and rack up entry hazard damage. Taunt can prevent slower foes from using support moves, allowing Skarmory to stop threats such as Ferrothorn and Trick Room Fidgit. Defog has the risk of blowing away Skarmory's own entry hazards, but it can be useful to rid the foe's entry hazards if they prove to be too much for Skarmory's team to handle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature are used to maximize Skarmory's special bulk and allow it to take on powerful Fairies such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie. Sturdy allows Skarmory to take any hit at full health and still be able to get up at least one layer of entry hazards. Leftovers grants Skarmory passive recovery, which can be useful to keep Sturdy intact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set allows Skarmory to serve as a counter or check to the various Fairy-types in the metagame, such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie. Thanks to its invested Special Defense, Skarmory can survive the 2HKO from Mega Gardevoir's or Mega Diancie's Hidden Power Fire. However, Skarmory still should not be expected to tank powerful Electric- or Fire-type moves. Against less offensive threats, Skarmory can reliably set up entry hazards. If running Whirlwind, Skarmory can be used to phaze setup sweepers, but if the opposing Pokemon has already accumulated multiple boosts, it likely needs to have Sturdy intact in order to survive. Due to it being slower than many offensive Ground-types, Skarmory is often able to use Roost without worry of being hit by Earthquake or Earth Power. Even without much Defense investment, Skarmory can still check some prominent physical attackers such as Colossoil, but it will not appreciate switching into multiple powerful hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory is a great choice on stall and balanced teams, since it can reliably set and remove entry hazard moves. Bulky Dragon-types such as Cyclohm and Latias work very well with Skarmory, since they can help take the powerful Electric- or Fire-type attacks that Skarmory struggles to switch into. Physically defensive Cyclohm can provide extra physical insurance for the team as well, which Skarmory appreciates, since it cannot switch into every physical attack with impunity. However, Fairy-types that use Flamethrower or Fire Blast, such as Clefable, can pose a threat to a Cyclohm + Skarmory core. Mega Venusaur can take Electric-type attacks that might be aimed at Skarmory from Krilowatt and Mega Manectric. Together, Mega Venusaur and Skarmory create a solid defensive core, specifically against Fairy-type threats; Skarmory assists Mega Venusaur with its Mega Gardevoir weakness, while Mega Venusaur can ease Skarmory's burden to take heavy hits from Azumarill. Heatran can be a great partner to take special attacks, particularly Fire-type moves, and Chansey can sponge special attacks. Rapid Spin users such as Colossoil can be helpful as well to aid Skarmory in entry hazard removal without the risk of removing Skarmory's own hazards that might have been set earlier in the match. Offensive partners such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Altaria greatly appreciate Skarmory removing Stealth Rock from the field, and they can take Electric- and Fire-type moves aimed at Skarmory; if played correctly, Skarmory can serve as a lure that lets these offensive partners set up.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom has a lot of positive aspects, including its movepool, ability, and typing. For one, it has Spore, the only 100% accurate sleep move in the game, which can cripple anything that isn't a Grass-type. This allows Breloom to put pressure on at least one of its checks or counters, making playing around this Pokemon a pain. Also, many of Breloom's other moves benefit greatly from Technician including Rock Tomb, Bullet Seed, and Mach Punch. It can even put slower threats to sleep and capitalize on the free turns with Swords Dance, sweeping weakened teams with Mach Punch. Along with this, Breloom has just the offensive typing it needs to check common offensive threats Colossoil and Kyurem-B.</p> <p>However, Breloom's horrible defensive typing and stats mean it really struggles against anything faster than it that resists Mach Punch, such as Talonflame, Cawmodore, and Latios, among many, many others. Its typing particularly suffers against Grass-types that can absorb every move coming at them including Necturna and Mega Venusaur. This, on top of its very subpar Speed tier, means that a lot of common Pokemon including Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Latios can outspeed and KO it easily, making Breloom overly reliant on Mach Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poison Heal is a good way to beat defensive teams but falters against offensive teams. Substitute allows Breloom to set up on the forced switch but the Life Orb whittles it down very quickly and works well in tandem with Focus Punch, but the combination of Substitute damage and Life Orb recoil whittles it down very quickly. Breloom can also use an Adamant nature if outspeeding Mamoswine and Mega Altaria isn't important for your team and you appreciate the extra damage on walls such as Clefable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon with a Spore immunity and Bullet Seed resistance such as Mega Venusaur and Necturna can deal big damage to Breloom with their STAB or coverage moves and take only a little bit of damage from Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Almost all Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y can deal with Breloom offensively or defensively, and Breloom's 4x weakness to Flying doesn't help. However, Breloom can OHKO all of these Pokemon with Rock Tomb. Defensive checks including Tomohawk and Skarmory are more tricky to take down, although Spore can cripple these Pokemon to allow a partner to come in on the free switch.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Faster priority moves can 2HKO Breloom if not resisted, such as Weavile's Ice Shard, and some can OHKO it, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Common Poison-types including Gengar and Plasmanta resist Breloom's STAB attacks and can hit back with a super effective Sludge Wave pretty easily.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fast Fire-types such as Talonflame and Volkraken take little damage from Breloom's STAB moves and hit back super effectively. However, they must watch out for Rock Tomb or Spore on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Most Psychic-types resist Mach Punch, and Pokemon like Latios and Latias also resist Bullet Seed. However, they can be put to sleep with Spore and hit for neutral damage with Rock Tomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Technician Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is a great utility move, as it is guaranteed to cripple one Pokemon (besides the uncommon Grass-types). This allows Breloom to get rid of one of its checks or counters for a couple of turns, supporting both the team and itself in a lot of ways, such as providing opportunities for Breloom and its teammates to set up. Mach Punch reaches 90 Base Power after STAB and Technician, meaning Breloom can clean or revenge kill very well thanks to its great Attack. Bullet Seed is great for breaking through Substitutes and complements Mach Punch very well, scoring hits against Gliscor and Azumarill. Rock Tomb can easily take care of offensive Pokemon that can normally switch in to Breloom, including Charizard, Talonflame, and Tornadus-T. Rock Tomb also lowers the foe's Speed and is boosted by Technician, so Breloom can outpace some threats and put them to sleep with Spore. With Stealth Rock support, Rock Tomb can beat some defensive checks such as Pyroak. Swords Dance can be used instead of Rock Tomb to boost Breloom's Attack by two stages, allowing Breloom to sweep much easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts damage output, allowing Breloom to dent Pokemon that it might normally struggle with, including Crucibelle. Life Orb is also necessary to get the OHKO on Stratagem. However, Focus Sash makes Breloom a blanket check against setup sweepers, allowing it to survive at least one hit and put a Pokemon to sleep with Spore. 252 Attack and Speed EVs make Breloom as powerful and fast as possible, letting it KO Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and outspeed Pokemon like defensive Heatran. A Jolly nature is necessary to further outpace maximum Speed Scizor, Adamant Bisharp, and neutral-natured Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Breloom gets worn down very quickly, and with its bad defenses, it needs to preserve all the health it can get. Because of this, try to bring Breloom in on free switches or through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. While Breloom has access to Rock Tomb, Flying-types are deadly and Breloom is best kept well away from them unless you can predict the switch. Try to keep from setting up Swords Dance until late-game when Breloom can clean up with Mach Punch. Breloom can also function well as a revenge killer for a lot of Pokemon, including Stratagem and Cawmodore. Sometimes it's worth using Spore more tactically to incapacitate a threat that otherwise wouldn't switch in on Breloom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Breloom appreciates Pokemon that can deal with its checks and counters. For example, Mega Manectric and Stratagem can take care of Flying-types, Weavile and Colossoil can beat a lot of Psychic-types, and Talonflame and Crucibelle handle Fire types; all of these types are difficult for Breloom to handle. Breloom also appreciates Stealth Rock support from the likes of Crucibelle and Heatran to help pressure Flying-types, which Breloom does not like. Since Breloom is good at eliminating Dark-, Water-, and Ground-types, it can pave the way for a Pokemon such as Victini. Breloom appreciates free switches in, so a Volt Switch or U-turn from a Pokemon like Mega-Manectric or Crucibelle (Mega Manectric Volt Switches, while Crucibelle U-turns) works very well. Setup sweepers like Naviathan, Azumarill, and Mega Charizard X can benefit from Spore and set up on Fire types; Pokemon like Naviathan can do this especially well as they have a good movepool to hit a lot of Pokemon that beat Breloom. Reliable entry hazard removal is a must if Breloom is using Focus Sash, as it fails to fulfill its role if Focus Sash gets broken. Pokemon that can do this well include Steel-types such as Skarmory, Kitsunoh, and Scizor. However, Flying-types such as Tomohawk, Zapdos, and Togekiss can also work well.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Medicham has near-exclusive access to one of the most coveted abilities in the game, Pure Power, which raises its subpar base 100 Attack to the highest in the entire metagame. This bloated Attack stat, in combination with Mega Medicham's wide movepool and powerful STAB moves, makes it a very effective wallbreaker. Furthermore, Mega Medicham's decent base 100 Speed allows it to outspeed almost every relevant defensive Pokemon in the metagame, and its access to priority moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch gives it utility against offensive threats as a revenge killer.</p> <p>Despite these great strengths, Mega Medicham is held back by its frailty, which limits what it can safely switch into and allows it to be revenge killed by faster threats. Mega Medicham's Speed, while useful against defensive threats, can't hold a candle to the fast-paced offensive threats populating the metagame, which causes an overreliance on priority to deal with them. Mega Medicham also has difficulty getting past some common defensive staples such as bulky Psychic-types, and it is forced to compete with other Fighting-types, such as Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny, both of which boast great Speed tiers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Punch allows Medicham to get past bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Suicune. Fire Punch can be used to hit Aurumoth, Kitsunoh, and Doublade, but it provides redundant coverage with High Jump Kick otherwise. A Bulk Up set can be used to boost Medicham's Attack and Defense, which allows it to 2HKO the entire metagame. Drain Punch can be used in conjunction with Bulk Up to take advantage of the Defense boosts and increase Mega Medicham's longevity. Poison Jab is an option to better handle Fairy-types, but most Fairies are 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt or Bullet Punch anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Mew, and Latias can switch into Mega Medicham's STAB moves safely and proceed to wear it down. Offensive variants of Aurumoth can take a hit and proceed to set up or hit Mega Medicham hard, and bulkier Will-O-Wisp sets can act as a hard counter unless Mega Medicham is running Fire Punch. Slowbro and Latias will have to be wary of Thunder Punch and Ice Punch, respectively. Mega Slowbro has enough physical bulk to shrug off Thunder Punch and can either burn Mega Medicham with Scald or set up on it with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Kitsunoh and Necturna can switch into High Jump Kick and force Mega Medicham to lose half its health, and then they can either cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or hit it hard with their Ghost-type STAB moves. In particular, Kitsunoh is immune to or resists every move Mega Medicham commonly runs save for Thunder Punch and can OHKO it with Shadow Strike.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Although they can't switch in reliably, bulkier Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria and Clefable can take a hit from Medicham and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types, notably Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Mega Pinsir, can easily threaten Mega Medicham with their STAB moves. They can't switch into Mega Medicham reliably, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick is one of the most powerful attacks in the metagame, dealing massive damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Zen Headbutt functions as Mega Medicham's secondary STAB move, blowing past other Fighting-types and providing crucial coverage against Ghost-, Flying-, and Poison-types. Fake Out allows Medicham to Mega Evolve safely as well as deal chip damage the first turn after it switches in. It also allows Mega Medicham to revenge kill frailer threats, such as Syclant and Talonflame, and can act as an emergency check to setup sweepers in conjunction with Bullet Punch. Bullet Punch is the preferred option in the last moveslot, as it gives Mega Medicham access to powerful dual priority and helps against offensive threats. Furthermore, it allows Mega Medicham to OHKO Mega Diancie. Alternatively, Ice Punch can be used to get past bulky Ground-types, such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, OHKOing all but the first. Ice Punch also allows Mega Medicham to heavily damage Latias, Latios, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack, making it a fearsome attacker. The given EV spread and an Adamant nature maximize Attack and Speed to help Mega Medicham in its role as a wallbreaker. A Jolly nature can be used to capitalize on Mega Medicham's base 100 Speed and,  at the very least, Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Charizard, Manaphy, Jirachi, and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful when using High Jump Kick if there is a Ghost-type on the opposing team or the foe is a potential Protect user, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, or Chansey. If Mega Medicham outspeeds the opposing Pokemon, it's generally better to use one of its STAB moves over Fake Out, especially if there is a Rough Skin or Iron Barbs user on the opposing team. Use Mega Medicham to soften up walls early- and mid-game, and then clean up weakened Pokemon with Fake Out and Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types, such as Clefable and Sylveon, make for excellent teammates, as they can check Slowbro. In return, Mega Medicham can remove Poison- and Steel-types for them. Clefable in particular can heal Mega Medicham with Wish, set up Stealth Rock, and paralyze foes to aid Mega Medicham's sweep. Volt Switch and U-turn users can help bring Medicham in safely to launch its STAB moves or get chip damage and safely Mega Evolve with Fake Out. Rotom-W, Colossoil, and Scizor work well in this role; Rotom-W handles Talonflame, Colossoil can Pursuit trap bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, and Scizor can remove Fairy- and Psychic-types. Speed control from Sticky Web, Tailwind, and paralysis spreaders allows Mega Medicham to handle faster Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Manectric, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Serperior, all of which Mega Medicham has a chance to OHKO after a single round of Stealth Rock damage. Necturna is the most prominent setter of Sticky Web and can spread burns to help soften up the opposing team. Fidgit is the best setter of Tailwind due to Persistent and can support Mega Medicham with its valuable support moves, such as Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, Wish, Encore, and Rapid Spin. Talonflame can also set up Tailwind and can clean up teams that Mega Medicham has weakened. Both Thundurus and Klefki can spread paralysis with Prankster Thunder Wave. Thundurus also checks Flying-types that may threaten Mega Medicham, and Klefki can check Fairy-types that Mega Medicham attracts. Other paralysis spreaders such as Clefable, Serperior, and Slowbro also make for capable teammates. Pokemon that can punish Talonflame, such as Garchomp and Cyclohm, are greatly appreciated, as it can revenge kill Mega Medicham easily. Pokemon such as Stratagem and Cawmodore can capitalize on Mega Medicham's ability to remove walls such as Chansey and Tomohawk. Lastly, fast attackers such as Talonflame and Syclant can clean up teams that have been weakened by Mega Medicham.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Manectric has a solid niche in the CAP metagame as a strong, speedy user of Volt Switch, making it a good choice for VoltTurn teams. Mega Manectric's great base 135 Speed puts it ahead of some of the metagame's fastest attackers, including Stratagem, giving it great revenge killing potential. It also has access to Fire-type coverage in Overheat and Flamethrower, which sets it apart from other popular Electric-types in CAP and allows it to deal significant damage to Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Necturna, which resist its Electric-type moves. In addition to this, having Fire-type coverage and high Speed means that Mega Manectric is able to reliably revenge kill the highly threatening Cawmodore, which is an especially useful trait. Mega Manectric's ability, Intimidate, is also quite useful, as this allows it to pivot into and check physical attackers more easily. Mega Manectric's main drawback lies in its rather unimpressive longevity; it's prone to being worn down by entry hazards due to the amount of switching in and out it does, and its middling bulk and lack of recovery don't help it in this regard. Mega Manectric is also very one-dimensional; it is only viable in its Mega forme and can't switch up its moveset very much, so it's quite predictable. Furthermore, the prevalence of Colossoil, especially Assault Vest variants, is a major roadblock for Mega Manectric in CAP, as Colossoil blocks its Volt Switch and doesn't take much damage from its other moves, making it quite difficult for Mega Manectric to function properly if Colossoil is still healthy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground OHKOes offensive variants of Plasmanta while retaining super effective coverage on Cyclohm and is Mega Manectric's best way of hurting Heatran and Mollux, but it's usually not worth the loss of Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Grass allows Mega Manectric to significantly damage Water- and Ground-types such as Mega Swampert and Quagsire that would otherwise wall it, but again, it's usually not worth giving up Hidden Power Ice. Charge Beam can boost Mega Manectric's Special Attack, potentially giving it a better shot at cleaning up late-game, but it's a bit too unreliable to be consistently useful, and Mega Manectric struggles to find a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Volt Switch, preventing Mega Manectric from gaining momentum as they switch in, and threaten it back with their STAB moves. Colossoil gets a special mention as one of Mega Manectric's biggest threats due to its prevalence in the metagame. Colossoil can stomach Mega Manectric's coverage easily, especially with Assault Vest, and hit it back with Earthquake or Sucker Punch. Although Mega Manectric can manually switch out, the threat of Pursuit is also quite troublesome, as it deals a significant amount of damage to Mega Manectric, drastically limiting its longevity. Hippowdon also walls Mega Manectric easily, as it isn't 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice and can heal off the damage with Slack Off. Other Ground-types, mainly bulky Landorus-T, specially defensive Gliscor, and Tank Garchomp, can check Mega Manectric, as they can take Hidden Power Ice once, but they can't switch into it safely.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon with good special bulk such as Chansey, Heatran, Mollux, Clefable, and Tyranitar can wall Mega Manectric and check it several times; they just need to be wary of switching into Volt Switch repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types, especially Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B, which are only hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice, can easily check Mega Manectric. Other Dragon-types such as Cyclohm and Mega Altaria can also do this; they just need to be wary of being worn down by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur naturally resists Mega Manectric's Electric-type moves and is neutral to its Fire- and Ice-type coverage thanks to Thick Fat, allowing it to wall Mega Manectric quite easily, heal off the damage done with Synthesis, and threaten it back with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mega Manectric is quite prone to being worn down by entry hazards over time due to the amount of switching it does, which can leave it more susceptible to being revenge killed as the match goes on.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Though Mega Manectric is quite fast, a handful of Pokemon can still outspeed and heavily damage it, such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Alakazam, as well as faster Choice Scarf users, such as Landorus-T and Timid Mollux.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Mega Manectric's most reliable STAB option, and it's ideal for heavily damaging several common Flying- and Water-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Tomohawk, Naviathan, and Manaphy. Volt Switch is also quite strong with STAB, allowing Mega Manectric to gain momentum against its switch-ins as long as they aren't immune to the move. Overheat provides strong coverage against Grass- and Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Necturna, Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Cawmodore. Flamethrower can be used instead for its increased reliability, as it's 100% accurate and doesn't cause a Special Attack drop, but the power drop is noticeable against most of the previously mentioned targets. Hidden Power Ice rounds off the set by providing pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, hitting Dragon- and Ground-types such as Cyclohm, Latias, Latios, Mega Altaria, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Hippowdon super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures that Mega Manectric hits as hard and as fast as possible. A Timid nature is preferred to make the best use out of Mega Manectric's excellent Speed tier. A Modest nature would leave it outsped by positive-natured Syclant, Stratagem, and Weavile, so it's not recommended. Lightning Rod is Manectric's most useful ability prior to Mega Evolving, allowing it to nab a Special Attack boost from a foe's Electric-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With its high Speed and access to Volt Switch, Mega Manectric mainly functions as a scout and a momentum grabber earlier on in the match. As the match goes on, Mega Manectric can be brought in as needed for revenge killing. Be wary of Ground-types that can block Volt Switch and thus prevent Mega Manectric from gaining momentum, and catch them on the switch with Hidden Power Ice. If there are speedy foes, such as Cawmodore, on the opposing team that you suspect Mega Manectric will be required to check later on in the match, try to Mega Evolve Manectric as soon as possible so that it will have the Speed required to check these foes. Even after being significantly weakened, Mega Manectric can remain useful with Intimidate to weaken physically offensive foes and potentially give a teammate a setup opportunity later on in the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types, especially Colossoil, can be quite problematic for Mega Manectric, so it needs teammates to take these foes on. Flying-types such as Tomohawk and Skarmory function quite well in this regard and can provide entry hazard support, as well as entry hazard removal to prevent Mega Manectric from being worn down too quickly. Landorus-T can also check Ground-types quite well and provides Stealth Rock support, and it also has U-turn and Intimidate to support its team even further. Other U-turn users such as Scizor, Tornadus-T, and Kitsunoh can form potent VoltTurn cores with Mega Manectric. Colossoil also makes for a nice partner, as it can control entry hazards with Rebound or Rapid Spin and also has access to U-turn to form a VoltTurn core with Mega Manectric. Other entry hazard removers, such as Tomohawk and Scizor, can pair well with Mega Manectric. Mega Manectric has trouble breaking through bulky special walls, so it pairs well with a strong wallbreaker to pivot into such as Azumarill or Volkraken to help bring them down. Gothitelle is also helpful to trap, cripple, and remove opposing walls; just beware of the compounded Colossoil weakness your team will have.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Metagross is one of the most fearsome threats in the CAP metagame. Its wonderful defensive typing gives it a massive nine resistances, including Fairy, as well as an immunity to Poison. Furthermore, its monstrous base 150 Defense and 110 Special Defense stats give it a major amount of bulk. Its offensive STAB combination is great, with Steel and Psychic working well together and threatening Fairy-types. In addition to this, Mega Metagross has a huge base 145 Attack stat and a good base 110 Speed stat. Its movepool perfectly complements its great power, and Tough Claws boosts the power of many of its moves. Mega Metagross can serve two roles on a team; it can be used as a strong wallbreaker or a speedy late-game sweeper. Either way, it can take down many powerful threats in the CAP metagame, such as Mega Altaria and Clefable, and it also can use its amazing movepool to deal with potential threats, such as Colossoil and Heatran. However, Mega Metagross is greatly hampered by four-moveslot syndrome, as it wants to fit all of its moves to take on all of its checks, but it simply cannot. For example, if Mega Metagross does not run Hammer Arm, Ferrothorn can severely wall it, and if Grass Knot is not there, then Mega Slowbro can also completely wall Mega Metagross.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Hone Claws set is viable, as it boosts Mega Metagross's Attack and reduces the chance of Meteor Mash and Zen Headbutt missing. Hone Claws can also put much more pressure on defensive teams, as the time spent not attacking by the opposing team can be used to boost, and the other team will have a hard time trying to deal with a +2 or +3 Mega Metagross. However, Hone Claws only boosts Attack by one stage, and acquiring multiple boosts will not be easy. In terms of moves, Pursuit is a viable option, as Pursuit can do good damage against Latios and Latias, as well as generally hitting any foe before they switch out. Thunder Punch is an option, hitting any Flying- or Water-types (such as Skarmory), although Ice Punch is a better option to hit some other Flying-types and many other types as well, and bulky Water-types are not too common in the CAP metagame. Substitute can be used for avoiding a painful Sucker Punch from Colossoil and Bisharp. Substitute can be useful on a Hone Claws set, giving Mega Metagross some free turns to boost, but it limits Mega Metagross's coverage to just two moves, and it should not be used on a Rock Polish set, as Mega Metagross only needs to use Rock Polish once.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pyroak</strong>: Pyroak is the ultimate counter to Mega Metagross. It laughs at any attack Mega Metagross could possibly run while 2HKOing it with Lava Plume. In addition to Pyroak's great bulk, it also has Synthesis, allowing it to reliably heal itself instantly.</p> <p><strong>Cyclohm</strong>: It might seem like Earthquake can demolish Cyclohm, but this is not true. Earthquake is only a 3HKO to physically defensive Cyclohm, while Cyclohm can 2HKO Mega Metagross with Fire Blast. Earthquake is a 2HKO on Choice Specs Cyclohm, but Cyclohm can OHKO back with Fire Blast. Cyclohm also has a great recovery move in the form of Slack Off, which also greatly aids its ability to check Mega Metagross. However, Cyclohm relies on the low-accuracy Fire Blast to check Mega Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Metagross can't really do too much to Mega Scizor. Hammer Arm has a 78.9% chance of 3HKOing Bulky Mega Scizor while Earthquake has a 88.9% chance of 4HKOing Bulky Mega Scizor. Mega Scizor can set up with Swords Dance and Roost off the damage, and after two Swords Dance boosts, a Knock Off will OHKO Mega Metagross, not to mention that the next Pokemon after Mega Metagross will have to deal with a boosted Mega Scizor. However, only a Swords Dance set can actually easily take down Mega Metagross; Knock Off is a 3HKO without any boosts even with full Attack investment, and Mega Metagross is initially faster than Mega Scizor. However, Hammer Arm does reduce Mega Metagross's Speed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, Gliscor, and especially Landorus-T can destroy Mega Metagross if it doesn't run Ice Punch, which most Mega Metagross don't have, or in the case of Hippowdon, Grass Knot. Choice Scarf Landorus-T has a 50% chance of OHKOing with Earthquake, while Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Gliscor can all 2HKO with Earthquake. However, Mega Metagross can 2HKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T and most Garchomp variants with Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Fire-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Mollux, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Talonflame can all outspeed and revenge kill Mega Metagross. Choice Scarf Mollux will outspeed and destroy Mega Metagross with a Fire Blast or Eruption. However, Mega Metagross will OHKO with either Zen Headbutt or Earthquake otherwise. Heatran has a very similar case with Mollux, except that Earthquake is needed to take it down. The best move Mega Metagross has to take down Talonflame is Zen Headbutt, which is a 2HKO, while a Choice Band Flare Blitz will OHKO Mega Metagross. However, with Stealth Rock, Zen Headbutt will be an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Status effects, especially paralysis and burns, can badly cripple Mega Metagross. Paralysis inducers, such as Thundurus, Clefable, and Revenankh, can greatly hamper Mega Metagross's ability to handle offensive threats and leave it very vulnerable to being revenge killed. Burn inducers, such Talonflame and Scald users, can severely neuter Mega Metagross's ability to wallbreak.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro and Mega Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro and Mega Slowbro can check Mega Metagross very well if Mega Metagross does not run Grass Knot, which is a rare choice. Meteor Mash is a pitiful 6HKO on physically defensive Slowbro, while Slowbro can either spam Scald or Fire Blast and heal up with Slack Off. Meteor Mash is a puny 7HKO on Mega Slowbro, which can set up with Calm Mind, heal itself with Slack Off, and become a powerful tank. However, Grass Knot does 3HKO Slowbro and 2HKO Mega Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Colossoil</strong>: On the all-out attacker set, if Mega Metagross is not running Hammer Arm, Colossoil will OHKO with Earthquake, while Sucker Punch can do a good deal of damage (64.4% to 76.4%). However, Hammer Arm is common on Mega Metagross, which is an OHKO on Colossoil. In addition to this, Colossoil can only 2HKO Rock Polish Mega Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp is a problem if Mega Metagross lacks Hammer Arm, as Sucker Punch and Knock Off both 2HKO it, while Mega Metagross's Earthquake has a slim 18% chance to OHKO Bisharp.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Mega Metagross's strongest STAB attack, which allows it to get past anything that does not resist it. Zen Headbutt takes down Fighting-, Ghost-, and Poison-types, OHKOing Mollux, and 2HKOing physically defensive Tomohawk and Rotom-W. Bullet Punch revenge kills weakened Pokemon and allows Mega Metagross to be used late-game to clean up. It OHKOes Stratagem after Stealth Rock and also has perfect accuracy. Grass Knot can 2HKO Mega Slowbro and 3HKO Slowbro, which otherwise wall Mega Metagross. It also generally does good damage against heavy Pokemon, which are fairly common in the CAP Metagame. Ice Punch OHKOes most Landorus-T sets and 2HKOes physically defensive variants. Ice Punch also OHKOes all variants of Gliscor with a little prior damage. Hammer Arm is the preferred move in the fourth moveslot, as it deals great damage to Steel-, Dark-, Rock-, and Ice-types. Earthquake deals with some common Pokemon such as Heatran, Plasmanta, Mollux, and opposing Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Metagrossite is required for Metagross to Mega Evolve. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are for Mega Metagross to be a potent and fast attacker. A Jolly nature is recommended for a chance to outspeed or Speed tie any of the common base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Latios, Gengar and Mega Gallade. An Adamant nature, however, can also be used, as Mega Metagross gains a significant amount of power, and can get a guaranteed OHKO on Colossoil with Hammer Arm. Clear Body helps with any Intimidate or Sticky Web drops before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a powerful wallbreaker, preferably early- and mid-game. It can check many common threats due to its bulk and favorable typing, so it can be used as a generally safe safe switch-in to many Pokemon. These qualities also allow it to stay in and punch holes in the opposing team for a while before going down. Avoid careless switches against Pokemon such as Mollux and Colossoil, as they can either OHKO Mega Metagross or put a massive dent in its health before it even starts attacking, which can severely limit its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azumarill is a great team member for Mega Metagross, as it deals with Talonflame and Colossoil, both of which can do massive damage to Mega Metagross. Colossoil takes care of Mollux if Mega Metagross isn't running Earthquake and also if Trick Room is up. Colossoil also appreciates Mega Metagross's ability to take on Fairy-types. Stratagem is a wonderful partner too, as it can eliminate Mollux with Earth Power and also OHKO Pyroak (Mega Metagross's ultimate counter) with Ancient Power or Paleo Wave after Stealth Rock. Stratagem, on the other hand, really appreciates Mega Metagross weakening Pokemon so that it can easily clean up late-game. Keldeo performs well with Mega Metagross, as it eliminates some of Mega Metagross's counters, such as Colossoil and Bisharp, while Mega Metagross protects it from any Fairy-, Flying-, or Grass-types. Stealth Rock users are appreciated, such as Tomohawk, as they further improve Mega Metagross's wallbreaking capabilities, and allow it to get some crucial OHKOs, such as against Stratagem with Bullet Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish is required for Mega Metagross to gain a major amount of Speed, and a +2 boost will ensure it outspeeds the vast majority of Pokemon in the CAP metagame. Meteor Mash is a great move to take out any Rock-, Fairy-, or Ice-type Pokemon, such as Sylveon and Mega Diancie. Meteor Mash also does good damage against neutral targets. Zen Headbutt is used to take out Fighting-types such as Tomohawk and the Poison-types that Mega Metagross walls. The flinch chance can also prove helpful. Hammer Arm is the preferred move in the fourth moveslot, taking out Steel-types and Dark-types such as Colossoil and Ferrothorn, as well as hitting any other Ice- and Rock-types. However, the Speed drop can be counterproductive with Rock Polish, hampering Mega Metagross's late-game sweeping capabilities. Earthquake is another solid option with great coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Kitsunoh, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and opposing Mega Metagross, and it has no negative drawbacks unlike Hammer Arm. However, Earthquake is not boosted by Tough Claws. Ice Punch is also an option, hitting Landorus-T and Dragon-types hard, but it should not be used for hitting Cyclohm due to Cyclohm's massive base 115 Defense and access to Static, as well as the lower Base Power of Ice Punch. In fact, Ice Punch is a 3HKO after Leftovers against physically defensive Cyclohm.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Metagrossite is required for Metagross to Mega Evolve and gain power, Speed, and bulk. 252 Attack EVs are required so that Mega Metagross can have as much power as possible and fulfill its role as a late-game sweeper. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature ensure that Mega Metagross can take advantage of its good Speed tier before a Rock Polish boost. However, a bulkier EV spread of 228 HP / 252 Atk / 28 Spe and an Adamant nature may also be used. 28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Choice Scarf base 110 Speed Pokemon in the CAP metagame such as Latios, Gengar, and Kitsunoh after a Rock Polish boost. The remaining 228 EVs are put into HP so that Mega Metagross can be as bulky as possible. An Adamant nature allows Mega Metagross to OHKO Colossoil with Hammer Arm and generally have much more power. Clear Body is a handy ability to have before Mega Evolving, preventing stat drops from Intimidate and Sticky Web.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a late-game setup sweeper, but it one of its main niches is that it can be also used effectively early-game as a wallbreaker. However, Wish support is often recommended to bring it back to full health and allow it to start its role as a late-game sweeper. Mega Metagross should also be used once most or all of its checks and counters are gone, as once it has gotten a boost, it would kill momentum to switch out and try setting up again, as the opponent would know that you would try to set up. To set up, Metagross should be brought in on a Pokemon that will force the opponent to switch Pokemon so it can Mega Evolve, use Rock Polish, and then proceed to outspeed and hopefully sweep everything.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As with many late-game setup sweepers, Mega Metagross's main checks and counters need to be eliminated for it to effectively clean up. Therefore, Stratagem is a great team member, as it deals with many of Mega Metagross's checks and counters. Earth Power has a 30% chance to OHKO physically defensive Cyclohm after Stealth Rock, and Earth Power will OHKO Choice Specs Cyclohm and Heatran after Stealth Rock. Stratagem will also OHKO Pyroak with Ancient Power or Paleo Wave after Stealth Rock and OHKO Bisharp with Vacuum Wave. Azumarill can be a good team member, as it takes down Talonflame, Colossoil, and Stratagem with Aqua Jet. Electric-types can deal with Talonflame, which can tear through Mega Metagross's health with Flare Blitz. Rotom-W and Cyclohm can also deal with Mega Slowbro, which severely walls Mega Metagross.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's incredible Steel / Psychic typing and its base 100 stats across the board let it fill many roles, from a specially defensive wall to a Choice Scarf pivot. Serene Grace lets Jirachi perform its roles even better, as its offensive moves have twice the chance to inflict their secondary effects, most notably giving Iron Head a 60% chance to make the foe flinch. Jirachi's movepool is arguably its best asset, with incredible coverage and support moves, such as Fire Punch and Healing Wish.</p> <p>While Jirachi's typing lets it wall Fairies extremely well, it leaves it with some glaring weaknesses, particularly to the ever-common Ground-, Fire-, and Dark- types. As such, Colossoil, Heatran, Garchomp, and many other Pokemon force it out with their STAB moves. Although Jirachi's base 100 stats are great for defensive roles, they fail to stand out offensively, forcing Jirachi to rely on super effective coverage, Toxic, and Serene Grace to deal any notable damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi can pull off a Calm Mind set that can sweep late-game, but it requires a lot of support and doesn't take advantage of one of Jirachi's greatest assets, Serene Grace. Doom Desire lets Jirachi force switches even when out of play and put the opponent into a difficult position. However, the move is very unreliable because it requires two turns to hit, letting the opponent switch in a Pokemon that resists the move. Thunder Wave can be used over Body Slam as a more reliable way to spread paralysis, but it leaves Jirachi unable to paralyze Ground-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Colossoil</strong>: Colossoil has Sucker Punch, Knock Off, Earthquake, and Pursuit; all of these moves can destroy Jirachi easily. Colossoil also has Guts to take advantage of Body Slam, Rebound to bounce back Stealth Rock, and Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. U-turn and Ice Punch both give Colossoil some trouble, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can take out Jirachi with their STAB moves, but they must watch out for Icy Wind, Body Slam, and Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, both Mega Charizard formes, Pyroak, and Mollux can eliminate Jirachi easily and tank most attacks that it has to offer. Heatran and Mollux must watch out for Hidden Power Ground, though. Paralysis from Body Slam and Thunder Wave can help neuter these threats as well, especially Mega Charizard X and Y.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Excadrill, and Kitsunoh can all use Jirachi as setup bait or remove it outright. They do not appreciate being paralyzed or hit with a Fire-type move, however. Kitsunoh gets a special mention for being immune to Body Slam thanks to its typing while still avoiding Thunder Wave because of its ability Limber.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water types can wall Jirachi fairly easily and heavily damage it with their STAB moves. Keldeo, Suicune, and Arghonaut can use Jirachi as setup fodder, though they must watch out for certain moves like Toxic and Heart Stamp.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, are capable of dealing heavy damage to and Pursuit trapping Jirachi due to its weakness to Dark. However, Iron Head does quite a bit of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis and Burns</strong>: Being burned or paralyzed is troublesome for Jirachi, as it hates the stat drops and, in the case of being burned, residual damage. Iron Head loses most of its flinching potential if it goes last and does pitifully low amounts of damage if Jirachi is burned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's primary STAB move and has a handy 60% chance to make the foe flinch; this pairs well with Toxic or paralysis. Toxic helps Jirachi wear down walls that it struggles against, including Cyclohm, Pyroak, and Hippowdon. Body Slam helps Jirachi paralyze the faster Pokemon that can threaten it, such as Mega Metagross and both Mega Charizard formes. Wish provides Jirachi with consistent recovery and the ability to heal its teammates. Protect lets Jirachi reliably heal itself and stall for more Toxic damage. Stealth Rock is an option if other team members cannot provide the support; however, Jirachi fears Colossoil's Rebound. U-turn lets Jirachi function as a defensive pivot and should be paired with Stealth Rock in order to force switches while punishing foes with Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers grants Jirachi passive recovery that can be further taken advantage of with Protect. 32 Speed EVs let Jirachi outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Jolly Tyranitar. HP is maximized, and the rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to let Jirachi easily wall special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir, Plasmanta, and Sylveon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Jirachi set works well in bulky balance builds and stall builds, fulfilling the role of a status spreader, pivot, wall, stallbreaker, and cleric all in one. Jirachi should be kept healthy throughout the match with Wish so that it can wall what it needs to without being overwhelmed. Spreading status onto switch-ins such as Cyclohm and Colossoil is valuable in order to weaken them for Jirachi's teammates. Protect is useful for scouting Choice item users, such as Volkraken, though you have to be wary of setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X taking advantage of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tomohawk has incredible defensive synergy with Jirachi, tanking the Dark- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Jirachi with ease, walling Jirachi's biggest threat, Colossoil, and helping against setup sweepers with priority Haze, while Jirachi can tank Ice-, Electric-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type attacks that threaten Tomohawk. Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Diancie appreciate Jirachi's ability to absorb Poison- and Steel-type attacks with ease. They can also switch in on the Dark-type attacks aimed at it. Assault Vest Colossoil is an excellent teammate for patching up Jirachi's weaknesses to Fire-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks. In return, Jirachi's Wish support can keep Colossoil healthy throughout the match. Bulky Water-types, such as Gyarados and Manaphy, appreciate Jirachi's ability to heal them and can use Jirachi's checks as setup bait. Finally, Fire-types such as Pyroak can beat the Steel-types that can handle Jirachi easily.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's most reliable STAB move and has a 60% chance to make the foe flinch. U-turn lets Jirachi pivot away from Pokemon that resist Iron Head, such as Heatran, and escape unfavorable situations. It also deals a hefty chunk of damage to some of the metagame's best answers to Jirachi, such as Colossoil. Fire Punch allows Jirachi to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor for a lot of damage, preventing them from setting up on it. Ice Punch is the alternative option, 2HKOing Garchomp and Landorus-T. Heart Stamp gives Jirachi a way to hit Keldeo, Mollux, Plasmanta, and Tomohawk harder than any of its other moves, though it comes at the cost of the generally superior coverage that Fire Punch and Ice Punch provide. Healing Wish is Jirachi's best way to provide team support, allowing it to heal a teammate at the last moment. Trick is another option for crippling opposing walls, such as Pyroak, Skarmory, and defensive Cyclohm, all of which dislike being locked into a move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf, maximum Speed EVs, and a Timid nature let Jirachi outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and even some boosted threats, such as +1 Mega Altaria and +1 Aurumoth. This is vital for Jirachi to check them effectively. Maximum Attack EVs let Jirachi hit hard with its attacks, especially against frail sweepers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's most spammable option, letting foes flinch to death while dealing a good amount of damage. Iron Head also lets Jirachi defeat Fairies easily and revenge kill Mega Altaria. In fact, because this set is faster than the entire unboosted metagame, Jirachi can make almost any foe flinch if luck is on its side. U-turn lets Jirachi pivot easily; it should often pivot when the opponent has a Pokemon that doesn't care about Iron Head, such as Heatran. The third attack shouldn't be used that often, but if Jirachi needs to handle a Swords Dance Scizor or Garchomp, the move should be used to revenge kill it. Healing Wish should be used when Jirachi has lost its use, needs to support another Pokemon to sweep, or is on its last leg and cannot survive another turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Almost any sweeper loves having Jirachi as a teammate in case an attempt to sweep goes wrong. Cawmodore, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, Garchomp, and Aurumoth are great sweepers that also help remove Jirachi's checks and counters and appreciate Healing Wish support to have a second chance to sweep the opposing team. If Trick is used instead, late-game sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Talonflame will appreciate walls being crippled. Wish support and entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Clefable and Tomohawk are great ways to support Jirachi, as it will be worn down from repeated entry hazard damage due to this set's lack of recovery. Jirachi pairs well with other Pokemon that can handle Fairies so that Jirachi is less pressured to spam Iron Head in unfavorable situations, such as when the opponent has a Ferrothorn or Heatran.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is useful for making foes flinch and defeating Fairies. Icy Wind lets Jirachi deal heavy damage to Ground- and Dragon-types that would otherwise take advantage of it, 2HKOing Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Dragonite. It can also be used to cancel out Speed boosts from an opposing setup sweeper so that one of Jirachi's teammates can KO it. Hidden Power Ground lets Jirachi handle Plasmanta, Mollux, and Heatran, which it would otherwise struggle against. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire lets Jirachi handle Scizor, Cawmodore, and Ferrothorn, which can set up all over Jirachi should it lack the move. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados and 2HKOes Skarmory, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Slowbro. It also 2HKOes Talonflame, but needs Hidden Power Ground to beat it due to Talonflame's priority Roost removing its Flying typing before Jirachi can use Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Healing Wish lets Jirachi fully heal a teammate after it has done its job, while U-turn is an option to let Jirachi pivot out of unfavorable situations while also providing helpful chip damage against Pokemon like Colossoil. Moonblast can be used in the last slot to 2HKO Cyclohm while dealing a decent chunk of damage to other Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Expert Belt takes advantage of Jirachi's vast coverage and lets it feign a Choice item in the right circumstances, especially if you haven't revealed its special moves. 216 Speed EVs let Jirachi outspeed everything up to neutral-natured Kyurem-B, and 132 Attack EVs let Jirachi 2HKO all variants of Clefable with Iron Head. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack for more power. If using Hidden Power Fire, 136 Atk / 152 SpA / 220 Spe should be used in order to compensate for the lost Attack and Speed IVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Jirachi set heavily relies on predictions to score 2HKOs or 3HKOs and as such it is quite risky to use. Use it as a lure for the threats that typically want to come in on Jirachi, such as Garchomp and Heatran. Jirachi lacks defensive investment, so it shouldn't be relied upon to tank hits repeatedly. The last move can dictate Jirachi's secondary role on the team; it can become a dedicated lure with Thunderbolt, a sacrificial cleric with Healing Wish, or a pivot with U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tomohawk helps Jirachi with its checks such as Colossoil, Ferrothorn (if lacking Hidden Power Fire), and Heatran (if lacking Hidden Power Ground) by tanking their attacks, removing entry hazards, and hitting them all super effectively. Tomohawk also attracts Fairies for Jirachi to switch in on. This set can also pave the way for certain sweepers, such as Clefable and Mega Charizard X, by luring in and removing their checks, such as Heatran and Landorus-T. Assault Vest Colossoil helps Jirachi by tanking the special attacks that heavily damage it, as well as absorbing Dark- and Ghost-type attacks easily. Jirachi loves having a teammate like Rotom-W, Gyarados, or another bulky Water-type to easily handle Ground- and Fire-type attacks.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny's high Speed, good Attack stat, and near-flawless coverage between its Fighting- and Normal-type STAB moves allow the punching bunny to act as a powerful offensive Pokemon. Scrappy is the icing on the cake for Mega Lopunny, allowing it to have perfect neutral coverage through its STAB moves alone and easing the pressure Ghost-types such as Gengar, Kitsunoh, and Mega Sableye traditionally put on High Jump Kick users. Mega Lopunny's great Speed allows it to heavily threaten offensive teams by outspeeding and heavily damaging many of the fast, frail Pokemon offensive teams utilize, such as Syclant, Weavile, and even Mega Diancie. Mega Lopunny also has access to a variety of support moves, such as Healing Wish and Encore, that allows it to pressure defensive Pokemon and gives some manner of unpredictability to its sets, and it even has access to a decently powerful STAB Fake Out to help it safely Mega Evolve and to pick up chip damage on frailer Pokemon. Unfortunately, lackluster defenses prior to and after Mega Evolution hamper Mega Lopunny's ability to switch into Pokemon. Mega Lopunny also has trouble breaking through physical walls such as Tomohawk, Cyclohm, and Skarmory, and its dependence on High Jump Kick and its general hit-and-run nature leave it susceptible to being worn down through chip and recoil damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an option to better punish defensive Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Pyroak, and Mega Lopunny can stall out additional turns of Toxic damage through Substitute. Quick Attack can be used in conjunction with Fake Out to allow Mega Lopunny to more effectively deal chip damage to frailer Pokemon and to soften up threatening sweepers for more effective revenge killers such as Talonflame, at the cost of the opportunities to steal momentum the other moves create. Fake Out plus Quick Attack is also able to KO Talonflame after Stealth Rock. Heal Bell can be used in the last moveslot to give an offensive team some way to reset status, but it is limited in effectiveness by Mega Lopunny's frailness. Thunder Wave can be used in conjunction with Mega Lopunny's high Speed to cripple setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Aurumoth, but it is overshadowed in this respect by Thundurus or even Tomohawk, both of which can neuter Pokemon after they've set up. Mega Lopunny is also considerably frail and would have to exercise caution using Thunder Wave. Facade is an option for use in situations where Mega Lopunny is statused, such as from Scald or Static, but it is situational. Substitute plus Endeavor is able to wear down bulky Pokemon that Lopunny would otherwise be unable to touch, allowing teammates to power through them later in the match.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, such as Talonflame, Mega Alakazam, and Choice Scarf users such as Mollux, Volkraken, Keldeo, and Volcanion, can all outspeed and KO or heavily damage Mega Lopunny. They have trouble switching in or taking repeated Fake Outs, though.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Tomohawk, Pyroak, Hippowdon, and Cyclohm can all shrug off Mega Lopunny's attacks and retaliate with their STAB moves or set up utility moves such as Stealth Rock or recovery moves on Mega Lopunny, but they must be wary of Encore and Toxic. Power-Up Punch also allows Mega Lopunny to threaten all of these Pokemon save Tomohawk, which can outdamage Mega Lopunny no matter what or just as easily remove its boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Altaria resist Mega Lopunny's main STAB move and can all take a hit and OHKO with their Fairy STAB move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir, Tornadus-T, and Talonflame all heavily threaten Mega Lopunny with their STAB moves, but they have trouble switching into Mega Lopunny, especially if Stealth Rock is up. Mega Pinsir and Talonflame deserve a mention for being able to threaten Mega Lopunny directly with their powerful priority.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Aurumoth, Latios, Latias, and particularly Slowbro can all take a hit from Mega Lopunny and OHKO with their STAB move of choice. Frailer Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Latias, and Latios are not able to switch into Mega Lopunny reliably, although Slowbro and Mega Latias take a pittance from anything Mega Lopunny has save Encore and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Priority</strong>: Due to Mega Lopunny's relative frailness, priority from Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Talonflame, Breloom, and Azumarill can heavily damage it and can pick it off when weakened. Switching into Mega Lopunny repeatedly is not an option for the majority of these Pokemon, however, reducing them to a revenge killing role.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Mega Lopunny's most powerful STAB move and allows it to OHKO frailer Pokemon such as Stratagem, Weavile, Colossoil, and even Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKO neutral targets such as Mega Metagross. Unfortunately, High Jump Kick's recoil damage puts Mega Lopunny at a disadvantage against Protect users and severely punishes the user for missing, often at crucial moments in a match. Return is Mega Lopunny's most reliable Normal-type STAB move and allows it to hit Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Tornadus-T, Latios, and Mollux. Return's perfect accuracy also allows it to be used over High Jump Kick when the potential miss and accompanying recoil damage are not acceptable. Scrappy also gives Return perfect coverage in conjunction with High Jump Kick. Fake Out allows Mega Lopunny to safely Mega Evolve and notably to get the advantage on initially faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Stratagem. Ice Punch is the most useful option for allowing Mega Lopunny to get past bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, which would otherwise be able to take a hit and deal major damage to Mega Lopunny in return. If Ice Punch doesn't appeal to you, Power-Up Punch can be used to boost Mega Lopunny's Attack during the switches Mega Lopunny can create, as well as when it revenge kills weakened Pokemon. The Attack boost allows Mega Lopunny to break through defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, more easily and sweep frailer Pokemon with ease. Additionally, Mega Lopunny can make use of Drain Punch, Encore, and Healing Wish effectively. Those moves also give it a safe option to use against Protect users such as Heatran. Drain Punch helps lengthen Mega Lopunny's longevity and offset chip and recoil damage. Encore puts more pressure on defensive Pokemon, allowing Mega Lopunny to lock would-be checks such as Tomohawk into support moves such as Stealth Rock. Healing Wish allows Mega Lopunny to give another Pokemon, such as Aurumoth, Mega Metagross, or Manaphy, a chance to clinch the game through fully healing them at the cost of its own life.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Limber is the least situtational of Lopunny's abilities and allows Mega Lopunny to shrug off paralysis pre-Mega Evolution, notably switching into Chansey's Thunder Wave or safely accumulating Power-Up Punch boosts on Static Cyclohm. The EV spread and Jolly nature are used to maximize Mega Lopunny's Attack and Speed to ensure its effectiveness as a revenge killer, giving it the Speed to outpace Stratagem, Syclant, Tornadus-T, and other prominent fast threats. Adamant is an option to pick up some notable KOs, such as a chance to 2HKO Clefable, a chance to OHKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock, and high chances of 2HKOing both Pyroak and Sylveon after Stealth Rock damage. Mega Lopunny will be able to outpace Jolly Cawmodore and below, but it is unable to revenge kill anything faster, such as Tornadus-T, Stratagem, and Syclant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exercise caution against Pokemon that commonly use Protect, such as Heatran, Mega Diancie, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. Mega Lopunny functions best on and against offensive teams due to its high Speed and Base Power of its STAB moves. Try to conserve Mega Lopunny's health for as long as possible; don't use High Jump Kick when Return would suffice and try not to switch it in needlessly. Use Fake Out when opportune, be careful if the opponent has a contact-punishing Pokemon such as Garchomp or Rocky Helmet Tomohawk. Fake Out also has utility for spreading chip damage and helping put threats such as Aurumoth and Mega Charizard X into revenge killing range. Keeping Mega Lopunny's last moveslot unknown for as long as possible can allow you to surprise the opponent. Encore can be used to take advantage of Mega Lopunny's sole immunity by locking Pokemon into Ghost-type moves. Healing Wish is best used when Mega Lopunny is weakened and would be unable to achieve anything more for its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set functions best with Pokemon that can handle common priority users, specifically Talonflame, such as tank Garchomp. Garchomp and other Stealth Rock setters are also vital teammates for Mega Lopunny, as it helps secure KOs against Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Tornadus-T, as well as pressuring Talonflame through Stealth Rock and Fake Out damage. Steel-types, such as Heatran and Scizor, can help handle Psychic- and Fairy-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Lopunny. Pokemon that resist Fighting synergize well with both Mega Lopunny and Steel-types to help handle their shared Fighting-type weakness. Tomohawk in particular can handily check the majority of Fighting-types while offering hazard control or the ability to weaken Fighting-resistant Pokemon, such as Clefable, on the opposing team. Clerics such as Clefable, Pyroak, and Cyclohm can help keep Mega Lopunny healthy and remove unwanted paralysis or burns through Heal Bell support. Wallbreakers such as Manaphy, Aurumoth, and Kyurem-B can soften up defensive cores for Mega Lopunny to break through later, and in return they appreciate Mega Lopunny's ability to handle faster offensive threats. Offensive Plasmanta sets are able to power through common Lopunny checks such as Tomohawk, Cyclohm, Skarmory, Pyroak, and Clefable with ease, and they are also able to lure bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp and surprise them with Hidden Power Ice, or in Garchomp's case, Dazzling Gleam. Mega Lopunny is able to threaten faster Pokemon that trouble Plasmanta and can remove Chansey as well.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Mega Lopunny a way to get past status and punish switch-ins and synergizes well with Encore. High Jump Kick is Mega Lopunny's most powerful STAB move and helps break through Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Mega Metagross, and it best allows Mega Lopunny to punish switch-ins after a Substitute. Drain Punch can be used over High Jump Kick to prolong Mega Lopunny's Substitute-creating ability at a significant cost of power. It also doesn't miss, which makes it a more reliable option versus Pokemon such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Return is Mega Lopunny's more reliable Normal-type STAB move and helps get past Fighting-resistant foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Its also perfectly accurate, which is useful in cases where High Jump Kick's potential for missing is unacceptable. Encore allows Mega Lopunny to pressure defensive Pokemon, notably locking them into a status move once a Substitute is up, allowing Mega Lopunny to create free turns. Encore also creates setup opportunities for Substitute. Fake Out and Ice Punch can be used to allow Mega Lopunny to take up a more offensive role, focusing on punishing switch-ins over crippling defensive Pokemon. Fake Out allows Mega Lopunny to bypass the downsides of the Mega Evolution turn as well as deal chip damage throughout the match. It also helps Mega Lopunny revenge kill opposing weakened Pokemon. Ice Punch allows Mega Lopunny to blow past bulky Ground-types that would otherwise give it trouble, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Limber is the least situtational of Lopunny's abilities and allows Mega Lopunny to shrug off paralysis pre-Mega Evolution. This is notable in a select few instances, mainly switching into Chansey's Thunder Wave or safely accumulating Power-Up Punch boosts on Static Cyclohm. The EV spread and Jolly nature are used to maximize Mega Lopunny's Attack and Speed to ensure its effectiveness as a revenge killer. HP is kept indivisible by four to maximize Substitute chances.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions well against stall teams by taking advantage of their attempts to status Mega Lopunny. Mega Lopunny functions best on offensive teams due to its high Attack and Speed. These attributes also allow it to threaten offensive teams effectively. Don't be careless with Substitute; use it sparingly and only in situations where the advantages of creating the Substitute overshadow the potential damage Mega Lopunny can deal that turn. That said, use Substitute on predicted switches or status moves. Exercise caution with High Jump Kick against Pokemon that commonly run Protect, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Mega Diancie, and Chansey. It's very important to try to conserve Mega Lopunny's health so that it can create a Substitute, so be cautious using Fake Out against teams with contact-punishing Pokemon such as Garchomp, and try not to switch Mega Lopunny in needlessly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can handle common priority users, specifically Talonflame, such as Garchomp, are essential for Mega Lopunny. Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp are also vital teammates for Mega Lopunny, as it helps secure KOs against Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Tornadus-T, as well as pressuring Talonflame through Stealth Rock and Fake Out damage. Steel-types, such as Heatran and Scizor, can help handle Psychic- and Fairy-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Lopunny. Pokemon that resist Fighting work well with both Mega Lopunny and Steel-types to help handle their shared Fighting-type weakness. Tomohawk in particular can handily check the majority of Fighting-types while offering hazard control or the ability to weaken Fighting-resistant Pokemon, such as Mega Altaria, on the opposing team. Clerics such as Clefable, Pyroak, and Cyclohm can help keep Mega Lopunny healthy and remove unwanted paralysis or burns through Heal Bell and Wish support. Wallbreakers such as Manaphy, Aurumoth, and Kyurem-B can soften up defensive cores for Mega Lopunny to break through later, and in return they appreciate Mega Lopunny's ability to handle faster offensive threats such as Stratagem, as well as Mega Lopunny's potential for passing them Substitutes. Offensive Plasmanta sets are able to power through common Lopunny checks such as Tomohawk, Cyclohm, Skarmory, Pyroak, and Clefable with ease, and they are able to lure bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp and surprise them with Hidden Power Ice, or in Garchomp's case, Dazzling Gleam. Mega Lopunny is able to threaten faster Pokemon that trouble Plasmanta as well as Chansey, and it is also able to pass Plasmanta Substitutes to get it in more safely.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is a powerful and versatile threat in the CAP metagame thanks to its potent offensive STAB combination, high Attack, and good Speed. Garchomp is especially notable for its defensive set, which takes advantage of its good physical bulk, access to Stealth Rock, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet to heavily punish VoltTurn teams. Garchomp's capabilities extend far beyond this bulky set, however, as its wide offensive movepool and great base stats allow it to run a variety of offensive sets effectively, providing it with a layer of unpredictability. However, Garchomp's 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks and weakness to the common Fairy-type moves are somewhat easy to exploit and can leave it susceptible to revenge killing by numerous strong, fast attackers that run these moves, such as Syclant, Krilowatt, and Mega Diancie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Tail can be used to hit Ground-types, notably Hippowdon and Landorus-T, for heavy damage. Certain damage-reducing Berries let Garchomp survive a hit from some of its usual checks and hit them back hard with its STAB moves. For example, Yache Berry lets Garchomp survive weaker Ice-type attacks, such as Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice, and retaliate with Earthquake. Roseli Berry lets Garchomp tank a Fairy-type attack, such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast, and hit back with Earthquake. A fast, mixed lead set with Focus Sash and Stealth Rock + three attacks is also a usable option, but it faces competition from bulkier Rocky Helmet variants with the same moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Many Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Clefable, Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Azumarill, and Sylveon are capable of threatening Garchomp thanks to their typing advantage. Togekiss in particular is completely immune to Garchomp's STAB combination, making it a great answer to Garchomp, only fearing Stone Edge. Physically defensive Unaware variants of Clefable are also notable for handling Swords Dance Garchomp without breaking a sweat.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Ice-types such as Syclant, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can outpace all but Choice Scarf Garchomp and revenge kill it with an Ice-type attack. They won't have an easy time switching in, however. Fast Pokemon that make use of Ice-type coverage, such as Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Krilowatt, can also revenge kill Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physical walls such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Hippowdon, Tomohawk, Zapdos, and Arghonaut have the bulk to survive an onslaught from Garchomp and either heal off the damage, cripple it with a status ailment, phaze it, or simply attack it. Many of these Pokemon won't enjoy taking a Draco Meteor from the mixed set, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed Garchomp and hit it hard such as Keldeo, Latias, Latios, Mega Manectric, Thundurus, Mega Diancie, Syclant, and Krilowatt are generally very effective at checking it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank Chomp": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Garchomp is a durable and reliable setter of Stealth Rock, which accumulates useful chip damage on the opposing team. Earthquake is Garchomp's primary STAB option, dealing decent damage against neutral targets and helping Garchomp check foes such as Heatran and Mollux. Dragon Tail phazes common switch-ins to Garchomp, racking up even more chip damage on the opposing team when Stealth Rock is set up. Fire Blast provides coverage against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Toxic can be used instead to wear down various bulky switch-ins to Garchomp, such as Tomohawk, Arghonaut, and various Fairy-types. Endure can grant an extra turn of chip damage on the foe with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Similarly, Rest can also provide extra opportunities to take advantage of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet while also healing Garchomp and is a good option with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support, but it has the drawback of potentially giving the opponent free turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>100 Special Defense EVs are just enough to avoid the OHKO from Timid Life Orb Plasmanta's Hidden Power Ice and let Garchomp handle special attackers such as Aurumoth lacking an Ice-type attack, Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus better. The remaining EVs and an Impish nature emphasize Garchomp's role as a physical tank. Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet are used to heavily punish users of contact moves such as Talonflame, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Scizor and discourage U-turn spam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garchomp primarily functions as a bulky Stealth Rock setter. You can lead with it or use it as a pivot throughout the match to check physical attackers such as Talonflame and Mega Scizor. If your opponent's team contains several Pokemon that Garchomp can pivot into throughout the course of a match, preserve Garchomp to handle these threats and take full advantage of the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Once entry hazards have been set up, shuffle the opponent's team around with Dragon Tail. Keep in mind that it can be beneficial to preserve Garchomp even if it is at low health, as it can still deal a good chunk of damage to foes simply by switching into a contact move such as U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Several offensive Pokemon such as Cawmodore, Aurumoth, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny all appreciate Garchomp setting up Stealth Rock reliably as well as its ability to check Talonflame. Dark-types such as Colossoil, Tyranitar, and Mega Sharpedo attract users of contact moves such as Arghonaut, Revenankh, and Mega Scizor, so they appreciate Garchomp's ability to punish these Pokemon. Pokemon like Aurumoth and Celebi highly despise U-turn, so they can also benefit from having Garchomp as a partner. A Steel-type teammate such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, or Kitsunoh is useful to handle the Fairy- and Ice-types that threaten Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Garchomp's high Attack even further, allowing it to break down walls and pressure the opposing team more easily. Earthquake and Dragon Claw are Garchomp's optimal STAB moves, providing great neutral coverage on most of the metagame with a few exceptions, notably Togekiss and Skarmory. Outrage can be preferable on lead sets over Dragon Claw for the increased damage output before Garchomp goes down, but it is not as optimal if using Substitute. If opting to use Garchomp as an early-game wallbreaker or a lead, Stealth Rock is used to help wear down the opposing team for Garchomp's teammates. Alternatively, Substitute provides Garchomp with a shield against status moves, allowing it to set up more safely against defensive foes, as well as a buffer against revenge killers. Fire Blast can be used in the last slot if hitting Skarmory is especially important. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used to hit Togekiss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment ensures that Garchomp hits as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature ensure that Garchomp outspeeds all base 100 Speed Pokemon and Thundurus-T and Speed ties with opposing fully invested positive-natured Garchomp. Lum Berry is a great choice to squander attempts at inflicting Garchomp with a status ailment so that it can set up Swords Dance or Stealth Rock more safely. Focus Sash is also a good option if using Garchomp as a lead, guaranteeing that it survives one hit from full health. Leftovers is the primary choice alongside Substitute, as it provides Garchomp with extra longevity, and Substitute can be used to avoid the foe's attempts at inflicting Garchomp with a status condition. Salac Berry is also an option in tandem with Substitute, allowing Garchomp to act as a much more effective late-game cleaner. If running Salac Berry, an EV spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe should be used to ensure that Salac Berry activates after three uses of Substitute. Rough Skin punishes users of contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garchomp can set up in the face of Will-O-Wisp users and other status inducers if it has Substitute or Lum Berry, so take advantage of this if running either one. If using Garchomp as an offensive Stealth Rock setter, it's best used as an early-game wallbreaker and entry hazard setter, or even as a lead if it runs Focus Sash. If utilizing Substitute, bring Garchomp in against Pokemon that have trouble breaking its Substitute, such as Mollux and Heatran, so that it can safely set up Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Kitsunoh can check the Fairy- and Ice-types that force Garchomp out. Other physical attackers such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Cawmodore can wear down the opponent's team so that Garchomp has an easier time sweeping, or vice versa. Garchomp struggles getting past bulky Pokemon like physically defensive Landorus-T, so strong Water- and Ice-types, such as Keldeo, Kyurem-B, and Syclant, can help out with this. Magnezone can trap some troublesome defensive threats for Garchomp, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, giving it a better shot at sweeping.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is the biggest draw to a mixed attacking set, as it hits impressively hard with full investment and Life Orb (or as Mega Garchomp) and catches physically defensive switch-ins such as Landorus-T off guard. Earthquake provides Garchomp with a strong physical STAB move. Even with minimal Attack investment, it's still more than enough to handle common targets such as Heatran, Mollux, and Volkraken. Fire Blast provides strong coverage against Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor. Stone Edge is Garchomp's best option against Togekiss, Zapdos, and specially defensive Talonflame, as well as Pyroak after Draco Meteor has been used. Stealth Rock can be used instead to capitalize on forced switches if the coverage provided by Stone Edge is deemed unnecessary for your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Naive nature take full advantage of Garchomp's Speed tier. Naive is preferred over Hasty because Garchomp will realistically be tanking more physical hits throughout the course of a match than special ones. 252 Special Attack EVs let Draco Meteor and Fire Blast hit as hard as possible. Life Orb increases Garchomp's damage output significantly. If your team doesn't yet have a Mega Evolution, Garchompite can be used in place of Life Orb to give a similar boost to Garchomp's offenses without requiring it to take recoil damage. This also boosts its overall bulk post-Mega Evolution, but it also slightly lowers its Speed. Rough Skin punishes users of contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a lure for physically defensive Pokemon that could otherwise safely switch into Garchomp. Landorus-T, Slowbro, Arghonaut, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn all take massive damage from a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Garchomp can still be used to check Fire-types, such as Heatran and Mollux, with Earthquake, potentially feigning a non-mixed set. Use this set to open up holes in the opponent's defensive cores early- to mid-game to allow a teammate to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Metagross, Cawmodore, and Mega Scizor enjoy physically defensive Pokemon being lured and defeated. Steel-types, such as the previously mentioned Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Cawmodore, as well as Kitsunoh and Naviathan, can serve as good partners to check Fairy- and Ice-types for Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is a very strong STAB option and a good tool for late-game cleaning. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Outrage, dealing great damage to foes that aren't resistant or immune to the move. Dragon Claw may initially seem redundant alongside Outrage, but it provides Garchomp with a more reliable, albeit weaker, Dragon-type STAB move for revenge killing in situations where locking Garchomp into Outrage would be unfavorable. Garchomp's final moveslot admittedly doesn't see much use, as locking Garchomp into these moves can leave it easily taken advantage of the next turn, but the chosen move can be helpful in specific luring or revenge killing scenarios. Stone Edge handles Flying-types such as Togekiss and Zapdos, while Fire Blast hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Cawmodore, and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment, a positive nature, and a Choice Scarf ensure that Garchomp can outspeed and revenge kill threats such as +1 Mega Charizard X, +1 Naviathan, and +1 Aurumoth. A Jolly nature is preferred unless Fire Blast is being used, in which case Naive is the superior option. Maximum Attack investment gives Garchomp the highest offensive potential. Rough Skin can hurt opposing users of contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garchomp is best used as a mid-game revenge killer or a late-game cleaner thanks to its high Speed and great Attack. Being one of Garchomp's lesser-used sets, Choice Scarf can help Garchomp grab some unexpected KOs against normally faster threats such as Mega Diancie and Krilowatt. Always consider the advantages and disadvantages of Outrage and Dragon Claw when attacking with Garchomp. For example, don't lock Garchomp into Outrage if it could grant a dangerous foe such as Mega Altaria a free turn of setup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp needs teammates to handle physical walls, as it is unable to muscle past or wear down bulky foes such as Slowbro, Togekiss, Skarmory, Arghonaut, and Tomohawk on its own. Magnezone can reliably trap Skarmory and Ferrothorn to help facilitate a sweep for Garchomp. Strong wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Aurumoth can help weaken the opposing team, as bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Clefable could prove to be real issues for Garchomp otherwise.</p>"

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W has a great defensive typing that gives it important resistances to Flying-, Water-, Ice-, Fire-, and Steel-type attacks and thus allows it to pivot into common Pokemon such as Talonflame, Tomohawk, Naviathan, and Cawmodore. In Levitate, Rotom-W possesses a useful ability that more or less removes one of its key weaknesses, leaving it with just one weakness—to the relatively uncommon Grass type. Its base 86 Speed means that Rotom-W can act as a slow pivot against faster offensive threats while also outspeeding walls such as Tomohawk and Cyclohm. Everybody's favorite washing machine also has access to a small number of useful moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch, which allows it to function as a defensive pivot and give massive momentum to teammates.</p> <p>However, Rotom-W's otherwise limited movepool means that it can be somewhat one dimensional offensively. This is further compounded by a lack of reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Pain Split or Rest to extend its longevity. Lastly, a poor HP stat leaves its otherwise decent defenses weak without sufficient investment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can be used to allow Rotom-W to outspeed a good proportion of the metagame, acting as a fast pivot. Access to Trick allows it to cripple foes by Tricking them its Choice Scarf, while Thunderbolt gives it a more powerful alternative to Volt Switch that also doesn't force it to switch. Although a much rarer option, Choice Specs is also a viable item, boosting Rotom-W's mediocre base 105 Special Attack to good levels and allowing it to function as a hard-hitting slow pivot.</p> <p>Thunder Wave can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp to cut foes' Speed rather than their Attack. Hidden Power Fire can be used to lure in and dispatch of Ferrothorn on more offensive sets. Hidden Power Ground can be used to damage Mollux and Plasmanta, which would otherwise be able to switch in on Rotom-W easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: A resistance to both of Rotom-W's STAB types and super effective STAB moves of their own give Grass-types the best chance of countering Rotom-W. In particular, Serperior can set up on Rotom-W with Contrary Leaf Storm, while Celebi's ability Natural Cure and Pyroak's typing prevent Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp from being effective on them. Most of the time, Rotom-W will be forced to Volt Switch out should a Grass-type come in.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Choice Specs Sylveon can heavily damage Rotom-W with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with an Immunity to Water-type Attacks</strong>: Mollux and Plasmanta can check Rotom-W, as they are immune to its most powerful attack, Hydro Pump. Mollux is also immune to Will-O-Wisp, and Plasmanta resists Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Mega Altaria, and specially defensive Mega Charizard X don't take much damage from Rotom-W's STAB moves and don't necessarily mind the burns it can dole out with Will-O-Wisp. In particular, Mega Altaria with Heal Bell or Refresh can easily set up on Rotom-W, while specially offensive sets can hit Rotom-W hard with a Pixilate-boosted STAB Hyper Voice. Kyurem-B can switch into any of Rotom-W's attacks well, and it can also Roost off damage or KO with Teravolt Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Most specially defensive Pokemon, such as specially defensive Jirachi, force Rotom-W to Volt Switch out, as it cannot do anything apart from burning them with Will-O-Wisp or trying to take out a chunk of their HP with Pain Split. In particular, those with an immunity to burns or a method of removing them, such as Natural Cure Chansey and Magic Guard Clefable, can prevent Rotom-W from doing anything except switching out with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Rotom-W's Electric-type STAB move, and it also allows Rotom-W to give momentum to its teammates. Hydro Pump is the only relevant Water-type move that Rotom-W learns and acts as a powerful but unreliable Water-type STAB move, allowing it to punish common Ground-type Pokemon that switch in to absorb its Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to cripple physically offensive threats, furthering its ability to act as a physically defensive wall. The last move is a choice of the type of recovery Rotom-W uses; Pain Split is dependent upon the foe's HP but has the advantage of being able to reduce the foe's HP, while Rest is dependent upon Rotom-W holding a Chesto Berry, as it puts Rotom-W to sleep for two turns otherwise. Therefore, it is a single-use strategy, whereas Pain Split can be used multiple times throughout a match and is useful for dealing with bulky Pokemon with large HP stats such as Colossoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers should be used in conjunction with Pain Split, while the preferred item for Rotom-W running Rest is Chesto Berry. 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD and a Bold nature are used to maximize Rotom-W's physical bulk while also limiting the damage it takes from entry hazards, although the 8 EVs put into Special Defense could just as easily be put into Speed to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt. 44 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Jolly Azumarill, while 128 Speed EVs can be run to outspeed Adamant Bisharp. Rotom-W can also run a mixed defensive spread of 248 HP / 152 Def / 108 SpD, which allows it to tank special attacks from the likes of Mega Manectric, Latios, and Latias more effectively. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD is also a viable option, as it allows Rotom-W to act as specially defensive pivot. This set can also act as a mixed wall due to Rotom-W's access to Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W uses its great defensive typing, good bulk, and useful ability to act as physically defensive pivot, taking physical hits from common Pokemon such as Talonflame before using Volt Switch to give momentum to its teammates or spreading burns throughout the opponent's team with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Rotom-W's ability, Levitate, allows it to switch in on Ground-type attacks, but many common Ground-type Pokemon, such as Colossoil and Garchomp, have secondary attacks (in this case, Knock Off and Outrage) that can harm Rotom-W. However, Rotom-W can limit the damage done through the use of Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split, and Hydro Pump hits most Ground-types for great damage, assuming that it doesn't miss. It should also be noted that Pokemon with Mold Breaker such as Excadrill and Mega Gyarados, which might otherwise be checked by Rotom-W, can hit it with a super effective Ground-type attack due to their ability.</p> <p>Through its pivoting, Rotom-W can acquire a lot of damage, particularly if there are any entry hazards on the field, so prudency is required to ensure that Rotom-W does not faint due to the damage it builds up. In the same way, non-Rest variants of Rotom-W do not appreciate being statused, as it wears them down. It is essential that care be taken to prevent Rotom-W from being worn down, because it needs to be healthy to deal with many of the Pokemon it checks. To avoid this, be prudent when using Will-O-Wisp against teams with Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie, as well as Rebound Colossoil. In a similar vein, Guts users such as Colossoil can take advantage of Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp to boost their own Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W is an excellent defensive addition to most VoltTurn teams, forming good defensive VoltTurn cores with Landorus-T, Scizor, and Colossoil. Together, Landorus-T and Rotom-W can stop many of the physically offensive threats prominent in the CAP metagame. U-turn Colossoil handles the Electric-types and specially offensive Pokemon such as Mollux that annoy Rotom-W, while Rotom-W handles the bulky Water-types that plague Colossoil. In terms of offensive partners, Mega Beedrill and Talonflame are good picks, as they handle the Grass-types that threaten Rotom-W while it deals with the physically offensive threats such as opposing Talonflame that force them out. Similarly, Pokemon that appreciate Rotom-W's ability to check many common physically offensive threats such as Mega Lopunny are good teammates.</p> <p>Rotom-W can also be a great teammate for wallbreakers like Mega Gardevoir, which are usually frail, as it can utilize its slow Volt Switch to enable them to switch in safely. Likewise, setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Talonflame appreciate Rotom-W's pivoting, as it allows them to set up safely.</p>"

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy's standout trait is its access to Tail Glow, which allows it to set up incredibly quickly and break through a plethora of walls. A mono-Water typing leaves Manaphy with very few weaknesses, and this coupled with good defensive stats means Manaphy is able to find many opportunities to set up. Manaphy has an impressive range of coverage moves as well, including Ice Beam, Energy Ball, and Psychic. However, foes such as Mollux, Plasmanta, Cyclohm, and Krilowatt make it difficult for Manaphy to always have the right coverage options. Manaphy's base 100 Speed isn't bad by any means, but it leaves it outsped by many offensive threats such as Mega Manectric and Serperior. However, very few things can safely switch into a boosted Manaphy, and with the right team support its coverage issues can be remedied.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky set with Rain Dance / Rest / Calm Mind / Scald is usable and has greater longevity than any of Manaphy's other sets. However, this set is too matchup dependent to be consistent, as Mollux and Plasmanta are fairly common and can wall this set completely. +3 Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Ferrothorn and maintains decent coverage against other Grass-types, so it can be used over Ice Beam, but it leaves Manaphy unable to deal with Dragon-types such as Cyclohm. Dazzling Gleam allows Manaphy to OHKO Kyurem-B after a single Tail Glow boost, but it provides subpar coverage overall compared to its usual coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, such as Krilowatt, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus, all pose a heavy threat to Manaphy and can serve as solid revenge killers. Plasmanta can get a Special Attack boost from Storm Drain if it switches into Scald. However, it needs to watch out for Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur can check Manaphy lacking Psychic and can hit it hard with Giga Drain. Serperior can outspeed and OHKO Manaphy with Leaf Storm and can even tank an unboosted Ice Beam if necessary, making it a good offensive check. Ferrothorn is a potential answer to Manaphy lacking Hidden Power Fire, as it is only 3HKOed by +3 Ice Beam and can strike back with a super effective Power Whip. However, Ferrothorn does not appreciate getting burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster attackers such as Mega Crucibelle, Stratagem, Tornadus-T, and Weavile can't switch into Manaphy very well, but they can outspeed it and dish out massive damage, allowing them to serve as revenge killers.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Powerful priority users such as Colossoil and Talonflame can easily pick off a weakened Manaphy but don't enjoy switching in directly.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Clefable and Arghonaut</strong>: Unaware Clefable ignores Manaphy's boosts, making it a solid answer to Manaphy if it's healthy enough. Clefable can potentially be worn down by a Scald burn, however, and Rain Dance Manaphy can put a lot of pressure on Clefable. Bulky Arghonaut variants can handle most Manaphy, especially if it is lacking Energy Ball or Psychic. That said, a Scald burn has the potential to cripple Arghonaut as well.</p> <p><strong>Mollux</strong>: Mollux counters any variant of Manaphy lacking Psychic due to Dry Skin.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can check Manaphy if it lacks Rain Dance thanks to its immense special bulk, but it can find itself being overwhelmed by Manaphy in the rain, as it's 2HKOed by a +6 rain-boosted Scald and will very likely end up getting burned if it tries to stall with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Mega Altaria, Cyclohm, and Latios resist Manaphy's STAB moves, allowing them to check any variant of Manaphy lacking Ice Beam. Kyurem-B is neutral to Ice Beam thanks to its secondary Ice typing and can threaten Manaphy with Fusion Bolt, but it doesn't enjoy getting burned by Scald upon switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tail Glow + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow boosts Manaphy's Special Attack by three stages, turning it into a powerful wallbreaker. Scald's burn chance allows Manaphy to cripple and wear down potential switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn, Kyurem-B, and Unaware Clefable, which can allow Manaphy a better shot at breaking past them. Ice Beam provides good overall neutral coverage with Scald and hits Grass- and Dragon-types such as Necturna, Mega Altaria, Cyclohm, Garchomp, and Latios super effectively. Psychic provides coverage against Keldeo, Mollux, Plasmanta, and Mega Venusaur, but it leaves Manaphy much more easily checked by opposing Water-types. Alternatively, Energy Ball may be used for stronger coverage against the likes of Azumarill, Krilowatt, Naviathan, Rotom-W, Starmie, and Slowbro, but it renders Manaphy helpless against the likes of Mollux, Plasmanta, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature make the best use of Manaphy's Speed tier. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Manaphy's damage output. Leftovers provides Manaphy with added longevity, allowing it to set up more often throughout the course of a match. Wacan Berry may be used instead to improve Manaphy's matchup against Electric-types. It prevents faster Electric-types such as Krilowatt and Mega Manectric from easily revenge killing it, and it allows Manaphy to set up more comfortably against slower Electric-types such as Cyclohm. Rindo Berry prevents Manaphy from being revenge killed by Serperior, giving it an opportunity to strike back with Ice Beam. Similarly, Rindo Berry also allows Manaphy to set up against slower Grass-types and use Ice Beam the next turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If there are no Pokemon immune to Water on the opposing team, Manaphy can use Scald liberally early on in the match to potentially cripple and wear down its defensive answers. Depending on which coverage move Manaphy is running, it will find itself being walled by a certain group of Pokemon. Manaphy should wait until these threats have been adequately weakened or removed before setting up Tail Glow. Manaphy should set up Tail Glow against Pokemon that can't do much damage to it, such as Heatran, so that it is as healthy as possible after setting up and harder to revenge kill. If Manaphy is running Wacan Berry or Rindo Berry, slower Electric- or Grass-types, respectively, can make for excellent setup bait. However, if fast Electric- or Grass-types are present on the opposing team, try to preserve Manaphy's Berry for these threats so they cannot revenge kill it. Manaphy may struggle finding an opportunity to set up against faster teams, so be sure to take advantage of Scald and its coverage moves as much as possible in these matchups; setting up too soon against fast teams can result in wasted turns of using Tail Glow as the opponent switches to a threat that forces Manaphy out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone provides a direct method of eliminating Ferrothorn by trapping it and KOing it with Hidden Power Fire. However, this may also be accomplished by utilizing a lure, such as Hidden Power Fire Kyurem-B or Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie. Fast cleaners such as Cawmodore, Stratagem, and Mega Lopunny all benefit from Manaphy's wallbreaking. Talonflame can handle faster offensive threats with priority Brave Bird or Acrobatics and can help defeat Ferrothorn and Chansey as well. Illusion Tail Glow Aurumoth is an excellent teammate; it can disguise itself as Manaphy and help break past Manaphy's checks and counters, allowing Manaphy a better shot at sweeping later on. Aurumoth's strong Psychic-type STAB moves lessen the need for Manaphy to run Psychic as coverage, freeing up the moveslot for Energy Ball. Electric checks such as Mega Charizard X and Hippowdon make for good teammates, especially if Manaphy is not running Wacan Berry. If Manaphy is not running Rindo Berry, Tornadus-T and Mega Scizor can take Grass-type moves aimed at it. A Sticky Web setter, such as Necturna, can slow down the opposing team, which improves Manaphy's matchup against offensive teams and allows it a much better chance at sweeping. However, Sticky Web also makes opposing Serperior even more threatening to Manaphy and its team. Tailwind users such as Fidgit and Talonflame pair well with Manaphy for similar reasons, speeding up Manaphy and its teammates.</p>"

      "Tail Glow + Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow turns Manaphy into a powerful wallbreaker by boosting its Special Attack by three stages. Rain Dance powers up Manaphy's Scald, giving Manaphy the potential to muscle past Unaware Clefable. It also allows Manaphy to take advantage of its ability, Hydration. Manaphy can utilize Scald's burn chance to wear down potential switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn and Unaware Clefable, more easily. Psychic allows Manaphy to deal notable damage to Mollux, Plasmanta, and Mega Venusaur, preventing them from walling the set. Energy Ball, instead, gives Manaphy the ability to threaten Water-types more effectively, such as Azumarill, Slowbro, and Rotom-W. Alternatively, Ice Beam gives Manaphy super effective coverage against opposing Grass- and Dragon-types such as Necturna, Mega Altaria, Cyclohm, Garchomp, and Latios. It should be noted, however, that many of the foes that are hit by Energy Ball or Ice Beam for super effective damage still take neutral damage from Psychic, whereas Manaphy absolutely needs Psychic if aiming to defeat Mollux on its own.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Manaphy to Speed tie with the plethora of other base 100 Speed Pokemon. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to increase Manaphy's damage output, making it deadly after a single Tail Glow boost. Leftovers increases Manaphy's longevity, allowing it to set up more often throughout the course of a match. Hydration heals Manaphy's status ailments at the end of each turn in rain, which is helpful in tandem with Rain Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opposing team lacks foes with abilities that grant Water immunities, Manaphy has the freedom to use Scald frequently and early on in the match, as it may cripple and wear down its defensive answers. Two coverage moves are nowhere near enough for Manaphy to cover all the threats it'd like to, and it will always be walled by a certain subset of Pokemon depending on which two attacks it opts for. Therefore, Manaphy should wait until these threats have been adequately worn down or handled by its teammates before attempting to set up. Heatran and other foes that do little damage to Manaphy provide it with great opportunities to set up either Tail Glow or Rain Dance. Despite Manaphy's reasonable bulk, its middling Speed means that it can struggle against offensive teams, as it'll have a hard time setting up or find itself being easily revenge killed. Manaphy should take advantage of Scald and its coverage move as much as possible in these matchups or be used as a Rain Dance setter to support its teammates on forced switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Depending on Manaphy's choice of two coverage moves, it will find itself being walled by certain groups of Pokemon and will need the proper teammates to handle them accordingly. Manaphy lacking Psychic absolutely needs a method of dealing with Mollux, Plasmanta, and Mega Venusaur. Seeing as these are all Poison-types, a Psychic-type such as Aurumoth is an excellent partner to take these threats out of the picture. Manaphy lacking Energy Ball will need a teammate that can check Water-types, such as Cyclohm, Mollux, Necturna, or Serperior. Manaphy lacking Ice Beam will struggle against opposing Dragon-types, so Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Mega Gardevoir can pair up well with Manaphy. Cawmodore pairs up very nicely with Manaphy if Manaphy is running Ice Beam to defeat Cyclohm, and it can act as a fast late-game sweeper after Manaphy breaks down walls. Cawmodore also benefits from Rain Dance, as it neutralizes its weakness to Fire. Other late-game cleaners such as Stratagem and Mega Lopunny can also take advantage of walls being broken down by Manaphy. Manaphy tends to struggle breaking past defensive threats such as Ferrothorn and Chansey and requires teammates to take them on. Talonflame works well in this role and can also handle faster offensive threats for Manaphy with priority Brave Bird or Acrobatics. Magnezone can trap an opposing Ferrothorn that blocks Manaphy's path to setting up and KO it with Hidden Power Fire. Alternatively, lures such as Mega Diancie can use Hidden Power Fire to take care of Ferrothorn. Manaphy should not use Rain Dance if its teammates have yet to weaken or remove Ferrothorn, as this will hamper their ability to do so by weakening their Fire-type moves. Necturna can use Sticky Web to allow Manaphy to outspeed more threats, but this has the risk of making Serperior more fearsome. Similarly, Fidgit and Talonflame can provide Tailwind support, thus pairing well with Manaphy for similar reasons by speeding up Manaphy and its teammates. Finally, Pokemon with Swift Swim, such as Mega Swampert, Kabutops, and Kingdra, or Hurricane, such as Tornadus-T and Tomohawk, can all benefit from Manaphy setting up Rain Dance.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Contrary, Serperior can utilize its powerful Leaf Storm and simultaneously boost its Special Attack by two stages, allowing it to quickly break down opposing walls. Serperior's high base 113 Speed allows it to outpace threats such as Mega Diancie, Kitsunoh, and Latias, making it a potent late-game cleaner once it obtains a boost from Leaf Storm. Serperior can also put heavy pressure on stall teams; Pokemon with Unaware such as Arghonaut, Quagsire, and Clefable can't safely switch into a Life Orb-boosted Leaf Storm, and Serperior can bypass some of its would-be checks depending on which Hidden Power it runs. However, Serperior's reliance on Hidden Power for coverage means that once the opponent knows which Hidden Power Serperior is running, walling it becomes an easier task. Also, outside of Serperior's high Speed, the rest of its stats are somewhat disappointing. For instance, its base 75 Special Attack is rather unimpressive without a boost. Serperior is also quite prone to being revenge killed by faster threats and priority users such as Talonflame, Syclant, and various Choice Scarf users due to its middling bulk and mediocre defensive typing. Serperior's opportunities to switch in are rather limited; taking too much damage while switching in coupled with Life Orb recoil can leave it even more susceptible to being revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Flying can be used to hit Tomohawk, Mega Venusaur, and Pyroak very hard at +2 while still retaining coverage against other Grass-types such as Necturna and Celebi. Hidden Power Ice is also an option, hitting Mega Altaria, Tomohawk, and Zapdos hard at +2, as well as the previously mentioned Grass-types. Hidden Power Rock is an option that lets Serperior deal with Pyroak, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y, and it is also a decent option for smacking Talonflame on the switch in. Knock Off is a good catch-all method of wearing down Serperior's switch-ins, removing important items such as Leftovers and, in Chansey's case, Eviolite, allowing Serperior's offensive teammates to have a better shot at breaking past them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran, Pyroak, and Mega Charizard Y all resist Leaf Storm, can tank a +2 Dragon Pulse, and can retaliate back with their super effective STAB moves. Heatran fears Hidden Power Ground, however, and Pyroak and Mega Charizard Y need Stealth Rock off the field to check Serperior safely. Talonflame, particularly the specially defensive variant, is also a notable Fire-type answer to Serperior, as it 4x resists Leaf Storm, doesn't take too much from Serperior's common coverage moves, and can easily threaten Serperior with its Flying-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Necturna, and Ferrothorn all resist Leaf Storm and can tank a +2 Dragon Pulse before hitting back with their STAB moves. However, Necturna struggles with +2 Hidden Power Fire depending on its bulk investment, and Ferrothorn can only handle Serperior if it isn't running Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Mega Altaria</strong>: Mega Altaria, especially bulkier variants, can check Serperior quite safely if it has already Mega Evolved, and it can set up on it or simply attack. However, if Stealth Rock is up, Serperior is running the uncommon Hidden Power Ice, or Mega Altaria has taken too much prior damage, it can potentially fall to Serperior.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Serperior, such as Syclant, Stratagem, and Mega Manectric, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Mollux and Volkraken can revenge kill Serperior without too much trouble, but most have trouble coming in on Leaf Storm or a potential coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Serperior isn't terribly bulky and can be worn down quickly due to Life Orb recoil, so strong priority users such as Mega Scizor can pick it off once it has lost enough health. Talonflame is a notable priority user, as it can easily switch into Leaf Storm or any of Serperior's coverage moves courtesy of its Fire / Flying typing and can smack Serperior with a strong Brave Bird or Acrobatics. All Talonflame really fears is being caught on the switch with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazing Moves</strong>: Tomohawk can remove Serperior's boosts with Prankster Haze and retaliate with Air Slash, but it must be at high health to reliably check Serperior. Pyroak and Skarmory can both phaze Serperior in a pinch with Roar and Whirlwind, respectively, but they will likely take massive damage in the process. Keep in mind that Skarmory will have trouble if Serperior is running Hidden Power Fire.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute shields Serperior from status effects from Rotom-W, Necturna, Chansey, Tomohawk, Garchomp, Gliscor, Slowbro, Clefable, and Ferrothorn and weak attacks from opposing walls. Leech Seed wears down opposing walls like specially defensive Heatran, Chansey, defensive Cyclohm, Unaware Clefable, specially defensive Jirachi, and Skarmory, Pokemon that Serperior struggles against with its other sets. Leaf Storm is Serperior's strongest STAB attack and boosts Serperior's Special Attack after using it, allowing it to break past worn-down walls and offensive Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire is Serperior's best coverage move, hitting Pokemon that take minimal damage from Leaf Storm like Scizor, Ferrothorn, Necturna, Kitsunoh, Cawmodore, and Mega Metagross super effectively. Hidden Power Ground is a decent coverage move that 2HKOes specially defensive Heatran and has a chance to OHKO tank Mollux after a Leaf Storm boost, but it leaves Serperior walled by Flying-types and the Steel-types that are hit super effectively by Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Serperior to outspeed as many threats as possible, outspeeding base 110 Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Kitsunoh and Speed tying with other Hidden Power Fire Serperior; however, note that it cannot outspeed Mega Crucibelle. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Serperior to hit as hard as possible because without a Life Orb, Serperior needs every ounce of power it can get. Leftovers allows Serperior to make more Substitutes and mitigate damage dealt by walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Serperior into resisted hits or weak attacks. If switching into a wall, try not to get hit by a status effect. Double switches or safe switches through U-turn, Volt Switch, and Baton Pass also help Serperior get in safely. Using Substitute is generally the best first course of action after Serperior switches in, as it shields Serperior from status effects. Against a wall, Leech Seed's passive recovery helps heal off the HP lost from setting up a Substitute. Leaf Storm should then be used if Serperior will not be forced out. Save Leaf Storm's PP until after Unaware Clefable and Haze Tomohawk have been removed from play. The former can heal off damage from Leech Seed and Leaf Storm, while the latter can alternate between Rapid Spin, which frees it from Leech Seed, and Haze, which removes Serperior's boosts. Wear down Tomohawk until it is forced to Roost, and take advantage of the turn it does so to use an unresisted Leaf Storm. Do not overestimate Serperior's firepower, as the lack of a Life Orb makes Serperior not very threatening unless it has a few boosts under its belt. This set should be used primarily to stallbreak; however, it can hold its own against offensive teams too. Hidden Power is Serperior's best move to use when wearing down a wall, as the other three moves' PP are precious.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Serperior's Grass-type STAB attacks and ability to wear down opposing walls. Because Talonflame, Tornadus-T, and Tomohawk annoy this set, Electric-type Pokemon are great teammates. Notable examples include Cyclohm and Rotom-W, which resist these counters' Flying-type STAB moves. In return, Serperior removes Ground-types like Colossoil and walls like Cyclohm, which give these Pokemon trouble. In particular, VoltTurn teams help Serperior switch in more easily and appreciate Serperior's ability to remove opposing walls. Crucibelle and Rotom-W can deal with Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Tomohawk, and Talonflame. The former can either threaten these Flying-types with STAB Head Smash or set up with Coil, but it must be wary of Superpower from Life Orb Tornadus-T and Earth Power from Tomohawk, whereas the latter must be wary of Life Orb Focus Blast Tornadus-T and Life Orb Aura Sphere Tomohawk. Both have access to U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, allowing safe switches for Serperior. They also act as good switch-ins to Fire-types like Mollux and Heatran. Paralysis inducers like Clefable, Thundurus, and Cyclohm are good teammates for Serperior, as they allow Serperior to outspeed faster offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Volkraken, Mega Crucibelle, and Syclant.</p>"
      },
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is absolutely required, as it's Serperior's strongest STAB option and gives Serperior the equivalent of a Nasty Plot boost when it is used thanks to Contrary. Dragon Pulse provides coverage against opposing Dragon-types such as Cyclohm, Latias, and Dragalge, and it can KO them if they switched into Leaf Storm the previous turn. Hidden Power Fire provides important coverage against opposing Steel-types and easily OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn at +2. It also KOes opposing Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Kitsunoh, and Skarmory with some prior damage. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground allows Serperior to handle opposing Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta after a boost from Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Glare is the preferred option in the final slot as it cripples Serperior's switch-ins, such as Talonflame and Choice Scarf Mollux. Giga Drain gives Serperior a semi-reliable form of recovery, helping to heal off damage it might take from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards. This also allows Serperior to outlast Chansey, as Giga Drain will restore a large portion of Serperior's HP if it has obtained enough boosts. However, keep in mind that Giga Drain is rather weak without a boost and should usually only be used after at least one boost from Leaf Storm. Taunt is useful against Pokemon that might try to heal against Serperior, cripple it with status, or set up on it. Substitute allows Serperior to play around Sucker Punch users, such as Colossoil and Bisharp. It also acts as a shield against passive Pokemon that might try to inflict status on Serperior and eases prediction against Serperior's switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Serperior's Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature is used so that Serperior outspeeds foes such as Kitsunoh, Mega Diancie, Latias, Latios, and Gengar. Life Orb is the item of choice so that Serperior hits as hard as possible, and a 29 HP IV is used to reduce the amount of recoil damage taken. Leftovers is an option over Life Orb which trades immediate power for longevity, improving Serperior's matchup against bulkier teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior should ideally be brought in on a Pokemon that it can KO with Leaf Storm, as this puts Serperior at +2 Special Attack the next turn and at a significant advantage against the next switch-in. Revenge killing a foe by using Dragon Pulse or a Hidden Power is acceptable in a pinch, but keep in mind that Serperior lacks a lot of raw power against the next switch-in at +0, which is why it's almost always preferable to bring Serperior in on a foe it can KO with Leaf Storm. Serperior must be brought in safely, either after a teammate has been KOed or by a slower teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch. This is because Serperior tends to be easily revenge killed, and taking too much damage while switching in can put it into KO range for priority moves that it could otherwise survive. Serperior can overwhelm most walls due to how quickly Leaf Storm stacks Special Attack boosts, as long as they can't hit Serperior back for super effective damage; for example, the combination of Leaf Storm and Giga Drain can wear down Chansey while keeping Serperior healthy. Be sure to wear down Serperior's checks before attempting to clean up the opponent's team, and keep in mind that Serperior's checks largely depend on which Hidden Power it is running.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users pair well with Serperior to bring it in safely so that it can start using Leaf Storm. Mega Scizor is a great example; it can also serve as a check to Mega Altaria, which can potentially use Serperior as setup bait. Volkraken can also pair well with Serperior; together, the two form a potent wallbreaking duo. Rotom-W and Zapdos can also bring Serperior in safely with Volt Switch. These two Electric-types can take on Flying-types such as Cawmodore and Talonflame, which is very helpful to Serperior. Cyclohm is another good partner for Serperior; although it doesn't have Volt Switch, its massive physical bulk allows it to take on several threats to Serperior. In return, Serperior can demolish the Ground-types that trouble Cyclohm. Tomohawk, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar are durable Stealth Rock setters that can all check various physical threats to Serperior and can give it a better shot at cleaning up late-game. A Healing Wish user such as Latias, Mega Lopunny, or Tomohawk can be useful to give Serperior another shot at sweeping after it has been worn down or given a status ailment, and it can also be useful to restore Leaf Storm's PP.</p> <p>If Serperior runs Hidden Power Fire, teammates that can wear down opposing Fire-types, most notably Heatran, pair well with Serperior. Strong Water-type attackers, such as Keldeo, Starmie, and Krilowatt, can all fit this role. Dugtrio can also be used to trap and remove Heatran from the game. If Hidden Power Ground is used, Serperior will require teammates that can handle foes such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Magnezone works especially well, as it can trap both and KO them with Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>In a metagame plagued with Colossoil, Krilowatt, and numerous Fairy-types, Ferrothorn stands out as a solid defensive Pokemon to take these threats on thanks to its Grass / Steel typing, Iron Barbs, and good mixed bulk. Ferrothorn's capabilities extend beyond simply tanking hits for the team, as it has several great utility moves to take advantage of, including Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Leech Seed. Ferrothorn can even function as a decent status absorber, as it's immune to both powder moves and poison, and doesn't mind being paralyzed.</p> <p>However, Ferrothorn lacks viable recovery options outside of Leech Seed and Leftovers, which can leave it susceptible to being worn down over the course of a battle. Though its typing grants it a whopping nine resistances as well as an immunity, it's left with two fairly significant weaknesses to Fire and Fighting, which are problematic with threats such as Mollux, Volkraken, and Tomohawk being so common. Lastly, Ferrothorn's passive nature can render it setup bait for some dangerous setup sweepers such as Cawmodore, which doesn't take much damage from Gyro Ball or Power Whip and is immune to Thunder Wave due to Volt Absorb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can cripple Pokemon by removing their item, but Ferrothorn has trouble finding a slot for the move. Bulldoze can help Ferrothorn lure and take on Heatran, Magnezone, Mollux, and Plasmanta, hitting them for 4x super effective damage, but again, it's usually not worth the slot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Fire-type coverage</strong>: Ferrothorn's typing makes it incredibly weak to Fire-type Pokemon, leaving it easily forced out by the likes of Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Mollux, Heatran, Pyroak, and Volkraken. Fire-type coverage from Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, Serperior, and Stratagem also poses a severe threat to Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Tomohawk, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, Keldeo, and Revenankh can all threaten Ferrothorn with their strong STAB moves. They can have some trouble switching in to Ferrothorn's status moves and STAB attacks, however, and Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham need to be cautious of Protect when using High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Pyroak and Mega Venusaur can switch in on Leech Seed and strike back with super effective STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt shuts Ferrothorn down, as it won't be able to use Leech Seed, set up entry hazards, or inflict status on the foe.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Cawmodore, Talonflame, Mega Scizor, and Aurumoth can use Ferrothorn as setup fodder due to its passive nature. Cawmodore can easily set up Belly Drum and take out Ferrothorn with a +6 Acrobatics or Drain Punch, as it resists Ferrothorn's STAB moves and doesn't fear Thunder Wave thanks to Volt Absorb. All Talonflame variants pose a threat to Ferrothorn; bulkier variants can Taunt Ferrothorn and wear it down with Will-O-Wisp or set up with Bulk Up while healing off damage with Roost, and offensive variants can opt to simply KO it with Flare Blitz, though Talonflame does take massive recoil damage in the process. Mega Scizor can easily set up Swords Dance on Ferrothorn while healing off damage with Roost. Aurumoth has several potential setup methods and can KO Ferrothorn with a boosted Overheat, Focus Blast, or Close Combat, while only truly fearing Ferrothorn's Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can trap and remove Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire if Ferrothorn is not running Shed Shell.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is a reliable setter of Stealth Rock thanks to its bulk and defensive typing, giving it several opportunities throughout the match to set up the entry hazard. Spikes can also be used in place of or in addition to Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn to capitalize on free turns even further. Leech Seed provides Ferrothorn with a way to wear down defensive Pokemon and grants chip damage against switch-ins. Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's primary method of dishing out damage, as it capitalizes on its low Speed and is helpful for handling Fairy-types, among other faster Pokemon. Power Whip allows Ferrothorn to check Water- and Ground-types much more easily, such as Azumarill, Manaphy, and Colossoil. It also prevents Pokemon like Mega Gyarados from using it as setup fodder. Protect grants Ferrothorn extra turns of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. It can also be used to scout for Hidden Power Fire from foes such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B. Thunder Wave allows Ferrothorn to cripple switch-ins such as Mollux, both Mega Charizard formes, and Heatran. It's useful to prevent boosting Pokemon from using Ferrothorn as setup bait, as long as they aren't immune to the move or carrying Substitute. Toxic can wear down switch-ins such as Pyroak, Cyclohm, and Zapdos. All three of these Pokemon tend to run Fire-type attacks and can heavily threaten Ferrothorn as a result, so putting them on a timer is helpful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 192 Special Defense EVs give Ferrothorn enough special bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining investment and a Relaxed nature go towards Ferrothorn's physical bulk, allowing it to take on physical attackers such as Colossoil more easily. A Relaxed nature also lowers Ferrothorn's Speed, making its Gyro Ball even stronger. An EV spread of 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 SpD can be used to capitalize more on Ferrothorn's physical bulk, avoiding the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Excadrill's Earthquake, while still maintaining many of its capabilities as a mixed wall. Leftovers is the preferred item in most cases, providing Ferrothorn with passive recovery and added longevity so that it has more opportunities to perform its supporting duties throughout the match. At the cost of longevity, Rocky Helmet allows Ferrothorn to punish users of contact moves more aggressively, racking up serious residual damage on them in tandem with Iron Barbs. Shed Shell is also an option, allowing Ferrothorn to escape from trappers like Magnezone. It's a bit less consistently useful than the other two options, though, as it's useless against teams that don't run a trapper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into Pokemon that Ferrothorn can wall, which are usually ones with resisted STAB types such as Krilowatt, Azumarill, and Mega Altaria, or passive Pokemon that Ferrothorn can absorb status from such as Chansey, and set up entry hazards. Try to scout for potential Fire-type coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire and Fire Blast before switching Ferrothorn in on a special or mixed attacker, as it risks being severely damaged by these moves. If your opponent has a Colossoil, there's a chance it could try to bounce back entry hazards with Rebound. Leech Seed can be used to safely scout for Rebound, as Ferrothorn is immune to Leech Seed, or you can simply opt to damage Colossoil heavily with Power Whip or Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish users such as Clefable, Chansey, and Alomomola can greatly extend Ferrothorn's longevity. Fairy-types, especially Fire-resistant ones like Azumarill and Mega Diancie, are able to beat Fighting-type Pokemon and Cyclohm for Ferrothorn. Fire-types can also cover Ferrothorn's weakness to Fire and threaten Pokemon like Mega Scizor that might use Ferrothorn as setup bait. Several setup sweepers fall nicely into this category, such as Mega Charizard X and Talonflame, as they appreciate entry hazards wearing down bulky walls, which Ferrothorn can easily provide. Heatran is a more defensive option that can absorb Fire-type moves with Flash Fire. Ferrothorn, in turn, can cover Water-type attacks aimed at these Pokemon. Water-types, such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Arghonaut, have good defensive synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can take Fire-type attacks easily while Ferrothorn can tank Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at them. Cyclohm can handle several Pokemon Ferrothorn despises, such as Fire-types, Tomohawk, Cawmodore, and Keldeo, and provides Heal Bell support for the team.</p>"

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus-T acts as one of CAP's greatest offensive pivots. It uses Assault Vest and Life Orb sets with great success. Its ability, Regenerator, gives Tornadus-T the recovery it lacks in its movepool, which helps mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness. Being a Flying-type, it's immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which limits its entry hazard vulnerability only to Stealth Rock. It has access to U-turn and Knock Off for utility, as well as a powerful STAB move in Hurricane, which allows it to check common threats such as Tomohawk, Keldeo, Aurumoth, and Pyroak. It sits in a great Speed tier, allowing it to Speed tie with Syclant and outspeed Cawmodore. However, Tornadus-T is held back by Hurricane's low accuracy and its coverage moves, which either cause stat drops or have low accuracy. In addition, it is checked by common Electric-types like Krilowatt, Cyclohm, and Rotom-W. It also has a minor case of four-moveslot syndrome, as it generally wants to run all of its coverage and utility moves. Nevertheless, Tornadus-T is an amazing choice for balanced and offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Tail can OHKO Mega Diancie and 2HKOes Clefable when boosted by Life Orb. Icy Wind can slow down faster foes like Stratagem and Mega Manectric on the switch. It also wears down bulky Ground-types like Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Rain Dance and Tailwind are two good utility moves that Tornadus-T can take advantage of, with the former giving Tornadus-T's Hurricane perfect accuracy and the latter supporting its team with speed control. However, Tomohawk and Fidgit, respectively, can use the moves better, with the former taking advantage of Prankster and the latter taking advantage of Persistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W, Krilowatt, and Cyclohm resist Hurricane and can tank Tornadus-T's attacks besides Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Jirachi can easily take Hurricanes and other Special moves, but they have to watch out for a predicted Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Stratagem, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Diancie, Crucibelle, and Mega Crucibelle can hit hard with their Rock-type STAB moves; however, Tornadus-T can hit them with Focus Blast, Superpower, or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Volkraken, Jirachi, Kitsunoh, and Kyurem-B can outspeed and hit Tornadus-T hard, but they run the risk of switching into Knock Off. Weavile can outspeed and OHKO Tornadus-T with Icicle Crash, but it cannot switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Scizor's Bullet Punch, Mega Metagross's Bullet Punch, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Colossoil's Sucker Punch are common forms of priority that can hurt Tornadus-T and force it to switch.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis ruins Tornadus-T's amazing Speed, while burn and poison compromise Regenerator's effectiveness.</p>",

      "Assault Vest Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is Tornadus-T's most powerful STAB move, but its 70% accuracy can be a huge letdown, unless it is used in rain. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to pivot out, take advantage of Regenerator, gain momentum for its team, and wear down checks. Knock Off removes the foe's item, and removing Leftovers and Eviolite can cripple walls like Slowbro and Chansey, while removing Choice Scarf can slow down threats like Volkraken and Mollux. Heat Wave hits Steel-types that are immune to or resist Fighting-type coverage, such as Kitsunoh, Cawmodore, Scizor, and Mega Metagross. Superpower hits Heatran and Colossoil on their weaker Defense stat; however, the Attack drop prevents Tornadus-T from using the move repeatedly, while the Defense drop makes it more susceptible to physical attacks, especially because Superpower forces Tornadus-T to run a Hasty nature. However, its power is not cut in half in rain, unlike Heat Wave. Focus Blast hits Rotom-W, Cyclohm, Krilowatt, and Naviathan harder than Superpower, and it similarly does not lose power in rain. It has 70% accuracy, though, which makes it unreliable especially because Tornadus-T will have to rely on two 70% accurate moves as its primary attacking options. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes Pokemon with a double Ground-type weakness that would normally give Tornadus-T trouble, including Mollux, Heatran, Crucibelle, and Plasmanta; it also does a decent amount of damage to Cyclohm. However, this is a weak option that should only be considered if the team needs to lure the aforementioned checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regenerator helps Tornadus-T recover while gaining momentum and is why Tornadus-T is so effective. It also lets Tornadus-T recover with an Assault Vest without a draining move. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Tornadus-T's Speed, which allows it to Speed tie with Syclant. Though it lowers the power of U-turn and Knock Off, those moves are used mostly for switching and removing items anyways. However, a Hasty nature should be used if Superpower is chosen. 160 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Keldeo with Hurricane and the 2HKO on Mega Crucibelle with Hidden Power Ground. 96 HP EVs increase Tornadus-T's bulk, allowing it to survive powerful hits from full health, most notably Bullet Punch from +6 Cawmodore and the combination of Hurricane and Nature Power from Life Orb Tomohawk. However, Stealth Rock must be cleared in both situations, and Tornadus-T must switch into Cawmodore before or while it uses Belly Drum. Furthermore, to act as an emergency check to Cawmodore, it must run Heat Wave and a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, in the early-game, Tornadus-T should wear down the opponent's team with Knock Off and U-turn by switching into special attackers like Keldeo, Tomohawk, Heatran, and Aurumoth. It can clean with Hurricane and its coverage moves late-game once its checks have fainted. Generally, Tornadus-T should U-turn when it needs to recover, but it should hard switch if it will be hit with a priority attack. Knocking off a foe's Choice Scarf can allow Tornadus-T to outspeed the Pokemon late-game. At full health with a Timid Nature, it can switch into Cawmodore successfully as long as Stealth Rock is cleared from the field. Whether it has used Belly Drum or not, Cawmodore is OHKOed by Heat Wave and +6 Bullet Punch can't OHKO Tornadus-T. But if rain is in effect, Heat Wave becomes a 2HKO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners, such as Tomohawk and Colossoil, and Defoggers, such as Mega Scizor, Latios, and Skarmory, can clear Stealth Rock off the field, which allows Tornadus-T to take full advantage of Regenerator's recovery. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, Assault Vest Colossoil, and Syclant make for great partners to keep up momentum. Rotom-W and Mega Scizor can tank physical hits with ease and resist Ice-type attacks, Assault Vest Colossoil can absorb Electric and Rock-type attacks, and Syclant can get free switches by absorbing a Rock-type attack with Mountaineer. Teammates like Syclant, Garchomp, Cawmodore, and Mega Diancie appreciate Tornadus-T's Knock Off to remove items, such as Volkraken's Choice Scarf, so they can outspeed it late-game. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, Cyclohm, and Clefable make for great teammates because Tornadus-T cannot survive strong physical attacks. Wallbreakers such as Mega Gardevoir, Choice Specs Volkraken, and Mega Medicham appreciate the momentum and forced switches Tornadus-T creates.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane OHKOes Tomohawk, Pyroak, Mega Venusaur, Keldeo, and +1 Aurumoth and 2HKOes Unaware Clefable, Mega Scizor, and tank Garchomp. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to pivot out and take advantage of Regenerator, which mitigates Life Orb recoil. Knock Off removes foes items like Choice Scarf and Assault Vest, whose holders might otherwise force Tornadus-T out. Taunt can be used to stallbreak and prevent the foe from healing. Superpower finishes off Chansey after Knock Off and Stealth Rock damage and hits Colossoil and Heatran for large amounts of damage. Focus Blast is a good alternative, hitting most threats harder than Superpower such as Rotom-W, Krilowatt, and Cyclohm for great amounts of damage, but running two 70% accurate moves can be risky. Heat Wave is drawback free and hits Cawmodore, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Kitsunoh harder than Superpower or Focus Blast, but it misses out on coverage against Heatran, Rotom-W, Cyclohm, Krilowatt, and Rock-types. Hidden Power Ground is an option if Tornadus-T needs to lure and KO certain threats, as it 2HKOes Crucibelle and Heatran and OHKOes Plasmanta, and if Stealth Rock is on the field, it 2HKOes Cyclohm and OHKOes Mollux. However, it is a subpar option, as Tornadus-T's other moves are much more useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regenerator mitigates the recoil Tornadus-T takes from Life Orb. 76 Attack EVs net a KO on Chansey with the combination of Stealth Rock damage, Knock Off, and Superpower. 252 Speed EVs and a Hasty nature maximize Tornadus-T's Speed, which allows it to Speed tie with Syclant and outpace anything slower. Hasty is used over Timid as not to compromise Superpower's damage output. If not using Superpower, an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature should be used to maximize Tornadus-T's damage output with Hurricane and Focus Blast or Heat Wave. Knock Off and U-turn are used for utility, so Attack EVs aren't needed when not running Superpower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, use U-turn to keep up momentum and Knock Off to cripple foes. Make sure not to use U-turn when below 10% HP, as otherwise Life Orb recoil will knock out Tornadus-T. Later on, use Hurricane and coverage moves to knock out worn-down foes. Even though Tornadus-T has decent bulk and Regenerator, it wants to use Regenerator to heal off Life Orb recoil. Bringing Tornadus-T in with slow U-turn and Volt Switch users can keep it from being worn down easily. Hard switch if Tornadus-T will be hit with a priority attack before U-turn hits and is still useful. Removing a foe's Choice Scarf can allow Tornadus-T to outspeed the Pokemon late-game. Wear down its checks with U-turn and Knock Off until Tornadus-T can break past them with Hurricane or a coverage move; just be wary if it loses its Life Orb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>To take full advantage of Tornadus-T's ability Regenerator, entry hazard removal is mandatory. Colossoil, Tomohawk, Latios, Mega Scizor, and Mollux can fulfill this role. Tornadus-T can form a VoltTurn core with Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, Assault Vest Colossoil, and Syclant. Tornadus-T appreciates teammates that resist its weaknesses: Assault Vest Colossoil can tank Electric- and Rock-type attacks, Rotom-W and Mega Scizor resist Ice-type attacks, and Syclant is immune to Rock-type attacks on the switch-in thanks to Mountaineer. Teammates such as Keldeo, Mega Altaria, Azumarill, and Aurumoth appreciate Tornadus-T's Knock Off to remove an unsuspecting Chansey's Eviolite. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, Cyclohm, and Clefable make for great teammates because Tornadus-T cannot survive strong physical attacks. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Volkraken, Mega Gardevoir, and Kyurem-B appreciate the momentum gained by Tornadus-T, as it can give them a free switch in.</p> <p>This set works particularly well on rain teams, so Politoed and Mega Swampert make for great members of a strong core with Tornadus-T taking out the Grass-type Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur, Necturna, and Serperior, that hurt these two. In return, Mega Swampert can tank the Electric- and Rock-type moves that hurt Tornadus-T and hit hard with strong physical moves.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is a premier offensive Pokemon in the CAP metagame thanks to its powerful combination of high offensive stats and good neutral coverage that allows it to threaten a large portion of the metagame. Keldeo's Water / Fighting typing gives it advantageous matchups against Chansey, Colossoil, and Heatran while also allowing it to switch into the Dark-, Fire-, and Ice-types in the metagame, notably Syclant and Weavile. Keldeo's movepool is small but has all the tools needed to allow it to succeed, including Secret Sword, which gives it the ability to pressure specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey. Most importantly, Keldeo's offensive prowess and versatility allow it to run multiple sets, such as a wallbreaker with Choice Specs and Life Orb; a revenge killer; a cleaner with Choice Scarf; and even a sweeper with Substitute + Calm Mind.</p> <p>However, Keldeo's coverage options can't break through every Pokemon in the metagame, so it will find itself walled by Plasmanta, Mollux, Mega Venusaur, Latios, Latias, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur depending on what Hidden Power it forgoes. It's also threatened by powerful offensive threats such as Talonflame, Aurumoth, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gardevoir. While Choice Specs, Life Orb, and Substitute + Calm Mind sets all sit in a very good Speed tier, they are outsped by common threats such as Kerfluffle, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Mega Crucibelle. However, Choice Scarf can remedy this problem at the cost of some of Keldeo's power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salac Berry can be used with Substitute + Calm Mind to make Keldeo a powerful late-game sweeper but is not very reliable. Hidden Power Flying can help punish Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Necturna, Celebi, and Breloom on the switch in, but it is weak, and Scald, Hydro Pump, or Secret Sword can deal more damage. Hidden Power Bug defeats Celebi and helps against Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, and Slowbro. Hidden Power Electric can be used to deal with bulky Water-types, primarily Gyarados. Taunt can be used to pressure walls like Pyroak and Chansey, and it also helps Keldeo avoid being statused, especially by Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Manaphy, Slowbro, Krilowatt, and Rotom-W are too bulky for unboosted Keldeo to defeat, allowing the former to set up on Keldeo. However, the only Water-type that can switch into Choice Specs-boosted Secret Sword is Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss simply wall Keldeo, and Necturna, Celebi, and Serperior overpower it, although the latter cannot take many Secret Swords from Keldeo. Serperior can also gain Speed boosts from Icy Wind due to Contrary.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable, Kerfluffle, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Azumarill all easily defeat Keldeo with their super effective STAB attacks. However, Mega Diancie, Kerfluffle, and Mega Gardevoir cannot switch into Keldeo, and Mega Altaria also has difficulty due to Icy Wind. Kerfluffle and Mega Diancie also have to watch out for Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Many Flying-types such as Talonflame and Tornadus-T outspeed and defeat Keldeo. Togekiss can survive a hit from Keldeo, use Thunder Wave, and take it down with Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Magnezone, Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus all outspeed and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Keldeo. However, they cannot switch into Keldeo reliably.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Many powerful Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Alakazam, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross outspeed Keldeo and defeat it, while Keldeo can do little in return. Latios and Latias switch in relatively well, although Icy Wind takes a large chunk out of their HP; Mega Latias can take Icy Wind, though. Moreover, most of the aforementioned Psychic-types hate switching in on Scald, especially Jirachi and Metagross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is key for combating walls such as Clefable, Tomohawk, and Jirachi and is the most powerful move on this set. Hydro Pump's greater power is essential in situations where the lower Base Power of Scald is insufficient to KO the foe. Secret Sword is an excellent secondary STAB option that allows Keldeo to hit specially defensive Pokemon such as Colossoil and Chansey as well as Water-resistant Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn. Scald is Keldeo's secondary Water-type STAB move and is used when Keldeo cannot afford to miss Hydro Pump; its burn chance allows Keldeo to wear down Pokemon such as Latios and Ferrothorn, and it is almost always a good move to spam. In the last moveslot, Hidden Power Ground is necessary to get past Mollux and Plasmanta, which resist Secret Sword and are immune to Water. Alternatively, Icy Wind can be used for coverage against Grass-types, such as Necturna, and Dragon-types, such as Latios, Latias, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Timid nature are needed for Keldeo to hit hard and outspeed as much as possible. Choice Specs turns Keldeo into a frightening attacker, allowing it to 2HKO Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Clefable. Life Orb can be used instead to preserve Keldeo's power and ease its matchup against Mollux and Plasmanta, but the recoil wears it down significantly. Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb to avoid recoil and to bluff a Choice item, but Keldeo hits significantly weaker against neutral targets such as Clefable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keldeo should be used to break opposing defensive cores. Life Orb and Expert Belt Keldeo have more freedom, as they are able to fight at any point in the match. If the opponent thinks Keldeo is Choice locked, they might send in a counter like Mollux or Plasmanta, in which case you should use Hidden Power Ground. Scald, unless the foe is immune to it, is generally the safest and most spammable move to use early-game, as a potential burn can wear down counters like Mega Venusaur and physical attackers, making it easier for Keldeo to clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo is good on offensive and balance teams thanks to its type coverage, power, and speed. It cannot fight common Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss as well as faster Pokemon such as Kerfluffle, so Talonflame is a helpful teammate thanks to its powerful priority Flying-type attacks. Since Keldeo is weak to common special attackers such as Serperior, Raikou, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Diancie, specially defensive teammates with Wish or Healing Wish, like Clefable, Jirachi, Latias, and Sylveon, are effective. Ground-types like Colossoil, Garchomp, and Hippowdon help deal with Electric-types. Colossoil also helps Keldeo against Psychic-types, as it can Pursuit trap them. Garchomp and Hippowdon can check Talonflame, set Stealth Rock, and offer Ground-type coverage if Keldeo does not run Hidden Power Ground. Offensive Grass- and Electric-types like Necturna, Serperior, and Plasmanta are helpful because Keldeo has great difficulty handling bulky Water-types, such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Slowbro. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Colossoil, Bisharp, Scizor, and Mega Metagross are great for removing bulky Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Starmie, Latios, and Latias, that wall Keldeo.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald's burn chance makes Keldeo annoying and cleans up the opposition late-game thanks to its accuracy. Secret Sword provides Fighting-type coverage and hits specially defensive Pokemon harder than Hydro Pump or Scald. Hydro Pump deals more damage to foes if you prefer higher damage output; it is especially helpful against Aurumoth and Mega Charizard X (both of which Keldeo outspeeds even after they set up), Mega Charizard Y, Mega Crucibelle, and Gliscor. Hidden Power Ground eliminates Mollux and Plasmanta, while Icy Wind slows down foes and targets switch-ins like Mega Altaria and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Keldeo's Speed and damage output. Choice Scarf allows Keldeo to outspeed more foes, several of which would defeat it otherwise, making it a check to Cawmodore, +1 Mega Charizard X, and Kerfluffle. A Timid nature allows Keldeo to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including Choice Scarf users like Volkraken and Crucibelle. While Modest provides more power, it makes Keldeo lose to Jolly Mega Charizard X and Naviathan after one Dragon Dance. It would also be slower than Choice Scarf base 95+ maximum Speed Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Kyurem-B.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keldeo is most effective late-game when its switch-ins have been worn down, allowing it to clean up with Secret Sword and Scald. Early- and mid-game, Keldeo should be used to revenge kill foes, such as Cawmodore, Mega Charizard X, and Crucibelle, with Hydro Pump, Icy Wind, or Hidden Power Ground. If used early-game, Keldeo should be wary of the foe switching and should not allow it to set up. Scald is the safest option early-game, as its burn on a switch-in allows Keldeo to have an easier time late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keldeo works best on hyper offense and balance teams to stop Pokemon like Heatran and Colossoil; therefore, Gengar, Mega Manectric, Mega Gardevoir, Kitsunoh, and Latios are good partners. As many Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types defeat Keldeo, Mega Metagross is a helpful partner. Ground-type teammates like Hippowdon, Colossoil, and Excadrill are very helpful for dealing with Electric-types, Mollux, and Plasmanta. Keldeo struggles with bulky Water-types, so Grass- and Electric-type teammates like Mega Venusaur and Plasmanta are very important.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald's burn chance helps Keldeo stick around longer against physical attackers that would bypass its Special Defense boosts; its low Base Power is offset by Calm Mind. Secret Sword provides great Fighting-type coverage and prevents Chansey from stopping Keldeo's sweep. Hidden Power Ground keeps Keldeo from being stopped cold by Mollux and Plasmanta. Substitute allows Keldeo to set up on Pokemon such as defensive Mega Scizor and specially defensive Jirachi more easily and avoid status from defensive Pokemon, allowing it to build up more boosts. Calm Mind increases Keldeo's longevity and power, letting it sweep effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature allows Keldeo to outspeed more foes, such as Gliscor, non-Choice Scarf Volkraken, and Kyurem-B. The EV spread allows Keldeo to outspeed slower Pokemon and deal a lot of damage. Life Orb gives Keldeo a considerable damage boost, which helps it handle Pokemon before a Calm Mind boost; it should be used when running Hidden Power Ground. Alternatively, Leftovers increases Keldeo's ability to create more Substitutes and mitigates residual damage, notably against more defensive teams that rely on such damage to pressure Keldeo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keldeo is helpful on hyper offense and balance teams to stop foes with Calm Mind and with its STAB coverage. Keldeo should set up Calm Mind late-game after its checks and counters are sufficiently weakened. Early-game, Keldeo should be fulfilling an offensive role to wear down the opposing team with Scald. Take opportunities to set up Substitute, as it is a necessity for combating faster Pokemon and makes it safer to use Calm Mind; Scald and Substitute should be used on passive Pokemon like Chansey, non-Giga Drain Pyroak, and non-Encore Fidgit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Keldeo struggles with bulky Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Fairy-types, Mega Venusaur is an effective teammate thanks to its defensive typing and STAB Grass- and Poison-type attacks. Unaware Clefable stops Pokemon that set up on Keldeo and can use Stealth Rock to stop Talonflame. In addition, it can pass Wishes to Keldeo to help it live longer and can use Heal Bell if it is statused. Ground-types like Garchomp, Colossoil, and Gliscor are vital teammates for this set, as various Electric-types, such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus, are threatening. Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Colossoil are excellent for removing Mollux, which annoys Substitute variants of this set. Unaware Clefable, commonly seen on stall teams, obliterates Keldeo, meaning Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Heatran; Poison-types like Gengar and Mollux; and Fire-types like Heatran and Pyroak are great partners. Flying-types like Talonflame and Tornadus-T are helpful for removing Grass-types like Serperior, Venusaur, Necturna, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss.</p>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "overview": "<p>Talonflame is one of the premier revenge killers in the CAP Metagame, as its access to Gale Wings gives it the most powerful priority move in the game in Brave Bird, along with priority Roost and Tailwind. This, along with a fantastic base 126 Speed that allows it to outspeed a vast majority of the metagame and an excellent offensive STAB combination in Fire and Flying, makes Talonflame a potent offensive Pokemon. Its access to good support moves, such as Swords Dance, Bulk Up, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp, gives it utility outside of pure revenge killing and adds a layer of unpredictability to Talonflame. It also has good resistances to Steel, Bug, Fire, and Fairy, and an immunity to Ground, which gives Talonflame ample opportunities to switch in against Pokemon such as Pyroak, Sylveon, and Heatran.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Talonflame's 81 base Attack is quite low for an offensive Pokemon, so Talonflame must use boosting items or moves to hit hard. 78 / 71 / 69 defenses are below average, leaving Talonflame weak to strong attackers. Its weaknesses to common offensive types, such Water, Electric, and Rock, leave it checked by common offensive Pokemon. The Rock weakness, in particular, leaves Talonflame doubly weak to Stealth Rock, severely hampering its longevity, especially as its best STAB moves result in recoil. Furthermore, it has massive problems getting past traditional Flying checks, such as Rotom-W and Cyclohm, and is unable to function well until they are removed, requiring dedicated team support to perform.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Natural Gift, in conjunction with Swords Dance and either Liechi or Apicot Berry, can be used to knock out or weaken some of Talonflame's checks and counters lured in. Liechi Berry will hit Rotom-W, Krilowatt, and Stratagem with a 100-Base Power Grass-type move, while Apicot Berry will hit Heatran and Cyclohm with a 100-Base Power Ground-type move. Unfortunately, all five of these Pokemon are popular checks to Talonflame, so it will never be able to get past them all with a single berry. Also, Cyclohm can take a +2 Nature Gift and KO back with its Electric-type STAB move. A stallbreaking set with Brave Bird, Roost, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp could be used.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Any Electric-type that can tank a Flare Blitz can easily check Talonflame. Cyclohm, Rotom-W, and Krilowatt are some of Talonflame's most reliable checks; Cyclohm in particular can take anything Talonflame can throw at it and KO back with its Electric-type STAB move. Mega Manectric, Zapdos, and Plasmanta can also check Talonflame, but must watch out for Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Most Rock-types can take any of Talonflame's moves save for Steel Wing and KO back with their STAB moves. Stratagem doesn't enjoy switching into Talonflame but can easily revenge kill it. Mega Diancie can also check any Talonflame set lacking Steel Wing.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types, such as Mega Slowbro or Suicune, can take a Brave Bird and KO Talonflame with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can take any attack from Talonflame, bar an Apicot Berry Natural Gift, and can proceed to set up Stealth Rock or cripple it with Toxic or Roar. Heatran lacking Ancient Power or Stone Edge will have to be wary of Taunt sets, though, as it will be unable to beat Talonflame if Taunted.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp can all serve as answers to Talonflame. Landorus-T lowers Talonflame's Attack with Intimidate and threatens it with Stone Edge. Hippowdon is bulky enough to stomach Talonflame's attacks, can heal off damage done with Slack Off, and proceed to phaze it out with Whirlwind or threaten it with Stone Edge. Garchomp, especially Rocky Helmet variants, can rack up a lot of residual damage on Talonflame thanks to Rough Skin. None of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon That Resist Flying</strong>: Faster Pokemon that resist Talonflame's Flying-type STAB moves, such as Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf Excadrill and Sand Rush Excadrill under sand will be able to take a Brave Bird or Acrobatics and KO Talonflame, although Mega Manectric and Excadrill have to watch out for Flare Blitz on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As both of Talonflame's main STAB attacks induce recoil and Talonflame loses half its health to Stealth Rock upon switching in, Talonflame will often be knocked out from residual damage. This is especially true for sets without Roost, as they will be unable to recover HP.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Talonflame to quickly boost its Attack and power through teams with its Gale Wings Flying-type STAB move. Brave Bird is the preferred option here, as the extra damage it gains from the ability to run a boosting item is greatly appreciated, as this set is more concerned with damage output than longevity. Acrobatics is an option if recoil damage is a concern, but gives up the power from a boosting item. Flare Blitz is crucial for getting past Steel-types, such as Mega Metagross and Cawmodore, and Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Plasmanta, that would otherwise wall Talonflame. Roost allows Talonflame to heal off both entry hazard and recoil damage, while easing setup against Pokemon such Sylveon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The recommended EV spread uses a Jolly nature to allow Talonflame to outspeed Cawmodore, which can otherwise beat Talonflame if boosted, while giving Talonflame as much power as possible. 64 EVs in Defense allows Talonflame to avoid the OHKO from Cawmodore's +6 Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature gives Talonflame as much power as possible while allowing it to outspeed fully invested positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon. Gale Wings provides Talonflame with a reliable priority move in Brave Bird, allowing it to get past revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Keldeo. Sharp Beak boosts Brave Bird without causing additional recoil damage and allows Talonflame to bluff a Choice Band set. If Talonflame is using Acrobatics, it is forced to run no item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set if you want an effective setup sweeper that can still function well as a revenge killer, as it will hit hard without a boost. This Talonflame can't break through stall effectively due to lack of Taunt or Will-O-Wisp to get past walls. Fortunately, this set will be able to sweep offensive teams easily, as it will hit hard after one boost and can function as a revenge killer even without any boosts due to investment in Attack. Try to play conservatively with this set, as switching Talonflame into neutral attacks or entry hazards repeatedly will compromise its bulk and ability to set up. Try to bring it in on resisted hits or off a free switch, preferably with Stealth Rock off your side of the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame absolutely needs Rapid Spin or Defog to function, so any reliable user of these moves is appreciated. Colossoil makes for a great partner, as it can provide Rapid Spin support and beat the majority of the Electric- or Fire-type Pokemon that wall Talonflame. Pokemon that can get past Cyclohm, Stratagem, Rotom-W, and any other Pokemon that can take Fire- and Flying-type attacks are a must, as Talonflame will be unable to sweep if they are still in play. Other powerful Flying-types, such as Tomohawk, Mega Pinsir, and Cawmodore, can help wear down each other's checks. Tomohawk can severely weaken Cyclohm and Rotom-W with Aura Sphere, Mega Pinsir can severely weaken teams after a Swords Dance boost, and Cawmodore can blow past some of its checks after some prior damage from Talonflame. Pokemon such as Syclant, Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Keldeo make good partners with Talonflame, as they are able to handle many of the bulky Ground-types Talonflame has trouble with, mainly Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up allows Talonflame to set up on physical attackers, as it turns Talonflame's mediocre physical bulk into something substantial after several boosts. It also eases setup versus Foul Play users, as Foul Play can only 3HKO Talonflame at any given time. Roost allows Talonflame to heal off any damage taken. Acrobatics is the preferred attacking option, as it provides a high-Base Power STAB move while not inducing recoil damage, and the power difference between Acrobatics and Brave Bird is negligible after several boosts. Unfortunately, Acrobatics forces Talonflame to forgo the passive recovery of Leftovers, but it allows Talonflame to handle Knock Off more easily. Acrobatics receives priority from Gale Wings; this is allows Talonflame to hit would-be revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Keldeo. Brave Bird is an option if the passive recovery from Leftovers is a must, such as on sand teams, but the induced recoil from Brave Bird severely hampers Talonflame's ability to sweep and necessitates the use of Roost after knocking out high-HP targets such as Chansey, Pyroak, and Colossoil. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, with each one easing Talonflame's setup. Taunt allows Talonflame to safely set up on most walls, protecting it from status, phazing, and opposing Taunts. It also allows Talonflame to turn one of its would-be checks, Heatran, into setup bait, and is useful from preventing entry hazards from being set up. Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to augment its uninvested physical bulk by burning physical attackers, but it must be careful burning Guts users such as Colossoil. Will-O-Wisp also has less utility against Fire-types and Magic Guard users such as Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs along with a Calm nature give Talonflame the most special bulk possible and allows it to set up on powerful resisted attacks such as Hyper Voices from Sylveon or Mega Altaria and Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y. This is especially important given that Talonflame can use Bulk Up or Will-O-Wisp to shore up its weaker Defense. Gale Wings gives Acrobatics, Brave Bird, and Roost priority. No item is necessary for the use of Acrobatics, but Leftovers can be used with Brave Bird for passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Talonflame set is not meant to act as a powerful revenge killer like the Choice Band set or a sweeper like the Swords Dance set, but as a bulkier win condition that can take advantage of stall. Be careful when switching into physical attackers, as Talonflame's Defense is weak without any boosts, so try to set up on weak special threats before you face physical attackers. This set is notable because it can set up on a large number of Pokemon with ease, only fearing super effective attacks or very powerful physical attacks. For example, Talonflame can easily set up on any Sylveon set, and sets with Taunt can set up on Pyroak, Chansey, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame will have trouble setting up if it loses half its health upon switching in, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is essential. Ground-types, such as Colossoil and Landorus-T, make for great teammates, as they can reliably beat the Electric-types that prevent Talonflame from sweeping. Electric- and Grass-types, such as Cyclohm and Mega Venusaur, can also break through the Water-types that can check Talonflame, such as Rotom-W and Keldeo.   Pokemon such as Syclant, Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Keldeo make good  partners with Talonflame, as they are able to handle many of the bulky  Ground-types Talonflame has trouble with, mainly Garchomp, Landorus-T,  and Hippowdon.</p>"
      },
      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is given priority by Gale Wings to give Talonflame the hardest-hitting priority move in the tier and give this set its revenge killing abilities. Flare Blitz is Talonflame's strongest secondary STAB option that allows it to power through most Electric- and Steel-types. U-turn takes advantage of Talonflame's high Speed to switch out of a predicted check, scout early-game, and land a solid hit on Tyranitar. In the last moveslot, Talonflame can opt for Steel Wing in order to deal heavy damage to Mega Diancie and Stratagem, which would otherwise be able to switch into anything Talonflame has and KO it with their chosen Rock-type STAB move. Tailwind is also an option as a sacrificial move, allowing Talonflame to support its team before it is knocked out. This can allow heavy-hitting Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir or Mega Metagross to have a chance to sweep. Alternatively, Roost can be used to offset Stealth Rock and recoil damage, but requires Talonflame to forgo a Choice Band.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The recommended EV spread uses an Adamant nature to give Talonflame as much power as possible, while allowing it to outspeed fully invested positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon. Alternatively, a spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe uses a Jolly nature to allow Talonflame to outspeed Cawmodore, which can otherwise beat it if boosted, while giving Talonflame as much power as possible. 64 EVs in HP help mitigate recoil damage. Gale Wings gives Talonflame access to priority Brave Bird, Tailwind, and Roost, which gives Talonflame its niche as a revenge killer. Choice Band gives Brave Bird the highest damage output possible and helps shore up Talonflame's lackluster base 81 Attack. Sharp Beak can also be used to bluff a Choice Band while still boosting Brave Bird without increasing the amount of recoil damage Talonflame takes, but gives a weaker boost then Choice Band.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Talonflame on any team that needs a solid check to setup sweepers, such as Aurumoth, Mega Scizor, Cawmodore, and Mega Pinsir. Talonflame is best used conservatively, as its weakness to Stealth Rock and reliance on recoil moves can cause it to be worn down quickly. It is best used to scout early-game with U-turn, then clean up weakened teams late-game or revenge kill threatening sweepers mid-game. Try to avoid switching Talonflame into super effective or neutral attacks, as its less-than-stellar defenses will allow it to be worn down easily, which will diminish its revenge killing ability. It also pays to be careful spamming any attacks with Talonflame if Cyclohm is still alive; it's generally better to switch out of the predicted Cyclohm switch-in instead of potentially activating Static.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame absolutely needs Rapid Spin or Defog to function, so any reliable user of these moves is appreciated. Colossoil makes for a great partner, as it can provide Rapid Spin support and beat the majority of the Electric- or Fire-type Pokemon that wall Talonflame. Other users of U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Rotom-W or Scizor, work well with Talonflame, as they can form VoltTurn cores. Talonflame also appreciates Stealth Rock support, as it allows Talonflame to ensure an OHKO on Pokemon such as Mollux, so Pokemon that can reliable set up Stealth Rock, such as Tomohawk, are appreciated. Other powerful Flying-types, such as Tomohawk, Mega Pinsir, and Cawmodore, can help wear down each other's checks to sweep. Tomohawk can severely weaken Cyclohm and Rotom-W with Aura Sphere, Mega Pinsir can severely weaken teams after a Swords Dance boost, and Cawmodore can blow past some of its checks after some prior damage from Talonflame. Pokemon such as Syclant, Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Keldeo make good partners with Talonflame, as they are able to handle many of the bulky  Ground-types Talonflame has trouble with, mainly Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie has one of the best offensive typings in the CAP metagame and is commonly seen taking advantage of its high offensive stats, gaining a boost of 60 to both its base Attack and Special Attack when it Mega Evolves. This makes Mega Diancie capable of running a mixed set rather than a fully physical or special one. In addition to its amazing typing and offensive stats, it has an outstanding movepool, with amazing STAB moves such as Diamond Storm and Moonblast and Earth Power to hit Steel-types. Furthermore, Mega Diancie also has some excellent setup moves, most notably Rock Polish, which allows it to outspeed common weather sweepers after a single use.</p> <p>One of Mega Diancie's main drawbacks is its terrible HP stat. While Diancie does have incredible Defense and Special Defense, its HP, in a way, negates those stats. In addition, it has an awful base 50 Speed before Mega Evolving. Furthermore, its typing is pretty mediocre defensively, with a quadruple weakness to Steel as well as weaknesses to Water, Ground, and Grass, limiting the number of Pokemon that Diancie can actually switch into and making it more susceptible to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set can shut down balanced teams if used correctly, but with threats like Syclant, Choice Scarf Volkraken, Scizor, and Ferrothorn lying around, sweeping is a lot harder. Psychic can be used over Protect on the all-out attacker set to hit Mega Venusaur for super effective damage. However, Hidden Power Fire is a more viable coverage move to run most of the time. Heal Bell can be used for team support, however Pokemon such as Cyclohm and Chansey fit the role better because Mega Diancie's other moves, such as its STAB attacks, are more useful. Mega Diancie forces switches pretty well, so it can use Stealth Rock to get entry hazards up easily. Sharpen 2HKOes Chansey, one of its usual counters, with +1 Diamond Storm. Magnet Rise can be used to handle Pokemon that rely on their Ground-type coverage to beat Mega Diancie such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Colossoil, and Garchomp. A regular Diancie set with Stealth Rock and Trick Room is usable, but Fidgit outclasses that set in both aspects.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, and specially defensive Skarmory can check Mega Diancie with a Steel-type STAB move and fully wall non-Hidden Power Fire variants. In addition, Mega Metagross and Cawmodore both threaten Mega Diancie with their Steel STAB moves, and Cawmodore uses non-Hidden Power Fire sets as setup bait. Specially defensive Jirachi walls the all-out-attacker set completely, and offensive sets can take one Earth Power and OHKO Mega Diancie regardless of its Attack investment. Additionally, some non-Steel-types are known to run Steel-type coverage moves, such as Mega Medicham with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Because Mega Diancie is so frail, all viable Water-type Pokemon such as Krilowatt, Choice Scarf Volkraken, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can easily OHKO Mega Diancie with their STAB moves. However, do know that all Pokemon mentioned except Azumarill get OHKOed or 2HKOed by one of Mega Diancie's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Sand Rush and bulky Excadrill, Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T all check and are able to heavily damage if not OHKO Mega Diancie with their STAB moves. However, Rash variants of Mega Diancie either OHKO or 2HKO all of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Necturna, Celebi, and Serperior all check Mega Diancie, being able to OHKO it with their STAB moves. However, most variants of Necturna do get 2HKOed by Moonblast. In addition, Mega Venusaur does have to be cautious of Psychic variants.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Eviolite Chansey can take every notable move Mega Diancie carries and can counter it by recovering off damage with Soft-Boiled and hitting it with Seismic Toss. However, Diamond Storm 2HKOes Chansey if its Eviolite has been removed. Mega Diancie also can get past Chansey with Sharpen.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is arguably Mega Diancie's best STAB move because Fairy is such a fantastic type in the CAP metagame. Diamond Storm picks up KOs against Flying-type Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Pidgeot, and Talonflame. It also hurts Fire-types such as Mollux, Pyroak, and Volkraken. Earth Power and Moonblast form an extraordinary pair of moves, as they cover so much of the tier. Moonblast is used to take down Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Cyclohm, Tomohawk, and Colossoil, and Earth Power hits all the types that resist Fairy for super effective damage. Some Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon that Earth Power KOes are Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta. Finally, Protect is run to safely Mega Evolve and obtain the resulting Speed boost. It's also used to scout what move opposing Choice item users ultimately lock themselves into. On the other hand, because of how predictable Protect is, Hidden Power Fire can be run instead, making this set a more deadly all-out attacker. Hidden Power Fire can also be used over Earth Power, though, Mega Diancie needs both of its STAB moves to fill its niche. Mega Diancie lures bulky Steel-types in such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, which it can 2HKO with Hidden Power Fire on the switch. Because its STAB moves are necessary, Hidden Power Fire could be used over Earth Power or Protect. However, losing that one Speed IV will cause Mega Diancie to lose out in Speed ties with other base 110 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs increase Mega Diancie's damage output. Mega Diancie should run maximum Speed EVs and a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion. A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty to prevent Mega Diancie from taking more damage from physical attacks, especially priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Colossoil's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If running Protect over Hidden Power Fire, it's usually recommended to lead with Diancie to obtain Magic Bounce and the Speed boost. Protect should be used to let Diancie Mega Evolve safely, allowing it to attack next turn with its higher Speed stat. However, it might also let the foe to setup for free, so try to judge if the opponent's Pokemon has any setup moves. If Mega Diancie has Hidden Power Fire over Protect, Mega Evolve against a foe that it has a good matchup against, such as Cyclohm, Talonflame, or Mega Sableye. Furthermore, try to predict the Steel-types that normally check Mega Diancie and KO them with Hidden Power Fire. In addition, because Mega Diancie is very frail, don't switch it into any Pokemon that might be able to hit it with a super effective move. Only switch Mega Diancie in on a favorable matchup. Some Pokemon that Mega Diancie can switch into safely are Talonflame, Mew, and Sableye.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp is a great teammate for Mega Diancie, taking on its checks such as Scizor and Ferrothorn comfortably. Mega Diancie can't hit Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for an ample amount of damage without Hidden Power Fire, so Magnezone is the perfect partner, as it can use its Magnet Pull ability to trap several Steel-types and harm them with Hidden Power Fire. However, while Magnezone can trap Steel-type Pokemon for Mega Diancie, Shed Shell is often used on Steel-Types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn to prevent them from being trapped by Magnet Pull. Colossoil, being able to lure those Pokemon in, can remove their Shed Shells with Knock Off and also baits in bulky Steel-types to bring in Magnezone with U-turn. Colossoil also U-turns on the predicted Tomohawk switch so Mega Diancie will get a good matchup and be able to heavily damage a foe.</p> <p>Another potential core is Mega Diancie + Talonflame. The threats that Mega Diancie has trouble with are primarily Steel-types, which are taken care of by Swords Dance Talonflame. Furthermore, Mega Diancie can take care of Talonflame's checks, such as Cyclohm and defensive Garchomp. Steel-type checks such as Cyclohm, Mollux, Heatran, and Volkraken are also great Mega Diancie partners.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish doubles Mega Diancie's Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed the majority of the metagame, including weather sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, Tornadus-T, and Excadrill. Moonblast is Mega Diancie's most optimal STAB move, allowing it to KO Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types such as Mega Altaria, Cyclohm, Sableye, Keldeo, and Tomohawk. Diamond Storm OHKOes common threats such as Talonflame, Mollux, Mega Pinsir, Syclant, and both Mega Charizard Evolutions. It also 2HKOes Pyroak as well as Aurumoth. Earth Power is used to hit Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon that resist Moonblast, such as Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta. Hidden Power Fire can also be run on Mega Diancie to get past Ferrothorn and lure in Scizor. However, running this over Earth Power will give up some power on against Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Rash Nature maximizes Mega Diancie's special damage output. 192 Speed EVs are specifically to outspeed Jolly Sand Rush Excadrill, the fastest weather sweeper in the game, and Mega Diancie almost always will OHKO it with an Earth Power. There are 64 Speed EVs left, which should be put into HP because Mega Diancie doesn't necessarily need Attack investment to OHKO Fire- and Flying-types with Diamond Storm. Finally, it is not recommended to run a Speed-boosting nature due to Rock Polish boosting Mega Diancie's Speed to the necessary levels.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is not recommended set up Rock Polish right away due to the prevalence of Bullet Punch users and common Pokemon that wall Mega Diancie indefinitely. Early-game, Mega Diancie can soften up walls such as Ferrothorn, Pyroak, and Tomohawk, but it's certainly not an early-game sweeper. Wait until all of Mega Diancie's checks and counters are gone or weakened, and then use Rock Polish to clean up late-game. When playing offensive teams that have no priority and rely on speed to beat Mega Diancie, Rock Polish can be used to end them. Pick the right Pokemon to set up on with Mega Diancie, such as Revanankh, Mew, or Sableye. Try to find a way to Mega Evolve and boost on the same turn, usually against a slower Pokemon Mega Diancie can easily knock out. Finally, due to Mega Diancie's frailty, playing it safe is the best way to use it, especially when it's the wincon in a game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Diancie + Talonflame is a well known hyper offense core because Mega Diancie primarily has trouble with Steel-types, which are taken care of by Swords Dance Talonflame. Furthermore, Mega Diancie can take care of Talonflame's checks, such as Cyclohm and defensive Garchomp. Celebi Baton Passing Nasty Plot boosts to a Rock Polish Diancie can make it very threatening, because an Earth Power OHKOes Mega Metagross at +2; just be careful of Bullet Punch. Furthermore, Celebi resists Ground- and Water-type attacks, two of Mega Diancie's weaknesses. In addition, Steel-type checks are necessary so that Mega Diancie can be preserved until all of its checks are gone and can sweep late-game. Good options are Mollux, Heatran, Volkraken, and Cyclohm. Lastly, with its Magnet Pull ability, Magnezone can trap many Steel-types and harm them with Hidden Power Fire, enabling Mega Diancie to have an easier time cleaning up the opponent's team. However, while Magnezone can trap Steel-type Pokemon for Mega Diancie, Shed Shell is an item Steel-types tend to run, preventing Magnezone from trapping them reliably. Notable Shed Shell users are Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Tomohawk": {
    "overview": "<p>Tomohawk is a heavily dominant and defining force in the CAP metagame thanks to its offensive, defensive, and supporting capabilities. Its versatility is nearly unmatched, as its unique combination of traits allows it to fit onto almost any conceivable team archetype. A big part of Tomohawk's effectiveness stems from its excellent ability Prankster, which works quite well with its supporting movepool that includes moves such as Stealth Rock, Haze, Reflect, and Healing Wish. Having access to priority Roost is also helpful, greatly increasing its staying power and defensive presence. Prankster also provides Nature Power with priority, which is useful for offensive sets. Tomohawk possesses powerful STAB moves in Hurricane and Aura Sphere, as well as useful coverage in Earth Power, allowing it to take advantage of its base 115 Special Attack stat and pose a serious offensive threat. Tomohawk's Flying / Fighting typing in tandem with reliable recovery makes it a hard stop to threats like Colossoil, Landorus-T, Bisharp, and Tyranitar, and priority Haze allows it to act as an emergency check to virtually any setup sweeper lacking super effective priority. However, its typing leaves it with several exploitable weaknesses to Electric-, Fairy-, Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-type attacks, which make it vulnerable to several common threats including Mega Altaria, Mega Diancie, Talonflame, Aurumoth, Azumarill, Clefable, Alakazam, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt allows Tomohawk to prevent opposing Pokemon from healing or setting up on it, turning it into an effective stallbreaker. Tomohawk also makes for an effective user of Baton Pass. It can pass any of Substitute, Bulk Up, and Work Up to its teammates, or it can simply opt to run Baton Pass without any of these moves for the sole purpose of maintaining momentum on forced switches. Memento is an option on offensive teams to provide one of Tomohawk's teammates with a much easier chance to set up. Substitute + Toxic is an option for stalling out foes, but the prominence of Pokemon with Pixilate + Hyper Voice make this a somewhat unreliable strategy. Whirlwind may be used to phaze opposing setup sweepers as well as rack up entry hazard damage; however, Prankster Haze is usually much more reliable for stopping opposing setup sweepers. A specially defensive set can stop opposing Electric- and Ice-types much more easily, as priority Roost can remove Tomohawk's weaknesses to these typings before they can harm it, though Tomohawk is still vulnerable to powerful Fairy- and Flying-types such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Tornadus-T. Tomohawk can also function as a reliable sun setter with Heat Rock + Sunny Day. Heat Wave provides alternative coverage against Steel-types, can be boosted by sun, and hits Mega Scizor for massive damage, though Aura Sphere and Earth Power usually provide better coverage in other cases. Yawn can threaten to put a foe to sleep and force it to switch out, which works particularly well on entry hazard-stacking teams. Intimidate allows Tomohawk to check physical attackers such as Mega Swampert more easily, but the priority to utility moves provided by Prankster is usually too useful to give up. Focus Blast provides Tomohawk with a much stronger Fighting-type STAB move; with Life Orb, it has a decent chance to OHKO Rotom-W after Stealth Rock damage. However, Aura Sphere is almost almost the superior option due to its reliability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Sylveon all pose a serious threat to Tomohawk with their STAB attacks. Life Orb Tomohawk isn't easy for them to switch into, however, as they all take considerable damage from Hurricane or, in Mega Diancie's case, Earth Power. Bulky variants of Sylveon are able to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Tomohawk's Hurricane, making them the most reliable switch-in out of the Fairy-types listed.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T and Mega Pidgeot can deal massive damage to Tomohawk with Hurricane. Setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame can hit Tomohawk with boosted priority attacks before it can use Haze, making it extremely difficult or impossible for Tomohawk to stop them. They generally function as revenge killers to Tomohawk, especially Mega Pinsir, as they don't appreciate switching in on its attacks repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mega Alakazam, Aurumoth, Hoopa-U, Latias, Latios, and Starmie can all serve as offensive checks to Tomohawk and deal massive damage with their STAB moves. Illusion Aurumoth is particularly threatening, as it can lure Tomohawk by disguising itself as a Pokemon that Tomohawk walls and proceed to KO it with its Psychic STAB move of choice.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Faster Electric-types, such as Mega Manectric, Krilowatt, Plasmanta, Raikou, and Thundurus can all serve as great offensive checks to Tomohawk; they just can't be directly switched into Earth Power. Bulky Electric-types such as Cyclohm, Rotom-W, and Zapdos can all serve as good defensive checks, though Cyclohm must be wary of Earth Power, and Rotom-W risks being 2HKOed by Life Orb Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem-B and Syclant are excellent offensive checks to Tomohawk, as they can OHKO it with Ice Beam. However, they are generally limited to revenge killing Tomohawk, as they can't switch into it very easily.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is mandatory on any defensive Tomohawk set; it provides Tomohawk with priority recovery thanks to Prankster, allowing it to check physical threats throughout the match and continually perform its supporting duties. Air Slash is Tomohawk's preferred STAB option due to its reliability, allowing it to hit Mega Venusaur, Pyroak, and opposing Tomohawk super effectively. Hurricane may be used in place of Air Slash, allowing Tomohawk to deal heavier damage to its switch-ins such as Mega Gardevoir, though its lower 70% accuracy is a significant drawback.</p> <p>The remaining moveslots are dependent on what type of support Tomohawk is required to provide for the team. Haze allows Tomohawk to stop setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Scizor in their tracks while also letting Tomohawk serve as an emergency check to setup sweepers that hit it super effectively, including Aurumoth, Mega Altaria, and Cawmodore, if the situation calls for it. However, if your team is capable of handling setup sweepers without Tomohawk's support, another offensive move may be used instead, giving Tomohawk a stronger offensive presence while maintaining its incredible durability. Earth Power is a prime choice for this, as it provides great coverage alongside Tomohawk's Flying STAB move, discouraging Electric-types like Cyclohm and Plasmanta from switching into it while also hitting Crucibelle, Heatran, Jirachi, and Mollux super effectively. Aura Sphere may also be used here, as it provides Tomohawk with a secondary STAB option, allowing it to hit Ferrothorn super effectively and Rotom-W neutrally, though it doesn't provide quite as much coverage alongside its Flying-type STAB move as Earth Power.</p> <p>Tomohawk is a reliable user of Stealth Rock, as it has the bulk and longevity to set up the entry hazard many times throughout the course of the match. Being able to set up Stealth Rock safely against the metagame's most prominent Rapid Spin user, Colossoil, helps it tremendously in this regard. If Tomohawk isn't needed to set up Stealth Rock, it can be used as an entry hazard remover instead with Rapid Spin. Tomohawk's ability to pressure certain Ghost-types such as Necturna and Revenankh helps prevent them from spinblocking safely, increasing Tomohawk's effectiveness as a spinner. Reflect is also a viable support option; not only does it provide Tomohawk's teammates with a cushion against physical blows, it also increases Tomohawk's defensive capabilities dramatically. With Reflect up, Tomohawk is only 3HKOed by physical attackers such as Mega Altaria and Mega Metagross, allowing it to wear them down with Rocky Helmet damage while safely healing itself with priority Roost. Tomohawk can even tank super effective STAB-boosted hits from some of the metagame's most powerful wallbreakers if Reflect is up, including Mega Medicham and Azumarill. It has great synergy with Haze, as the combination enables Tomohawk to wall a vast array of setup sweepers.</p> <p>Though the slashes shown on the moveset might insinuate otherwise, there are several other viable move combinations Tomohawk can run, as it's entirely dependent on what support Tomohawk is required to provide for your team. For example, if you need a Pokemon that can both set and remove entry hazards, Tomohawk can run Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin on the same set. Tomohawk can even run a set with no attacks to maximize its support capabilities, though a lack of attacking options can prove detrimental in end-game situations.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in both HP and Defense alongside a Bold nature maximize Tomohawk's physical bulk. Leftovers provides Tomohawk with passive recovery, increasing its longevity even further. At the cost of longevity, Rocky Helmet may be used instead to punish physical attackers more aggressively, and it is the optimal choice on sets with Reflect. For teams that rely on Tomohawk to sponge Knock Off from the likes of Colossoil and Bisharp, it's also the preferred choice over Leftovers. Prankster gives priority to all of Tomohawk's non-attacking moves, making it an effective supporter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tomohawk walls a wide variety of physical attackers such Colossoil, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Bisharp, so switch it into these Pokemon throughout the match. From there, Tomohawk can wear them down by attacking while keeping itself healthy with Roost. However, Tomohawk will often force these Pokemon to switch out, so take advantage of the opportunity to use a support move such as Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin. If Tomohawk is running Haze and you suspect it will be required to stop a specific setup sweeper during the match, keeping Tomohawk alive (and preferably healthy) should be a top priority so that it can take advantage of priority Haze when the time comes. For example, if Tomohawk is needed to remove a Belly Drum boost from Cawmodore, it must be kept above 45% health to survive a +6 Bullet Punch, as Tomohawk won't be able to prevent Cawmodore from sweeping otherwise. If using Reflect, Tomohawk can generally wear down opposing physical attackers by repeatedly using Roost as they continue to take Rocky Helmet damage. However, it may also be optimal to switch to a teammate that can take better advantage of the Reflect boost and handle or set up on the foe, as Tomohawk can usually find an opportunity to use Roost later in the match even if it has been heavily weakened thanks to Prankster.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Covering Tomohawk's weakness to Fairy-type moves is very important, so it pairs well with defensive Steel- and Fire-types, including Mollux, Pyroak, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Strong special attackers in general tend to overwhelm Tomohawk, so Chansey pairs very well with it to sponge hits from them and provide cleric support. Chansey in return appreciates Tomohawk's ability to handle Knock Off users such as Colossoil with ease. Bulky Ground-types such as Assault Vest Colossoil, Tank Garchomp, and mixed defensive Hippowdon can also pair well with Tomohawk, as they cover its weakness to Electric-type attacks and prevent opposing Volt Switch users from gaining momentum. Tomohawk can handle Grass-types in return. Pokemon resistant to Flying, such as Cyclohm and Rotom-W, are also helpful defensive partners for Tomohawk. Unaware Clefable is another nice defensive teammate, as its ability reduces the need for Tomohawk to run Haze, freeing up one of its moveslots to run another supporting move. Unaware Clefable can also handle most variants of Aurumoth, which can be a troublesome foe for Tomohawk to face.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Life Orb Hurricane hits very hard; it can 2HKO Clefable and deal massive damage to many of Tomohawk's non-Electric checks, such as Mega Gardevoir. Despite its shaky accuracy, Hurricane is still preferred over Air Slash, as Air Slash is much weaker and prevents Tomohawk from 2HKOing Clefable and Mega Sableye. Aura Sphere smacks Dark- and Steel-types for heavy damage, such as Tyranitar, Colossoil, and Ferrothorn. It also 2HKOes Rotom-W and specially defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage. Earth Power does massive damage to foes such as Cyclohm and Kitsunoh. With Prankster, Nature Power becomes Tri Attack with +1 priority, allowing Tomohawk to pick off various weakened faster threats and Choice Scarf users. Nature Power also prevents several of Tomohawk's usual checks, such as Mega Gardevoir, Thundurus, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T, from switching into it safely, as they are all KOed by the combination of Hurricane and Nature Power after Stealth Rock damage. Roost allows Tomohawk to heal off the damage it takes from Life Orb, usually on forced switches, extending its longevity. On some teams, particularly hyper offense, Tomohawk's longevity isn't of much importance. Healing Wish is often a more suitable option in this case, as it allows Tomohawk to bring one of its teammates back to full health while preserving offensive momentum for the team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tomohawk's Special Attack and Speed are maximized to ensure top offensive potential. A Modest nature is preferred over Timid to increase Tomohawk's damage output, ensuring that the combination of Hurricane and Nature Power KOes Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock damage. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Tomohawk's offensive moves while still allowing it to switch moves as it pleases, which lets it take advantage of its non-attacking moves, as well as Nature Power, effectively. 29 HP IVs are used to lower the damage taken from Life Orb recoil. Prankster gives priority to Tomohawk's Nature Power, Roost, and Healing Wish.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep in mind that Tomohawk isn't terribly bulky without investment, so it should only be directly switched into predicted Ground-type attacks or other resisted hits if at all possible. Getting Tomohawk in via a free switch is ideal. Once it's in, simply click the appropriate coverage move for the situation; Tomohawk's STAB moves are pretty safe options most of the time. If there are still healthy Pokemon that resist Flying present on the other team, such as Mega Crucibelle, Krilowatt, and Rotom-W, you can consider predicting their switch in to smack them with the appropriate coverage move or pull a double switch into a teammate. If running Healing Wish, save Tomohawk for at least mid-game so it has something to heal when it's about to go down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pairing Tomohawk with a Stealth Rock setter is vital to ensure several OHKOs and 2HKOs as well as dissuade the opponent from switching. Garchomp, Jirachi, and Clefable can all work well in this regard. Offensive Pokemon that can set up on Pokemon that Tomohawk is weak to pair well with it, as they preserve offensive momentum and make for good Healing Wish recipients. Mega Charizard X, for example, can set up on many of the Electric-types that check Tomohawk. Talonflame and Cawmodore can set up on certain Fairy-types and can form an effective wallbreaker + sweeper combination with Tomohawk, as they appreciate having their checks being heavily worn down by Tomohawk. Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Kitsunoh pair well with Tomohawk to help check opposing Fairy- and Ice-types.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With access to both Prankster and Hurricane, Tomohawk makes for a great setter of Rain Dance. Hurricane provides Tomohawk with a powerful, perfectly accurate STAB move in the rain. Earth Power provides super effective coverage against several Pokemon that resist Hurricane, such as Crucibelle, Cyclohm, Jirachi, Mollux, and Plasmanta. Aura Sphere also provides strong coverage against the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Hurricane. It also provides good neutral damage against Rotom-W. Roost provides Tomohawk with longevity so that it may continue to set up Rain Dance multiple times throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The combination of Prankster, Rain Dance, and reliable recovery is what sets Tomohawk apart from other manual weather setters, as it can set up rain and heal itself with increased priority, making it quite a reliable setter. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature allows Tomohawk to hit as hard as possible. Maximum HP improves Tomohawk's bulk, increasing the number of foes it can safely set up Rain Dance against. Damp Rock lets Tomohawk provide eight turns of rain instead of the usual five, giving Tomohawk and its teammates even more time to take advantage of the rain. At the cost of three rain turns, Life Orb may be used over Damp Rock to allow Tomohawk to wallbreak much better. An EV spread of 232 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 20 Spe should be used in this case, as this allows Tomohawk to outspeed Rotom-W and 2HKO it with Aura Sphere, as well as minimizing Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Tomohawk in on Pokemon it can safely set up Rain Dance against. Many opposing Ground-types work well for this, such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Though it may be necessary at times, try to avoid directly switching into Knock Off, especially if your team is reliant on the extra turns of rain that Damp Rock provides. After Rain Dance is set up, start attacking with Tomohawk's powerful, perfectly accurate Hurricane if it isn't being immediately threatened. If Tomohawk finds itself up against, say, a faster Electric-type like Mega Manectric, use the opportunity to bring in a teammate that can handle it and take advantage of the rain, such as Mega Swampert. It's in your best interest to try preserving Tomohawk if at all possible so that it can set up rain as many times as needed throughout the match. If Tomohawk is paired up with another rain setter such as Politoed, try to keep at least one of them alive throughout the match for this purpose.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On dedicated rain teams, Politoed is an excellent partner for Tomohawk, as it can set up rain automatically via its Drizzle ability, taking some of the pressure off Tomohawk and allowing it to function as a secondary rain setter. Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Kabutops make for great partners, as they benefit from the rain that Tomohawk provides. Tornadus-T appreciates having a perfectly accurate Hurricane and can form a solid Flying spam core with Tomohawk. Cyclohm can take on opposing Flying-types for Tomohawk and can benefit from rain by running Thunder and Hydro Pump. Mollux can take advantage of the rain with Dry Skin and can help check Fairy-types for Tomohawk. Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Cawmodore, Mega Metagross, and Mega Scizor can all help Tomohawk deal with Fairy-types, and all of them appreciate taking reduced damage from Fire-type attacks.</p>"

  "Mollux": {
    "overview": "<p>Mollux is commonly seen taking advantage of its high Special Attack and good offensive STAB move combination by holding a Choice Scarf, allowing it to revenge kill several prominent offensive threats in the metagame. Access to Trick makes it an even better Choice Scarf user, as it can cripple bulky, passive Pokemon that might try to switch into it. Mollux's unique Fire / Poison typing and its access to Dry Skin allow it to check common Fairy- and Water-types quite well. In addition to Mollux's useful typing and ability, its good special bulk, wide support movepool, and access to reliable recovery allow Mollux to support the team in many ways, such as with Rapid Spin, Heal Bell, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>One of Mollux's main drawbacks is its middling Speed; without Choice Scarf, Mollux is rather easy to outspeed and force out, as its weaknesses to the common Ground-, Psychic-, and Rock-types are easily exploitable. The 4x weakness to Ground is especially troubling, as Mollux finds itself unable to deal much damage at all to the very common Colossoil and is easily OHKOed by Earthquake. Other attackers such as Keldeo and Azumarill have adapted to its presence and tend to run Ground-type coverage to handle Mollux more easily, which can make it even tougher for Mollux to switch in safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eruption is a very powerful Fire-type move if Mollux is at full health and is deadly with a Choice Scarf, but it requires entry hazard removal or Wish support to function optimally. Mollux can act as a rain setter with Rain Dance alongside Damp Rock, but Mollux is a bit strapped for moveslots as it is, so rain support is best provided by Mollux's teammates. Toxic can be used to whittle away at the foe's HP, but Mollux's easily exploitable Ground weakness and weakness to physical attackers limit its potential as a Toxic staller. Will-O-Wisp is an option to cripple physical attackers that might switch into Mollux, but Mollux's most common switch-in, Colossoil, can either bounce it back with Rebound or gain an Attack boost with Guts, limiting its effectiveness. Acid Spray is an interesting option that allows Mollux to defeat Chansey one-on-one and can be used on a non-Choice Scarf set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: While they don't appreciate coming in on a strong Fire-type attack, Ground-types such as Colossoil and Landorus-T can easily come in on Mollux's other attacks and threaten it out with their super effective STAB attacks. On top of this, any Pokemon that carries Ground-type coverage, such as Krilowatt, Syclant, or Mega Altaria, can easily threaten to KO Mollux.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, especially those with access to Psyshock, such as Latias, Latios, and Mega Gardevoir, can all deal heavy damage to or KO Mollux, but they must be wary of switching into Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame heavily threatens Mollux with its strong Brave Bird and can deal significant damage to all of Mollux's sets due to Mollux's lower physical bulk. In addition, specially defensive variants of Talonflame can use Mollux as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: The only moves that threaten Heatran are Hidden Power Ground and Trick to an extent. Heatran otherwise walls any support set and Choice-locked sets that are locked into Fire- or Poison-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon that can tank special hits such as Tyranitar and Chansey have no problem sponging hits from Mollux. Tyranitar can even eliminate Mollux's passive recovery with Sand Stream, but it doesn't appreciate the potential burn from Lava Plume. Chansey can sponge anything Mollux dishes out, but it must be wary of Trick and can't do much in return besides Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that outspeeds Mollux and can hit it for super effective damage, such as Syclant, Stratagem, or Aurumoth, can revenge kill Mollux, but all of them have trouble switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Mollux's strongest reliable STAB move and is its best option for cleaning up late-game. Flamethrower, however, can be used as an alternative if a 100% reliable answer to Cawmodore is needed; a Fire Blast miss can sometimes mean a loss against a +6 Cawmodore. Sludge Wave allows Mollux to deal massive damage to Fairy-type Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon. Hidden Power Ground rounds out Mollux's coverage by hitting Heatran and opposing Mollux, which would otherwise wall Mollux's STAB combination, for 4x super effective damage. Thunderbolt can be used instead to hit Water-types such as Keldeo, Mega Gyarados, and Naviathan harder. Trick is in the final slot to cripple common walls that may try to sponge Mollux's attacks, such as Chansey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is straightforward, maximizing Mollux's damage output and Speed. Choice Scarf allows Mollux to act as a revenge killer and outspeed Pokemon such as Cawmodore and Syclant. A Modest nature secures the OHKO on Mega Gardevoir with Sludge Wave while letting Mollux outpace everything up to Syclant; however, a Timid nature can be used to outspeed even faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric at the cost of some power. Dry Skin gives Mollux an immunity to Water-type moves, potentially giving it some switch in and healing opportunities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a Choice Scarf user, Mollux can be brought in as a revenge killer mid-game or to clean up weakened teams late-game. This set is a good fit for both offensive and balanced teams, as it can easily revenge kill and OHKO threats such as Mega Pinsir and Cawmodore with no prior damage, as well as Mega Gardevoir after Stealth Rock damage. While Mollux can easily switch into resisted hits, be wary of Pokemon that commonly carry coverage that Mollux is weak to, specifically Ground-type attacks, such as Mega Altaria's Earthquake, Keldeo's Hidden Power Ground, and Azumarill's Bulldoze. Also, keep in mind that while Mollux's base 76 Speed coupled with Choice Scarf is enough to outspeed most unboosted threats, naturally faster Pokemon that can boost their Speed, such as Mega Charizard X and Aurumoth, will outpace Mollux regardless, so Mollux should not be relied on to revenge kill them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mollux has trouble with Ground-types and is often forced out by them. Therefore, its best partners are strong Grass- and Water-types, such as Necturna, Keldeo, and Arghonaut, which can all help break down opposing Ground-types. Fighting-types such as Tomohawk, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny also pair well with Mollux, as they can take on specially defensive Pokemon that might try to wall Mollux, such as Chansey and Tyranitar. In return, Mollux can cover their weakness to Fairy-type moves. Mollux's typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, so teammates that can remove entry hazards are appreciated. Colossoil makes for an excellent teammate, as it can provide Rapid Spin support, ensuring that Mollux doesn't get worn down too quickly. In return, Mollux resists or is immune to every one of Colossoil's weaknesses. Wish support from a teammate such as Chansey, Sylveon, or Clefable is very much appreciated, as this strengthens Mollux's ability to check opposing threats such as Mega Scizor and Cawmodore if Stealth Rock or Spikes is set up on Mollux's side of the field.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Mollux's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to demolish opposing Grass-types and Steel-types such as Necturna, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Flamethrower is also a reasonable option with perfect accuracy and is the preferred option if Mollux is running Calm Mind. Sludge Wave provides coverage against Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Clefable, and Azumarill. Recover allows Mollux to heal off damage taken from entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. Hidden Power Ground provides important coverage against Heatran and opposing Mollux. Keep in mind that Mollux needs some prior damage on bulkier variants of Heatran to secure the OHKO and fears Heatran's Earth Power. Thunderbolt can be used to hit bulky Water-types harder and allows Mollux to OHKO Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage if holding Life Orb. Thunder is an option here if Mollux has rain support from its teammates. Calm Mind allows Mollux to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to attempt a sweep. However, it struggles to accomplish much if opposing Ground-types, namely Colossoil, are still present.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and a Modest nature maximize Mollux's offensive potential. 48 EVs in Speed ensure that Mollux outspeeds Adamant Azumarill and defensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Cyclohm, and Necturna. The remaining EVs are put into HP to increase Mollux's bulk. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it maximizes Mollux's damage output and is especially useful if Mollux has Wish support or rain support to keep it healthy throughout the match. Black Sludge, however, is also an option for reliable recovery, and it is the preferred option if running Calm Mind. Air Balloon is also an option that lets Mollux serve as a much safer check to foes that commonly carry Ground-type coverage, notably Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Dry Skin gives Mollux a useful immunity to Water-type moves. An alternate EV spread of 208 HP / 252 Def / 48 Spe and a Bold nature can be used on Calm Mind sets to bolster Mollux's physical bulk and increase setup opportunities while still hitting the same Speed benchmark.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Mollux in on Water-type moves if at all possible, as this will heal off damage Mollux might have taken earlier from Life Orb recoil or entry hazards. Mollux makes for an excellent check to Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Azumarill, and Clefable, so bring Mollux in to punish the foe with its strong attacks. Be wary of Pokemon that commonly carry Ground-type coverage, such as Heatran, Mega Altaria, and Keldeo, as this can spell doom for Mollux if it is not holding an Air Balloon. If attempting a sweep with Calm Mind, make sure that opposing Ground-types are KOed or heavily worn down first.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mollux is easily forced out by Ground-types, as it has trouble hitting them for heavy damage, so strong Water- and Grass- types such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Serperior are its best offensive partners. Mollux is checked by Psychic-types, so Pursuit trappers such as Colossoil and Tyranitar make for good teammates. Mollux, in turn, can cover their weaknesses to Fairy-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks. Rain support from Pokemon such as Politoed and Damp Rock Tomohawk helps Mollux thanks to its Dry Skin, allowing it to heal off damage taken from entry hazards or Life Orb recoil and also use Thunder reliably. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Colossoil, Talonflame, and Rotom-W can bring Mollux in safely so it can start launching its strong attacks. Gothitelle can trap and remove opposing Chansey, allowing Mollux to more freely use its special attacks without being walled. Pokemon such as Tomohawk, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T can all help check physical attackers for Mollux and set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Entry hazard support is especially helpful for wearing down opposing Colossoil; two switches into Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes ensures that Mollux can 2HKO even Assault Vest Colossoil with a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast. Stealth Rock with a layer of Spikes puts most variants of Heatran into KO range for Hidden Power Ground.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume gets a STAB boost and has perfect accuracy and a decent burn chance, discouraging physical attackers from switching in. Sludge Bomb is used to break down the Fairy-types that Mollux checks so well, such as Sylveon, Clefable, and Azumarill, and it also has a good chance of poisoning the foe. Recover restores Mollux's health and allows it to check special attackers several times throughout a match. The last slot depends on what type of support you'd like Mollux to provide. Rapid Spin allows Mollux to remove entry hazards from your side of the field. Alternatively, Mollux makes for a viable Stealth Rock setter thanks to its bulk. Heal Bell allows Mollux to clear its teammates of status ailments. Toxic Spikes is also an option to help wear down the opposing team.</p> <p>Mollux can opt to run more than one of the supporting moves listed above on its moveset. However, this means one of its STAB moves or Recover must be dropped. Dropping one of Mollux's STAB moves compromises its ability to check certain Pokemon; if Mollux doesn't run Lava Plume, it becomes bait for Cawmodore, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, and if Mollux doesn't run Sludge Wave, it becomes bait for Pyroak, Cyclohm, and Mega Altaria. Giving up Recover compromises Mollux's longevity and limits the number of times Mollux will be able to come in and support its team, but this is a reasonable option if Mollux has Wish support from its teammates. Hidden Power Ground can also be run in one of the moveslots so that Mollux isn't completely walled by Heatran and opposing Mollux; although this set has trouble finding room for the move, it's a viable option with the proper support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs and a Calm nature maximize Mollux's great special bulk, allowing Mollux to come in safely on many special attackers and support the team. Black Sludge provides Mollux with passive recovery. Dry Skin provides Mollux with a useful Water immunity and more switch in and healing opportunities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Mollux in on predicted Water- and Fairy-type moves, as this will allow Mollux time to set up entry hazards, remove them with Rapid Spin, or clear its teammates of status with Heal Bell. Be sure to keep Mollux healthy with Recover; its weakness to Stealth Rock can otherwise leave it worn down quickly and compromise its ability to check special attackers. Generally, Mollux should try to stay away from physical attackers and Psyshock users, which can prey on Mollux's lower physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can handle physical hits and Ground-type attacks aimed at Mollux are great teammates. Landorus-T is a great partner because it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can easily take physical hits, while Mollux covers Landorus-T's weaknesses to Water and Ice in return. Tomohawk also makes for a great teammate and can check a plethora of physical attackers that threaten Mollux. Mollux is forced out by Psychic-type Pokemon with Psyshock, such as Latios. A Pursuit trapper such as Colossoil or Tyranitar can prove to be a handy teammate for this reason. Colossoil can also bounce back opposing entry hazards with Rebound, taking considerable pressure off of Mollux. Mollux works well on a rain team, providing the team with a helpful 4x resistance to Grass-type moves, checking Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Zapdos, and Rotom-W, providing Rapid Spin support, and gaining even more passive recovery with Dry Skin. Therefore, rain setters such as Politoed and Damp Rock Tomohawk make for good teammates. Pokemon that can check Talonflame, such as Cyclohm, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar, can pair well with Mollux, as Mollux is setup bait for bulky variants of Talonflame and takes hefty damage from its Flying-type moves. Wish support from a teammate such as Chansey, Sylveon, or Clefable is helpful, as this keeps Mollux healthy and gives it more opportunities to support the team.</p>"

  "Aurumoth": {
    "overview": "<p>Aurumoth's incredible versatility gives it different checks and counters to each of its sets, only retaining a couple of universal checks, which allows it to fit on most offensive or balance teams. It has great mixed attacking stats and a decent Defense stat, allowing it to have a high damage output and tank some physical hits. It has access to great boosting moves in Quiver Dance, Tail Glow, and Dragon Dance, as well as amazing coverage moves and STAB attacks, leaving no Pokemon that can wall every set. It also has access to many utility options like Final Gambit, Will-O-Wisp, Healing Wish, and Wish if these are wanted. Illusion can trick the opponent and let Aurumoth nab a free boost, which is what makes Aurumoth so threatening. It also lets Aurumoth lure in certain threats that a sweeper needs to have taken out for a surprise KO. No Guard makes Aurumoth's many inaccurate moves such as Focus Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder hit without any chance of missing.</p> <p>However, Aurumoth has an inconvenient Speed tier of base 94, meaning it is outsped by Pokemon like Choice Specs Volkraken, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Crucibelle before a Speed boost and +1 Mega Charizard X and Choice Scarf Volkraken after a boost. Additionally, a lackluster Special Defense stat leaves it prone to revenge killing, though Quiver Dance can patch this deficiency. It is vulnerable to entry hazards, which can ruin its Illusion if the Pokemon it is disguised as takes the incorrect amount of Stealth Rock damage, if a Poison-type gets poisoned by Toxic Spikes, or if a Flying-type or a Pokemon with Levitate is affected by Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or Sticky Web. It is also vulnerable to common priority moves, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Colossoil's Sucker Punch. Aurumoth has some annoying move illegalities when it comes to running mixed sets, including Bug Buzz with Close Combat and Megahorn with Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tail Glow + No Guard is an option to boost quickly and fire off really powerful moves, but it leaves Aurumoth very open to revenge killing if not against a defensive team. Substitute can ease setup and preserve Illusion longer, but it competes with a coverage move and compromises Aurumoth's HP. Leftovers gives Aurumoth passive recovery, but the extra power from Life Orb is generally better. Coba Berry allows Aurumoth to tank Talonflame's unboosted Brave Bird and continue sweeping. Focus Sash allows Aurumoth to survive a powerful hit, set up, and turn the tables on a revenge killer. However, Aurumoth has excellent bulk to begin with, so a power boosting item is generally preferred. Aurumoth can run a Choice Scarf set utilizing Final Gambit, Trick, and Illusion for a surprise KO, but the all-out attacker set can pull this surprise off better multiple times throughout a match. Aurumoth can run a defensive set utilising Wish / Protect / Megahorn or Psychic / Will-O-Wisp, which can check Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Breloom, spread burns, and keep its team healthy. This gives Aurumoth a unique niche on defensive and balance teams; however, Aurumoth would rather capitalize on its offensive stats. Healing Wish lets Aurumoth sacrifice itself in order to heal up a teammate, but Aurumoth generally appreciates Healing Wish support from its teammates. The best set to run Healing Wish on would be the Choice Scarf set. Disable can lock a super effective move from a check or counter, but it competes with a coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Unaware Clefable</strong>: Unaware Clefable is the closest Pokemon Aurumoth has to a counter, as it ignores all of Aurumoth's boosts and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave or KO it with Moonblast. However, Clefable must be wary of Overheat, as Unaware ignores the Special Attack drops, and Final Gambit, the only move Aurumoth has that can OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Priority</strong>: Talonflame can switch into Bug Buzz, Megahorn, Overheat, or Focus Blast, ignore any of Aurumoth's boosts in Speed, and OHKO or 2HKO with priority Brave Bird or Acrobatics, while Colossoil can switch into Overheat, Psyshock, Zen Headbutt, and Psychic and almost OHKO it with Sucker Punch. However, Talonflame has to be wary of boosted Psyshock, Thunderbolt, Thunder, and Hydro Pump when switching in, while Colossoil has to watch out for Bug Buzz, Megahorn, Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Blizzard, Focus Blast, and Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Colossoil</strong>: With an Assault Vest, Colossoil can stomach any unboosted special hit from Aurumoth and even has the potential to tank a +1 Bug Buzz. Furthermore, Knock Off has a 50% chance to outright KO Aurumoth, while Sucker Punch will KO Aurumoth if it has taken Stealth Rock damage or two rounds of Life Orb Recoil, allowing Colossoil to revenge KO Aurumoth that lacks a Colbur Berry. However, if Aurumoth has boosted more than once or if it has Megahorn or Close Combat, it can muscle past Colossoil.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Mega Diancie, Syclant, Tornadus-T, Weavile, Stratagem, Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, Kitsunoh, Kerfluffle, and Mega Alakazam can outspeed Aurumoth before it boosts its Speed. Choice Scarf Volkraken in particular is dangerous, as Aurumoth cannot outspeed it even with maximum Speed and at +1.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis from Cyclohm, Thundurus, and Clefable ruins Aurumoth's important Speed. Burns from Rotom-W ruin the Dragon Dance and Scarf variants. Burn damage and poison damage compromise Aurumoth's longevity and Final Gambit's damage output.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Specially defensive Heatran can absorb Aurumoth's STAB moves and Overheat, but it has to watch out for Aurumoth's Water- and Fighting-type coverage moves, particularly Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Both defensive Cyclohm and Quagsire wall Aurumoth's Dragon Dance set and can recover whatever damage Aurumoth deals. The former can paralyze Aurumoth with Discharge or Static, while Quagsire ignores Aurumoth's boosts entirely and can poison or burn it. However, Cyclohm and Quagsire fall to every other one of Aurumoth's special sets.</p>",

      "Illusion + Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance is arguably Aurumoth's best boosting move, boosting its Special Attack, allowing it to outspeed most metagame threats, and patching up its weak Special Defense. This move turns Aurumoth into one of the metagame's deadliest sweepers. Bug Buzz is Aurumoth's most powerful special Bug-type STAB attack that OHKOes Latios and other Aurumoth before a boost and has a good chance of OHKOing defensive Cyclohm and some Assault Vest Colossoil variants after a boost. It can also damage targets through Substitute. Psyshock hits specially defensive threats like Chansey, Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Crucibelle, and Fighting-types like Keldeo, Kerfluffle, and Tomohawk. Alternatively, unboosted Psychic can OHKO defensive Haze Tomohawk. Overheat OHKOes Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Kitsunoh, Cawmodore, and Mega Scizor with no boosts and has an almost perfect chance of OHKOing specially defensive Jirachi after Stealth Rock damage. Be mindful of the Special Attack drop, though. Hydro Pump can OHKO Heatran after a bit of prior damage and OHKOes Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T after a boost. It is also Aurumoth's best option if it wants to attempt a late-game sweep. Ice Beam reliably OHKOes Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp before a boost, as well as Cyclohm after a boost; however, Aurumoth becomes walled by Steel-types. Thunderbolt hits Naviathan, Gyarados, and Talonflame super effectively, but its coverage is lacking otherwise. Shadow Ball hits Kitsunoh and Mega Metagross super effectively, has good neutral coverage, and doesn't lower Aurumoth's Special Attack. However, Aurumoth generally appreciates its other coverage moves better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows Aurumoth to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb lets Aurumoth hit as hard as possible. Colbur Berry can soften Colossoil's Sucker Punch or Knock Off, though it comes with a loss of power. Expert Belt is another option to take advantage of Aurumoth's wide super effective coverage and preserves Aurumoth's Illusion, but it also comes at a cost of a bit of power, especially against neutral targets. Illusion eases Aurumoth's setup, potentially tricking the opponent into switching in a Pokemon harmless to Aurumoth as it sets up, such as Latios, Mega Crucibelle, Kerfluffle, or Serperior. 24 HP EVs allow Aurumoth to survive one round of Life Orb recoil after a maximum damage roll from Colossoil's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to clear entry hazards away before sending in Aurumoth to take most advantage of Illusion and to survive Colossoil's Sucker Punch. If hazards cannot be cleared, try to disguise Aurumoth as a Pokemon that will take the same amount of Stealth Rock damage and be affected by Toxic Spikes, Spikes, and Sticky Web. Early-game, send in Aurumoth disguised as a Pokemon that will lure in Steel-types and hit them with Overheat. This makes a sweep easier late-game because Aurumoth has a hard time recovering from Overheat's Special Attack drop after boosting. Disguising as a defensive behemoth like Cyclohm or Tomohawk or an offensive threat such as Kerfluffle or Volkraken can force a switch, giving Aurumoth a free turn to set up a Quiver Dance. Try to remove Unaware users like Clefable before setting up so that they don't stop a sweep. Colossoil's Sucker Punch and Talonflame's Acrobatics or Brave Bird can end a sweep, so removing them before setting up is preferred. If possible, setting up twice allows Aurumoth to outspeed Choice Scarf Volkraken, a common check. However, this can be very difficult and just one boost is sufficient to steamroll most teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners such as Colossoil, Tomohawk, and Mollux and Defoggers such as Latios and Mega Scizor allow Aurumoth to preserve its Illusion when switching in. Mega Crucibelle and Krilowatt have great type synergy with Aurumoth, luring in resisted attacks so that Aurumoth can get a free turn of setup. Tank Garchomp, Mollux, Heatran, and Tomohawk set up Stealth Rock for Aurumoth, allowing it to pick up KOs more easily. Physical sweepers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X appreciate Aurumoth's ability to lure in and weaken physical walls like Cyclohm. Aurumoth appreciates wallbreakers such as Choice Band Azumarill, Life Orb Tomohawk, and Keldeo to soften teams. Aurumoth also appreciates stallbreakers like Heatran and Naviathan to eliminate or weaken Chansey and Pyroak. Kerfluffle can weaken Steel-type checks and use Parting Shot to give Aurumoth an easier time setting up, as Aurumoth wants all of its HP for Life Orb recoil.</p>"
      },
      "Illusion + Tail Glow": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow boosts Aurumoth's Special Attack to obscene levels, capable of breaking the sturdiest of walls. Bug Buzz nukes bulkier Pokemon after a Tail Glow and is capable of piercing through Substitutes. It notably OHKOes Pyroak and Cyclohm. Psyshock hits specially defensive walls, capable of OHKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock damage and OHKOing Tomohawk. Psychic is an alternative Psychic-type STAB attack that can still hit special walls for great damage at +3 and +6 and has a guaranteed 2HKO on maximum HP and Defense invested Unaware Clefable. Overheat is good for luring in Steel-types and removing them before Aurumoth sets up Tail Glow later in the match. It also has a chance to 2HKO maximum HP and Defense Unaware Clefable. Surf is a good alternative to hit specially defensive Heatran, but it is only necessary if running Psychic, as Psyshock 2HKOes after a Tail Glow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb maximize Aurumoth's Special Attack stat. Colbur Berry allows Aurumoth to stomach Colossoil's Sucker Punch better and break past it with Bug Buzz, but it comes with a power drop. Expert Belt is another option to preserve Aurumoth's Illusion longer while boosting its super effective hits, but there is a power drop for its neutral hits. 184 Speed EVs allow Aurumoth to outspeed offensive Modest Tomohawk. 72 HP EVs increase Aurumoth's bulk, which notably allows Aurumoth to survive Colossoil's Sucker Punch. Illusion allows Aurumoth to disguise as another Pokemon, allowing it to set up Tail Glow more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Entry hazards can ruin Aurumoth's Illusion, so clear them away before sending it in. If absolutely necessary, try to send in Aurumoth disguised as another Pokemon with a 2x weakness to Stealth Rock. Disguise Aurumoth as an offensive Pokemon to lure in a wall; for example, Manaphy lures in Ferrothorn, which Aurumoth can OHKO with Overheat. Many opponents will send in Unaware Clefable to tank Aurumoth's boosted moves; if an Unaware Clefable switch-in is predicted, use Overheat or Psychic to 2HKO it. Aurumoth doesn't have to set up to be powerful; however, setting up whenever possible is ideal. If Aurumoth hasn't finished taking out opposing walls, don't let it go down prematurely. Save it for later in the battle to set up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Manaphy is a great teammate, as it also utilizes Tail Glow to wallbreak. Manaphy also lures in Grass-types, which Aurumoth can eliminate. Spinners and Defoggers eliminate entry hazards to preserve Aurumoth's Illusion. Prime examples include Colossoil, Tomohawk, Mollux, Latios, and Mega Scizor. Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Tomohawk, and Mollux help Aurumoth net KOs. Clefable, Mega Crucibelle, Mega Diancie, and Azumarill lure in Steel-types, so disguising Aurumoth as one of these Pokemon helps Aurumoth eliminate or deal heavy damage to them with Overheat. Clefable can use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon that Aurumoth wouldn't otherwise be able to outspeed with a wallbreaking set. Mega Crucibelle and Mega Diancie can check Flying-type Pokemon like Talonflame and Tornadus-T. Azumarill is a good wallbreaking partner with Aurumoth, as it checks Colossoil, and with the help of Aurumoth, and doesn't have to run Superpower to deal with Ferrothorn. Sweepers and cleaners like Cawmodore, Mega Charizard X, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Volkraken appreciate Aurumoth's ability to take out walls. Kerfluffle can use Parting Shot to ease Aurumoth's setup and has good type synergy with it, dissuading the opponent from using Dark- and Rock-type attacks. This Aurumoth set appreciates checks to revenge killers because Aurumoth loses momentum after knocking out a Pokemon. Tank Garchomp punishes VoltTurn teams sufficiently and can check Talonflame, while Coil Mega Crucibelle can switch in and set up if Talonflame revenge kills Aurumoth.</p>"
      },
      "No Guard + Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Aurumoth's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Psychic, Focus Blast, and Shadow Ball are best used together, whereas Psyshock, Thunder, and Blizzard form an alternative option. After a boost, Psychic OHKOes Tomohawk, Mega Venusaur, Mega Crucibelle, Plasmanta, Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Kerfluffle, and Volcanion. Cyclohm requires a bit of prior damage to OHKO after a boost. Focus Blast can replace Aurumoth's Bug-type STAB move because it has better coverage: after a bit of prior damage and a boost, it OHKOes specially defensive Heatran, Assault Vest Colossoil, Ferrothorn, Mega Gyarados, and Cawmodore. After two boosts, Mega Scizor can be OHKOed and Chansey can be 2HKOed. Shadow Ball is Aurumoth's best coverage move for Ghost-types and OHKOing Kitsunoh after a boost, and Psychic-types, OHKOing Mega Medicham, Mega Metagross, Latios, Mega Gardevoir, other Aurumoth, and Slowbro after a boost and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>If you opt for the second set of slashes, Psyshock becomes the better STAB move to hit Chansey; it achieves a 2HKO after a boost and Stealth Rock damage. It also OHKOes Mega Venusaur, Mollux, Crucibelle, Plasmanta, Kerfluffle, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny after a boost. Thunder is a great coverage move with perfect accuracy thanks to No Guard. It OHKOes Slowbro, Azumarill, Naviathan, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Volkraken, Tomohawk, Tornadus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion after a boost. It 2HKOes Rotom-W and Mega Scizor after a boost as well. Blizzard rounds out the BoltBeam coverage with Thunder, as it OHKOes Cyclohm, Necturna, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Hippowdon, Latios, and Cawmodore after a boost. It also OHKOes Colossoil and 2HKOes Ferrothorn after two boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb maximize Aurumoth's damage output. 232 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Aurumoth to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. 24 HP EVs allow Aurumoth to survive a max roll Colossoil Sucker Punch and a round of Life Orb recoil. No Guard allows Focus Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder to hit with perfect accuracy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Only set up if Aurumoth's hard checks such as Clefable, Talonflame, Choice Scarf Volkraken, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Colossoil are taken out. Since Aurumoth doesn't have Illusion to hide itself, setting up on passive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Fidgit, and Ferrothorn is ideal. Using Quiver Dance twice to outspeed Choice Scarf Volkraken and to secure guaranteed OHKOs is favorable, but this isn't always possible. Use double switches or a slow VoltTurn to get Aurumoth in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While entry hazards are not very harmful to this set, they will still wear down Aurumoth, so spinners and Defoggers are good teammates. Stealth Rock users help Aurumoth net easier KOs. Volt Switch and U-Turn users like Mega Scizor, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T help Aurumoth get in safely. Partnering No Guard Aurumoth with Manaphy or Volcarona can give the impression that one of them is Illusion, which allows these teammates to set up more easily. Wallbreakers help to soften tanks before Aurumoth sets up to sweep. Stallbreakers such as Heatran, Clefable, and Naviathan can remove passive Pokemon that can stomach Aurumoth's boosted moves. Kerfluffle can also stallbreak and use Parting Shot to help Aurumoth set up.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn should be run together alongside Psychic, while Bug Buzz should be run alongside Psyshock. These pairs of moves allow Aurumoth to hit both physically and specially defensive Pokemon with one set. With the given EV spread, Megahorn can 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock Damage. It also OHKOes Colossoil, which allows Aurumoth to knock it out on the switch before Colossoil can use Sucker Punch on Aurumoth. It is also Aurumoth's most powerful option against neutral targets, though it has subpar accuracy. Other notable 2HKOs include Krilowatt, Slowbro, and Rotom-W. Psychic should always be run alongside Megahorn. It OHKOes Keldeo, has a high chance to OHKO defensive Tomohawk and Choice Scarf Mollux, and can OHKO Mega Crucibelle and offensive Mega Venusaur after a bit of prior damage. Bug Buzz is Aurumoth's next best Bug-type STAB move, which 2HKOes Colossoil, Krilowatt, and Rotom-W and OHKOes Slowbro and Latios. It also pierces Substitute. Psyshock is preferred if Aurumoth runs Bug Buzz. It OHKOes Mega Crucibelle, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Mollux and 2HKOes defensive Tomohawk and offensive Mega Venusaur. Overheat is Aurumoth's most powerful coverage move and OHKOes Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Kitsunoh, Cawmodore, Skarmory, and Mega Metagross. Aurumoth doesn't mind the Special Attack drop, as this set is very hit-and-run. Ice Beam reliably OHKOes Garchomp, specially defensive Gliscor, and defensive Landorus-T and 2HKOes Cyclohm and Assault Vest Tornadus-T, but it leaves the set walled by Heatran. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Naviathan and Assault Vest Tornadus-T, OHKOes Gyarados, and has a chance to OHKO Talonflame. Hydro Pump can 2HKO specially defensive Heatran, mixed wall Hippowdon, and specially defensive Gliscor and can OHKO defensive Landorus-T. However, it is illegal with Megahorn and Close Combat. Close Combat nets a 2HKO on Chansey with the given EV spread, though it is illegal alongside Bug Buzz, and Megahorn and Overheat generally cover most targets that Close Combat would hit. Close Combat also makes Aurumoth more susceptible to revenge killing. Focus Blast is an option to 2HKO specially defensive Heatran alongside Megahorn, but it suffers from low accuracy and overlapping coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>84 Attack EVs and a Life Orb secure a 2HKO on Chansey with Megahorn after Stealth Rock damage. 232 Speed EVs and a Naive nature let Aurumoth outspeed maximum Speed Landorus-T. Naive is used over Hasty to take priority moves better. 24 HP EVs let Aurumoth survive a maximum roll Sucker Punch from Colossoil and one round of Life Orb recoil. The remaining 168 EVs are tossed into Special Attack to allow Aurumoth to hit hard with its special attacks. A spread of 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe with a Timid Nature should be run if not using Megahorn or Close Combat. Choice Specs gives Aurumoth more power and can give it more longevity, but it locks Aurumoth into one move. Additionally, it should not be run with Megahorn or Close Combat. A notable difference between Choice Specs and Life Orb is that with Choice Specs, Overheat is guaranteed to 2HKO Unaware Clefable. Expert Belt is another option to preserve Aurumoth's Illusion, but it lacks the power of Life Orb or Choice Specs. Illusion lets Aurumoth disguise as another Pokemon, which can lure in Pokemon when they least suspect a powerful Life Orb-boosted or Choice Specs-boosted attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is used primarily for luring in Pokemon for another sweeper. Aurumoth should disguise itself as this sweeper to lure in its checks and counters so that it can KO them. Because it lacks a boosting move, this Aurumoth set cannot sweep on its own. Predicting which Pokemon will switch in is key. To maintain the element of surprise, Aurumoth should switch into an entry hazard-free field. This set's standard moveset can systematically dismantle the Colossoil, Tomohawk, bulky Steel-type, and Cyclohm core.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers like Coil Mega Crucibelle, Mega Lopunny, Cawmodore, Talonflame, Choice Scarf Volkraken, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Scizor appreciate Aurumoth's ability to eliminate certain threats that would otherwise halt a sweep. Spinners and Defoggers help Aurumoth preserve its Illusion longer. Examples of the former include Colossoil, Mollux, and Tomohawk; examples of the latter include Mega Scizor, Latios, and Zapdos. Stealth Rock users, including Mollux, Heatran, and Tank Garchomp, help Aurumoth achieve certain KOs, most notably against Chansey using Megahorn. Tailwind users such as Fidgit and Zapdos can be used to turn Aurumoth from a wallbreaker into a fearsome sweeper.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Aurumoth's Attack and Speed, which can start a sweep. Megahorn is Aurumoth's most powerful physical STAB attack, and its low accuracy can be mitigated by No Guard. Regardless of the number of Dragon Dance boosts, it 2HKOes Chansey. After a boost it 2HKOes Pyroak and defensive Necturna; OHKOes Krilowatt, Slowbro, Colossoil, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Gyarados, Latios, and Choice Scarf Jirachi; and OHKOes Rotom-W with a bit of prior damage. Zen Headbutt is Aurumoth's best Psychic-type STAB attack, which can OHKO Mega Crucibelle, Keldeo, Mollux, offensive Mega Venusaur, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and defensive Tomohawk after a boost. Close Combat hits Steel-types hard after a boost like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Naviathan. It also hits Chansey harder than Megahorn, although Aurumoth becomes walled by Kitsunoh. Alternatively, Overheat can also be used to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Cawmodore, Kitsunoh, and Scizor, but it is weak without investment and leaves Aurumoth walled by Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs and a Life Orb let Aurumoth hit as hard as possible. Life Orb also offsets the hindering nature and lack of investment for Overheat. Colbur Berry can be used to weaken Colossoil's Sucker Punch or Knock Off, but Aurumoth misses the power from Life Orb. 232 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Aurumoth outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Dragon Dance boost. Aurumoth should run Jolly even if using Overheat, as it still deals decent amounts of damage to Steel-types. 24 HP EVs let Aurumoth take a maximum roll Sucker Punch from Colossoil and one round of Life Orb recoil without fainting. Aurumoth can disguise itself as another Pokemon with Illusion to ease setup. No Guard still has merit, as Aurumoth usually baits in special walls anyway. It ensures that Megahorn and Zen Headbutt will always hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Aurumoth's disguise takes the incorrect amount of damage from entry hazards, Illusion becomes useless; therefore, removing entry hazards before switching in is mandatory. However, if entry hazards cannot be removed, Aurumoth should disguise as a Pokemon that will take the same amount of entry hazard damage as Aurumoth. If the opponent has Choice Scarf Volkraken, try to accumulate two boosts to outspeed it. However, be mindful that losing too much HP can make Aurumoth easily revenge killed by priority users. Take out physical walls like Unaware Quagsire, Unaware Clefable, and Cyclohm before setting up, as they can switch in and halt Aurumoth's sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X, Feraligatr, Mega Gyarados, and Naviathan are other Dragon Dance sweepers that Aurumoth can disguise as. In particular, after Mega Evolving, Mega Charizard X takes the same amount of damage from Stealth Rock and is affected by Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. Spinners and Defoggers help to preserve Aurumoth's Illusion. Stealth Rock users help Aurumoth achieve KOs more easily. Wallbreakers can help soften tanks and walls before Aurumoth sets up. Magic Guard Clefable and Kerfluffle can take on both Quagsire and Cyclohm and remove them before Aurumoth sets up Dragon Dance.</p>"

  "Cawmodore": {
    "overview": "<p>With Volt Absorb and Intimidate plus a great Defense stat, Cawmodore might seem to fill the role of a defensive Pokemon. However, it instead shines as an offensive powerhouse and is a deadly user of the move Belly Drum. Though Cawmodore's attacking movepool is shallow, it contains gems such as Acrobatics for pure power and Drain Punch for recovery. Thanks to its great Speed stat, Cawmodore is able to sweep a large portion of the metagame after setting up.</p> <p>Cawmodore's Attack stat is rather unimpressive on its own, which means in order to be an effective sweeper it has to set up Belly Drum first. There are a number of Pokemon that can threaten Cawmodore while it is setting up, so reliably boosting can be difficult at times. Even after Cawmodore has set up, certain special sweepers can still outspeed it and target its poor Special Defense. Overall, Cawmodore is fairly one-dimensional, and it lacks any truly viable set variation. However, if it can pull off a well-timed Belly Drum, Cawmodore can wreck holes in almost any opposing team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is a great move in general; however, it may be hard to fit into the set, and doesn't offer better coverage than Cawmodore's main options. Drill Peck can be used alongside non-consumable items such as leftovers. Iron Head hits harder than Bullet Punch and can take out bulky Fairies, but generally Cawmodore appreciates priority more. Intimidate can be useful to weaken physical attackers, but without Volt Absorb, Cawmodore is vulnerable to Electric-type attacks. Lastly, Substitute + Salac Berry can be used, but Cawmodore's Speed tier is already pretty good for the CAP metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Cyclohm</strong>: With a resistance to Acrobatics and access to Fire Blast and Flamethrower, defensive Cyclohm is one of the best hard counters to Cawmodore.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers that Resist Steel</strong>: Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mollux and Choice Scarf Volkraken are usually Cawmodore stop Cawmodore in its tracks. Essentially, if Cawmodore is hit by a neutral STAB move or almost any super effective special attack, it'll be down and out.</p> <p><strong>Hazing / Phazing</strong>: Bulky or speedy hazers or phazers can stop a Cawmodore sweep and check it on the spot. The most notable of these is Haze + Reflect Tomohawk. However, switching into a Cawmodore attack is generally not advisable if it has set up already. Skarmory is always slower than Cawmodore, which allows it to Roost without fear of a super effective Drain Punch hitting it, and it can phaze Cawmodore with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Unaware Users</strong>: Quagsire is the most notable of the bulky Unaware trio, but Clefable can do well against sets without Iron Head. Arghonaut still fears Acrobatics, however.</p> <p><strong>Jolly Talonflame</strong>: If rocks aren't up, Talonflame can sort of check Cawmodore with Flare Blitz. Taking around half health from Bullet Punch plus recoil damage is less than favorable, however.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Burning Cawmodore severely hurts it, but at +6 it can still do decent amounts of chip damage. Prankster Sableye has some potential to check Cawmodore with priority Will-O-Wisp. However, accuracy can be problematic at times and Sableye does not appreciate a Bullet Punch after Cawmodore has set up. Rotom-W is a bulkier alternative, but it would usually just want to KO Cawmodore with Hydro Pump anyway.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Captain Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum lets Cawmodore hit extremely hard after only a single turn of setup. Afterwards, Sitrus Berry activates and turns Acrobatics into an insanely powerful STAB move that can even dent Pokemon that resist Flying. Drain Punch provides coverage against Steel-types and can be used to recover some of the HP that was lost during setup. Bullet Punch functions as a priority move and a secondary STAB move; it can hit some faster would-be threats such as Stratagem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>4 HP EVs give Cawmodore an even HP stat, which is vital for allowing Sitrus Berry to activate and heal Cawmodore after a Belly Drum. With Sitrus Berry consumed, Acrobatics receives its boost and becomes quite powerful. Cawmodore needs the extra Speed from the Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs in order to outspeed as much as it possibly can. 252 Attack EVs allow for its best sweeping potential.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 12 Atk / 252 Spe is usable, as it allows Cawmodore to be bulkier and can help it set up a Belly Drum more easily in some situations. 244 HP EVs allow it to maintain an even 302 HP, which still allows for Belly Drum to activate Sitrus Berry on the same turn. The addition to Attack may seem small and not particularly noteworthy, but 12 Attack EVs is the minimum to guarantee that +6 Drain Punch KOes specially defensive Heatran.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to balance risk and reward when setting up, as a failed or premature Belly Drum can prove disastrous. Cawmodore is usually not an early-game sweeper, and its obvious counters need to be eliminated or weakened significantly before a Belly Drum is usually worth it. However, this does not mean Cawmodore can't come in at all earlier in the game, as its immunities do let it switch in and threaten out certain Pokemon.</p> <p>Even though Cawmodore has Volt Absorb, it is important to remember that Kyurem-B can still bust through with Fusion Bolt thanks to Teravolt. Also keep in mind that using Bullet Punch can cause an opposing Sucker Punch to fail as long as the opponent is slower. In particular, this means that Cawmodore can gamble with opposing Colossoil and choose to use Bullet Punch to prevent a predicted Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey is a fantastic teammate, as it can provide Wish support and can absorb Flamethrowers with ease. Wish support in general can be helpful to restore Cawmodore's HP in the event that its first Belly Drum attempt didn't end very well. Memento users such as Volkraken can give Cawmodore an opportunity to set up, though the cost of a teammate can be pricey. Landorus can take out some of Cawmodore's most notable counters, such as Cyclohm, and it can be a good special attacker to pair with Cawmodore.</p>"

  "Volkraken": {
    "overview": "<p>Volkraken swoops out of its underwater abyss and threatens the metagame with its fearsome Special Attack and its ability to punish switch-ins with Analytic. Its rare typing gives it powerful STAB moves that complement its Special Attack while simultaneously giving Volkraken good coverage. Collectively, these traits allow Volkraken to perform multiple offensive roles and allow it to either be a revenge killer or a wallbreaker.</p> <p>However, one of the more dubious aspects about Volkraken is its odd Speed tier that leaves it somewhere between being an all-out sweeper and an Analytic abuser. As a result, Volkraken's item choice is a big factor in what role it can perform, often leading it into the role of a Choice attacker. Unfortunately, being weak to Stealth Rock and susceptible to all other entry hazards somewhat reduces its own opportunities to switch in. Overall, Volkraken tries to control the switch game on the opposing side of the field, but simultaneously has some trouble gaining switches itself. That said, Volkraken still has the potential to dish out massive damage and maybe even reveal a few surprises along the way, while its access to sacrificial moves such as Memento helps to differentiate it from other powerful attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower has better accuracy than Fire Blast, but the loss in power is noticeable. Assault Vest is handy for letting Volkraken take some special attacks, most notably Thunderbolt. In general, however, Volkraken appreciates extra Speed or power more. Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit the rare Water / Ground types such as Quagsire, whereas Hidden Power Ground allows Volkraken to hit Cyclohm and Mollux. Substitute can be used to avoid status, most notably paralysis. Red Card can be useful if a faster foe hits Volkraken; the foe will be forced to switch out, letting Volkraken land an Analytic boost against a new target. Though this is not reliable, it does allow for another opportunity for Volkraken to abuse Analytic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: With resistances to Volkraken's STAB moves, bulky Water-types can usually come in safely and chip away with their STAB attacks. Arghonaut in particular counters Volkraken, while Krilowatt threatens Volkraken back with its Electric-type STAB moves. Though they are rarer, Kingdra absolutely tanks Volkraken's STAB attacks and Gastrodon can potentially net a Storm Drain boost from Volkraken's Water-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Taking neutral damage from all of Volkraken's moves and shrugging the blows off, Chansey can come in and Toxic stall Volkraken or whittle away its HP with Seismic Toss. Switching in on a Choice Specs + Analytic set cannot be done unless healthy, however. Once in, hits become softer due to Chansey's naturally lower Speed.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Most Dragon-types will resist both of Volkraken's STAB moves. Latias can take multiple hits and recover the damage. Garchomp can KO with Earthquake and doesn't have to worry about much other than a Scald burn. Cyclohm has Electric-type STAB attacks, but has to worry about taking multiple hits due to its weaker Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Most of the bulkier Electric-types have the potential to tank a lot of Volkraken's moves, but they still don't want to switch in. Rotom-W stands out for resisting both of Volkraken's STAB moves, while Plasmanta is notable for being immune to Volkraken's Water-type moves (but it doesn't want to take a Fire Blast at all).</p> <p><strong>Powerful Neutral Priority</strong>: Boosted or Choice Band priority moves can be a thorn in Volkraken's side, potentially allowing it to be KOed before it can move. However, if Volkraken survives a priority move, its Analytic will activate.</p> <p><strong>Mollux</strong>: Thanks to Dry Skin, Mollux can take hits well and can potentially regain HP if brought in on a Water-type move. It fears Hidden Power Ground, which is thankfully rare, and Power Gem, so it should only be switching in once Volkraken is known to be Choice-locked into a different move.</p> <p><strong>Fast Rock-types</strong>: Aerodactyl and Stratagem can generally take out non-Choice Scarf Volkraken, though they can't switch in directly. Focus Sash Stratagem can mess up even Choice Scarf variants of Volkraken, however.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Being paralyzed hinders Volkraken's sweeping ability, but it also can make Analytic even deadlier.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is a fairly reliable STAB move with more firepower than its alternatives. Surf and Hydro Pump rounds out Volkraken's STAB coverage. Scald is an alternative, but might miss KOs against Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <p>Destiny Bond can be used against some slower threats for a surprise KO; this is particularly useful when Volkraken is blazingly fast thanks to Choice Scarf. Memento can be used as a sacrificial move to help Volkraken's next teammate set up. U-turn allows Volkraken to keep momentum and lets it have more flexibility in the switch wars that it aims to control.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Volkraken to outspeed most Pokemon and its choice of nature comes down to a few threats. With a Modest nature, Volkraken outspeeds the likes of Mega Manectric and Mega Beedrill. With a Timid nature, it can outspeed Aurumoth even after it has a single Speed boost up, as well as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. However, regardless of the choice of nature, the EVs are standard for a special sweeper.</p> <p>The choice of ability is fairly subjective, though Volkraken normally appreciates Analytic to be able to punish the foe for switching in and out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For the most part, Choice Scarf Volkraken plays like a standard hit-and-run revenge killer. However, what Volkraken lacks in coverage, it makes up for with a few niche tricks. While predicting obvious switches is always helpful, Analytic Volkraken shouldn't be too afraid to use Hydro Pump or Fire Blast most of the time. That said, foes with abilities that grant immunity to Fire or Water are usually a sign that trouble is on the way, so risk-reward decisions become important. However, Volkraken with U-turn can opt to play it safe and avoid these risky situations.</p> <p>For those not opting for U-turn, at the start of the match, it is strongly advised to begin thinking about which threat is best for Volkraken to use Memento or Destiny Bond against (if any at all). These moves are highly conditional but can provide fantastic team support if used properly. That said, most of the time Volkraken would rather provide assistance by using its attacking options and staying alive.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically bulky partners, especially those that can take Ground-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks, are great partners to Volkraken in terms of type synergy. Cawmodore works surprisingly well, but both it and Volkraken are wrecked by Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt due to Teravolt. However, Cawmodore gets a special mention for Memento sets. There are few things that would make it worth it for Volkraken to sacrifice itself, but providing support to one of the most fearsome Belly Drum sweepers in the metagame is arguably one of the more worthy causes available.</p> <p>Spinners and Defoggers are helpful, if not mandatory, as Volkraken greatly appreciates entry hazard removal support, especially with all of the switches involved on a Choice set. Colossoil in particular can be a great partner, as it is immune to the Electric-type attacks that Volkraken fears. Physical attackers such as Colossoil can help get rid of the special walls that plague Volkraken. Generally, Volkraken should always be played with a teammate or two that can take out Chansey.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Volkraken's reliable Fire-type STAB move, and the extra power over Flamethrower really adds up when stacked with Volkraken's item and a potential Analytic boost. Hydro Pump is Volkraken's most powerful Water-type STAB move. Scald is an option as well, but might miss KOs against Mega Charizard Y or Assault Vest Landorus-T. Hydro Pump and Scald can actually be used on the same set if you forego Volkraken's last moveslot, as together they provide both power and utility. Surf, however, is not recommended on this set due to the lack of Pokemon that it can KO that Scald cannot. U-turn allows Volkraken to keep momentum and lets it have more flexibility in the switch wars that it aims to control. Hidden Power Ground is an option over U-turn to hit Mollux.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs makes Volkraken stupidly powerful. A Modest nature is usually preferred for the extra power, though Timid lets Volkraken outspeed a few rare threats such as Jolly Excadrill. Even with U-turn, Volkraken should still use an Attack-lowering nature due to its pitiful base Attack. The EVs are standard for a special attacker.</p> <p>The choice of ability can be a toss-up at times, though Volkraken normally appreciates Analytic to be able to punish the foe for switching in and out, something that is especially handy when the boost stacks with Volkraken's item boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set plays as a typical wallbreaker for the most part. If using Analytic, Volkraken's Fire Blast and Hydro Pump will hit most foes extremely hard on the switch, so they are the safest moves for prediction's sake. However, Volkraken must beware of potential Pokemon that can absorb its STAB moves if holding Choice Specs; having to switch out because you mispredicted eats up valuable momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners and Defoggers are helpful, if not mandatory, as Volkraken greatly appreciates entry hazard removal support, especially with all of the switches involved on a Choice set. Colossoil in particular can be a great partner, as it is immune to the Electric-type attacks that Volkraken fears. Due to its sometimes lackluster Speed, Volkraken also appreciates Sticky Web support from Necturna, but this hinders Analytic boosts except in instances of switching.</p> <p>In terms of type synergy, physically bulky partners that can take Ground-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks are great partners to Volkraken. Cawmodore fills this niche surprisingly well, but both it and Volkraken can be defeated by Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt due to Teravolt. Physical attackers such as Colossoil can help rid the special walls that plague Volkraken. Generally, Volkraken should always be played with a teammate or two that can take out Chansey.</p>"

  "Plasmanta": {
    "overview": "<p>Plasmanta is a powerful special attacker that makes use of its unique Electric/ Poison typing to check common threats such as Mega Scizor, Pyroak, Tomohawk, and Fairy-types. Plasmanta's key resistances to Electric-, Steel-, Fairy-, Flying-, Poison-, and Grass-type moves in addition to Storm Drain give it plenty of opportunities to switch in, and its decent 60 / 119 / 98 defensive stats and access to support moves such as Taunt, Haze, and Encore allows it to perform more defensive roles well.</p> <p>Unfortunately, two common weaknesses, to Psychic- and Ground-type attacks, limit what Plasmanta can effectively check and leave it checked by common threats such as Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Aurumoth. Plasmanta's offensive movepool is small, consisting mainly of STAB moves, Dazzling Gleam, Psychic, Psyshock, and Hidden Power. This means that Plasmanta is reliant on Hidden Power to get past Steel-types and Ground-types, which leaves it horribly walled by a large group of Pokemon depending on it moveset. Plasmanta also has trouble getting past common special walls, such as Chansey, and its lack of reliable recovery outside of Black Sludge severely limits its walling ability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Discharge can be used as an alternative to Thunderbolt, but the higher Base Power of Thunderbolt is preferable on the offensive set. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple switch-ins such as Latias, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gallade, but it does not affect Ground- and Electric-types such as Colossoil and Cyclohm. Clear Smog can prevent stop setup sweepers but can't be prevented through Taunt, unlike Haze. Unfortunately, it can't stop Steel-type setup sweepers, such as Scizor and Cawmodore. Hidden Power Ground can be used to get past Heatran, Mollux, and opposing Plasmanta, but this leaves Plasmanta walled by Ground-types and unable to break Ferrothorn and Cawmodore. Choice Scarf can be used to revenge kill faster threats, such as Cawmodore, more reliably, but both Electric- and Poison-type moves are easy to take advantage of when locked into. Choice Scarf also faces serious competition from other Electric-types such as Magnezone, Rotom-W, and Raikou, which have access to Volt Switch and better coverage. Air Balloon can be use to allow Plasmanta to serve as a one-time check to Mega Altaria, but the item is easy to get rid of and leaves Plasmanta with no passive recovery. Plasmanta can make use of Water Pulse and Thunder on rain teams, as a rain-boosted Water Pulse has a decent chance to 2HKO Assault Vest Colossoil and OHKO Landorus-T after one round of Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Ground-types such as Gliscor, Colossoil, and Landorus-T can easily switch in and threaten to KO Plasmanta with their STAB moves, and they only fear Hidden Power Ice. Ground-type coverage also allows Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Azumarill, Keldeo, and Tomohawk to get past Plasmanta.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Specially defensive Heatran can take any attack Plasmanta can throw at it and hit it hard with its Fire-type STAB moves or Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gallade can all tank a hit from Plasmanta and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Frailer Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Mega Medicham will take considerable damage on the switch, though.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Gothitelle and Dugtrio can switch into Plasmanta and remove it from play, but both have to be wary of switching into Life Orb-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey and Mollux, can tank Plasmanta's attacks and slowly wear it down, but they must be careful of being locked into a status move. Mollux must also be wary of Psychic-type coverage on Plasmanta.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur can wall the defensive set and proceed to either wear it down with Leech Seed or 2HKO it with Earthquake, but it cannot check the offensive set reliably, as a Life Orb-boosted Sludge Wave will always 2HKO Mega Venusaur after a round of Stealth Rock damage and has a high chance to 2HKO it without Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Plasmanta lacks Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Ferrothorn can wall it to no end. Cawmodore can also use Plasmanta as setup bait, but it must be wary of being Encored into Belly Drum. Mega Metagross can also tank a hit and KO Plasmanta with Zen Headbutt or Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb allows Plasmanta to reliably check slower Fairy-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, Togekiss, Azumarill, and non-Mega Gardevoir, and it also allows Plasmanta to deal considerable damage to Mega Altaria. Sludge Bomb also allows Plasmanta to check Pyroak while still getting solid hits on Electric-types such as Cyclohm. Hidden Power is used to round out Plasmanta's coverage. Hidden Power Fire is the preferred option, as it allows Plasmanta to check Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Cawmodore, and without it, Plasmanta is setup bait for Cawmodore and Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice can be used if checking Steel-types is not a priority for Plasmanta, as it deals solid damage to common switch-ins such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice is also this set's best option against Assault Vest Colossoil, but even then, it will only do chip damage at best. Haze allows Plasmanta to better check setup sweepers such as Cawmodore, Mega Scizor, and Clefable. Taunt and Encore are primarily for disrupting slower walls and for discouraging setup; Taunt allows Plasmanta to stop recovery, entry hazards, Defog, and phazing, while Encore can steal momentum and force switches by locking opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge provides Plasmanta with its only source of recovery and can punish Trick users. A Bold nature gives a welcome boost to Plasmanta's Defense. 100 Speed EVs allow Plasmanta with Hidden Power Fire to outspeed Adamant Mega Altaria and hit it hard with Sludge Bomb. The rest of the EVs are put into HP and Defense for maximum physical bulk. If Plasmanta uses Hidden Power Ice, an EV spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe is enough to outspeed Adamant Mega Altaria. A second spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 200 Spe, or 252 HP / 64 Def / 196 Spe if running Hidden Power Ice, can be used to outspeed positive-natured Mega Altaria, but this takes away a good deal of Plasmanta's bulk and gives Cawmodore's Knock Off a slim chance to OHKO Plasmanta after Stealth Rock. If getting the jump on base 80 Speed Pokemon is not a priority, an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spa can be used, as it noticeably increases Plasmanta's bulk and makes it a better check to Cawmodore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to scout for Ground-type coverage on Azumarill, Sylveon, and Keldeo; Bulldoze and Hidden Power Ground can blow holes into Plasmanta. If they do lack Ground-type coverage, Azumarill, Sylveon, and Keldeo are great oppurtunities for Plasmanta to switch in. Plasmanta can also freely switch-in on water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune, even picking up a boost if it comes in on their STAB moves. If it's possible, try to switch Plasmanta in on Water-type moves, but be careful of switching into secondary STAB or coverage moves. When Plasmanta is conscious, it can actively discourage the use of Water-type moves from the foe, so don't be surprised if you switch your Plasmanta into Volkraken's Fire Blast or Rotom-W's Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Depending on the choice of Hidden Power, Plasmanta will need have team support to handle Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon, and even with Hidden Power, it will still struggle against bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Colossoil and Heatran. Pokemon that can easily handle Ground-types, such as Gliscor and Tomohawk, make for great teammates. Wish passers, such as Clefable and Chansey, can help make up for Plasmanta's lack of reliable recovery moves. Dark-types such as Colossoil, Bisharp, and Weavile can easily switch into Psychic-type attacks targeted towards Plasmanta and can provide Pursuit support to remove Plasmanta's Psychic-type checks. Plasmanta enjoys having a secondary check to Cawmodore as a teammate, whether it be Haze Tomohawk, Unaware Clefable, or a special Choice Scarf user. This takes off a lot of pressure on Plasmanta to stay healthy and leaves it free to check Pokemon such as Keldeo and Rotom-W. Pokemon that enjoy Plasmanta's ability to soak up Water- and Grass-type attacks, such as Gliscor, Colossoil, and Stratagem, make for good teammates. They also encourage the use of Water-type attacks, which Plasmanta can use to get a Special Attack boost through Storm Drain. Gyarados also makes an excellent partner for Plasmanta, as it's able to setup on the Ground-types that threaten Plasmanta, and Plasmanta can absorb the Grass- and Electric-type attacks Gyarados attracts in return. Plasmanta also threatens Tomohawk and Fairy-types that can check Gyarados. Other Pokemon that can set up or threaten the Ground-types that check Plasmanta work well. Azumarill, Keldeo, and Serperior do this aptly, and Serperior can also pressure Electric-types such as Rotom-W.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Wave is Plasmanta's most powerful Poison-type STAB move, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO Pyroak and every relevant Fairy-type in the CAP Metagame. Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative to Sludge Wave, as it has an increased poison chance, but it hits for less damage and has a higher chance of triggering Guts on one of Plasmanta's most common switch-ins, Colossoil. Thunderbolt allows Plasmanta to deal heavy damage to Flying- and Water-types such as Tomohawk and Mega Slowbro. Hidden Power Fire allows Plasmanta to get past Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor. It also prevents Cawmodore from setting up on Plasmanta, although Cawmodore has to be wary of Encore regardless. Hidden Power Ice allows Plasmanta to get past some of its Ground-type checks. With a Life Orb, Plasmanta can OHKO Landorus-T and Garchomp and 2HKO Hippowdon with the move. Encore allows Plasmanta to force switches by locking slower Pokemon into undesirable moves, such as status moves, moves it resists, and Water-type attacks. Taunt or a fourth coverage move can be ran over Encore. Taunt prevents walls from healing, stops entry hazards from being set up, and prevents slower Pokemon from setting up. Psychic or Psyshock can be ran to hit opposing Poison-types hard. Psychic hits opposing Plasmanta and Mega Venusaur harder while 2HKOing specially defensive Mollux most of the time. Psyshock can be over Psychic to have a chance to OHKO Mollux after Stealth Rock damage. Dazzling Gleam can be run to deal more damage to Colossoil, and it is worth noting that a Modest Life Orb-boosted Dazzling Gleam can 2HKO Assault Vest Colossoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Plasmanta a significant boost to its damage output and is needed to guarantee the OHKO or 2HKO on several Pokemon, such as Pyroak, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Storm Drain allows Plasmanta to switch into Water-types more reliably and helps punish Scald spam, and the boost to its Special Attack allows Plasmanta to OHKO or 2HKO almost anything besides Chansey. The given EV spread gives Plasmanta as much Speed and Special Attack as possible. A Timid nature allows Plasmanta to Speed tie with base 100 Speed Pokemon, notably Manaphy, Mega Gardevoir, and Jirachi. A Modest nature can be used if Speed tying with base 100 Speed Pokemon is not a concern, as the extra power allows Plasmanta to grab several important OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the OHKO on specially defensive Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Plasmanta is meant to serve as an offensive check to Pokemon such as Keldeo, Cyclohm, Rotom-W, and Fairy-types. It should be noted that this Plasmanta cannot check Cawmodore, as a single Belly Drum-boosted Acrobatics will OHKO it. Be sure to scout for Ground-type coverage on Pokemon such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Pyroak before you switch Plasmanta in, as Bulldoze, Hidden Power Ground, and Earth Power will easily 2HKO or OHKO it. Make the best use of Encore as you can; Encore locks slower walls into status or recovery moves and offensive Pokemon into resisted or setup moves. If you can manage it, use Encore to lock a Pokemon into a Water-type attack, as a boosted Plasmanta can 2HKO almost the entire metagame. Be aware that Encore is expected on Plasmanta, and many opponents will switch Pokemon if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Depending on the choice of Hidden Power, Plasmanta will need to have team support to handle Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon, and even with Hidden Power, it will struggle against bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Colossoil and Heatran. Dark-types such as Colossoil, Bisharp, and Weavile can easily switch into Psychic-type attacks targeted towards Plasmanta and can provide Pursuit support to remove Plasmanta's Psychic-type checks. They also appreciate Plasmanta's ability to take on the Fairy-types they're weak too. Plasmanta enjoys entry hazard support, as Stealth Rock helps guarantee KOs on Pokemon such as Gliscor. Plasmanta also forces a lot of switches through its immunity to Water-type attacks and ability to Encore opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves, so having entry hazards up is a good way to wear down the opposing team. One of Plasmanta's best checks, Assault Vest Colossoil, can be worn down through the use of entry hazards. A dedicated check to Colossoil is appreciated, as it is only 3HKOed by a Modest Life Orb Hidden Power Ice and can do significant damage to Plasmanta with Pursuit. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Mega Altaria, Pyroak, Mega Scizor, and Tomohawk are all reliable Colossoil checks. Tomohawk can set up Stealth Rock and counter Colossoil and has good type synergy with Plasmanta. Tomohawk can handle Ground-types, and Plasmanta can handle Electric- and Fairy-types. Ground-types, such as Colossoil, enjoy Plasmanta's ability to switch into and threaten Water-types, and they can handle Mollux, opposing Plasmanta, and specially defensive Heatran. Pokemon that struggle with Fairy- and Flying-types, notably Fighting- and Grass-types such as Keldeo and Pyroak, enjoy Plasmanta's ability to switch in on them and threaten them. Gyarados also makes for an excellent partner for Plasmanta, as it's able to set up on the Ground-types that threaten Plasmanta, and Plasmanta can absorb the Grass- and Electric-type attacks Gyarados attracts in return. Plasmanta also threatens Tomohawk and Fairy-types that can check Gyarados. Other Pokemon that can set up or threaten the Ground-types that check Plasmanta work well. Azumarill, Keldeo, and Serperior do this aptly, and Serperior can also pressure Electric-types such as Rotom-W.</p>"
