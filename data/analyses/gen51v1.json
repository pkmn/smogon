Serperior should run 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature to have better odds against opposing Serperior, as a faster Serperior can force it into using Struggle with Taunt. The remaining EVs should be invested in Special Defense over HP to get the maximum percentage of Leech Seed recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Serperior can often use Protect on the first turn to scout its foe's move. It should not do this against Snorlax, however, as it should use Substitute first. This lets it play around Belly Drum + Custap Berry sets and force Choice Band + Giga Impact Snorlax to recharge, and Serperior still survives Choice Band Snorlax's Return after Substitute + Protect. It should almost always look to use Leech Seed turn 2, establishing damage and health regeneration for Substitute, followed by alternating between Substitute and Protect.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Volcarona is the best Fire-type in BW 1v1 due to its natural power and its access to Quiver Dance. Overheat does massive damage to non-resistant targets like Zapdos, while Bug Buzz threatens common Psychic-types like Cresselia, Latios, and Meloetta and comes without Overheat's stat drop. Volcarona's last move is quite customizable. Substitute buys Volcarona a free turn on status moves, gives it a better matchup against other Volcarona, and allows it to fish for misses on inaccurate attacks such as Choice Band Sawk's Stone Edge. On the other hand, Flame Charge guarantees the win against Magnezone, and Roost helps against other Volcarona and stall Snorlax. Charti Berry is used to survive various Rock-type coverage moves, like Choice Scarf Heracross's Rock Slide or Choice Specs Magnezone's Hidden Power Rock.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Special Defense investment allows Volcarona to survive Choice Specs Zapdos's Hidden Power Flying. The Speed investment allows Volcarona to outspeed Magnezone.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Volcarona can take an OHKO on turn 1, such as against Metagross, Celebi, or Genesect, it will.</p> <p>To avoid being locked into Quiver Dance by Trick users such as Cresselia and Porygon-Z, Volcarona should use Bug Buzz or Overheat, respectively, on turn 1.</p> <p>Versus Latios, Volcarona has an unintuitively bad matchup. Bug Buzz is not guaranteed to OHKO no bulk Latios and it commonly carries Trick + Choice Specs or Calm Mind to stop Volcarona's Quiver Dance. Volcarona must choose between setting up Quiver Dance on an attack or Calm Mind or using Bug Buzz to use Latios's Choice Specs against it or go for a damage roll.</p> <p>Against opposing Volcarona, both players should use Quiver Dance repeatedly before attacking each other. If either player has Substitute, they should use it early on to force the opponent to lower their Special Attack with Overheat. If you have Roost, use it to heal off damage from Overheat.</p> <p>Substitute allows Volcarona to fish for misses on inaccurate Rock-type moves from slower opponents like Tyranitar, and may buy free turns if the opponent decides to set up, like against Bulk Up Scrafty or Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Flame Charge breaks Magnezone's Sturdy so that Volcarona does not have to worry about Mirror Coat.</p> <p>Roost allows Volcarona to outlast stall Snorlax's Seismic Toss and boost up to +6 to match Snorlax's Amnesia boosts. It then 4HKOes most stall Snorlax with Bug Buzz. Roost is also helpful versus opposing Volcarona, since it heals off damage from Overheat and forces them to use Quiver Dance to regain maximum Special Attack.</p>"

Rock Wrecker is Crustle's strongest STAB move and with a Rock Gem and Shell Smash boost, it can OHKO most Pokemon that do not resist it, such as Snorlax and Latias. Rock Blast is useful against Pokemon that try to set up Substitute, such as Volcarona, Thundurus, Aerodactyl, and Serperior. X-Scissor allows Crustle to more reliably hit Pokemon such as Cresselia. Earthquake can be used to have better matchups against Heatran and Terrakion. Counter can be used in conjunction with Sturdy to punish physical attackers, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Crustle almost always runs 252 Attack EVs due to needing as much damage as possible from Shell Smash. It also almost always runs 252 Speed EVs to outspeed Tornadus-T after a Shell Smash. Adamant is the preferred nature because Crustle does not gain any meaningful matchups having a Jolly nature other than against opposing Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle's strength lies in its combination of Sturdy, Shell Smash, and Rock Wrecker. Sturdy allows Crustle to often freely use Shell Smash and attack first on turn two. However, Crustle struggles against Pokemon that can use moves like Taunt, which is commonly used by Heatran, Jellicent, and Sableye. It also struggles against Pokemon with priority moves, such as Keldeo, Genesect, and Mienshao, which can either break Sturdy or attack it after Sturdy activates. Despite having difficulties against Trick, Crustle can still perform well against Choice Scarf Cresselia and Choice Specs Latios if it has X-Scissor. If Crustle has X-Scissor, it is important to not use Shell Smash on the first turn against these Pokemon, as they can use Trick to lock Crustle into Shell Smash. Crustle, however, still struggles against Porygon-Z and Jellicent, which also commonly use Trick.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Crustle can also use a variety of different items with this set, including Mail, which makes Crustle immune to with Trick, and Lum Berry, which can heal a burn from Heatran, Arcanine, or Sableye's Will-O-Wisp, which Crustle struggles against. Choice Band Crustle is also an option, but it is generally worse than Rock Gem sets, as it cannot use Shell Smash.</p>"

Some of the most common matchups with more complex sequences are listed below.</p> <p>To defeat Crustle, first use Trick to potentially lock the opponent into Shell Smash and remove Rock Gem, then use Icy Wind to break Crustle's Sturdy, and finally use Hyper Beam to KO Crustle.</p> <p>Versus Custap Berry users like Venusaur and Garchomp, you will have to guess whether to use Uproar on a potential Endure or Hyper Beam. Note that Garchomp more commonly uses Yache Berry instead, so it is usually safer to use Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Although Hyper Beam does not OHKO Cresselia, it is useful for Porygon-Z in this matchup anyway. Provided Cresselia is not holding Mail, Porygon-Z should use Trick turn 1 onto Cresselia to lock it into a potential status move before continually using Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam outdamages Rest and Moonlight, eventually resulting in a win for Porygon-Z.</p> <p>Many other stall Pokemon, like Registeel, Snorlax, and Manaphy, may use Mail to block Trick; watch for it on Team Preview and be mindful of it in game.</p>"
