  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur used to be used more often in earlier RBY OU metagames, but it fell out of favor due to the amount of Psychic- and Ice-type moves, as well as paralysis, thrown around. Still, it stands out as a Swords Dance wallbreaker that isn't hindered by Rhydon, and it can cleave through bulky Water-types like Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro thanks to Razor Leaf: Razor Leaf is one of the most consistent ways to dispatch Slowbro in the tier, and deceptively few teams are actually prepared for it. Venusaur is one of faster viable sleepers in the tier, only being outsped by Jynx and Gengar. It can act as a soft check to Snorlax, which is unlikely to 3HKO Venusaur and may be forced into a Rest loop by Razor Leaf, letting Venusaur set up. Venusaur often can be a two-for-one with sleep as one \"KO\", and Swords Dance + Hyper Beam picking up the second.</p> <p>However, a horrible defensive typing makes Venusaur harder to use effectively. It takes super effective damage from the very common Psychic and Blizzard, which will often deal heavy damage or force it out. Because of this, Venusaur adds very little defensive synergy to a team. Secondly, Venusaur's coverage is limited to Grass and Normal, allowing Gengar to hard wall it. Finally, it has competition with Victreebel. Victreebel also has STAB Razor Leaf, gets Wrap and Stun Spore, and has a higher Attack stat. It, however, has lower Defense and Speed than Venusaur. This means that, although Venusaur is less prone to being revenge killed by Tauros and never has to worry about Cloyster speed ties, it lacks the surprise factor and misses out on a few important damage ranges when compared to Victreebel, further narrowing its niche.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to keep a Pokemon out of play for up to the entirety of the game. Combined with Venusaur's Speed, you should be able to find an opportunity to land sleep in most games. Razor Leaf is Venusaur's best STAB option, landing a critical hit 99.6% of the time. Razor Leaf's primary target will be Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro in addition to Rhydon. However, Razor Leaf also notably can 2HKO Tauros after just a little chip damage, while Tauros is unable to 2HKO Venusaur back. Swords Dance allows Venusaur to wallbreak and sweep when paired with Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Venusaur primarily uses sleep from itself or a teammate to set up Swords Dance. One of the best times to set up is immediately after sleeping a Pokemon, which gives a free turn whether it switches or stays in. Another good time is when an opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax or Slowbro is about to use Rest; you can also use Razor Leaf instead to deal damage to a switch-in or force Snorlax into a Rest loop. Before setting up, you also should deal with key threats that outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with high damage or paralysis—especially Gengar, which hard walls it—and avoid any damage or status unless Venusaur absolutely has to take it. After one Swords Dance, Venusaur has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Alakazam and OHKOes Chansey with a bit of initial damage; after a second Swords Dance, it has an 84.6% to KO Starmie with a single Hyper Beam. At +6 Attack, a majority of Pokemon that do not resist Hyper Beam will be OHKOed. Even if Venusaur fails to sweep an entire team, you likely got sleep off and took out at least one fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, possibly Tauros. This lets Venusaur enable Rhydon due to Tauros being one of the main obstacles for Rhydon. Rhydon also pairs nicely with Venusaur because it handles threats such as Zapdos and Pin Missile Jolteon that threaten Venusaur.</p> <p>When using Venusaur, you should not put it in the lead spot. Its Speed does not allow it to do well against any of the common leads, and leading off puts Venusaur in the face of danger early, which can weaken its offensive potential. Waiting to deploy Venusaur lets it get sleep off without risking any Speed ties with Exeggutor. If you paralyze the common leads—Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx—before getting sleep, they often cannot switch in comfortably anyway. Starmie will be threatened by Razor Leaf, and Alakazam and Jynx will usually fall to a +2 Hyper Beam. Body Slam may look enticing for its paralysis chance and lack of recharging, but it is not strong enough to make as much use out of Swords Dance as Hyper Beam.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Charizard is completely unviable in RBY OU, being outclassed by fellow Fire / Flying type Pokemon Moltres in almost every way. Moltres packs a higher Special stat and Agility, making it a more powerful threat better suited for the OU metagame. Charizard finds itself overwhelmed by common Water-types like Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster, and there's very little it can do in return. Additionally, while Swords Dance could make you assume it has some sort of niche, many better Swords Dance users exist such as Kingler, Kabutops, and Sandslash. The only benefits to using Charizard over Moltres are its base 100 Speed, Swords Dance, and Slash. +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake can threaten most Pokemon, but it's difficult to use Swords Dance due to the omnipresence of Thunder Wave users like Alakazam and Starmie, and being paralyzed makes Charizard's fragility much more apparent. Its weaknesses to common attacking types leave it 2HKOed by Starmie, Slowbro, Zapdos, Jolteon, most Blizzards, and Gengar, as well as OHKOed by Rhydon and Golem.

Earthquake threatens Jolteon and Rock-types, which threaten Charizard. Slash gives Charizard immediate power without the need for setup, ignoring Reflect and knocking most Pokemon into range for a +2 Hyper Beam. Fire Blast threatens Jynx, Exeggutor, and Victreebel while scaring Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax with the risk of game-losing burns. However, it risks thawing frozen Pokemon and burning Pokemon that appreciate the resulting immunity to other status effects, such as Starmie.

  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>A cursory glance at Raticate may lead one to quickly disregard it as simply a worse Persian. Indeed, the cat and mouse share many similarities such as a Normal typing and access to Thunderbolt and Bubble Beam to strengthen specific matchups, but Raticate suffers from worse attacking stats and a significantly worse Speed tier. However, Raticate has a distinct niche thanks to its exclusive access to Super Fang. RBY OU is a metagame where KO ranges are a crucial factor for players to keep in mind, as nothing wants to be in range of an enemy Tauros. Super Fang's consistent damage is incredible for getting foes to these KO ranges and is guaranteed to leave a dent in anything that attempts to switch in; most importantly, Super Fang ignores type immunity against Gengar, which is one of Raticate's major strengths over Persian, as it limits the number of times that Gengar can switch in safely. Against frailer or weakened targets, Raticate can also threaten them with a Hyper Beam afterwards to KO; additionally, with its great base 97 Speed, it outpaces many Pokemon in the metagame, such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, and threatens them with massive damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all cheddar and fruit for this humble rodent. Raticate is incredibly frail, making it difficult to switch in and repeatedly wear down foes. This, combined with Super Fang's 89.5% accuracy and 16 PP, can allow faster foes like Starmie and Alakazam with reliable one-turn recovery moves to stall out Raticate's Super Fangs until it misses or runs out of PP. Raticate isn't just frail, either: its defensive profile is decidedly mediocre, meaning it can't afford to trade blows often and thus often loses a flat one-on-one fight; Super Fang's imperfect accuracy also means that missing an attack will force Raticate to take a potentially fatal blow in return, something it cannot afford. Finally, Raticate's attacking stats are very average, which often prevents it from KOing bulkier foes even after a Super Fang. As a result of these flaws, Raticate is heavily reliant on good prediction to be effective in its role, and as such, it is not recommended for most RBY OU teams because Tauros is normally all that's necessary. Even if a \"second Tauros\" is desirable, Persian is usually the better choice.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Raticate should be used exclusively mid- to late-game when faster foes such as Starmie have been paralyzed or as an emergency Snorlax switch-in. Super Fang is obligatory, as it is Raticate's only notable niche in OU and allows it to consistently deal significant damage; notably, it's able to wear down Snorlax, one of the premier defensive Pokemon in RBY. Hyper Beam is Raticate's strongest follow-up after a Super Fang, KOing non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam as well as Victreebel most of the time. Body Slam is spammable and allows Raticate to fish for paralysis on common switch-ins like Starmie. It's also useful after Super Fang as a way to fish for paralysis as Alakazam or Starmie uses Recover. Bubble Beam is Raticate's preferred coverage move because it is very likely to KO Rhydon after Super Fang, which is likely to switch in anticipating a Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>While Raticate's first three moves are too important to drop, its last moveslot is more flexible; though, it should be noted that with the exception of Blizzard, replacing Bubble Beam will significantly compromise the Rhydon matchup. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Cloyster, potentially taking it out with a critical hit after a Super Fang. Tail Whip is an option that can be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing a paralyzed Raticate to once again outspeed opposing paralyzed Pokemon while also putting foes in range for Raticate's attacks. Blizzard has a useful freeze chance and is Raticate's strongest option against Gengar and Dragonite, but it has a lower chance to KO Rhydon after a Super Fang than Bubble Beam. Finally, Quick Attack can be used to chip a faster foe such as Tauros before Raticate goes down, but it's very situational and Raticate struggles to find much room for it.</p>"

Raichu can use its unique coverage to force paralysis past usual paralysis absorbers, such as Starmie and Chansey, and onto foes that will usually attempt to avoid paralysis, such as Exeggutor and Alakazam.</p> <p>However, Raichu is 3HKOed at best by most physical attacks and loses one-on-one to nearly every physical attacker.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf and Submission are both droppable within reason, as Rhydon and Golem still have to fear the potential of Raichu having Surf, and Submission's accuracy and recoil make it unreliable even for its intended purpose; Raichu can drop either one. Seismic Toss 4HKOes Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Jolteon and is Raichu's best option to hit Exeggutor. Body Slam has an 87.7% chance to 4HKO Jolteon and a slim chance to 4HKO Chansey. It also 6HKOes Exeggutor, but it is generally lacking in power, and Raichu would much rather run Submission or Seismic Toss. Hyper Beam 2HKOes Jynx and Alakazam and deals decent damage to other foes, such as Chansey and Jolteon. Agility can be used to outspeed faster foes, such as Alakazam, even if Raichu is paralyzed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor walls Raichu's usual coverage and threatens back with status and a strong Psychic. However, Exeggutor is outsped and dislikes taking paralysis. Seismic Toss helps alleviate this slightly, as it 4HKOes Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Raichu without Submission cannot pressure Chansey that well, 7HKOing it at best with Thunderbolt and almost always 5HKOing it with Body Slam, while Chansey can easily status and wear down Raichu in return. Even with Submission, Chansey can paralyze Raichu and try to heal off the damage in many situations, given Submission's 80% accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax 2HKOes Raichu with Earthquake and 3HKOes it with Body Slam, while Raichu can only 4HKO it in return with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: Jolteon with Rest walls Raichu without Body Slam, and while it can't do much damage to Raichu, Jolteon will wear down Raichu over time. However, a sleeping Jolteon is extremely exploitable and can be forced out with ease by the likes of Tauros.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam 3HKOes Raichu with Psychic and walls it with Recover, although Alakazam hates paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Gengar and Tauros</strong>: Gengar and Tauros both outspeed Raichu and threaten it with Hypnosis and Earthquake, respectively.

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandslash is often overlooked in RBY OU, but it realizes a dangerous niche with its unique combination of typing, movepool, and Speed tier. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, and it is just fast enough to outpace many crucial threats, including Rhydon, Chansey, and Exeggutor. As a Ground-type, it is frailer than Rhydon and Golem, less powerful to start, and doesn't resist Normal, making it a poor pivot. However, it can sweep, is faster, and beats the two one-on-one by virtue of its Ground neutrality. As a Swords Dance user, its winning matchup against Rhydon, Electric immunity, and consistent STAB Earthquake make up for its lower offensive stats. In particular, its Thunder Wave immunity provides both a consistent entry point for sweeping and a partial safeguard against sweep-ending paralysis, a weakness that plagues all other viable Swords Dance users. Overall, though, Sandslash is frequently defined by its shortcomings. No Normal or Flying resistance means it can't be a primary physical tank or a firm Zapdos answer, unlike Rhydon or Golem. It has low Speed, low Special, a plethora of weaknesses, and merely respectable power before setup, which leave it easily forced out and picked off. Most notably, the excellent Starmie can harry it in all stages of a battle. Unlike all other viable Swords Dance users, it misses the crucial OHKO on Chansey after a boost. Still, with paralysis support and against slower teams, Sandslash can be a very potent offensive weapon while checking Rhydon, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Golem in emergencies.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash has other moves that seem appealing, but all of the legitimate options have already been discussed. Rest could theoretically help it defensively, but it's too slow and burdened by weaknesses. A traditional physical tank set would be outclassed by Rhydon, Kabutops, or even Snorlax. Slash is a good move, but Kabutops uses it better, and it has poor synergy with Swords Dance. Toxic discourages partial trapping and forces out Reflect users, but it's too fringe and has many better users. Sand Attack can let Sandslash fish for safe turns to survive attacks or set up, but it's an overly inconsistent gimmick for spending a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: All OU Ice-types can easily OHKO Sandslash. Cloyster is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Sandslash and tanks its hits for easy momentum, though with accuracy factored in, Blizzard only has about a 60% chance to OHKO it from full health. Furthermore, Cloyster can get overburdened as a check to many threats, and lure options like Thunderbolt Tauros and Self-Destruct Snorlax can remove it. Lapras has less physical bulk and is outsped by Sandslash, making it vulnerable if worn down, but it can comfortably survive a +2 hit and always OHKO Sandslash with Blizzard. Articuno and Jynx fold to boosted Rock Slide and Earthquake, respectively, but they outspeed and safely revenge kill Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Although it requires the rare Hydro Pump to OHKO Sandlash without a critical hit, Starmie is nonetheless the most common impediment to a Sandslash sweep. Great Speed, high Special, and Recover all help Starmie check Sandslash consistently. It can have some difficulty switching in, though, as it detests being paralyzed by Body Slam and takes a solid chunk from Earthquake. Starmie also takes upwards of 74% from a +2 Earthquake, meaning Sandslash can often power through if Starmie is worn down or paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros tends to stop Sandslash dead in its tracks late-game by 2HKOing it with Blizzard, serving as one of its biggest obstacles. However, it takes more than 60% from a +2 Earthquake, which can let the opposing Tauros easily win the vital mirror matchup. Oddball sets lacking Blizzard have a more difficult time, as Sandslash can sometimes survive two Body Slams into Hyper Beam. If Sandslash can boost to +4 Attack, it has good odds to OHKO Tauros with Earthquake or Submission, a feat that can often be game-deciding.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although its improved matchup against Exeggutor is a major advantage of Sandslash over other Ground-types, overall it is far from guaranteed to win one-on-one. Hyper Beam misses, full paralysis from Stun Spore, and Mega Drain recovery can potentially let Exeggutor win. Even when Sandslash KOes Exeggutor, it often ends up paralyzed by Stun Spore or in Tauros's Blizzard or Hyper Beam KO range. Exeggutor can, however, end up worn down throughout a match, letting Sandslash get past it more safely. In a pinch, +2 Body Slam into Hyper Beam will KO Exeggutor 84% of the time assuming both moves connect, while Earthquake or Rock Slide instead of Body Slam drops the odds to ~45% without the possibility of paralysis. If Exeggutor manages to switch into an unboosted Sandslash without taking heavy damage, the matchup shifts dramatically in Exeggutor's favor. Explosion and Mega Drain can also allow Exeggutor to force a direct trade. Beyond Exeggutor, Sandslash is completely vulnerable to Victreebell and Venusaur, being outsped and usually OHKOed while failing to OHKO either at +2, though neither enjoys switching in considering their neutrality to Earthquake and dislike of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Alakazam can easily revenge kill weakened Sandslash, halting a sweep. Its prevalence in the lead matchup means it is often paralyzed though, allowing Sandslash to OHKO it risk free when set up. Jynx has a similar dynamic. Sandslash can try to set up on them late-game if your opponent's Pokemon are paralyzed and especially if Sandslash is running Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Sandslash is a shaky counter to Zapdos. It can't 2HKO Zapdos unboosted unless it runs Rock Slide, and Drill Peck makes it significantly more vulnerable when switching in and after setting up. Other Flying-types have better matchups still, as Moltres threatens it with a burn and 2HKOes it with Fire Blast, while Articuno OHKOes Sandslash with just Ice Beam. Dragonite performs the best, as Sandslash rarely OHKOes it at +2 without the inferior Rock Slide, and it is susceptible to Wrap and easily 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard. Even niche Flying-types such as Dodrio and Gyarados can give Sandslash quite a bit of trouble. Rock Slide can substantially threaten these Pokemon, especially Moltres and Articuno, but it is not standard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave but still vulnerable to Body Slam and Exeggutor's Stun Spore, both of which cripple its effectiveness. Swords Dance can somewhat compensate for this if the foe is also paralyzed, as using it will reapply the paralysis's Speed drops, rendering them slower. That being said, losing its already middling Speed tier is a death sentence with its vulnerability to special attacks, especially considering the prevalence of Ice Beam and Blizzard on slow Pokemon like Chansey, Lapras, and even Snorlax. Even independent of the Speed drop, any full paralysis turns are particularly devastating for a sweeper.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is obligatory for Sandslash's niche. STAB Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and heavily chunks the majority of the metagame after a boost. If running Body Slam, Sandslash can use it into Hyper Beam for the best odds to 2HKO Exeggutor at +2, one of its advantages over Golem and Rhydon. Body Slam also allows Sandslash to fish for paralysis on its common switch-ins, which can help it or Tauros sweep late-game. Alternatively, Rock Slide can cover Flying-types and the rare Pinsir, but it's no stronger than Earthquake against Pokemon like Cloyster, Lapras, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, Body Slam into Hyper Beam still 2HKOes Zapdos at +2. Despite its poor accuracy, Submission allows Sandslash to secure an OHKO on Tauros at +4, which is important because Tauros can impede a Sandslash sweep; it also occasionally OHKOes Chansey at +2 and Snorlax at +4. Substitute can be used over a coverage move, as it can afford Sandslash a free turn against a paralyzed foe, though it can be difficult to set up. Substitute further amplifies Sandslash's unique ability among Swords Dance users to defeat Zapdos, as Drill Peck only breaks Substitute around 30% of the time, allowing Sandslash to safely set up and sweep more effectively. If not used in the third moveslot, Body Slam can also be used in exchange for Hyper Beam due to the danger of Sandslash needing to recharge.</p> <p>Sandslash can reliably check most Rock- and Electric-types, with the exception of Jolteon, but doing so will usually prevent it from sweeping late-game. Therefore, you must determine whether a trade or the potential for a sweep is more valuable. To stay healthy to sweep, Sandslash is best brought in on Thunder Wave, via partial-trapping pivots, or with double switches. It benefits from being hidden until late in the game when it is in a position to sweep. If Sandslash is forced onto the field before a sweep is likely, it should generally lead with Body Slam to chip and potentially paralyze its checks, as using Swords Dance is rarely useful before the opponent's team has been fully scouted. When saved until late in the game, Sandslash can greatly benefit from an opportunity to boost to +4, which allows Earthquake to secure OHKOs on Chansey and Starmie and OHKO Tauros a majority of the time. Additionally, +4 Hyper Beam OHKOes Zapdos about 60% of the time and Exeggutor about 40% of the time, limiting their ability to impede a sweep. Be aware that calculations for +4 Hyper Beam assume it hits and doesn't critically hit, a combined 78.09% chance, so it's riskier in practice.</p> <p>Sandslash is at its most dangerous with paralysis support, and it has good synergy with many paralysis spreaders, including Zapdos, Starmie, Snorlax, and Chansey. The offensive prowess of Zapdos and Starmie in particular often forces paralysis on the opponent's team, either neutralizing foes like Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Starmie or providing setup opportunities against slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax and Exeggutor, which Sandslash enjoys coming in on. In return, Sandslash can set up and threaten the slow special tanks that limit them offensively, as well as effectively checking the Rock- and Electric- types that threaten them if a Sandslash sweep seems infeasible. Its reduced physical tanking capabilities versus Golem and Rhydon and weakness to Ice-type moves make Cloyster an ideal defensive partner, and Sandslash synergizes well by switching in on the Thunderbolts Cloyster draws in. Sandslash shares many switch-ins with Tauros, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Snorlax, and Starmie; it often clears the way for a late-game Tauros sweep even if it cannot sweep. Lastly, Sandslash is prone to being crippled by Body Slam paralysis, so Reflect Snorlax can also be effective to block that paralysis and generally help with tanking physical hits despite its lower immediate physical bulk. In return, Sandslash threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and heavily pressures Golem and Rhydon, which can give mono-Normal attacking Snorlax sets issues. Snorlax is also invaluable for drawing in, pressuring, and paralyzing Cloyster throughout a match, which is essential to the success of Sandslash.</p>"

      "Offensive": {"description": "<p>Body Slam is always a useful attack for its chance to inflict paralysis, and with the STAB boost, it has the potential to hurt some physically frail Pokemon such as Chansey.

Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful move to pick off a weakened Pokemon when other attacks can't. Thunderbolt can hit some Water-types, such as Starmie and Slowbro, moderately hard, while Thunder Wave is a more reliable move than Body Slam for spreading paralysis.

Thunder Wave is the most reliable paralysis-inducing move and is especially effective alongside Blizzard to hit the Ground-types that are immune to Electric-type moves. Sing can be used to induce sleep, but its 54.7% accuracy leaves something to be desired. Alternatively, Counter can bounce back physical attacks, particularly the very common Body Slam, to inflict some good damage off Clefable's decent HP. Thunderbolt complements Blizzard well for type coverage by hitting the Water-types that resist Ice-type attacks. On the other hand, Thunder can sometimes OHKO Gyarados and 2HKO Starmie, but it has low accuracy.</p>"}

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>Persian carves out a niche in RBY OU thanks to its ability to consistently land critical hits with Slash. Slash bypasses Reflect, allowing it to break through Reflect Snorlax. Its solid special coverage ensures that it's only fully walled by Gengar and is able to handle potential answers to Normal-types, such as Rhydon and Cloyster. Persian’s impressive Speed allows it to outspeed Tauros and tie with Starmie, making it an effective revenge killer. It also grants Persian a strong 22.46% critical hit rate. Tauros and Persian form a devastating offensive duo that's tough to handle, as absorbing their combined damage becomes a significant challenge.</p> <p>Despite its offensive potential, Persian is not a replacement for the rampaging bull, Tauros, which partly explains why it has never achieved true OU prominence. Persian is significantly less bulky, often getting 2HKOed by many attacks that Tauros can typically survive. Due to this weakness, Persian is often forced out by Thunder Wave users, such as Alakazam and Starmie. This lack of defensive utility is a key weakness, as Persian cannot afford to switch into any attacks, making it hard to get onto the field safely. Furthermore, since Persian is almost always paired with Tauros, this creates a team with two Pokemon that do not want to take hits, leading to a lack of space for defensive tools.</p> <p>Finally, although Slash is a strong move and always lands a critical hit by design, this means Persian's damage output with Slash is capped. In contrast, Tauros can deal nearly as much damage with Body Slam, but also has the potential to score critical hits and inflict paralysis, giving it higher overall potential in terms of both damage and utility. Persian demands sharp prediction and aggressive play to make the most of its strengths, but when used effectively, it can be very rewarding, particularly against more defensive strategies.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian’s other options are not very interesting. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to OHKO Pokemon like Starmie, creating mind games and encouraging switches. It also offers a helpful way to check for Counter from Chansey and Snorlax, potentially allowing Persian to land the move for free. Just like Growl, it can also allow to reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon. However, running Screech means sacrificing too many of Persian's essential moves. Thunder, on the other hand, 2HKOes Cloyster and deals more damage to Starmie than Thunderbolt, but its accuracy and reliability leave much to be desired, making it a less consistent option overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gengar: Persian can't fight Gengar at all, possessing only its special coverage to have even a hope in doing so. Even Thunder only has a vague chance to 5HKO it, so Persian is often forced out while giving Gengar free rein to use an uncontested Hypnosis or force damage onto Persian's teammates. Ideally, Gengar should be accounted for and dispatched before even revealing Persian.</p> <p>Paralysis: Persian can't handle paralysis, which makes its lack of bulk much more apparent and easier to exploit. Worse still, being paralyzed completely diminishes Persian's potential to revenge kill, making it little more than food for opposing Snorlax and Tauros. Many Pokemon, like Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Cloyster, can even 2HKO it with little consequence when it's paralyzed.</p> <p>Starmie: Starmie is capable of stomaching Slash + Hyper Beam and Speed ties with Persian, which, combined with its access to Thunder Wave, makes it very capable of downing the cat. Persian is capable of winning against a paralyzed Starmie, but it will often rely on full paralysis to win if Starmie is at full HP.</p> <p>Tauros: Without Growl shenanigans, Tauros can 2HKO Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam, while Persian can only threaten it with Slash followed by a critical hit from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Snorlax: Snorlax with Hyper Beam can take on Persian, as it 2HKOes with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and it has the bulk necessary to withstand Persian’s attacks. It just needs to be cautious of a potential Growl.</p> <p>Exeggutor: With its fantastic bulk, Exeggutor can win against Persian one-on-one, threatening it with Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, or a 2HKO from Psychic. However, it will take massive damage in the process, often being forced to use Explosion much sooner than usual.</p> <p>Counter: Counter is a major annoyance for Persian because it doesn’t have an efficient way to scout for it. This makes Snorlax and Chansey with Counter tough for Persian to handle. If Persian revenge kills something, Chansey can easily come in and threaten Thunder Wave, forcing Persian to switch out to avoid paralysis. This allows Chansey to use Counter on the incoming Pokemon, dealing significant damage and putting the Persian player in a tough spot.</p> <p>Rhydon: While it is 2HKOed by Bubble Beam, Rhydon is capable of threatening Persian, as it 2HKOes Persian with Earthquake and resists Slash. Due to it effectively forcing Persian to use Bubble Beam, it can pivot to a specially bulky Pokemon like Alakazam to switch in with relative impunity unless a Speed drop occurs. Ergo, defeating Rhydon with Bubble Beam can actually be quite difficult, so Bubble Beam should be seen as a way to encourage it to switch out and force Slash damage onto the opposing team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Slash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slash is the main reason Persian is viable, effectively ignoring Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Body Slam is crucial against Reflect Snorlax; after two hits with Slash, the third will only KO 6.5% of the time, and Snorlax can simply use Rest, undoing your progress. However, Persian can fish for a critical hit with Body Slam to secure the KO, as Snorlax can’t afford to skip Rest. Additionally, Body Slam can fish for paralysis when Starmie switches in, potentially crippling it. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, and its Speed drop chance can occasionally help against faster switch-ins like Alakazam and Starmie, forcing them into a tricky situation.</p> <p>For the 4th move, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and Slowbro, giving Persian a fighting chance against them. It also can critically hit Starmie, unlike Slash, providing Persian more offensive pressure, and it is a way to chip away at Gengar if it is asleep or at low HP. Growl gives Persian a way to handle Tauros. Persian is 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam, but using Growl on the Hyper Beam turn prevents the KO unless Tauros critically hits, allowing Persian to retaliate with Slash and take it down. However, this tactic is somewhat predictable, and if the opponent anticipates it, they could simply use Body Slam instead. Still, Growl is enough to put Tauros in an awkward position in a matchup that is otherwise unfavorable for Persian. Growl can also be useful against Hyper Beam Snorlax depending on its remaining HP and helps prevent a Self-Destruct OHKO. Additionally, it can reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon, which is particularly useful against Starmie.</p> <p>Hyper Beam, meanwhile, allows Persian to finish off Pokemon like Starmie, Victreebel, and Chansey after Slash and provides a slight damage boost to secure KOs where Slash would otherwise fall short. It’s also a viable option for a final stand in a tight spot, with Persian’s critical hit rate giving it a chance to turn the tables in critical moments.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath's ugly typing and unremarkable stats give it a lot of trouble in RBY OU, but access to the rare Amnesia gives it a real niche as a wallbreaker. Unlike Amnesia users such as Slowbro and Snorlax, Poliwrath lacks the stats and typing to become unbreakable, but its Speed gives it a niche over them. Poliwrath outspeeds Exeggutor and can nail it with Blizzard after some chip damage, rather than having to fear Sleep Powder and Explosion like the other Amnesia users in the tier. It also possesses immediate threats against Chansey in the form of Hypnosis and Submission, which OHKOes with a critical hit.</p> <p>However, while Poliwrath possesses these advantages over Slowbro, it suffers from all of Slowbro's flaws and more. It needs a lot of setup to break past Starmie and Chansey, which often threaten it with Thunderbolt, and it is vulnerable to Psychic, making Pokemon like Alakazam and Jynx much more problematic than they are for Slowbro. Like Slowbro, even after setting up, Poliwrath needs to watch for enemy Explosions that can stop the party before it even starts. Perhaps most importantly of all, Slowbro is able to heal itself throughout the game and provide utility thanks to superior defensive stats paired with Thunder Wave, while Poliwrath does not possess the bulk nor the movepool to be anything other than a one-time breaker.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Poliwrath's Hydro Pumps deal incredible damage after only a few turns of Amnesia, which it can often find against paralyzed or sleeping foes, and it is capable of taking down multiple Pokemon in a single game if its primary checks, usually Starmie and Chansey, are either KOed by teammates or statused and weakened enough to be handled by Poliwrath itself. While inconsistent, Poliwrath is a Pokemon that can lead to good results if you build towards its strengths.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Amnesia": {
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath's viability in OU revolves around the combination of Amnesia and Hydro Pump. All would-be checks fall to it if they allow enough free turns: Starmie has great odds to be 2HKOed at +4, Alakazam is 2HKOed at +2 and OHKOed at +6, and even Chansey cannot survive two +6 Hydro Pumps. Other Pokemon that may attempt to finish off a weakened or crippled Poliwrath are also significantly easier to take down with Hydro Pump than with Surf: Snorlax is OHKOed by +6 Hydro Pump but always stomachs a +6 Surf, while +4 is enough to drop Tauros. While the prospects of Hydro Pump's accuracy and PP will understandably scare players off, the favorable ranges this move reaches are simply too important.</p> <p>In the third slot, a tool against Exeggutor is highly recommended: Blizzard will hit for over half its HP after a single Amnesia, but if the team has no plans to put any other foes to sleep, then Hypnosis is also a valid way of threatening it, while also doubling as a way for Poliwrath to give itself free turns. For the last slot, many options are viable: Submission provides an immediate critical hit OHKO threat on Chansey, though the accuracy and recoil make it fairly inconsistent, while Surf's accuracy can be appreciated in specific scenarios where the extra damage from Hydro Pump is not required. Other options such as Body Slam, Counter, Psychic, and Rest can also have merits in very specific scenarios but are strongly discouraged, as they do not contribute to Poliwrath's primary purpose as a wallbreaker.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>In a generation where Psychic-type attacks are only resisted by the same type, and because its only weakness may as well not exist, it's not surprising that Alakazam is an incredible threat in RBY OU. Alakazam is most commonly seen in the lead slot due to possessing excellent Speed and access to Thunder Wave; it outspeeds every Pokemon that has access to a sleep move, allowing it to immediately cripple them with paralysis. It also has the strongest Psychic in OU by virtue of its excellent Special and as such can heavily pressure its most common checks. This Special stat also makes it a decent sponge for opposing moves like Psychic, though its HP limits this slightly. It is also good at absorbing sleep, since it resists Exeggutor's Psychic. Unlike Starmie, Alakazam doesn't have a weakness to Thunderbolt, which can come in handy for absorbing sleep from the likes of Gengar and Lapras. Alakazam can also prove to be very effective outside the lead slot, maintaining excellent utility against various threats and potentially turning into a dangerous sweeper if its most common checks have been removed. However, it can be difficult to consistently keep Alakazam safe from paralysis; if paralyzed, Alakazam often finds its low Defense being exploited by strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. It's also very reliant on its Psychic, which means it is difficult to break past Chansey. Overall, Alakazam is a regular presence in RBY OU and one of the best Psychic-types available, but its extreme vulnerability to strong physical attacks and paralysis keeps it firmly below the top of the pyramid.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Recover should never be dropped. Though the last move is somewhat flexible, Alakazam's movepool is very shallow, so it should generally stick to the options mentioned. Counter has some utility when forcing out threats after the opponent KOed one of your Pokemon with a hard-hitting Normal-type attack from high health, such as Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Hyper Beam. This can be used to force damage against whatever switches in or even outright KO it. It also has situational use in Alakazam mirrors, as countering Seismic Toss can leave the opposing Alakazam severely weakened.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can hit Alakazam through its weak Defense and KO it, especially if it's paralyzed. They should try to switch in on Recover, though, as Psychic will do a big chunk of damage to all of them. Snorlax deserves a special mention for early-game, as it's crippled way less by paralysis and Psychic damage than the other Pokemon mentioned. Rhydon can also switch in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Almost all Psychic-types can check Alakazam, although most of them can be broken through with paralysis and Special drops. Although it generally should not come out early-game, Slowbro is particularly dangerous, as it can set up on Alakazam safely and heal its paralysis with Rest. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also take Alakazam's Psychic and Seismic Toss and threaten it in return with their own attacks and paralysis, but these matchups can swing either way with repeated full paralysis or Special drops from either side. Surf variants of Starmie are especially dangerous, as they can deal heavy damage to Alakazam. Jynx can be used to check Alakazam in an emergency, but it is passive when doing so, vulnerable to critical hits, and better used for other tasks.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Alakazam is a special attacker, and like all special attackers, Chansey makes a decent check. Chansey can attempt to paralyze Alakazam and pressure with Seismic Toss and to a lesser extent Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. This can force Alakazam to heal with Recover, allowing the opponent to switch into a physical threat. However, due to Psychic's secondary effect, paralysis, and Alakazam's high critical hit rate, Chansey will eventually be forced to either use Soft-Boiled or switch out. Should it get unlucky with full paralysis when trying to use Soft-Boiled, it can even be KOed. It's common to see Chansey switch in on a lead Alakazam and take a Thunder Wave to block sleep later. It can then attempt to put Alakazam to sleep with Sing on the next turn. Chansey can also attempt to fish for a freeze with Ice Beam if Alakazam isn't paralyzed, though this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Alakazam on Turn 1 to immediately try to put it to sleep. However, the opponent would need to be content taking paralysis and getting hit by at least one Seismic Toss, which reduces the longevity of Exeggutor. This makes it much worse at checking Rhydon later in the game. If you try to prevent Alakazam from being paralyzed by switching to Chansey, the opponent gains a huge advantage, as Exeggutor can outspeed Chansey and put it to sleep. In general, though, Exeggutor checks Alakazam well. However, it struggles to pressure Alakazam enough before getting worn down by Seismic Toss, often forcing it to use Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Alakazam is one of the best leads in RBY OU. Since it's the fastest lead that regularly sees use, it's almost guaranteed to be able to immediately cripple something from the start of the game, be it through paralysis or serious damage with Psychic. This means Alakazam is great for pressuring opposing leads. Against other Alakazam, one generally wants to paralyze it and try to get a physical attacker like Snorlax in on a predicted Recover. However, be careful to not leave the field too damaged, as Exeggutor can have Double-Edge or Hyper Beam to pressure Alakazam. Generally, you don't want to switch out at less than 80% in order for Alakazam to avoid the 2HKO from Exeggutor's Double-Edge most of the time. Gengar leads generally switch out against Alakazam due to the threat of a 2HKO from Psychic as well as an OHKO with a critical hit. Starmie should generally be approached the same way as an opposing Alakazam. However, one must be wary of Chansey when using Thunder Wave early on; its extreme bulk turns it into a phenomenal sleep blocker when paralyzed. As a result, it becomes very difficult to put anything to sleep until the now-paralyzed Chansey is KOed.</p> <p>A lead Alakazam's role, besides crippling the opposing lead, is mostly to absorb sleep. If used in this fashion, Alakazam should absolutely be running Seismic Toss. This allows Alakazam to hit Starmie and Exeggutor rather than waste Psychic's PP. Lead Alakazam can also be used to absorb paralysis from those who propagate it, such as Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. This especially goes for Chansey without Seismic Toss. It's also effective against Starmie without Surf or Psychic, the latter of which can force Alakazam out after a few Special drops. Alakazam also tends to attract physical attackers like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon on a forced Recover turn. If you can correctly predict the switch, you might be able to sneak in a Thunder Wave or Psychic on them. Moreover, due to Alakazam being one of the few pure special attackers that can force Chansey out, it is also an efficient paralysis spreader that can be used as such throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>In some situations, you might still resort to using non-lead Alakazam as if it were in the lead slot to check or pressure opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Starmie. It can also be used to function as a sweeper late-game. This strategy revolves around keeping Alakazam hidden, then attempting to clean up once its checks have been removed. Reflect can be used on sweeper Alakazam to give it a much-needed Defense boost, but it also means Alakazam will only have Psychic to attack with. In addition, Reflect Alakazam can still be taken care of through paralysis, critical hits from Tauros and Zapdos, and Explosion. Explosion is especially pressing if paralyzed, as even if Reflect Alakazam survives, it's still easily revenge killed by threats such as Tauros. However, Seismic Toss remains very usable in this context for beating Starmie and other Psychic-types more consistently.</p> <p>When using Alakazam as a sweeper, the rest of the team should work on removing Alakazam's checks before it's revealed. These checks include special sponges such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Pokemon that resist Psychic, such as Slowbro and Exeggutor, are also important to remove. For maintaining maximum sweeping potential, Alakazam should also try to avoid paralysis as much as possible, as its Speed is the reason it's able to compete with other late-game sweepers for a team slot. Ideally, Tauros should also be put in range of Psychic to avoid its high critical hit rate and Body Slam's paralysis chance. Fortunately, that can easily be accomplished through a Tauros mirror, a common scenario in RBY OU battles, since two Body Slams will leave the opponent's Tauros in said range.</p>"

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.</p> <p>Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the \"Big 3\" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>STAB Low Kick may seem unassuming, but its 30.1% flinch rate in RBY makes Machamp excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, making up for its mediocre defensive stats. Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.</p> <p>Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.</p>"

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel got lucky in RBY OU. It lacks obvious strengths, having just decent offensive capabilities, mediocre bulk, and a lousy typing. However, Victreebel has several useful tools that allow it to exploit certain metagame trends. Thanks to its average Speed and access to Wrap and Sleep Powder, Victreebel is able to keep itself safe while bullying the tier's slowest staples, like Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax. Likewise, anything paralyzed is liable to fall victim to Victreebel's repetitive Wraps. Victreebel also has a powerful Razor Leaf that can deal hefty damage to several key Pokemon, like Starmie, Slowbro, Lapras, and Rhydon, the last of which it will always OHKO. Victreebel has plenty of other toys to play with as well, such as Stun Spore and Swords Dance. These traits make Victreebel a menace against slower teams and teams that have mismanaged paralysis. It is undoubtedly one of the best Pokemon for closing games against weakened teams.</p> <p>Victreebel, however, has numerous flaws that have reduced it to more of a niche threat than a tier staple in recent times. In the modern metagame, teams are typically much faster than they were in the past and leads like Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx are more inclined to switch early on and dodge paralysis. While Chansey is very likely to become paralyzed over the course of the game, Victreebel may find it difficult to pressure anything else, and its mere presence is often an invitation for fast Psychic-type Pokemon. Additionally, the slight decrease in Exeggutor usage has been to Victreebel's detriment. Although the two compete as sleepers, Exeggutor's reduced role in the metagame has contributed to faster teams and reduced the presence of a prime Pokemon Victreebel can dominate with Sleep Powder or Wrap. Other more general issues include Victreebel's horrendous weaknesses to Ice and Psychic, vulnerability to paralysis, inability to threaten Gengar, and poor consistency, due to the imperfect accuracy of virtually every move it uses, most notably Wrap. Finally, while its defensive stats are somewhat workable, its mediocre Speed, poor typing, and lack of recovery make it deceptively frail; Tauros will typically KO Victreebel with a Blizzard followed by a Hyper Beam, for example.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam is Victreebel’s most notable alternative option for either set. The decent Base Power and paralysis chance allow Victreebel to punish switch-ins without committing to moves like Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, which can potentially be blocked by a statused Pokemon or just miss. However, the middling payoff and rather high value of Victreebel’s moveslots make it a rare sight. Double-Edge can potentially be run on the Swords Dance set for additional power without risking a Hyper Beam recharge turn, but it is generally outclassed by the utility moves that give Victreebel its niche. Toxic is another possible option on the standard set because it pairs well with Wrap, causing damage to accumulate much more quickly. Once again, however, Victreebel seldom has room to run a move like this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Victreebel is incapacitated by paralysis. With all of its healthy foes faster than it, Victreebel will no longer be able to use Wrap to pressure slower targets and pivot. Additionally, Wrap will hit only a mere 66% of the time once Victreebel is paralyzed, making it an inconsistent option even against paralyzed targets. Likewise, the imperfect accuracies of Razor Leaf, Hyper Beam, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore are exacerbated by the chance for full paralysis. Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will typically try to use Thunder Wave to dispatch Victreebel as fast as possible, and slower Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor will be happy to punish any Wrap misses with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a hard counter to Victreebel. Aside from status moves, Victreebel is incapable of threatening Gengar at all, as it takes no damage from Wrap or Hyper Beam and very little from Razor Leaf. Gengar, on the other hand, can put Victreebel to sleep or quickly KO it with Night Shade or the occasional Psychic. Wrap still immobilizes Gengar despite not doing any damage, allowing Victreebel to pivot to a teammate, so Gengar can’t switch in entirely for free.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon tend to be strong answers to Victreebel. Zapdos is by far the most common and can easily dispatch Victreebel with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Drill Peck. Unless Victreebel is partnered with Rhydon or Golem, Zapdos is very likely to claim a KO if it gets the chance to face Victreebel. Articuno and Moltres also outspeed and can 2HKO Victreebel with Blizzard and Fire Blast, respectively. All three Pokemon also have impressive bulk, so they can survive even a +2 Hyper Beam if necessary. Dragonite is also a rather sturdy check, as it shrugs off most of Victreebel’s moves and can inhibit it with Thunder Wave or its own Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Psychic and Ice-type Moves</strong>: Psychic and Ice-type moves deal hefty damage to Victreebel, typically scoring a 2HKO. Alakazam, Starmie, and Jynx all outspeed Victreebel and can 2HKO it with Psychic or Blizzard. Slower Pokemon can also harshly punish misses and poor switches from Victreebel. Exeggutor and Lapras both score 2HKOs with their super effective STAB moves, though the latter takes a lot from Razor Leaf. Chansey can also get a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Cloyster is an incredibly awkward matchup, as the two Speed tie and 2HKO each other with their STAB moves, with Victreebel potentially getting the KO outright if Cloyster has sustained even the slightest chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Victreebel has difficulty threatening Pokemon faster than it, as it typically cannot stay in and use Wrap safely. Essentially every common Pokemon faster than Victreebel has the potential to simply wait out Victreebel’s Wrap turns, provided it doesn't switch out, and eventually punish it with a super effective attack or paralysis. Victreebel can typically weaken these Pokemon before going down, such as hitting Starmie with Razor Leaf or Tauros with Stun Spore, but these matchup are generally losing for Victreebel overall.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its middling Speed, Victreebel can threaten about half of the tier with Sleep Powder. In general, Victreebel is most effective as a sleeper when it can get in against a slower foe with minimal risk. For example, when Chansey is likely to use Soft-Boiled or Snorlax is about to wake up from Rest, Victreebel can usually sneak in and use Sleep Powder. Likewise, if a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Slowbro is likely to come in, Victreebel can usually find an entry point. From there, Victreebel can pivot with Wrap or pressure slower Pokemon like Snorlax with Razor Leaf and Wrap. While going for sleep early on is a viable strategy, Victreebel frequently shines late-game, as revealing it too early may make paralyzing some of your opponent's faster Pokemon more difficult. Therefore, Sleep Powder is often an endgame tool that it can use to threaten Tauros and other common endgame Pokemon. Wrap makes Victreebel a capable pivot and occasional sweeper; it can use the move to quickly get its teammates great matchups with little risk. For example, using Wrap against Chansey can provide entrance for Snorlax and using it against Exeggutor can provide entrance for Cloyster. Faster Pokemon are also vulnerable; if a foe like Alakazam, Starmie, or Zapdos tries to switch into Wrap and threaten paralysis, then a teammate like Snorlax, Jolteon, or Rhydon can come in for free. Finally, if the opposing team is made entirely slower than Victreebel, either by KOing or paralyzing every faster Pokemon, Victreebel can gradually chip away the team's health with Wrap until it can pick foes off with its attacks or swap out to a sweeper like Tauros to finish the job. Razor Leaf is Victreebel's strongest STAB move and primary attacking move. Water- and Rock-type Pokemon typically fold after just a hit or two, allowing Victreebel to reliably force switches when facing Pokemon like paralyzed Starmie, paralyzed or Resting Cloyster, Slowbro, and Rhydon. In the case of Slowbro, Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit enables Victreebel to deal hefty damage regardless of how many times it has used Amnesia. Victreebel's ability to pressure both Starmie and Rhydon is fairly unique and one of the key traits that allowed it to rise to OU. Victreebel's last move is its least important and most flexible. Stun Spore improves Victreebel's utility with Wrap and gives it the ability to pressure faster Pokemon even after Sleep Clause has taken effect. This is especially potent when the opponent's only Pokemon faster than Victreebel is Tauros. Hyper Beam makes Victreebel a more effective sweeper in late-game scenarios, picking up early KOs on Pokemon like Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Depending on how Victreebel is played, it has a number of strong potential teammates. Starmie and Rhydon are typical partners, as they create a potent offensive core. Starmie can stymie Pokemon that threaten Victreebel like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, while Victreebel can take advantage of Starmie’s ability to spread paralysis by using Wrap and applying pressure to Starmie’s strongest check, Chansey. Rhydon rounds out the core by handling Electric-type Pokemon, particularly Zapdos, which heavily threaten both Starmie and Victreebel. Rhydon also benefits from paralysis spread by these allies. Electric-type Pokemon also tend to work well with Victreebel on offensive teams, as Wrap can be a valuable tool for allowing them to switch in safely; Zapdos and Jolteon are quite good at finishing off a team that has been chipped by Wrap. Victreebel can also punish the switches to Rhydon or Golem that Electric-type Pokemon tend to encourage. Victreebel is also a fixture of Wrap teams. While a less common strategy in competitive play, Victreebel can be paired with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dragonite to easily maintain momentum and annihilate paralyzed teams. Due to the many free switches generated by Wrap, such teams often feature multiple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Alakazam.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>While Victreebel often gets the most value from a utility set based around pivoting and spreading status, it can make use of a Swords Dance set. Victreebel boasts an above-average Attack stat and can secure many important KOs after a Swords Dance. Frailer Pokemon such as Alakazam and Jynx drop to a single +2 Hyper Beam and Chansey will drop from full health about 17.9% of the time. Thanks to its decent Speed tier, Victreebel can severely weaken or outright sweep a team with Swords Dance after only a little chip damage and paralysis. Razor Leaf complements Hyper Beam quite well, as it threatens many of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro. The final move on the set largely comes down to team structure and personal preference. Wrap remains useful as a pseudo-pivot move and can help Victreebel get a little more chip damage on a Pokemon to bring it into range of Hyper Beam or Razor Leaf. Sleep Powder helps Victreebel find turns to set up with Swords Dance and punish Pokemon that might be brought in to stop a sweep, like Tauros or Electric-type Pokemon. Stun Spore acts similarly, heavily punishing common late-game switch-ins. While paralysis is generally weaker than sleep, Stun Spore has a case over Sleep Powder, as it is not inhibited by Sleep Clause and can be used at any point in the match. Moreover, because Victreebel is often best at switching in and setting up on Pokemon that are already asleep, Sleep Powder may be redundant.</p> <p>While Victreebel can succeed with this set, it has several notable limitations. Victreebel’s poor typing, underwhelming bulk, and vulnerability to paralysis make setting up quite difficult, forcing Victreebel to rely on free turns from sleep and risky double switches. Victreebel needs a lot of support to not only set up with Swords Dance, but also to weaken the opposing team enough that Victreebel can do real damage. This generally means all Psychic-type Pokemon on the opposing team need to be paralyzed and hard walls like Gengar need to be eliminated. Finally, while Victreebel is arguably the best user of Swords Dance in the tier, it is not necessarily the best fit for every team. Pokemon like Sandslash, Kingler, Venusaur, Pinsir, and Kabutops all offer a variety of positive traits and give Victreebel pretty stiff competition for an already niche role.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Golem's Rock / Ground typing makes it a strong attacker that crucially hard counters Zapdos and Jolteon while resisting Normal-type attacks. Its QuakeSlide coverage is completely unresisted and able to 2HKO Pokemon like Rhydon, Zapdos, and Alakazam. This makes Golem excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, but what tops this all off is Explosion. Golem's Explosion, while just shy of Snorlax's Self-Destruct's strength, is terrifyingly strong, even having a chance to OHKO Starmie. Explosion Golem is likely to break even (at worst) against most Pokemon, and this has kept it relevant for decades.</p> <p>However, Golem is very slow and has devastating weaknesses to most common special attacks; it has to run from Blizzard, Surf, Razor Leaf, and whatnot. Even neutral special attacks such as Psychic will deal significant damage to Golem. Further, being so slow means Golem gets forced to use Explosion in many one-on-one fights. Due to these two setbacks, Golem is very reliant on enemy teams being riddled with paralysis before it gets going. Plus, while Explosion can theoretically compensate for Golem's Speed and let it break even frequently, Golem generally shouldn't use Explosion until the opponent's Zapdos or Jolteon is accounted for, lest its team crumble to them. Therefore, decision-making with Explosion is difficult until Zapdos or Jolteon is paralyzed or KOed, after which it can be deployed more freely and actually exert offensive pressure. This can make its role seem a little paradoxical to the uninitiated.</p> <p>Golem famously fell from RBY OU in 2019, ending a long-standing battle between it and Rhydon for places on competitive teams. Understanding this is important, as while many teams can use Golem adequately, they tend to be better off with Rhydon instead. This is because Rhydon has a higher Attack stat, which allows it to achieve damage thresholds like 2HKOing Chansey and rarely 2HKOing Starmie. It's also capable of sometimes 3HKOing Slowbro, defusing a key threat if it switches in on Rest. The extra damage output against Exeggutor, Rhydon's and Golem's biggest counter and most common switch-in, is also a key advantage; Exeggutor cannot safely switch in as much as it would like against the rocky rhino. Additionally, Rhydon is bulkier thanks to its higher HP, which also enables 104 HP Substitutes to stomach Seismic Toss or Night Shade. This quirk helps Rhydon reliably run and use Substitute in general; it can fish for Substitute in situations where Golem is forced to use Explosion, making it even harder for Golem to justify itself on teams. Regardless, Golem's strong perks over Rhydon remain recognized: possessing the second-strongest self-KO move and outrunning Rhydon allow it to indisputably succeed over Rhydon on highly specific teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Customizing Golem usually involves looking at what it has over Rhydon, but this tends to be a fool's errand when looking beyond Explosion. If you must customize Golem, Body Slam is the most replaceable option, but note that this means its team will need at least one more reliable paralysis-spreading Pokemon to be effective.</p> <p>Golem can run Substitute to try and be like its brother Rhydon, but at that point, it's usually better to bite the bullet and use the stony superior. The utility of having both Substitute and Explosion is typically just not enough. Fire Blast can burn Exeggutor switching in, effectively ruining its Explosion, but it deals just barely more damage than Rock Slide, and Golem is usually forced out thereafter anyway. Defense Curl or Harden can let Golem consistently wall Snorlax and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but these perks are dubious at best in respect to what Golem wants to do.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Golem's Earthquake and threaten it with Sleep Powder or Psychic, forcing it out and granting Exeggutor's team significant momentum. Mega Drain variants are particularly soul-crushing, almost OHKOing Golem while letting Exeggutor recover almost half its HP. Once Exeggutor is at half HP and paralyzed, however, it's in Rock Slide's 2HKO range and cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: It's hard to name a Pokemon in RBY OU that doesn't have a super effective move against Golem. Any Pokemon with Surf or Razor Leaf, such as Starmie, Venusaur, or Victreebel, can OHKO Golem outright. Blizzard or Ice Beam users like Starmie, Chansey, Articuno, Tauros, and Amnesia Snorlax can also deal significant-to-heavy damage to Golem. Even Rhydon's Earthquake 2HKOes. Golem can usually take non-STAB Blizzard from full HP though, so keep this in mind for when a risky trade is necessary.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Normal-types</strong>: Reflect Snorlax doesn't care about anything Golem can throw at it, effortlessly trading blows with it. If it has Ice Beam, the matchup becomes completely unwinnable. The best Golem can offer in the matchup is using Explosion before Snorlax can use Reflect, after Reflect has already been revealed, but this should only be done in desperate situations. Reflect Chansey can perform similar feats, being just fast enough to use Reflect before Golem can use Explosion by default, but it should be at least a little afraid if paralyzed and without Reflect set up.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While it's afraid of Body Slam paralysis, Starmie normally runs at least one super effective move against Golem, namely Surf or Blizzard. Surf OHKOes Golem outright, while Blizzard deals up to 79.8%. Unlike Rhydon, Golem can't 2HKO Starmie without a very lucky critical hit or Explosion. While Golem does like to use Explosion against Starmie, it's only 38.5% to OHKO, so the matchup remains a bad situation for it in a vacuum. Golem can only outright win this matchup if Starmie has taken prior damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: You know it's bad when Clamp deals over half a Pokemon's HP. While Cloyster greatly fears Rock Slide, especially if paralyzed, it can use Blizzard to potentially OHKO Golem in return, or Clamp—liberally—to scout for its switch-in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Explosion": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>QuakeSlide coverage allows Golem to hit the entire RBY roster for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Articuno, Moltres, and Jynx; it also 2HKOes Zapdos and sometimes Dragonite. Earthquake is Golem's strongest attack without drawbacks and should be used liberally; it can OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKO Alakazam and Rhydon. Body Slam lets Golem be more self-sufficient in the paralysis-spreading effort, and it's useful to potentially incapacitate checks like Starmie and Exeggutor.</p> <p>What defines Golem, however, is Explosion. The dream of a Golem player is to beat out Zapdos or Jolteon late-game, then use Explosion on the opponent's last healthy Pokemon. This is a difficult dream to attain, but not impossible. Golem should ideally use Explosion very late into a game; usually, this is when the trade is clearly game-winning and the potential Electric-type threat has been accounted for. If Golem uses Explosion before Zapdos or Jolteon is revealed, its team may fall apart. Knowing common team structures and strategies involving these Pokemon is essential to predict if Explosion is safe prior to the last Pokemon being revealed. Tauros, Snorlax, and Chansey are omnipresent, so this can alleviate prediction by a chunk. Golem should ideally use Explosion against Starmie, which normally threatens Golem's partners with its sublime coverage and Speed. Starmie should ideally be ever-so-slightly chipped or paralyzed before doing this, as an OHKO isn't guaranteed. If Starmie lacks Surf, Golem can add the chip damage itself, as Blizzard deals 79.3% at most without a critical hit. If Starmie isn't present, Golem can also use Explosion on Chansey or Snorlax to pave the way for Tauros. Outside of this, Explosion can be a handy contingency plan in the event Slowbro snowballs out of control.</p> <p>Golem is frequently pushed out by Rhydon on teams, as its Explosion and favorable matchup against its rocky friend are typically unnecessary. Parties that require these traits typically use Pokemon like Moltres, which appreciate a better matchup against Rhydon- and Zapdos-centric teams. Teams that can't afford to compress the self-KO role onto Snorlax with Self-Destruct, or that wish to use an Explosion user alongside it, can also utilize Golem over Rhydon. Teams that feature many Explosion users—\"Boom Offense\"—will sometimes include Golem, but its low defensive utility makes it a tough fit even then.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as TobyBro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.</p> <p>However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really \"bad luck\" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p> <p>Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p> <p><strong>Razor Leaf users</strong>: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen users</strong>: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "TobyBro (Amnesia)": {
        "description": "<p>Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous. Amnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum 999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its STAB Surf at +6. Amnesia, like all boosting moves, also has the great side effect of further reducing the speed of paralyzed enemies, allowing Slowbro to muscle through paralyzed would-be walls a lot more easily. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.</p> <p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p> <p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.</p> <p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.</p> <p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.</p> <p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and \"safe\" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Being extremely fast and hitting as hard as Snorlax, Dodrio can be a frightening foe in RBY OU, acting as a strong revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Its offensive prowess is no joke, with Body Slam + Hyper Beam 2HKOing many Pokemon in the tier, including Chansey and Starmie. With STAB Drill Peck under its belt, Dodrio has the potential to even OHKO Exeggutor with a critical hit, as well as play around Counter users like Chansey. When used alongside Tauros, Dodrio is very capable of tearing holes in the opposing team that can leave it ripe for exploitation from its teammates.</p> <p>However, Dodrio is by no means a standard, and there are many reasons why. For starters, it is extremely frail, struggling to even stomach neutral hits and being OHKOed by Zapdos, Articuno, and even Cloyster. This fragility, combined with paralysis incapacitating it, makes it very difficult to utilize outside of late-game scenarios, which many teams will struggle to facilitate. Furthermore, similar to Zapdos, Dodrio is completely hopeless against Rhydon, getting effortlessly stonewalled. Finally, like many Normal-type attackers, Dodrio is strictly outclassed by Tauros, which possesses superior coverage and Speed; ergo, Dodrio must be used alongside it. Overall, while it has merit, Dodrio's flaws make it difficult to recommend for conventional RBY OU teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Dodrio is fairly straightforward, aiming to simply deal as much damage as possible while not sustaining damage or paralysis itself. Body Slam makes Dodrio extremely difficult to switch into, with the paralysis chance ruining faster Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie while leaving them wide open to a KO the following turn. Drill Peck allows Dodrio to duel Gengar and Exeggutor far more effectively; it also does not enable Counter, which lets Dodrio scout users like Chansey while not losing any offensive pressure. Hyper Beam can potentially OHKO Jynx and Alakazam, as well as secure 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie in tandem with Body Slam. With critical hit Hyper Beam, Dodrio can 2HKO any Pokemon in the tier barring Rhydon after a Body Slam. Finally, Agility allows Dodrio to outrun the entire unboosted metagame, giving it a more secure late-game sweep, while bypassing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Dodrio's movepool is quite barren, but it has some niche options worth exploring. While it doesn't protect from status in RBY, Substitute is a viable choice to scout for free turns, such as the opponent switching or full paralysis, allowing Dodrio to stomach harder hits than it otherwise could. However, Substitute's HP cost makes Dodrio much easier to revenge kill later, cutting into its already poor bulk. Mimic is a serviceable option, giving Dodrio a potential coverage move like Earthquake to better handle Rhydon, but is extremely unreliable.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a Pokemon with coverage limited to STAB moves and Normal-type attacks, yet despite this, it has access to one of the most diverse toolsets in RBY OU. Through the use of Clamp, Cloyster can provide free switches to its teammates while also walling some of the most prominent physical threats, such as Snorlax, particularly those running Reflect, and Tauros. It possesses a reasonably powerful Blizzard, with the ability to threaten freeze on special walls, and has the option of using Explosion on Starmie to set up a Rhydon or Tauros sweep. Its part-Ice typing gives it immunity to freeze and STAB on Blizzard, at the expense of being weaker to Rock Slide. However, Cloyster has some drawbacks that stop it from being one of the top threats of RBY OU. Firstly, not being a Normal-type means it can be paralyzed by Body Slam, unlike Chansey or Snorlax. Secondly, Clamp's subpar accuracy could prove deadly to Cloyster's pretensions, especially if it's paralyzed. Lastly, it needs to rely on Rest as means of recovery, which means it's going to remain completely passive for three turns whenever it wants to recover HP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The options listed give Cloyster the best tools to perform its roles effectively, so other options should generally not be considered. Reflect could be used in place of Clamp or Explosion to wall Normal-types even more reliably, but Cloyster loses on one of its key supporting roles when doing so and the extra bulk is generally not needed. Ice Beam is an option, though the drop in power is noticeable; most notably, Snorlax is 4HKOed instead of 3HKOed with Blizzard, but the added PP can come in handy in longer games where neither player manages to break the opponent. Toxic, when combined with Clamp, can allow Cloyster to wear down the special walls that usually threaten it with higher degrees of efficiency; however, it's difficult to justify making space for it when all of Cloyster's default moves are so valuable. Paralysis is generally very efficient at enabling Clamp chains and already present on virtually every RBY team anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie is the premier Cloyster counter; it takes virtually no damage from Clamp or Blizzard and is able to Recover any damage done effortlessly. It can also cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave or do heavy damage to it with Thunderbolt or Psychic. However, it must watch out for Explosion, as it can be KOed if not at full health. Lapras or an opposing Cloyster can also completely shrug off Cloyster's attacks, and the former can threaten a powerful Thunderbolt or even Sing. It should be noted that if these Water-types are paralyzed they struggle considerably more, as Cloyster will now be faster, allowing it to use Clamp and switch out safely, with the only danger being the unlikely case of a Clamp miss coupled with lack of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Alakazam can also shrug off Blizzard relatively easily thanks to their high Special bulk and easy, accessible recovery; however, if they are paralyzed, Cloyster has the option to partial trap them with Clamp to deny their recovery and switch out freely. They are also very vulnerable to Explosion, meaning that they have to tread carefully when attempting to take on Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Electric types</strong>: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster, with the latter having a small chance to OHKO. They must be wary of switching in, though, as Blizzard threatens significant damage, especially to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch in on Cloyster with impunity, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and start setting up on it. If it's carrying Reflect, it's even worse, as Cloyster does a measly 30% to it with Explosion after Reflect has been set up. Slowbro is even more dangerous for Cloyster if it's packing Psychic; a +4 Psychic is already more than 50% likely to OHKO Cloyster. Thus, Cloyster is forced to use Clamp and then switch out as soon as Slowbro enters the field. This is risky and predictable due to the low accuracy and imminent threat that Slowbro poses.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Tauros</strong>: If Tauros chooses to run the rare Thunderbolt instead of the standard Earthquake, it can lure in Cloyster and seriously cripple it, especially if Cloyster is already caught in Rest cycles or suffers a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel Speed ties with Cloyster and can do at least 85% damage with Razor Leaf. However, it's a shaky check at best, as it's also 2HKOed by Cloyster's Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Though it does not particularly enjoy switching into Blizzards, Gengar does not suffer Clamp much, outspeeds Cloyster, and threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also able to completely nullify Explosion, though this is reliant on prediction.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx enjoys switching into Cloyster's attacks and threatening it with Psychic. It is faster, making it a good switch-in to Clamp, and can use Cloyster's weaker attacks to its advantage to wake up after a Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>This is Cloyster's best set and the one you should expect when you see it. Clamp provides a free switch to another teammate. It also does respectable amounts of damage due to having a higher Base Power than similar moves such as Wrap as well as being boosted by STAB. Blizzard is Cloyster's best attacking option, a powerful STAB move that only Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras or special walls such as Chansey and Alakazam can handle; it also has a possibility of scoring a freeze. Explosion allows Cloyster to act as a wallbreaker once its support capabilities are no longer needed, blowing up on a Pokemon such as Starmie or Chansey and allowing a sweeper to perform its job more easily. For the third move, Rest is the the most common option by far, as it allows Cloyster to perform its walling duties much more easily. However, Hyper Beam can also be used if the team favors the possibility of doing extra damage to Chansey. It is also the best option on dedicated Wrap teams, since they can't afford to lose any momentum, but those teams tend to be inconsistent and are thus rarely seen.</p> <p>Cloyster provides unique utility to RBY teams in that it provides the user with a sturdy Tauros answer, something that very few other Pokemon in the tier can do. Therefore, despite being an excellent Pokemon to lure in and KO walls like Starmie and Chansey through Explosion, it is often best to preserve Cloyster for the later stages, until the opposing Tauros has been crippled enough for Cloyster's defensive prowess to be superfluous. However, Cloyster is not simply a late-game Tauros answer; its positive matchup against Snorlax also gives it plenty of positional utility in the early stages, especially when combined with Clamp to gain free and safe switches. Managing Cloyster's health demands making many tricky decisions: switching in on Snorlax or using Explosion on Chansey early on may seem like great propositions, but they will weaken your team against the opponent's Tauros, so it is necessary to think about your long-term plans whenever you expose Cloyster to danger.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar makes a name for itself in RBY OU as the tier’s fastest sleep inducer, giving it a prominent role in the lead metagame, as it threatens every other sleep-inducing lead in the game. Gengar is the only Pokemon immune to Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Its high Special allows it to deal solid damage with Thunderbolt, and access to Explosion allows it to threaten walls and bulky foes like Chansey and Exeggutor. In addition, its 21.48% critical hit rate makes these offensive tools all the more dangerous.</p> <p>However, Gengar’s secondary Poison-type, frailty, shaky accuracy with Hypnosis, and lower Speed relative to its threats all prove to be significant flaws that make Gengar somewhat unreliable. Its Poison-type allows Tauros and Snorlax, which would otherwise be walled, to threaten it with Earthquake. It also allows Alakazam and Starmie, which both outspeed Gengar, to severely threaten it with Psychic. This poor defensive typing is exacerbated by Gengar’s poor bulk, which leaves it 2HKOed by every STAB Psychic user barring Jynx, which has a 98.8% chance to 2HKO, and Slowbro, which rarely carries Psychic. Gengar also has reliability concerns as a sleeper, as its frailty combined with the 60% accuracy of Hypnosis means it may fail to put a foe to sleep before it is KOed or forced to use Explosion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Drain is the most common other option and is used for the purpose of hitting Rhydon. It is not recommended because its low Base Power means it only 2HKOes Rhydon, doing just under 63% on a maximum damage roll, while Gengar is OHKOed in return by Earthquake. Mega Drain therefore only works if Rhydon is significantly chipped, asleep, or if Gengar critically hits.</p> <p>Anything else that Gengar can use is either extremely niche or luck-reliant. Confuse Ray is primarily used to prevent Chansey from healing and to generally increase the opportunities for favorable RNG. Counter can be used to catch switches if Gengar is brought in against something it forces out by utilizing the Counter damage storing mechanics. Submission 3HKOes Chansey and is an additional way to threaten it beyond Explosion, but Gengar will take 60% in recoil damage to KO a Chansey from full HP. Seismic Toss is a worse alternative to Night Shade, as the 8 extra PP is not worth making it vulnerable to Counter, and Gengar should not be getting into PP wars. Gengar is also an effective user of Toxic on teams utilizing partial trapping strategies.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Gengar is 2HKOed by every STAB Psychic in the tier, and Gengar with Psychic strongly threatens a Gengar without it. Exeggutor deserves special mention, as it can come in on Gengar for momentum and cannot be significantly threatened in turn. Even Explosion is a poor deterrent unless Exeggutor has already sustained significant damage. However, Starmie and Slowbro, OU’s two Psychic-types that do not always run Psychic, are both favorable matchups for Gengar if they are not carrying the move, since they are weak to Thunderbolt. A paralyzed Starmie can be especially vulnerable to Gengar if it cannot threaten with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Gengar cannot OHKO Rhydon without a Mega Drain critical hit nor threaten it with Explosion, and it is OHKOed in return by Earthquake. Gengar should only fight a Rhydon that is either asleep or in KO range. Even if sleep is available, Gengar should not try to fight a healthy Rhydon unless the situation is desperate or as a sacrifice when switching out would allow a KO anyway.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Snorlax</strong>: Earthquake variants of Snorlax are the only sets that seriously threaten Gengar. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar, which can only 5HKO in return. Against an Earthquake + Reflect Snorlax, the best way for Gengar to handle it is to force Snorlax to Rest with other team members, come in as it uses Rest, and pressure with Psychic or Thunderbolt Gengar can fish for critical hits and Special drops until Snorlax is forced out; if it wakes up, Gengar is usually forced out if it did not get any critical hits or Special drops. If the opposing Snorlax does not have Reflect set up, then using Explosion to either KO Snorlax or put it into range of a revenge killer is also a valid counterplay option. Amnesia Snorlax will usually force Gengar to use Explosion to handle it, but Gengar should still have enough turns to chip Snorlax down into range of Explosion or a revenge killer. Amnesia Snorlax variants with Reflect and Rest wall Gengar and use it to set up, but that set is rather rare.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Gengar and Tauros Speed tie, but Tauros 2HKOes Gengar with Earthquake, while Gengar cannot 2HKO in turn. If Gengar is out of KO range and Tauros is in Explosion range, attempting to land Explosion may be worthwhile, especially if the opponent has nothing to switch into Explosion. Eliminating Tauros is always incredibly valuable, and Gengar wins the interaction unless it loses the Speed tie and Tauros critically hits with Earthquake, a 10.74% chance. Using Hypnosis against a Tauros out of Explosion range is possible as well, but it's much riskier. Notably, Earthquake is the most commonly dropped move when Tauros doesn't use the standard set. A Tauros without Earthquake is no longer able to check Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Assuming Chansey cannot be put to sleep, Gengar will have difficulty breaking through it, as all of Gengar’s attacks except Explosion are walled by Chansey. If Chansey uses Reflect, then even Explosion will likely be healed off with ease. Depending on Chansey’s set and the game state, it can then threaten Gengar with Sing, Thunder Wave, Seismic Toss, or Ice Beam. The best way for Gengar to deal with Chansey is to use Explosion. Gengar can KO Chansey with a critical hit Explosion or after some chip damage, or it can at least get Chansey to low HP and allow a revenge killer to take advantage. Chansey can potentially bait Explosion and switch to something less valuable or capable of taking the hit, but as long as something has been put to sleep, attempting to land Explosion on Chansey is almost always worthwhile.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Gengar’s Speed is one of its most powerful tools, so being paralyzed hinders it drastically. If it has not put something to sleep by the time it is paralyzed, it will struggle to induce sleep, as Hypnosis only becomes more unreliable with a full paralysis chance added on top of an already shaky 60% accuracy. This does, however, allow Gengar to serve as good paralysis bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is necessary to facilitate Gengar’s role as a sleep inducer. Thunderbolt is Gengar’s primary attack, allowing it to put immense pressure on the Water-types of the tier. Explosion, despite coming off of a poor 65 Attack stat, still manages to hit extremely hard. It is used to break physically frail Pokemon, such as Jynx, which is almost always OHKOed, as well as Chansey and Alakazam with prior chip damage.</p> <p>The remaining move is mostly a choice between Night Shade and Psychic. Night Shade deals consistent damage to everything, while Psychic can critically hit and drop Special but is worse against Psychic-types. Night Shade’s main notable targets are Exeggutor, which resists Gengar's other moves, and Zapdos, which takes considerably more damage from Night Shade than Psychic or Thunderbolt. Psychic, meanwhile, is more useful for opposing Gengar, and it also threatens Rhydon as it switches in or if it's at low health. Psychic also serves to better pressure Snorlax and Chansey.</p> <p>Gengar’s unreliability in securing sleep makes a second sleep inducer strongly recommended. Sing Chansey is the most common partner for Gengar, but Exeggutor is also frequently seen alongside it. Jynx is also possible to use as a backup sleeper but is much rarer. Gengar is most commonly run as a lead. If it can land Hypnosis, it can then be used to pressure Water-types, wall variants of Snorlax and Tauros lacking Earthquake, or as a sacrifice to the opposing sleep inducer. If Gengar cannot put something to sleep before being forced out, the backup sleep inducer can try to induce sleep later. Gengar's best opportunity to switch in to try to land Hypnosis is on Snorlax. It can either try to switch into an expected Body Slam or against a Snorlax confirmed to not be carrying Earthquake.</p>"

  "Hypno": {
    "overview": "<p>Hypno has the best typing in RBY, serviceable base stats, and the uncommon ability to spread both sleep and paralysis through Hypnosis and Thunder Wave. While these qualities are good in a vacuum, Hypno is unfortunately outclassed by the most dominant Psychic-types in the tier; Starmie and Alakazam have Recover, while Exeggutor has Explosion, giving all three great options to play out of potentially difficult situations. Hypno, meanwhile, is stuck with Rest as its only recovery option and no way to match or break through its Psychic-type cousins in most scenarios. This means that Hypno struggles both defensively and offensively in practice, failing to find real defensive niches and to threaten much more than Thunder Wave on its Psychic-type foes.</p> <p>Hypno's niche mostly exists alongside these superior Psychic-types, rather than in their place, offering unusual options its competitors lack or struggle to combine. For example, one may use their Exeggutor to lure a paralyzed target into blocking its Sleep Powder, KO it with Explosion, and then follow up with Hypno's Hypnosis for easy sleep. However, there are two use cases for Hypno as a primary Psychic-type that are worth mentioning. Hypno is better than either Jynx or Exeggutor at sleeping a foe, spreading paralysis, and later absorbing sleep thanks to its decent Defense, which allows it to run Rest without being overwhelmingly punished, thus potentially healing its own paralysis so that it may absorb sleep at a later point. Jynx struggles with using Rest due to its terrible Defense, while Exeggutor struggles because of Ice-type moves breaking its Rest cycles. Hypno's diverse toolkit also includes oddball moves such as Submission, which allows for more pressure on Chansey than the other Psychic-types can usually offer, and it can lead to some extremely favorable scenarios with some lucky paralysis and critical hits. These advantages are incredibly specific and marginal, though, so Hypno is nothing more than a fringe pick in RBY OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno can run a moveset of Hypnosis / Thunder Wave / Reflect / Rest, preferably as a lead. It allows Hypno to land Hypnosis, then paralyze any potential switch-ins, and then simply sit in place with Reflect and Rest until the opponent gives in and puts it to sleep, activating Sleep Clause to keep all its teammates safe. However, should this plan not come to fruition, this set can become entirely useless. Other Reflect + Rest sets can also exist, as these moves make Hypno generally hard to take down, but it will generally struggle with making progress due to Hypno's lackluster offense.</p> <p>Submission allows Hypno to break through Chansey with some luck between full paralysis and critical hits. However, it is pretty much useless otherwise, and the recoil will leave Hypno significantly weakened even if it cripples or KOes Chansey. Nevertheless, due to Chansey's omnipresence, it can be viable to lure it in and break through it with some consistency.</p> <p>Hypno has access to Meditate, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, which can theoretically help it break through its Psychic-type walls, but in practice it takes far too long to set up and will usually get KOed before dealing any significant damage. If it elects to run just Meditate + Body Slam or Hyper Beam + Reflect + Rest, then it won't be KOed too quickly, but it also won't be able to break through a vast number of foes, including Gengar, Rhydon, and Reflect Snorlax. Headbutt's 30% flinch chance can give Hypno odds to break through foes in the long run, but it comes at the cost of Base Power.</p> <p>Hypno can use Toxic in conjunction with Rest to try and defeat its Psychic-type walls through extremely passive stalling, something that standard Hypno cannot achieve by any other means. However, Toxic has proven to be a generally unsuccessful strategy at high level play, with only occasional appearances and no results to write home about.</p> <p>Counter can be used to try and catch Snorlax and Tauros, but Hypno already struggles for moveslots, and spending one for Counter generally leaves it much less useful in the long term, banking almost its entire utility on the ability to land one Counter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Recover</strong>: Starmie and Alakazam are unthreatened by Hypno's entire movepool bar Hypnosis. Hypno is able to cripple them with Thunder Wave, but it is pretty much forced to switch out immediately after, as it has no prospects in a one-on-one matchup without an extremely unlikely run of Psychic Special drops.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: While they do not handle Hypno quite as comfortably as Psychic-types with Recover, Rest Jynx, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can generally stop it from making progress, especially if Hypno lacks Seismic Toss. Because Hypno will force them into passivity for a few turns, they are not quite as efficient as other checks. Slowbro deserves a special mention due to its ability to set up with Amnesia against Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While it has to respect the potential for Submission, Chansey is entirely happy against any other Hypno set, and even when Hypno is running Submission, misses and recoil can often lead to its demise.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While not as frail as other Psychic-types, Hypno is still not physically bulky enough to shrug off attacks from the likes of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, unless it is running the rare Reflect. All of these Pokemon can trade hits favorably against Hypno, especially if it ever attempts to use Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypno's main draw is Hypnosis, as it incapacitates a Pokemon in a single turn, possibly making one would-be counter into nothing more than a momentum sink. The second best option against these counters is Thunder Wave; this won't help Hypno break through them much, but it will at least enable its teammates to do so. A number of options contest the fourth moveslot: Seismic Toss is the most common and appealing, as it is Hypno's best bet at pressuring Psychic-types. Rest allows it to stick around for longer, shrugging off weaker attacks from many special attackers, though it can be difficult for Hypno to wake up in the presence of strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Hypno's toothlessness against Alakazam and Starmie can most easily be addressed by an Explosion teammate that can lure and remove them—Exeggutor being by far the most reliable, though Gengar can also lure in the former. Once either is removed, Hypno's sleep and paralysis can actually significantly improve one's odds in the endgame. Endgames are usually left for Pokemon that are very dangerous but also very fragile, such as tier icon Tauros, for which Thunder Wave is often a death sentence. Alternatively, if one really needs to cripple Alakazam, Starmie, or Chansey for a teammate, Hypno's strong Psychic will most often force players to expose one of those three targets to its Thunder Wave, which can be very useful for specific teammates trying to break through them. Ultimately, though, this is no different from Alakazam's ability to force Thunder Wave onto special sponges, and Alakazam outclasses Hypno in most scenarios, so make sure you have further reasons to select Hypno—such as Hypnosis—if your primary goal is to paralyze special sponges.</p>"

  "Kingler": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingler is the strongest Pokemon with access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, possessing a dizzying base 130 Attack. This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.</p> <p>So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify. Stomp is a potential choice, allowing Kingler to take a paraflinch approach, but it mandates far more team support to work, which teams can't always afford.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Kingler can deal sizable chip to Gengar with Crabhammer to prevent it from repeatedly switching in, Gengar KOes Kingler with Thunderbolt if it has taken any amount of damage. Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.</p> <p>Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>Once widely considered to be the fourth best Pokemon in the RBY metagame as well as the best sleeper available, Exeggutor has recently suffered a drop in reputation and viability, though it remains a popular choice. A combination of Explosion, Sleep Powder, and Psychic, in addition to unique typing and solid base stats, makes it an easy pick for a large number of RBY teams. Despite the unfortunate Ice weakness, its resistance to Ground-type attacks makes it one of the most reliable Rhydon switch-ins; it is also the most reliable answer to the uncommon but threatening Slowbro. A combination of defensive utility and wallbreaking power earns Exeggutor a spot on many RBY teams; however, teams that already feature other sleepers may find it redundant, and its inability to recover damage can make it undesirable to some teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggutor has a large movepool that can allow it to fill different roles, but none of the following options has seen high-level success in in any combination. Exeggutor can use Rest to get consistent value out of its strong Psychic and Stun Spore, as well as consistently check opposing Exeggutor, Rhydon, Alakazam, Jolteon without Pin Missile, and Blizzard-less Starmie variants throughout a game. However, this often invites in offensive behemoths like Tauros for free, which makes it very difficult to justify over conventional, standard sets. Alternatively, Egg Bomb hits as hard as Double-Edge and has no recoil, but its low accuracy makes it a generally inferior choice. Finally, Exeggutor has access to decent defensive and utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, Leech Seed, and even Mimic, but these are often seen as strictly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon are often on the receiving end of a turn 1 Thunder Wave, which makes them solid switch-ins to Sleep Powder, although they must watch out for aggressive predictions from the Exeggutor user. Although they are not fully reliable in all situations, they are often the best available option to safely switch in on Exeggutor, and should be able to threaten it with Thunder Wave or Blizzard while keeping themselves healthy to answer it repeatedly thanks to Recover or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Exeggutor simply has no ways to consistently get through Chansey outside of Sleep Powder and Explosion, which come with their obvious limitations. A paralyzed Chansey leaves Exeggutor with no options other than to Explode, pray for multiple full paralysis + Special drops with Psychic, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can't really harm each other much, and unless one of the Exeggutor is able to land Sleep Powder on the other, this one-on-one matchup most often ends with one of the Exeggutor Exploding on the other to trade evenly.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Zapdos</strong>: Although they are by no means switch-ins, Lapras and Zapdos threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard and Drill Peck respectively, while Lapras also outspeeds Exeggutor and is able to threaten it with Sing, which means that either of these Pokemon find themselves in a one-on-one against Exeggutor they are generally favored.</p>",

      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<p>Sleep Powder is an extremely threatening move, as incredibly dangerous Pokemon such as Tauros can switch on a sleeping Pokemon with little risk and cause havoc; counterplay to Exeggutor is often centered around absorbing it and containing its effects. Psychic is a powerful attack that threatens significant damage to anything other than special sponges, and is Exeggutor's main weapon against threats such as Snorlax. Explosion is an incredibly useful move that allows Exeggutor to bring something down with it and can create incredibly favorable situations if used correctly; however, the user must be careful of its Explosion being too predictable, as there are a number of ways to neutralize it, such as with Rock- or Ghost-type Pokemon, or sacrificing a Pokemon already affected by a strong status condition such as sleep or freeze. The fourth slot is the most contentious, as none of the four moves listed clearly outshine the other options. Double-Edge is a strong attack capable of breaking down paralyzed Jynx or Alakazam with minimal previous damage, an excellent tool to have at your disposal because both of these Pokemon commonly switch in on Exeggutor to absorb its Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor to continue to cripple potential answers even after Sleep Clause is activated; this is especially useful when facing teams with multiple special sponges. Despite Mega Drain's pitiful Base Power, it ends up being Exeggutor's best tool against Starmie, and while the move is otherwise relatively useless, Starmie is another very common answer to Exeggutor, so Mega Drain has its merits. Finally, Hyper Beam is capable of sniping Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, and even Chansey if they have taken sufficient damage before attempting to switch in into Exeggutor, but it is entirely useless if they have not, and it can have terrible drawbacks if predicted correctly by the opponent; nevertheless, its utility against every common special sponge should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Thanks to this set, Exeggutor is able to answer tier titans such as Chansey and Snorlax and apply huge amounts of pressure on the opponent's team. While its lack of recovery and susceptibility to status makes it a fairly difficult piece to maneuver with, the options in its toolbox make it a difficult threat to answer. Exeggutor players should try to damage or KO paralyzed opposing Pokemon that are able to block Sleep Powder in order to clear the way for it, as landing a Sleep Powder is often game-changing. The easiest and most common ways to find opportunities to send Exeggutor out on the field are on a predicted Chansey using Soft-Boiled or Snorlax using Rest; the former will have to respect the Sleep Powder threat and switch out, while the latter is not only scared of the sleep threat, but also vulnerable to Psychic itself. Once Exeggutor is on the field, the threat that Sleep Powder poses generates strong momentum for the player using it, but it must be followed up by strong predictions to progress the game favorably; using Sleep Powder on an incoming paralyzed Pokemon is simply a wasted turn, but so is Double-Edge on a Snorlax. The stress of prediction can be eased by sending Exeggutor on the field before paralyzing any foes, such as by leading with it. Although landing Sleep Powder this way is much easier, it is also less rewarding due to having to absorb early pressure, status, or damage on Exeggutor.</p> <p>The last detail to touch on is the usage of Explosion. Although most players are tempted to keep Explosion as a tool to get value out of a low health Exeggutor, one should try to recognize when such a line of play might be too greedy. For example, in situations where Exeggutor would not be able to make much progress at all even with a full health bar, it can be advantageous to use Explosion earlier on, when it is harder to predict and therefore more likely to hit the intended target. However, you should be careful of your matchup against Rhydon when choosing to get rid of your Exeggutor early, as it can be very dangerous to get rid of your sturdiest defensive answer to it. It's also possible to use Explosion to get rid of a Sleep Powder answer for a secondary sleeper on your team, most commonly Lapras, but this is a last resort option only in most cases.</p>"

  "Lickitung": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickitung has many desirable traits among OU Swords Dance users that make it stand out from the crowd. These include STAB Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Wrap, all the physical and special coverage it could ever want, and bulk roughly on par with Tauros. Unfortunately, its wide movepool and STAB Hyper Beam are let down by its abysmal base 55 Attack, making its STAB moves no more powerful than any other Swords Dance user's non-STAB attacks, and its awful base 30 Speed ties it for the slowest fully evolved Pokemon in the entire game. Lickitung is very easy to play around once paralyzed, making it extremely risky to stay in on anything that can paralyze it.</p> <p>Nearly every unique trait Lickitung has is eclipsed by another Pokemon. Its role as a Swords Dance user with Wrap is taken by Victreebel, its Water-type coverage is done better by Kabutops and Kingler, and its ability to hit Gengar with Earthquake is outclassed by Sandslash's STAB Earthquake. Its only redeeming traits are its STAB Hyper Beam and that, unlike other Swords Dance users, it has no blatant defensive weaknesses thanks to its decent bulk and strong Normal typing, which has no common weaknesses and allows it to avoid Body Slam paralysis. Although Lickitung has many positive traits as an OU Swords Dance user, its positives are heavily outweighed by its negatives, making it extremely impractical and difficult to use.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Hyper Beam, Wrap, and Lickitung's good defensive qualities are the only reasons to consider it over better Swords Dance users, such as Kingler or Sandslash. +6 Hyper Beam reaches such immense power that it even OHKOes Cloyster 82.1% of the time, though +4 Hyper Beam still packs enough power to almost always OHKO threats with more moderate bulk, such as Zapdos and Tauros. Earthquake is essential coverage, as it is Lickitung's only option to hit Gengar for super effective damage, and it deals decent damage to Rock types at +2; +2 Earthquake has a 7.7% chance to OHKO Gengar and a 6.6% chance to 2HKO Rhydon. Wrap is a useful utility move that can be used to pivot out of bad matchups and chip paralyzed foes into Hyper Beam range while keeping Lickitung safe from paralysis. Water-type coverage can be considered; Bubble Beam 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 33% chance to drop their Speed, which allows Lickitung to outspeed and KO them on the next turn, whereas Surf deals enough damage to prevent Rhydon from using Substitute later. Body Slam is Lickitung's best option for dealing consistent damage, 2HKOing Chansey and having a 95.5% chance to 3HKO Snorlax at +2.</p> <p>Lickitung's only way to find success is by putting it on a team with heavy paralysis support and statusing nearly the entire enemy team before bringing it out. The best opportunity it has to set up is to switch in when a paralyzed Snorlax uses Rest and boost to +2 while Snorlax switches out. It can then try to choke the paralyzed enemy team with boosted Wrap and Hyper Beam.</p>"

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon possesses a very important place in RBY OU thanks to a fairly unique typing and formidable Attack stat; moreover, its Earthquake is the most powerful physical attack in the game without a drawback. Rhydon's typing gives it a good amount of defensive utility, such as switching in to force and punish Hyper Beam recharges, taking Explosions, staving off Thunder Wave, and stonewalling Zapdos and Jolteon. Thanks to its immense Attack stat, Rhydon can hit very high damage ranges, most notably a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. It's also capable of KOing Tauros after two Body Slams from your own Tauros. This power makes it very difficult to switch into, with would-be checks such as Exeggutor taking surprising damage. While initially slow, Rhydon is also very scary for paralyzed teams to fight—they often fold to it outright. Naturally, this means it appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Chansey. It can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, however, to force damage if they lack Reflect.</p> <p>Golem has competed with Rhydon for a teamslot for many years. Golem has the strongest Explosion in the game, only beaten by Snorlax's Self-Destruct, along with slightly higher Speed to win against Rhydon specifically. However, because Golem's niche hinges on Explosion, it often has to eschew Substitute. The lower damage output also causes Golem to lose out on some very valuable ranges, notably losing to Reflect Chansey more often than not, which Rhydon excels against. Due to these factors, Rhydon is generally favored over Golem in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Out of all of Rhydon's moves, the most replaceable would be Rock Slide. This is because its coverage is rather specific, while the other listed moves add key utility. When dropping Rock Slide, be wary of the lower damage output, such as only 4HKOing Cloyster and 3HKOing Lapras with Earthquake, as well as the loss of coverage against Articuno and Moltres. Should these qualities be useful, Body Slam can be dropped instead. In this case, though, Rhydon can't set up paralysis for itself, making it much more reliant on teammates and matchups against threats such as Starmie noticeably worse.</p> <p>Rest can be used to give Rhydon more longevity, but it's hard to wake up due to being 2HKOed by Tauros. Rest is generally used on more defensive teams to better handle Zapdos and Jolteon throughout a game, but it's also extremely helpful against Reflect Chansey, enabling Rhydon to be more aggressive and freely burn Rest turns behind Substitute. It also helps against Snorlax without coverage, as Rhydon despises being paralyzed by Snorlax on the switch. Another option is Leer to beat Reflect Chansey much more reliably and potentially get past Reflect Snorlax. However, these Pokemon can switch out to get rid of the Defense drops. Using Leer also lets faster Pokemon switch in while taking no damage, which can give the opponent opportunities to play around Rhydon's usual sweeping. In contrast, when spamming Earthquake, a critical hit still ruins Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, and switch-ins will likely take damage. Counter can be used to more heavily punish Hyper Beam and Explosion—bringing in Rhydon after a foe's Explosion and using Counter after forcing their switch-in out can usually lead to a free KO. While gimmicky, Bubble Beam could be used for other Rhydon or Golem; if it drops Speed, it guarantees a KO with Earthquake. It can also allow Rhydon to move first against Exeggutor switch-ins, allowing it to situationally win the interaction should Exeggutor be worn down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is the best check for Rhydon in the game. It resists Earthquake and is only 4HKOed by Rock Slide. However, it must watch out for Body Slam. In fact, Rhydon will usually use Body Slam expecting an Exeggutor switch-in if it's still healthy. A paralyzed Exeggutor won't be able to reliably check Rhydon anymore, as two Rock Slides will deal upwards of 55% of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard in return, which, when combined with Tauros's absurdly high critical hit rate and the chance of freeze, means that Rhydon is almost always forced out. Even if it doesn't switch out, there's a respectable chance that it does absolutely nothing in return. However, Tauros doesn't appreciate being damaged, especially if the Tauros on Rhydon's team is still at full HP. After Rhydon KOes a Pokemon, Tauros can usually force it out and start exerting its sweeping prowess.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is only 4HKOed by Earthquake and 3HKOed by Rock Slide, and it can OHKO a third of the time in return with Blizzard. It even packs Clamp for denying a free move to Rhydon behind a Substitute, as Clamp will break the Substitute and render Rhydon immobile in the process.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Chansey</strong>: These two Pokemon are able to switch in on Rhydon and duel it, but only if they are not paralyzed, and Chansey requires Reflect. Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Starmie, while very rarely 2HKOed by Earthquake, can be paralyzed by Body Slam on the switch or on a predicted Recover, turning the tides in Rhydon's favor. The paralysis factor makes these matchups extremely variable.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel outspeeds and OHKOes Rhydon with Razor Leaf. However, it takes a huge chunk of damage from Earthquake, which is a likely 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro threatens to OHKO Rhydon with Surf, and with Reflect, it can effortlessly set up Amnesia against it. It can also use Thunder Wave when predicting a switch to worsen the situation. However, it does take significant damage coming in, making it a check at best.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon can OHKO Rhydon with their Ice-type moves, but they struggle to switch in because of the threat of Rock Slide, as it will almost always 2HKO Lapras and always OHKO Jynx. Paralyzing them also turns them into prey for Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem outspeeds Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon also 2HKOes Golem with its own Earthquake, meaning Golem cannot switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: While Rhydon is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Ice Beam, it struggles heavily to actually KO Snorlax without critical hits if Reflect is active. Earthquake can deal up to 38% before Reflect goes up, but after that, the damage is negligible at best. Reflect Snorlax does give Rhydon a good number of opportunities to fish for critical hits, so this matchup can be quite volatile. Snorlax also has issues switching in, making it a check at best.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rhydon's Earthquake is the strongest physical move in the game with no drawbacks, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Rock Slide covers Zapdos and hits Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Lapras harder. Body Slam is extremely valuable, allowing Rhydon to generate its own paralysis support against the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras. Rhydon's Substitute is hard for inexperienced players to understand the true potential of, but it can single-handedly win games. Its Substitute tanking one Seismic Toss gives Rhydon the edge one-on-one against Chansey, though Ice Beam still stings. Also, Rhydon can create Substitutes versus Pokemon that can't significantly damage it, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, giving it a free hit against whatever comes in afterwards. This can instantly win the game or impart a huge chunk of damage to a replacement like Tauros. Substitute is also extremely helpful against paralyzed Starmie, letting Rhydon fish for full paralysis to stay in. Rhydon can then go for the uncommon 2HKO with Earthquake or even a possible OHKO with a critical hit.</p> <p>Despite being slow, Rhydon is very hard to switch into if you lack Exeggutor, making it one of the key reasons for Exeggutor's success in RBY OU. It's an absolute nightmare for paralyzed teams, easily rampaging through them. It's very viable to build a team around Rhydon, providing it the paralysis support it needs to clean up. Its key immunity to Electric-type moves, namely Thunder Wave, means it's very hard to reliably paralyze and gives it switch-in opportunities on Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey. It is also the premier counter to Zapdos and Jolteon, two Pokemon that can be very dangerous in its absence—especially Zapdos—due to the few Electric-resistant Pokemon in RBY OU. Rhydon also resists Normal, which means it can switch into a predicted Explosion or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Despite all of the advantages, Rhydon is heavily reliant on opposing Pokemon being paralyzed to get in safely. It has very poor Special; this and its typing can make it easy prey for almost every special attacker in the tier. As a result, Rhydon tends to struggle one-on-one against non-paralyzed threats, notably Tauros, Starmie, and Exeggutor.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey is a staple in the RBY metagame, present on nearly 100% of competitive teams. The reason for its extreme popularity mostly lies in its gargantuan special bulk neutralizing Psychic-types, an otherwise incredibly difficult task without using Psychic-types of your own, as well as its ability to completely wall other special attackers like Lapras. It does not perform as well against physical attackers, however; strong hits from the likes of Snorlax and Rhydon can threaten an easy 2HKO, so Chansey must be wary of these threats whenever entering the field, although it does possess tools to ease these matchups despite its generally innocuous offensive presence. Nonetheless, Chansey is somewhat of a requirement in any RBY team due to the risks you would take against Psychic-types without it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While it is generally recommended to stick to the above combinations, Chansey is free to mix and match its options, with the only mandatory move being Soft-Boiled. Sets such as Counter + Sing or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss, Reflect + Ice Beam + Thunderbolt, and Seismic Toss + Ice Beam + Thunder Wave can all perform admirably on the right team, so if you want to rebalance certain matchups for your team, feel free to explore different, less conventional ways to combine Chansey's best moves.</p> <p>Defense Curl is an option over Reflect in the typical Reflect set. Boosting Chansey's Defense past +2 usually makes little difference, but its 64 PP allow you to win PP wars against opposing Reflect Chansey and Snorlax handily as well as significantly increase Chansey's odds in a PP stall against Alakazam and Starmie, which is a useful advantage in its own right; however, Reflect's one-turn setup is significantly better when Chansey switches in on Snorlax, so it's generally preferred.</p> <p>Toxic is another curveball that synergizes well with partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, or Victreebel, as the damage quickly stacks up on targets that would otherwise be able to endure their hits, such as opposing Chansey; also, a Chansey carrying Toxic should beat any Chansey that isn't carrying Ice Beam in the long run due to the damage from the poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, forcing it to keep using Soft-Boiled in most situations; as Body Slam's 24 PP outlasts Soft-Boiled's 16, Chansey cannot afford to outstall the attacks, especially when you also factor in the odds of critical hits as well as the potential Hyper Beam from Snorlax. Even when Chansey is carrying Reflect, a Snorlax with Rest is often not even forced to switch out, as it has really good odds of breaking through eventually between critical hits and PP count. The best option for Chansey is to force Snorlax to use Rest and then switch out to something that can threaten it while it's sleeping. While this is not an awful short-term scenario for the Chansey player, as the Snorlax will need some free turns to wake up, Snorlax can easily find those turns whenever Chansey hits the field again, putting it in yet another situation where it is bound to lose if it doesn't switch out. If the Snorlax carries Ice Beam, it can also attempt to freeze Chansey, and in the worst case for Snorlax, it can trade with Chansey by using Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Chansey has no way to significantly damage Alakazam, and while it won't be doing much damage back, it can win the PP war thanks to Recover's massive 32 PP unless it gets fully paralyzed several times in a row. Alakazam can also simply fire off Psychic until Chansey's Special drops low enough that it's forced to switch out, but Psychic's limited 16 PP means this can generally only happen two or three times per game. Starmie functions very similarly, as long as the Chansey doesn't have Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Chansey will be healing up a lot throughout the game. If you can send a sleep move user such as Exeggutor out on a predicted Soft-Boiled, Chansey will have to respect the threat of Sleep Powder and switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Depending on the sets, Chansey can be an excellent Chansey counter. Ice Beam threatens to freeze any unparalyzed Chansey, while a paralyzed Reflect Chansey is going to PP stall most other Chansey with ease. Sing Chansey can also surprise the opponent's Chansey and land a sleep on it, and even if it misses, Sing will remain threatening and have to be respected with a switch.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Lures</strong>: Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Gengar can usually manage to get Chansey on the field to sponge one of their powerful special attacks and catch it with an Explosion to take it out. This is especially viable for teams running a Pokemon such as Lapras or Psychic-less Starmie, which are otherwise completely walled by Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While Rhydon has to respect the Ice Beam threat, its Earthquake achieves a guaranteed 2HKO, so it can sometimes accept taking the Ice Beam damage in exchange for a KO on Chansey. It's even better against Chansey sets that don't run Ice Beam, as it can create Substitutes with enough HP to tank two Seismic Tosses and use Earthquake freely. Both of these situations only really favor Rhydon if the Chansey is paralyzed, however, so make sure to set up its status properly before attempting to win with Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: If Chansey is not running Thunderbolt, Slowbro can freely get Amnesia boosts on it, periodically heal any damage with Rest, and eventually KO via the STAB move of choice as soon as Chansey gets fully paralyzed. Chansey should generally switch out of Slowbro whenever possible, as it can get very threatening very quickly otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: If Jolteon carries Rest, it is able to repeatedly shrug off Chansey's attempts at damage until Double Kick critical hits and paralysis manages to take Chansey down. This leaves Jolteon very vulnerable during its Rest turns, so you should be careful when attempting this.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: If all else fails, Tauros can come in on a paralyzed Chansey and take it out with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, but Tauros really hates being paralyzed, so you should only use this option as a last resort.</p>",

Soft-Boiled is necessary to remain healthy throughout the game, and Thunder Wave is Chansey's main weapon to cripple threats like Tauros and hinder anything else that tries to beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> <p>BoltBeam Chansey will always have to be careful maneuvering around Snorlax, as it doesn't have the tools to face Snorlax one-on-one; this is especially true for Snorlax that carry Rest. BoltBeam Chansey often wants to get paralyzed so it can avoid freezes and sleep, but this makes the Snorlax matchup even worse, and since it's such a threatening Pokemon to begin with, you may want to be careful with accepting Thunder Wave on your Chansey. Another tough matchup is Alakazam, which can easily sponge all of Chansey's attacks and retaliate with repeated Psychic that will eventually cause multiple Special drops and force Chansey off the field; even if Alakazam runs out of Psychic PP, it can often win an all-out PP stall. However, BoltBeam Chansey has a much happier time against the other common Psychic users due to super effective coverage on both Starmie and Exeggutor. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to win against non-Ice Beam Chansey thanks to the freeze chance, so long as the opposing Chansey isn't paralyzed — when it is, this matchup turns around, as Ice Beam's relatively low 16 PP will usually cause BoltBeam Chansey to lose the PP war.</p>"

      "Sing": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sing is one of the premier Chansey sets. Although the high risk of missing may appear dangerous, Chansey is unlikely to take much punishment in return from any special attacker, so it is a common and successful strategy to simply switch Sing Chansey on a Pokemon like Starmie very early on and put it to sleep immediately. As Soft-Boiled is mandatory, using Sing leaves two moveslots open, usually to be filled with one attacking move and one utility move. The most common attacking move is Ice Beam, as the freeze threat is quite potent against most special attackers, which cannot harm Chansey all that much. However, running Ice Beam as your only damaging move leaves Chansey entirely toothless against Ice-types such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Lapras, so you may want to opt for Seismic Toss instead. As for the utility move, Thunder Wave is handy to cripple various threats, most notably physical attackers that pose an urgent threat to Chansey but really dislike being paralyzed, such as Tauros. Counter, on the other hand, is a specific tool to take care of Snorlax. Due to Chansey's gigantic HP stat, it will OHKO Snorlax after taking a single Body Slam, which is Snorlax's go-to STAB move and main way to damage Chansey. Once Counter is revealed, Snorlax can use moves that Counter can't reply to, such as Earthquake and Ice Beam, and then switch out to a more appropriate check; this means that it is of vital importance for Chansey to land its Counter the first time it uses it, as getting any mileage out of it in the rest of the game is going to be quite unlikely.</p> <p>Sing Chansey's dream scenario is to switch in on a Turn 1 Thunder Wave, allowing it to neutralize incoming sleep moves for the rest of the game, and immediately firing off Sing to achieve what is essentially a full Pokemon advantage due to RBY's notorious sleep mechanics. This threat means Sing Chansey is a strong antimeta pick, as it is commonplace for leads such as Starmie and Alakazam to want to use Thunder Wave in the first turn of the game. However, this strategy is very well known, especially at higher levels of play, so expecting opponents to use Thunder Wave on the first turn may result in heartbreak. Should these types of mindgames not appeal to you, it is also possible to hide Chansey's Sing until later in the game, attempting to bluff a different set and catch a more valuable target than you otherwise would have; however, this is largely reliant on hitting your very first Sing, which is only a 55% chance, as the surprise factor will be blown afterwards.</p> <p>It should be mentioned that Sing Chansey can also function as a lead; although its matchup against faster sleepers such as Gengar, Jynx, and Exeggutor is abysmal, it is able to comfortably land a Sing when facing common leads such as Alakazam and Starmie.</p>"

      "Reflect": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect halves the damage received from physical attacks, patching up Chansey's biggest weakness. Soft-Boiled is a necessity to allow Chansey to check threats and stay healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is necessary to punish any Tauros that may attempt to ruin your fun by negating Reflect with a critical hit; it's also generally strong utility and one of the most threatening tools in Chansey's arsenal. Seismic Toss is the preferred move to deal damage, as it hits for a consistent 100 HP, but Ice Beam, while resisted by many Pokemon, still threatens a deadly freeze on everything other than Ice-types. If you choose to rely on Ice Beam as your only attacking move, you will have to be careful not to paralyze Pokemon such as Starmie, as Chansey loses all offensive pressure against it without the possibility to freeze it.</p> <p>Reflect Chansey is one of the best early- and mid-game pivots, while also retaining good enough one-on-one matchups to remain a threat in the later stages of the game. This set's biggest selling point is the ability to switch into Snorlax's Body Slam without having to fear paralysis, allowing it to always set up Reflect, heal off all the damage with Soft-Boiled, and then safely chip away at the opposition via Seismic Toss. An important decision is going to present itself often when playing Reflect Chansey: letting it take a Thunder Wave will make it immune to freezes, allowing it to take on Ice Beam Chansey and win the PP war as well as making it a reliable answer to Exeggutor since it won't have to fear Sleep Powder anymore; however, this will make Chansey much less effective at switching in on Snorlax, and other threats such as Rhydon will also have a much better time against it. Managing the status of your Reflect Chansey is extremely important, and making the right decisions can often swing the tides of the game in your favor. It should be mentioned that a paralyzed Reflect Chansey will also have much more trouble facing Psychic-types due to the 30% chance of dropping its Special via Psychic; it is relatively easy for one of them to accumulate two or more drops and force it to switch out, thus removing Reflect and significantly weakening its effectiveness against physical threats for the rest of the game, unless it is given the free turns to set it up again.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is often labelled as a \"second Tauros\", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.</p> <p>However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks</strong>: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.</p> <p><strong>Tauros Checks</strong>: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.</p> <p>Despite Kangaskhan's \"second Tauros\" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie is one of the most common Pokemon in RBY OU thanks to its Psychic typing and access to Recover and Thunder Wave. Starmie's physical bulk allows it to be a defensive check to virtually every Pokemon lacking an Electric-type attack and take two hits from almost any physical attacker. Additionally, its access to many special attacks such as Blizzard, Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns it into an offensive threat versus anything without instant recovery. Although Starmie naturally outspeeds many common Pokemon, most notably Tauros, oftentimes a paralyzed Starmie functions well in its defensive role due to its ability to block sleep-inducing moves from almost anything, while the ability to paralyze any non-Ground-type Pokemon via Thunder Wave makes it difficult to pressure offensively even then. Among the Recover and Soft-Boiled users in OU, Starmie also possesses a special defensive utility, as it's the only one of them to not be forced out immediately by Snorlax when paralyzed and is able to fight back against it offensively as well when running a STAB move. Those traits make Starmie usable in pretty much any state of the game, turning it into a very flexible Pokemon and easy addition to most RBY OU teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the increased PP if Starmie tries to fish for freezes on opposing Alakazam or Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Hyper Beam is an option to surprise weakened Chansey or Alakazam, but Starmie loses a lot of potential if you drop a move for it. Hydro Pump is an option on a late-game Starmie, as it can 2HKO Tauros and generally do decent damage to anything that does not resist it, especially with a critical hit.</p> <p>Hydro Pump can be used for strong STAB hits, and can be especially powerful when combined with Special drops from Psychic, but running the two moves in combination severely limits Starmie's coverage options and leaves it struggling to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor or an opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie also has access to Reflect and the rare Light Screen. However, it will struggle to fit those moves onto its moveset most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is the number one counter to Starmie, as Starmie realistically cannot beat it with any of its movesets, especially when Chansey is paralyzed. In return, Chansey beats Starmie by paralyzing it and beating it down with Thunderbolt, which Starmie will almost certainly fail to outstall with Recover due to full paralysis and critical hit chance. Alternatively, a Chansey lacking Thunderbolt can attempt to freeze an unparalyzed Starmie, as it runs little risk of losing by doing that. However, in order for Chansey to reliably beat a paralyzed Starmie, it needs to run Thunderbolt, since Seismic Toss's PP does not surpass Recover's massive 32 PP, meaning Starmie can outstall variants without Thunderbolt. It's also worth noting that an unparalyzed Chansey runs the risk of getting frozen by Starmie's Ice-type attacks, especially if it cannot threaten with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam has little to fear from Starmie as well. Although it does not possess any super effective move to hit Starmie with, its higher Speed and Special mean Alakazam can trade paralysis against Starmie and proceed to damage it with Seismic Toss or go for Special drops with its own, vastly stronger Psychic. The best Starmie can do is try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or paralyze it and go for Special drops of its own in order to gain the Speed advantage and make Blizzard do more damage. Recover's massive PP leaves Starmie outstalled relatively quickly with that approach, though, since Alakazam can switch out to something like Chansey to relieve the Special drops. Additionally, while Surf can help Starmie in the Alakazam matchup, it usually still is not enough to beat it, since it only 4HKOes. The possibility of critical hits combined with multiple full paralysis turns on Alakazam, however, does give Starmie a fighting chance.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Even though Starmie is relatively bulky for a Pokemon with instant recovery, it still takes a good chunk from Snorlax's Body Slam. Alongside Starmie's relative trouble to deal great damage to Snorlax plus Snorlax frequently running Rest to heal damage and sometimes carrying Hyper Beam, this makes it a solid check to Starmie. If nothing else, Snorlax's Body Slam is another tool to paralyze Starmie, which generally makes it easier to handle. However, Snorlax has to be careful versus Starmie carrying a STAB move, especially Psychic, since one Special drop means it can no longer reliably Rest stall even a paralyzed Starmie. Another tool Snorlax has to dispose of Starmie is Amnesia. Since Amnesia Snorlax frequently only carries Blizzard and Body Slam as attacking moves, it still does not reliably beat Starmie, but outspeeding Starmie thanks to the additional Speed drop caused by using Amnesia when both are paralyzed surely helps break it with Body Slam. However, Amnesia does not protect Snorlax from Starmie's high critical hit chance, meaning Starmie can even break through Amnesia Snorlax with two consecutive Psychic critical hits or a potential freeze from an Ice-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Starmie struggles to stay in against Electric-type STAB moves from Jolteon and Zapdos or trade a Thunder Wave with them, since it cannot attempt to Recover off the damage they inflict piece by piece. Jolteon is definitely the best offensive check to Starmie. It does not like paralysis very much, but since it is one of the rare Pokemon that naturally outspeed Starmie, it can afford to take Starmie on even when paralyzed. Starmie can at best 4HKO Jolteon with Psychic, while Jolteon outspeeds and 2HKOes it. Zapdos does not fare as brilliantly against Starmie as Jolteon does due to being weak to Blizzard and not naturally outspeeding it, but it still does beat Starmie one-on-one, though it greatly appreciates it being paralyzed beforehand. Note that both Zapdos and Jolteon have a high critical hit rate thanks to their high Speed. One critical hit Thunderbolt from them will easily OHKO Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Razor Leaf from Victreebel does upwards of 73% to Starmie, meaning that Victreebel does not need to hit many Wraps to put a paralyzed Starmie in range of being KOed by Razor Leaf. If Sleep Clause is already active, Starmie absolutely needs to be paralyzed for Victreebel to beat it, though, since Starmie 2HKOes Victreebel with either Psychic or Blizzard. Mega Drain on Exeggutor is another option to pressure paralyzed Starmie trying to block Sleep Powder, since it 3HKOes Starmie and 2HKOes it after a Special drop from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong>: Other non-STAB Electric-type attacks coming from the likes of Gengar, Lapras, and opposing Starmie will put enormous pressure on Starmie, potentially taking it down with a single untimely full paralysis or critical hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover and Thunder Wave alongside Starmie's incredible Speed turn Starmie into a very sturdy Pokemon that possesses the ability to paralyze the foe and outspeed it after, even when paralyzed itself, and proceed to recover its health, since most attacks do not deal 50% to it. This makes Starmie tough to break and is why this move combination allows Starmie, despite its high Speed, to take paralysis even early on in the game and avoid being crippled by it as much as most other Pokemon. In fact, a paralyzed Starmie is very good at blocking sleep-inducing moves from common sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Starmie's traits do not end at its defensive role, however. In its last two moveslots, Starmie is able to run a variety of powerful special attacks, which can be chosen to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier except Chansey super effectively or at least decently hard. In that context it is worth noting that, due to its high Speed, Starmie has a very high chance of 22.46% to score a critical hit, which frequently enables Starmie to successfully knock out opposing Pokemon by shooting for critical hits.</p> <p>Blizzard most notably hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Rhydon, as well as Victreebel and Dragonite. It is chosen over Ice Beam due to having more power while only being 10% less accurate. In addition to the coverage Blizzard provides, another reason to use it lies in its chance to score a freeze on opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Alakazam or just about any Pokemon if you're desperate. Moves that typically go alongside Blizzard are Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Psychic is Starmie's best option to hit Pokemon like Gengar and the Normal-types, thanks to gaining STAB. This is especially important against Snorlax, as a Starmie without STAB moves struggles quite a bit to really hurt it. Another important feature of Psychic is the chance to score Special drops, which can help force switches and thus spread paralysis on the opposing team. This is especially noteworthy against Chansey, especially those running Reflect, since enough Special drops can force it out even when it has already set up a Reflect, which Starmie will otherwise fail to achieve. It can be useful against Alakazam as well, albeit not as consistently, since Alakazam itself can cause Starmie's Special to drop. It is worth mentioning however, that the Blizzard + Psychic set does have some issues with running out of PP rather quickly against opposing Recover users and will not be able to hurt opposing Starmie and Slowbro.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is used to hit opposing Water-types super effectively, including Lapras, Cloyster, and especially opposing Starmie and Slowbro. Being able to threaten other Starmie, especially when they lack Thunderbolt themselves, and beating Slowbro with a critical hit are the biggest selling points for Thunderbolt. Additionally, Thunderbolt is Starmie's only super effective move against Articuno, which itself doesn't really threaten Starmie much but can be annoying to actually knock out. If Thunderbolt is chosen alongside Blizzard, it should be noted that Starmie will struggle to properly threaten Gengar and Snorlax, as the latter can usually Rest stall Starmie, especially if it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Either move can be run alongside Blizzard whether or not Starmie is used as a lead, though as a lead Starmie usually prefers Psychic, as it's usually more useful for early-game purposes; Thunderbolt's coverage alongside Blizzard is appreciated if Starmie is kept for late-game, when opposing Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax are taken care of otherwise.</p> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt can be used on the same set if you want to retain the power versus Starmie and Slowbro and the ability to threaten Snorlax, which can be very dangerous for teams that have to rely on either of those Pokemon to fend off Starmie if Chansey is taken out already. Not being able to do much versus Exeggutor, especially when facing it as a lead, plus being unable to hit Rhydon super effectively can be annoying, but neither of them really likes going up against Starmie, since Psychic still does a lot to Rhydon, and Exeggutor usually cannot do much back if it lacks Mega Drain and Starmie cannot be put to sleep anymore. Exeggutor will be paralyzed and receive permanent chip damage in the process of trying to beat Starmie. However, Starmie cannot beat it without giving it multiple chances to fish for Special drops, which might force Starmie out and give Exeggutor the opportunity to put a switch-in to sleep. Additionally, Exeggutor has plenty of time to go for its Explosion, meaning Starmie will likely only trade with Exeggutor. Furthermore, not running Blizzard means you miss out on hitting especially the rare Dragonite super effectively, which then does not have to fear being outright KOed by Starmie and may be able to try its luck with setting up Agility on a weakened team.</p> <p>Another STAB option Starmie has is Surf. However, Water-type moves do not provide much in terms of coverage in the RBY OU metagame, since Fire-types are basically nonexistent and will be unable to beat Starmie anyway, and the ones you might meet such as Moltres are already hit super effectively by Blizzard. Nevertheless, Surf is used to OHKO Rhydon, hitting it by surprise, and it's Starmie's best option against Alakazam and Jynx, giving it a chance to take them down with some luck. It is worth noting that even with Surf, Starmie does not necessarily beat Alakazam; it will force it to Recover more frequently, though, and thus create turns to gain momentum by switching in a physical attacker on a Recover. Like Psychic, Surf also serves as a stronger STAB move against neutral targets such as Snorlax. The lack of a Special drop chance, however, makes it the inferior choice for that purpose. Usually the move to go alongside Surf is Thunderbolt, since Blizzard and Psychic are somewhat redundant with Surf. Since Surf and Thunderbolt both have 24 PP, this Starmie set is best suited for drawn-out games that include PP stalling. It must be noted that with Thunderbolt and Surf, Starmie is walled by Victreebel and Exeggutor, the latter of which has a good chance to force Starmie out due to its high Special and Psychic dropping Starmie's Special, giving Exeggutor opportunities to use Sleep Powder on a switch-in. Additionally, Starmie can no longer hurt opposing Zapdos and Dragonite. Pairing Surf with Blizzard is possible to avoid these issues, but the inability to hit opposing Water-types makes this less desirable.</p>"

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>Jynx has a lot of unique features that differentiate it from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie. For one, Jynx is the second fastest sleep inducer after the unreliable Gengar, making it a fantastic potential lead option that can incapacitate its checks by making them fall asleep. STAB Blizzard also allows Jynx to win the matchup versus Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos. This is all in addition to the standard expectations of a fantastic Psychic-type: access to the powerful STAB Psychic and a high Special stat. Jynx also has its faults, though. Despite its key resistances to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks, Jynx can become easily trampled over by physical attacks, namely from Normal-types such as Tauros and Snorlax, due to its pitiful HP and Defense stats. While its key resistances to Blizzard and Psychic may say otherwise, the main way Jynx provides defensive utility is being the switch-in for predicted sleep-inducing moves. Additionally, nearly all teams run at least two solid checks to Jynx between Chansey and either Starmie or Alakazam, sometimes both. Due to the omnipresence of these checks, their access to Thunder Wave and reliable recovery, and Jynx's susceptibility to paralysis and being worn down over time, Jynx's role is undermined. Jynx can use Rest to restore its health and alleviate its paralysis, burning off sleep turns against Pokemon that can't do much back to it like a paralyzed BoltBeam Starmie. However, doing so opens itself up to a slew of physical attackers such as Tauros and Snorlax that can freely switch into it while it's asleep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously stated, Jynx's most useless move is Rest, and therefore if one wishes to use one of these other options, it should usually replace Rest. Ice Beam can be used over Blizzard to give Jynx more PP on its Ice-type STAB option. Running Ice Beam can also come in handy in long, drawn-out games to secure a freeze against one of the opponent's Pokemon, although the drop in power is noticeable. A healthy Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Tauros and Snorlax; it is situational, and Jynx has to be at a sizable amount of health for this strategy to be pulled off, although it can also be used after taking damage from a previous turn and the foe switching out. Mimic can be utilized to potentially copy an important utility or coverage move such as Thunder Wave, Soft-Boiled, Recover, or Thunderbolt from one of Jynx's switch-ins such as Chansey or Starmie. However, forfeiting Rest for only a chance to copy a useful coverage move is somewhat risky and still leaves Jynx prone to being paralyzed. Body Slam can be utilized to fish for paralysis against incoming switch-ins like Alakazam, although it is not guaranteed, cannot paralyze Chansey and Snorlax, and is fired off of Jynx's exceedingly below-average Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch in safely on Jynx whatsoever, it can put Jynx out of commission from the very beginning of the game with Hypnosis. Gengar is also faster than Jynx and can threaten to use Explosion at any time.</p> <p><strong>Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam</strong>: Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam can sponge all of Jynx's attacks, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and restore their health with Soft-Boiled or Recover, acting as some of the most consistent Jynx checks after one of their teammates has been put to sleep. Although they are all susceptible to being frozen with Blizzard, they can whittle Jynx down and force it to use Rest early, limiting the number of chances Jynx has of freezing something.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Tauros and Snorlax can take advantage of Jynx's low HP and Defense and love switching into it after it uses Rest, forcing in a teammate to take the incoming Body Slam. Tauros can also pick up the KO against Jynx with Hyper Beam with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, like Starmie, resists Jynx's dual STAB combination of Ice and Psychic and can use Jynx as a setup opportunity to boost with Amnesia and Rest off all the damage it has taken. Lapras is another great example of an offensive check to Jynx despite its lack of reliable recovery due to its 4x resistance to Blizzard and access to Body Slam, although one of its teammates will need to have already been put to sleep. The Jynx user may also decide to trade damage off against Lapras with the end goal of revenge killing it later with another teammate such as Tauros or Alakazam. Getting too much damage off on these Pokemon after Jynx puts something to sleep will often lead to the defensive core of a team crumbling.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jynx's primary goal is to use Lovely Kiss and incapacitate the foe's lead such as Starmie or Alakazam. Blizzard is Jynx's strongest STAB option against certain Psychic-types such as Alakazam and nails Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. It can also be used to fish for a potential freeze while scouting which of the opponent's Pokemon has a sleep-inducing move. Psychic rounds out Jynx's coverage, receives STAB, and hits Pokemon such as Gengar and Lapras. It also has the potential to lower a foe's Special stat, which can come in handy to more convincingly win matchups versus special attackers, notably an opposing paralyzed Chansey. Rest provides Jynx with a way of restoring its health and alleviating paralysis. While Jynx doesn't have too many opportunities to use Rest due to its lackluster physical bulk, it can use Rest and burn sleep turns on more passive foes such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor lacking Double-Edge. Burning off sleep turns is not always easy, however, as generally speaking most teams pack anywhere from two to three solid checks to Jynx, leaving it liable to exploitation. Jynx is primarily used as a lead due to its above-average Speed tier and access to a fairly accurate sleep-inducing move. However, Jynx can also be used mid-game due to its high Special and fantastic offensive dual STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic. Note that removing statused Pokemon such as paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey from play allows for Jynx to more freely use Lovely Kiss. The ideal way to utilize Jynx is to put one check to sleep with Lovely Kiss, potentially freeze one of Jynx's remaining checks, and then switch it into potential sleep inducers.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance and Hyper Beam are Pinsir's bread and butter, allowing it to swiftly end games if its team can successfully chip and paralyze the opposing team. It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.</p> <p>Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.</p> <p>While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.</p>"

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>Tauros is the most iconic Pokemon in RBY OU, and its presence has been shaping the tier for as long as it has existed. Tauros is undoubtedly the strongest offensive threat in the tier, thanks to its powerful Body Slams and Hyper Beams paired with the coverage moves to hit any Pokemon that resists its STAB moves. This is further enhanced by its high Speed, and therefore high critical hit rate, as well as serviceable bulk. This makes switching into Tauros a very arduous prospect for most teams, as potential checks like Starmie have to fear a sizable chance of paralysis or a critical hit from Body Slam. Other Pokemon with the theoretical physical bulk, such as Snorlax, Cloyster, and Slowbro, can only shrug off Tauros's hits via Rest, leaving them in an exploitable state. Overall, although some special attackers can trade blows advantageously with Tauros, and it has to be very wary of paralysis, its sheer offensive prowess makes it an automatic inclusion on a vast majority of RBY teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder can be used to damage Cloyster, which is one of the sturdiest Tauros switch-ins available. Thunder manages to 2HKO it but has to deal with much lower accuracy, while Thunderbolt misses out on that damage range but is generally far more reliable, and is therefore the preferred option a vast majority of the time.</p> <p>Given the generally low usage of Gengar and Counter Chansey, it is reasonable to cut Earthquake in favor of Fire Blast; while this move does not hit any targets for extra damage, it does carry a 30.1% burn chance that can give Tauros an upper hand in a one-on-one matchup with opposing Tauros.</p> <p>Stomp has a 30.1% flinch chance, and while definitely unreliable, it can be used to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range with no damage traded back with some luck. This is an especially appealing option if the enemy Pokemon is already paralyzed, which further increases the chances of it not managing to attack.</p> <p>Double-Edge's 100 Base Power can be used to safely snipe out KOs that Body Slam cannot reach while not having to rely on Hyper Beam; the recoil is a generally unpleasant side effect, but it can be used to your advantage, as whenever a Pokemon faints from recoil the turn ends immediately. This mechanic can occasionally be used to damage an opponent and prevent them from healing back up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros's below average bulk is difficult to exploit because it is usually faster and strong enough to KO the foe before they can strike back. Paralysis and sleep are both very common in the RBY metagame, and they can shut down this element of Tauros's gameplay, making it much easier to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor lacks recovery, and therefore cannot repeatedly switch in on Tauros, simply having Exeggutor in the back will often dissuade Tauros players from clicking Hyper Beam, as Exeggutor could switch in, tank the Hyper Beam, and land a Sleep Powder or a Stun Spore on Tauros during the recharge turn, effectively putting it out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only Pokemon with access to Recover that can survive a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, which makes it an obvious candidate for a reliable switch-in on Tauros throughout the game; however, Body Slam can ruin its day with decent frequency due to the chance of paralysis. Regardless, Starmie outspeeds Tauros and can even threaten it with Thunder Wave, which makes a healthy Starmie one of the best Tauros answers available.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These Pokemon possess great bulk and access to a powerful Blizzard that is generally enough to scare Tauros away. Lapras's Blizzard is stronger and has a chance to 2HKO, while Cloyster takes Body Slams better and more commonly runs Rest to heal the damage back up. As a side note, Articuno also possesses 2HKO potential via Blizzard, but it's significantly frailer and generally less viable than both Cloyster and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is part of the small list of Pokemon that are guaranteed to survive a critical hit Hyper Beam from full HP, making it an appealing option to switch in on a predicted Hyper Beam in order to guarantee landing a Thunder Wave on the recharge turn. It does not mind a Body Slam either, but it can be hard for it to use Rest and wake up unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Tauros's much slower and bulkier counterpart is a good asset when trying to answer an opposing Tauros, as its natural bulk will often at least guarantee that some damage gets traded back, and if it carries Self-Destruct, it can somewhat reliably trade one-for-one if your opponent chooses to leave Tauros on the field.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Although mauled by Earthquake, Gengar can switch in on Normal-type attacks from Tauros at no cost and threaten it with Hypnosis. Although the exchange is somewhat likely to end very poorly, between Hypnosis's miss chance and Earthquake's critical chance, the Tauros user is generally expected to keep it away from danger if possible, which means Gengar can somewhat reliably be used to prevent Tauros from making any progress as long as it doesn't get hit with an Earthquake on a predicted switch in. Gengar is also the best check to Tauros without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Alakazam</strong>: Although they definitely do not want to pick a full one-on-one against Tauros or ever switch in on it, Alakazam and Jolteon deserve a mention as they can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Tauros, which is a fairly rare quality.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "The Bull": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Tauros's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam makes it an incredibly difficult threat to switch into, as a majority of Pokemon only need to receive minimal chip damage before being unable to tank a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, and some are KOed by this sequence even from full health. Body Slam's paralysis chance on some of the most common Tauros switch-ins such as Starmie and Exeggutor is yet another addition to Tauros's already threatening arsenal. Blizzard is Tauros's best attack to threaten Rhydon and Golem, the two OU-viable Rock-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on its Body Slam, and force them to face the threat of being 2HKOed (or being OHKOed on a critical hit). Earthquake is the preferred move in the last slot, as it gives Tauros a tool to hit Gengar, which otherwise walls it, as well as a way to play around Counter Chansey, although Tauros still risks taking a Thunder Wave in a direct one-on-one situation. Additionally, it can finish off a weakened Rhydon or Golem with greater accuracy than Blizzard. Earthquake also gives Tauros a safe move to hit both Chansey and Rock-types, which eliminates the need to predict a switch with Body Slam or Blizzard in certain situations.</p> <p>Tauros is such a potent tool to break the opposition down that it is generally preferred to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game while also trying to get it on the field as often as possible; this is a tricky balance to achieve that often sets apart new players from experienced ones. Great opportunities to switch it in can be found against Pokemon that are asleep, on a predicted switch, or on a recovery move that will leave the opponent's active Pokemon in KO range for Tauros. Quite frequently, Tauros will be able to clean up teams that have appropriately been crippled with status or weakened beforehand thanks to its extremely strong Hyper Beam; this is one of the most common win conditions in RBY, and as such, your game plan should generally account for the possibility of a late-game Tauros sweep. This means you should capitalize on opportunities to set up a Tauros sweep while trying to reduce your opponent's chances to do the same thing. The biggest obstacle in these plans is often the fact that both Tauros are kept as healthy as possible and always able to try a last-resort mirror, even when the rest of the team has fallen apart; this is one of the many reasons for keeping your own Tauros safe.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.</p> <p>However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Lapras</strong>: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Gyarados's Hydro Pump is no joke, letting it potentially 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Tauros, winning against them one-on-one. However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.</p> <p>Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Lapras is a potent special attacker backed up by solid bulk and a good variety of coverage and utility moves, such as access to Blizzard and Sing. While it faces strong competition from other Pokemon with similar coverage, such as Starmie, its combination of power and bulk, as well as access to Sing, gives Lapras a unique set of qualities that give it an important niche in the metagame. Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one. It also has positive matchups against Tauros and Snorlax, two of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame, which can be crucial in many instances.</p> <p>However, Lapras is bogged down by some flaws. Lapras's typing leaves it with a weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Psychic, which often makes it easy to wear down with Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam running around. It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Alakazam</strong>: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Blizzard is Lapras's most powerful attack, allowing it to deal heavy damage to anything that doesn't possess either huge special bulk or a resistance to Ice. Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.</p> <p>When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Jolteon's high Speed and Special stats and critical hit rate make its Thunderbolt a big threat. Because of this, Jolteon is able to outpace the whole metagame and is one of the few Pokemon that can revenge kill a weakened Tauros. It is also a good lead because of its ability to force a lead Starmie to switch out with Thunderbolt and paralyze other leads like Alakazam, Exeggutor, and Jynx with Thunder Wave. Jolteon also has an important defensive niche that allows it to be one of the few Pokemon to take on Zapdos comfortably due to resisting both of its STAB options as well as put pressure on Water-types like Slowbro and Cloyster with Thunderbolt. While Pokemon like Chansey, Exeggutor, and Alakazam can take Jolteon's Thunderbolt, it can cripple these Pokemon with Thunder Wave. However, outside of its STAB move, Jolteon does not have any other good attacking moves, as it only has two good options in Pin Missile and Double Kick, which fail to do major damage outside of a potential critical hit even on super effective targets like Exeggutor and Chansey due to Jolteon's low Attack stat. Furthermore, Jolteon is unable to deal with Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem, as it cannot do any good damage to them with any of its attacks and gets OHKOed by Earthquake.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jolteon can run Agility to get its Speed back if it gets paralyzed; however, it will have to give up Rest or Pin Missile in order to run it, which makes it lose the ability to hit Exeggutor more effectively or get HP back on passive Pokemon. Thunder is a more powerful move that allows Jolteon to OHKO Cloyster and Tauros on a critical hit; however, the miss chance and lower PP make it hard to justify using it over Thunderbolt or over Rest or Pin Missile. Body Slam can be run over Rest or Pin Missile to try to paralyze Rhydon and Golem as they switch in; however, it is redundant otherwise, as Thunder Wave is able to paralyze Pokemon like Alakazam and Exeggutor as is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem wall Jolteon, as they're immune to Thunderbolt and Double Kick fails to do any major damage to them, while they OHKO it back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Though it needs to be wary of potential critical Thunderbolts, Snorlax is relatively happy to switch into Thunder Wave, can tank a Thunderbolt, and threatens Jolteon immensely with any of Body Slam, Earthquake, or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor and Victreebel</strong>: Without Pin Missile, Jolteon cannot take care of Grass-types, as Thunderbolt fails to do a lot of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Without Rest, Jolteon cannot get rid of paralysis, which hinders it from sweeping late-game and makes it easy for any offensive Pokemon to take care of it by exposing its frailty. Jolteon wins a full one-on-one against Thunder Wave users such as Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos, but they can simply paralyze it and switch out; Alakazam can even attempt to beat Jolteon by itself.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunder Wave allows Jolteon to cripple its defensive checks such as Alakazam, Chansey, and Exeggutor that commonly come in on its Thunderbolt. It is also good to use against Tauros, as it is no longer a threat once it's paralyzed. Thunderbolt takes care of Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro and can do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it if Jolteon lands a critical hit. Double Kick scares out Chansey because it is 2HKOed on a critical hit. Double Kick also allows Jolteon to have a way to get damage on Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem as a last resort, though Jolteon should switch out if it predicts them to switch in to help keep damage off of itself and its teammates. Rest allows Jolteon to get HP back and cure itself of paralysis, which is useful against Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos; however, outside of these Pokemon, Jolteon will find it hard to use Rest, as the move is more useful late-game, and putting Jolteon to sleep allows Tauros to come in safety. Pin Missile gives Jolteon a way to deal with Grass-types such as Exeggutor, as it will deal major damage if it lands a critical hit on them. If Jolteon is being used as a lead, the best move to start the game is Thunder Wave in order to slow down opposing leads like Jynx, Exeggutor, and Alakazam; however, Jolteon must be careful, as this can lead to it being put to sleep with Lovely Kiss or Sleep Powder or paralyzed from Thunder Wave or Stun Spore. Because of its poor bulk, the best way to have Jolteon come in safely is against Pokemon like Chansey, on a predicted switch, or when a Pokemon faints. Jolteon should be saved to use late-game because of its Speed, as it can pick off most weakened Pokemon with Thunderbolt. Jolteon will need Pokemon like Exeggutor and Starmie on the team because it struggles against common Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem. Pokemon that can also help with Snorlax and Tauros like Cloyster and Exeggutor are needed.</p>"

  "Porygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon is a small fish in a big pond. Its stats are typical of an unevolved Pokemon, making it much slower and weaker than just about everything. Despite this issue, Porygon's access to Recover and immunity to paralysis from Body Slam give it just enough to be a surprisingly viable pick in OU. These two traits make Porygon an impeccable switch-in to one of the most important Pokemon in OU, Snorlax. Porygon has just enough Speed and physical bulk to switch in against Snorlax and stall out its 24 Body Slam PP with its 32 Recover PP. Most variants of Snorlax will struggle to make any progress against Porygon, meaning Porygon can consistently force it to switch out, as it is almost never worth using Snorlax's Self-Destruct against such a low-value Pokemon. Porygon should always be used with Chansey to create a defensive core; Chansey can handle special attackers like Alakazam and Starmie, while Porygon can handle Snorlax and paralyzed physical attackers.</p> <p>While its matchup against Snorlax is its main selling point, Porygon can wall some other Pokemon in a pinch. Pokemon that are unable to reliably status Porygon will usually struggle to defeat it in a head-to-head matchup. Especially if they are paralyzed, Porygon is relatively comfortable against Tauros and Gengar, for example. However, Porygon has some consistency issues in even its best matchups. Critical hits and strong attacks can expose its poor defensive stats, Ice Beam and Blizzard can freeze it, Special drops from Psychic can overwhelm it, and paralysis can render it unable to wall Snorlax securely. Perhaps worst of all, Porygon can be easily overpowered by Amnesia Snorlax, meaning it will have almost nothing to do against teams with that set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon has a very deep movepool to play with, both offensively and defensively. Psychic is likely the most valuable alternative coverage move. Psychic comes with a useful chance to drop the foe's Special, but Thunderbolt or a Normal-type move tends to be superior because of the many Psychic-type Pokemon that can come in and scare Porygon out. Psywave is mildly useful as a universal coverage option that can deal up to 150 damage. However, its low accuracy and heavy randomness make it less than reliable.</p> <p>Reflect can make Porygon even more consistent against Snorlax and Tauros. However, it can be difficult to find an opportunity to use it, as Porygon will generally want to heal or use Thunder Wave first in most cases. Flash is another move for bullying Snorlax and common switch-ins. While the move has poor accuracy itself, it can help Porygon keep up some momentum, as most Pokemon will want to switch out after sustaining the accuracy drop. Sharpen can slowly but surely boost Porygon’s Attack so it can deal hefty damage with Tri Attack or Hyper Beam. Setting up with Sharpen is often quite difficult because Porygon is easy to scare off with paralysis, but it can potentially succeed against a weakened or paralyzed team. Recover also makes Porygon unique among other boosting Pokemon, as it can heal and doesn’t necessarily need to commit to attacking once it starts setting up.</p> <p>Conversion is a mildly interesting option that Porygon can use to combat certain special attackers like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Jolteon. Realistically, however, Conversion will only be useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as most special attackers have a way to paralyze Porygon—negating its primary purpose in handling Snorlax—or can simply overwhelm it with strong attacks. Toxic allows Porygon to deal passive damage to Snorlax while it repeatedly uses Recover, thus forcing Snorlax to use Rest sooner, even if it is carrying Amnesia. However, a number of Pokemon that are likely to switch into Porygon, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie, generally don't mind Toxic, as it allows them to dodge more dangerous status effects like sleep, freeze, and paralysis. Finally, Mimic is a decent option on Porygon. The main purpose of Mimic is to pick up Amnesia from Amnesia Snorlax, which otherwise completely bulldozes Porygon. At a mere 25% chance, though, this is not a reliable option, unfortunately.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Paralysis completely ruins Porygon, so Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore can consistently force it to switch. This means many Pokemon are very capable of threatening it, including Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, Jolteon, Slowbro, and some variants of Exeggutor and Victreebel. Unless Porygon has an opportunity to KO these Pokemon, it must almost always switch out into a teammate that can absorb paralysis. Sleep and freeze also quickly deal with Porygon, and it is quite vulnerable to the former due to its low Speed. However, because Porygon has relatively low value, it is often good for Porygon to take sleep or freeze so nothing else on the team must. While rare, confusion also inhibits Porygon a lot, as Porygon isn’t bulky enough to risk hitting itself and giving up a free turn to the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Stat Alteration</strong>: Because Porygon has mediocre defensive stats, it becomes easy to exploit if the foe begins to boost their stats or lower Porygon’s stats. Amnesia users like Snorlax and Slowbro can boost largely unfettered against Porygon and begin doing a lot of damage. Slowbro in particular only needs to get to +4 before it has a chance to OHKO Porygon. Swords Dance users, while not particularly common, also can set up rather comfortably in front of Porygon and overwhelm it. Special drops from Psychic also threaten Porygon quite a lot. Exeggutor, for example, is guaranteed to 2HKO Porygon with Psychic if the first hit drops its Special. Other users like Alakazam and Starmie also have no issue breaking through Porygon after a Special drop.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Porygon often has trouble with faster foes even if they can’t paralyze it as critical hits imperil Porygon quickly. Tauros, even if it is paralyzed, can potentially break through Porygon if it gets multiple consecutive critical hits. If Snorlax gets a critical hit, it often places Porygon on the backfoot, as it will lose more health than it can recoup with Recover in a single turn. Moreover, a desperate Hyper Beam will cleanly OHKO Porygon if Snorlax manages to score a critical hit. Heavy hitters like Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Zapdos will also make short work of Porygon if they can get a critical hit or two.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Porygon’s poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trappers like Cloyster, Victreebel, and Dragonite. Partial trappers can accumulate significant damage on Porygon and pivot to a hard counter, all before Porygon has a chance to heal.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover is one of the most important moves in RBY and the primary reason Porygon has a niche. The move is mandatory for Porygon to wall and stall Snorlax. Given Recover's 32 PP, Porygon can easily absorb all 24 Snorlax Body Slam hits and then some. Unless Snorlax is carrying Amnesia, it lacks any solid option to break through Porygon. Outside of a freeze from Ice Beam or multiple consecutive critical hits, Snorlax can only feasibly beat a healthy Porygon with Self-Destruct. Considering this is generally a poor trade for the Snorlax user, they will often be forced to switch it out. This gives the Porygon user the opportunity to double switch or attack to maintain some momentum. Porygon can prevent Snorlax from getting offensive momentum while keeping Pokemon that often answer Snorlax, like Chansey, Starmie, and one's own Snorlax, safe and available to fill other roles. Porygon is a rather frail Pokemon, so it should use Recover very liberally. It should avoid switching out until it is at or near full health, as it would otherwise risk falling to a heavier hit from Snorlax, like Hyper Beam or any critical hit.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is also essentially required. Paralysis is critical for mitigating Snorlax: full paralysis generates free turns for Porygon, enabling it to attack instead of simply using Recover on most every turn. Paralysis also makes other physical attackers much more manageable. While Tauros is very unlikely to stay in against a healthy Porygon, if it must do so in a desperate endgame, Porygon can rather safely win the one-on-one by using Thunder Wave, using Recover, and waiting for full paralyses to attack and eventually KO Tauros. Similarly, Thunder Wave is a good way to pressure Pokemon like Gengar and Exeggutor. Additionally, because Porygon pretty consistently forces Snorlax to switch, Porygon can potentially paralyze the Pokemon that commonly switch in like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam. However, doing this may prevent Porygon from reaching full health before it switches out, as Porygon will have to switch out in fear of paralysis.</p> <p>While Porygon may have dismal offensive stats, it has a large and diverse offensive movepool. Ice Beam is the most common attack on Porygon primarily due to its ability to freeze foes. While Porygon generally defeats Snorlax via a war of attrition regardless, it is more than happy to cut the war short with a freeze. Ice Beam allows Porygon to participate in freeze wars and keep higher value Pokemon, like Chansey and one’s own Snorlax, safe from bad luck. Ice Beam is also a reasonable coverage move with a potential 2HKO on Rhydon and likely 4HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos. Being able to chip or even potentially freeze switch-ins like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam is also significant. Porygon’s final move extends its coverage. Thunderbolt is the most common choice, as it complements Ice Beam famously well. It notably enables Porygon to bully or finish off Water-type Pokemon like Starmie, Slowbro, Cloyster, and Lapras, especially if they are paralyzed. It also has a fair amount of PP to improve Porygon's ability to stall. Tri Attack is a fairly strong option that can pressure Pokemon with more special bulk, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Jynx. Finally, Hyper Beam is an option that can catch switch-ins and paralyzed foes by surprise. It can reliably pick off Chansey below 45% health and Alakazam below 60%. The choice for Porygon’s second offensive move often comes down to its teammates and player preference.</p> <p>Porygon has a very straightforward gameplan. Generally, it needs to do two things to stay successful. First, Porygon should try to stay as healthy as possible. Porygon should aim to switch out with as much health as possible so it can consistently answer Pokemon like Snorlax. It should generally only attack when it is close to or at full health. Two important benchmarks to keep in mind are 76.5% and 84.6% HP; Porygon must be at or above these points to survive a Hyper Beam and a critical hit Body Slam, respectively, and thus feel comfortable attacking instead of healing. It is imperative that Porygon ends every turn above both of these benchmarks, especially before it is switched out. In general, Porygon should prioritize Recover and Thunder Wave over attacking. Second, Porygon should avoid paralysis. Paralysis is often a death sentence for Porygon, as it will become slower than Snorlax and very easy to exploit on turns when it is fully paralyzed. Unless it can KO them immediately, Porygon should generally switch out when faced with paralysis inducers like Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, Slowbro, Jolteon, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor. The bigger-picture purpose of using Porygon often comes down to getting more out of one’s Snorlax and Chansey, as neither should need to deal with the opponent’s Snorlax when Porygon can do so. Snorlax is more free to forgo Reflect and explore more offensive options thanks to Porygon’s assistance. Additionally, if Porygon loses a freeze war against Snorlax, one’s own Snorlax can engage in a freeze war with no fear. Chansey works similarly, as it can focus on checking special attackers and be more difficult to exploit.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Omastar's typing is almost unique in OU, being shared only with Kabutops. It provides it with useful resistances to Normal and Ice, which allow it to punish Hyper Beam and Explosion, and let it check Snorlax and Tauros lacking Earthquake. This is backed up by its solid bulk and good Special, which enables it to do significant damage with Hydro Pump. Its movepool contains decent utility and coverage options such as Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, Submission, and Body Slam.</p> <p>Omastar is not recommended for most OU teams, though, as it is plagued by several crippling flaws that outweigh these qualities. It is walled by the omnipresent Chansey and the common Starmie. Slowbro also has little trouble walling it and can use it as an opportunity to set up with Amnesia. Omastar's typing is a double-edged sword that gives it weaknesses to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, which are both common in the metagame. Even if it avoids both, Omastar has to rely on Rest for recovery, which renders it useless for two turns, giving offensive threats such as Tauros and Zapdos opportunities to switch into it and wreak havoc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>STAB Hydro Pump 2HKOes Tauros, allowing Omastar to win against it one-on-one, as Tauros can only 3HKO it with Earthquake or 4HKO with Thunderbolt. Hydro Pump also 3HKOes most other Pokemon that are not named Chansey and do not resist Water. This includes Snorlax, so, even if it is carrying Earthquake, Omastar can still force it out if it switches in on a predicted Snorlax Rest. If Hydro Pump's low PP and 79.7% accuracy are a concern, Surf can be used instead at the cost of a noticeable reduction in power. Ice Beam 3HKOes Exeggutor and Zapdos, and it can also be used to fish for a freeze. Body Slam is used specifically to fish for paralysis on switch-ins like Starmie, though it cannot paralyze Chansey, which also likes to switch into Omastar. Seismic Toss is an alternative option to do consistent damage to Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster. Rest restores Omastar to full HP and removes any status it had beforehand. With it, Omastar can loop the rare Amnesia Snorlax that runs Ice Beam as its only move. Unfortunately, Snorlax more commonly runs Blizzard when using Amnesia and 3HKOes Omastar with it at +6.</p> <p>Omastar has some other options. Blizzard is usable because it 2HKOes Victreebel and requires less prior chip damage than Ice Beam to 2HKO Exeggutor and Zapdos. However, Victreebel is rare, and Blizzard has less PP and accuracy than Ice Beam. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, but it has little other use, causes recoil damage, and only has 79.7% accuracy. Substitute protects Omastar from Ice Beam freezes and paralysis from Body Slam and allows it to burn a Rest turn for free. Reflect and Withdraw boost Omastar's Defense so it can check Snorlax carrying Earthquake, but they do nothing to stop Chansey, Starmie, and Slowbro from walling it. Mimic is unreliable but can get Omastar solid moves from its switch-ins like Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, and Sing.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a very dangerous Pokemon and among the best Swords Dance users in OU. First of all, its base 115 Attack stat is very respectable, and it sports the best high critical hit rate move in the game—Slash. While this may seem counterproductive for Swords Dance, since in RBY critical hits ignore stat boosts, it means Kabutops can pose an immediate threat without having to raise its Attack. Slash also gives it wallbreaking potential, mostly because critical hits also ignore Reflect. Because Kabutops can switch in on recovery moves such as Rest and Recover and immediately pose a threat, it commonly forces the opponent to switch in a check that lacks recovery, like Exeggutor or Tauros, to force it out. This means Kabutops will do permanent damage. Its typing grants it a valuable resistance to Normal and Ice. This means it can freely set up against Pokemon such as Cloyster, sometimes against Chansey without Thunderbolt (depending on circumstance, the threat of Thunder Wave may pose a problem) and on any variant of Snorlax not packing Earthquake—or the very rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p>However, while Kabutops's typing is certainly one of its key assets, it also leaves it with very unfortunate weaknesses to Electric and Ground. This means it can't switch in as much as it would want against Rhydon despite its Surf and good Defense. Also, Kabutops is easy to force out with Thunderbolt users such as Jolteon, Zapdos, Gengar, Starmie, and Lapras—the first four outspeed it, and Lapras easily survives a +2 Hyper Beam. Kabutops can struggle to discourage them from switching in, giving them great momentum. Surf is weak enough against them to almost give a free switch. A Hyper Beam use can be punished by Gengar, while Swords Dance usually gives free entry to Thunderbolt users. Every move besides Slash is fairly easy to punish—and Gengar even ignores that, countering Kabutops outright. Slash is still a great move and helps deter these threats, but again its critical hits ignore Swords Dance boosts. Therefore, if these threats can pressure Kabutops into using Slash often, they reduce its threat ceiling in practice. Also, Hyper Beam's 10.4% miss chance or Kabutops's 15.6% critical hit rate can just ruin its sweep, a likely scenario if Kabutops is expected to KO several Pokemon consecutively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used to paralyze switch-ins, potentially paralyzing a Pokemon such as Starmie or Exeggutor and thus facilitating a sweeper like Rhydon, but it is difficult to drop one of the listed moves. Dropping Surf means losing to Rhydon and not being able to damage Gengar at all. Dropping Slash makes Kabutops's job of wallbreaking much harder, with it unable to reliably get past Reflect Snorlax and Chansey or hit switch-ins hard, and dropping Swords Dance or Hyper Beam severely hinders its sweeping capabilities. Blizzard may also seem a good choice, but missing out on the OHKO on Rhydon is very detrimental, and Slash hits Exeggutor and Zapdos harder.</p> <p>For a completely different approach, a more defensive set using Rest, Slash, Surf, and either Reflect or Body Slam could be used. It makes use of Kabutops's key resistances to Normal and Ice, with Slash allowing it to not forfeit momentum. However, Reflect is generally only useful against Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, the former having a very high critical hit rate anyway and the latter often forgoing Earthquake for overall more useful moves, giving Reflect fringe utility at best. However, Body Slam is fringe too: it moves Kabutops away from purer defense towards a sort of offensive support role, a less unique role that other Pokemon such as Snorlax and Rhydon fulfill better. They don't need to sacrifice as much of their offensive presence—remember that this Kabutops set drops Swords Dance and Hyper Beam—to be physical walls or lure in and paralyze certain threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is undoubtedly the best Kabutops counter, since it can easily come in on any of Kabutops's moves and threaten it directly with Thunderbolt. It easily takes Kabutops down, even while paralyzed, since Surf is a 5HKO. If Sleep Clause is not in effect and no statused Pokemon can safely switch in, Gengar can also safely go for Hypnosis to punish the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Kabutops and has a 61.5% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt. If Zapdos is paralyzed, it's a check at best though, because Slash and +2 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. Jolteon only has a 2.4% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt, but its critical hit rate is very high and should be kept in mind. However, if Jolteon is paralyzed or asleep from Rest, it can no longer switch in either, because both Slash + Hyper Beam and +2 Hyper Beam are almost always a KO.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is never OHKOed by Slash + Hyper Beam or +2 Hyper Beam, which means it can easily come in and threaten Kabutops with Thunder Wave, Thunderbolt, or to a lesser extent even Surf and Psychic. However, if it's paralyzed, it has to watch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor needs Mega Drain to counter Kabutops, since it is almost always KOed by Slash and +2 Hyper Beam. Otherwise, sets without it can come in once and threaten with a status move—or even heavy damage with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Razor Leaf OHKOes Kabutops, and Kabutops cannot realistically expect to KO Victreebel even if it switches in, since a +2 Hyper Beam only has a 1 in 39 chance to OHKO. Much like Gengar, it can somewhat safely go for Sleep Powder if circumstances allow for it.</p> <p><strong>Lapras</strong>: Lapras checks Kabutops in a similar way to Exeggutor, with the notable difference that it can generally switch in twice instead of once, and Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO. It can also use Sing similarly to Gengar.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set makes Kabutops a very menacing threat in OU, although the reasons why may not be immediately apparent. While Slash does not benefit from Swords Dance boosts, it comes off of a very high 115 base Attack stat, which allows it to immediately threaten a paralyzed Alakazam or Chansey (and Starmie to a lesser extent), as well as Rest Snorlax. If the former two have full paralysis on a recovering turn or Kabutops comes in on Rest from the latter, the opponent will be forced to switch them out, most likely to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Tauros that takes permanent damage. Slash is not a 3HKO on Snorlax, but Snorlax cannot just stall Kabutops with Rest because it is too easy to predict the Rest and use Swords Dance. Once Kabutops is at +2, two Slashes and a Hyper Beam KO Snorlax after Rest before it can attack, forcing Snorlax to switch or risk fainting. Even if Snorlax uses Reflect, it offers little protection because Kabutops has plenty of opportunities to boost to +4. Alternatively, Kabutops can fish for a critical hit with Surf while Snorlax is asleep—a viable strategy considering Kabutops's respectable critical hit rate.</p> <p>The benefits of Slash don't end here, though. Slash with +2 Hyper Beam is enough to KO Zapdos and Tauros 100% of the time, as well as Exeggutor 95.4% of the time. If Chansey is at 88.6% health, Slash + Hyper Beam becomes a guaranteed KO. At 84.4%, Slash becomes a guaranteed 2HKO too, so a little bit of chip damage comes a long way in breaking through Chansey.</p> <p>Kabutops also packs a big, big punch as a late-game sweeper. +4 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO on Exeggutor and anything more frail than it. With a bit of chip damage, +2 Hyper Beam KOes Starmie and Chansey. Kabutops is not very hard to find setup opportunities with, either: any sleeping Pokemon such as Rest Cloyster, Snorlax, or Jolteon (provided it comes in on the latter's Rest turn) will do. Sleep fodder your opponent is trying to sack, a Rhydon switching out fearing Surf, and an untimely full paralysis are other possible setup windows.</p> <p>Kabutops also distinguishes itself from other setup sweepers because paralysis does not end its usability in the game. While its late-game sweeping abilities are hindered, its respectable Speed means it's still very capable of beating several Pokemon such as Chansey, Snorlax, Cloyster, and paralyzed Alakazam, using Swords Dance to reapply the latter's paralysis Speed drop and outspeed it. Paralyzed Kabutops also still does significant damage with Slash to potential switch-ins.</p> <p>Kabutops's typing plays a key role in the Tauros matchup, and typing is perhaps the main asset it has over Sandslash and Kingler. Kabutops's Rock typing means that Tauros will generally resort to Earthquake to beat it, or the much rarer Thunderbolt. Not only does Earthquake have a mere 2.2% chance to 2HKO, it will also never OHKO a full health Kabutops with a critical hit. Sandslash is always 2HKOed by Tauros's Blizzard and OHKOed if it's a critical hit, while Kingler taking on Tauros is likely to find itself paralyzed by a neutral Body Slam, severely hindering its ability to continue the sweep. Earthquake also comes without a freeze or paralysis chance, which gives Kabutops much better odds at late-game sweeping. Unboosted Kabutops can even beat Tauros one-on-one in some situations, usually winning if Tauros is damaged by Slash beforehand or switches in on it. Kabutops also has the most reliable way of disposing of Rhydon and Golem with Surf, since Kingler's Crabhammer has unreliable accuracy, and Sandslash must be at +4 to always OHKO with Earthquake, but this comes the expense of being worse against Gengar.</p> <p>Lastly, Kabutops also has good synergy with Electric-types such as Zapdos. They can seriously threaten each other's counters, and most players will switch Rhydon in without second thought upon sight of Zapdos, allowing for a double switch to Kabutops and subsequent threat of a setup sweep.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a centerpiece of the RBY OU metagame. It is present on almost every team due to its incredible strength, bulk, and versatility, in spite of its terrible Speed. Thanks to Reflect, Snorlax can upgrade its physical bulk to truly remarkable levels and begin firing powerful Body Slams with little concern about incoming hits. Defensive answers to its Body Slam do exist, but Snorlax has access to a plethora of options to threaten them, such as Earthquake to get around Gengar and Counter users, or Ice Beam to freeze Pokemon which try to fight Snorlax's Reflect with their own. Furthermore, Snorlax can even opt to give up a traditional Reflect set and catch opponents off-guard by using less common moves such as Amnesia or Counter, which can allow it to bypass some common answers, and it even has access to the strongest Self-Destruct in the game, giving it the ability to eliminate almost any Pokemon if necessary, with only Gengar and Rhydon being able to comfortably absorb it.</p> <p>Despite all these positive qualities, Snorlax comes with two inherent flaws: the lowest Speed in the metagame, only tied with Slowbro, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. This means that once Snorlax is put to sleep it is possible for many special attackers in the tier to threaten it with their STAB moves: Psychic from the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and even Jynx can rapidly snowball out of control due to the high chance of Special drops, and other strong attacks such as STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos or STAB Blizzard from any of the Ice-types in the tier can also ensure Snorlax is punished for its Rest turns. Nevertheless, Snorlax is one of the biggest offensive threats and one of the hardest Pokemon to KO at the same time, and its set can be tailored to cover any desirable match ups effectively, which means it's usually hard to find reasons not to run Snorlax on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax can drop Body Slam entirely to run an Ice Beam / Reflect / Amnesia / Rest set that simply aims to soak up damage and spam Ice Beam until it manages to freeze a foe, but it generally needs to be on very specific types of teams to function, is completely helpless against Ice-types, and needs some luck to break through paralyzed Starmie and Chansey, as Ice Beam's limited PP means so Snorlax cannot fish for consecutive paralysis for long.</p> <p>Surf is the best option available to Snorlax to hit Rhydon and Golem, but given that most Snorlax sets run either Reflect or an Ice-type attack, if not both, the situations where Surf is useful are rare.</p> <p>Harden is sometimes preferred over Reflect for the higher PP count and ability to reapply the Speed drop on paralyzed foes, but it is considerably weaker at answering physical attackers, which is usually the primary duty of Reflect Snorlax.</p> <p>Another unusual set is Body Slam / Amnesia / Thunderbolt / Self-Destruct or Rest: given that Starmie and Cloyster are common switch-ins once Amnesia is revealed and that Thunderbolt is a very, very uncommon attack on Snorlax, this set can attempt to lure them in and cripple them with a strong super-effective attack. Self-Destruct is preferred in the final slot as an emergency option that allows Snorlax to bail out of unsuccessful lure attempts with an even trade, but it is possible to use Rest instead in an attempt to preserve Snorlax as a long-term defensive answer. On this set, it is also possible to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam to avoid being completely walled by Rhydon, though it makes Snorlax much weaker against Chansey and Alakazam, so it is usually not preferred.</p> <p>Body Slam / Reflect / Rest sets can afford a few more options in the fourth moveslot. Toxic can allow partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, Victreebel, and Dragonite to be significantly more dangerous, as any poisoned Pokemon attempting to stall out their PP will run out of HP much more quickly, and Snorlax is particularly good at luring in optimal Toxic targets such as Reflect Chansey. Another move that can fill that slot is Amnesia, making Snorlax incredibly difficult to threaten via special attacks alone but ultimately leaving it relatively powerless, with Body Slam as its only attack. Counter is also viable, as after Reflect has been revealed, opponents will most likely stop playing around Counter, giving you some opportunities to net surprise KOs with it.</p> <p>Other Normal-type attacks such as Mega Kick and Double-Edge are rarely seen due to their drawbacks and overall lack of usefulness when Body Slam is such a reliable move and Hyper Beam is a much stronger one, but the ability to repeatedly hit with a greater Base Power can occasionally come in handy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect users, particularly Chansey and opposing Snorlax, can switch in on Body Slam and neutralize the damage output from Snorlax fairly efficiently. They are by far the most reliable defensive answers to Snorlax, and a vast majority of RBY teams are forced to include one of the two, if not both, to check it.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar deserves a special mention due to its unique Ghost typing, which allows it to wall all Snorlax sets that lack Earthquake and use Snorlax as an opportunity to threaten either status with Hypnosis or damage with Thunderbolt. It is especially useful against Snorlax sets that only run Normal-type attacks, but it also performs well against any set that lacks Earthquake or Amnesia (unless Snorlax gets a lucky freeze with Ice Beam).</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Slowbro</strong>: Cloyster and Slowbro are the next best options to switch into Body Slam. Their high defensive stats allow them to come out of the one-on-one matchup on top, but their reliance on Rest to stay healthy and failure to pose a significant immediate threat mean they aren't always the most reliable answers to Snorlax. Slowbro is especially notable, as it can use a sleeping Snorlax as a golden opportunity to set up Amnesia; however, Cloyster has better physical bulk, allowing it to avoid a 4HKO from Body Slam, as well as the ability to use Explosion in case things start to go wrong after paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Other Special Attackers</strong>: Although there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam to the face, many of them are powerful enough to 3HKO Snorlax, which means they can exert a lot of pressure over it, especially when it's forced to use Rest and sit still for a few turns. Starmie, Lapras, Exeggutor, and Zapdos are some good examples of Pokemon that can force Snorlax out with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Although Porygon's base stats are pitiful, it has access to a very specific set of qualities that make it just good enough to handle Snorlax: it is faster, it is immune to Body Slam's paralysis due to its typing, and Recover's 32 PP allow it to outstall Body Slam's 24 PP. Snorlax's only hopes of breaking down Porygon usually rest on the possibility of landing either a critical hit with Body Slam or a freeze with Ice Beam; however, Porygon is very weak, and it is incredibly easy for the Snorlax player to simply switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types Carrying Rest</strong>: Another very specific countermeasure, Rock-types carrying Rest are generally able to outstall any Snorlax variant that isn't carrying the specific coverage for them. As long as the Rock-type has Rest to stall out repeated Body Slams, there are quite a few of them that can win the one-on-one matchup: non-Earthquake Snorlax will be unable to break through Omastar and Kabutops, non-Ice Beam Snorlax will struggle to wear down Aerodactyl, and even Rhydon can beat a Snorlax in the long run if Snorlax is only carrying Normal-type moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Reflect": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's Body Slam is one of the most difficult attacks to switch into in the tier due to its sheer power, its paralysis chance, and the relative lack of Normal-type switch-ins in the tier. Reflect allows Snorlax to take on physical attackers, most importantly opposing Snorlax, much more comfortably. Rest gives Snorlax the ability to remain healthy throughout the game. A lot of moves can fit in the last moveslot. The most common one is Ice Beam, as it allows Snorlax to potentially freeze opposing Reflect users, which can otherwise neutralize its Body Slam; however, this leaves Snorlax unable to threaten large amounts of damage in one turn, which means its matchup against many important Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Cloyster, and Lapras goes from bad to worse, and even its ability to power through a paralyzed Starmie or Chansey goes down significantly. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to function as a wallbreaker if needed, as well as a defensive piece thanks to Reflect and Rest if preferred, while Hyper Beam provides some of Self-Destruct's wallbreaking power without you having to sacrifice your Snorlax for it; however, a Snorlax that is only carrying Normal-type attacks will struggle against Rock-types and will be entirely unable to damage Ghost-types. Lastly, although Earthquake doesn't provide the freeze threat of Ice Beam or the immediate power of the other moves, it allows Snorlax to beat Gengar and Counter Chansey, two Pokemon that, albeit rare, are usually specifically devised to beat it.</p> <p>Using Reflect Snorlax is particularly nuanced due to having to balance Snorlax as both an offensive and defensive tool. If used too aggressively, it might take a KO but subsequently struggle to find turns to heal back up with Rest, making it a trade that is not always worth taking. On the other hand, if used too passively, it will invite too much offensive pressure and eventually collapse without achieving much of anything. Optimal usage of Reflect Snorlax requires careful analysis of the game state as well as appropriate prediction, but when properly managed, it is incredibly potent, as the special attackers that can threaten it lack either recovery or physical bulk, meaning that teams will generally resort to various stalling tactics to force Snorlax to use Rest first and then pressure it during its sleep turns. Reflect Snorlax is at its best early-game when the opponent has one or more paralyzed Pokemon to take advantage of, most commonly Alakazam and Chansey, and when its teammates can offer the necessary defensive cover against special attackers, but it is no slouch late-game either, as it can trade one-for-one with most Pokemon and has an important positive matchup against Tauros.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This moveset is fairly straightforward: maximize offensive prowess to wallbreak as well as possible. Body Slam is the go-to attack to inflict damage, and combined with Hyper Beam, it makes Snorlax particularly dangerous and hard to switch into, especially for paralyzed foes. Self-Destruct is an incredibly potent move to take down an extra Pokemon with Snorlax's last breath or even to take opposing Pokemon by surprise earlier on if the situation calls for it. The last moveslot is a toss-up: Earthquake allows Snorlax to play around Counter Chansey much more comfortably, as well as hitting Gengar and threatening Rhydon, but it can be dropped in favor of Counter, a tool that allows this Snorlax set to muscle through an opponent's Reflect Snorlax with correct prediction. Counter may also be used in conjunction with Earthquake and in place of Hyper Beam; the lack of Hyper Beam is quite noticeable, as it makes Snorlax much less threatening as a wallbreaker, but Earthquake offers unique coverage that could be worth keeping for specific matchups.</p> <p>The absence of recovery on this Snorlax set makes it far riskier to utilize, as it can only take a few hits before being forced to use Self-Destruct. Therefore, this Snorlax set needs to be considered as a tool to accelerate the game and little else, as its defensive capabilities are very limited. This often just means using an early-game Self-Destruct on the opponent's Reflect user to remove them from the situation before they get a chance to set up Reflect. It must be noted that this is a one-for-one trade, which is not always advantageous, but it is often the best that can be achieved with this set, as it is often endlessly walled by Reflect users otherwise; recognizing when to be greedy and when to accept a simple Self-Destruct trade is key to achieving good results with this Snorlax set.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is the main attack to create pressure on the opposition and hopefully bait in Reflect Snorlax, which this set can take advantage of thanks to the combination of Amnesia and Blizzard. The last move defines the type of game you want to play with this set: Self-Destruct means hard and fast wallbreaking, as Snorlax simply doesn't have the durability to set up Amnesia multiple times throughout the game, while Rest gives Snorlax those opportunities to set up but leaves it notably vulnerable to Tauros. Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the higher PP, which is especially relevant on Rest sets, but Blizzard's considerably greater damage output is generally preferred.</p> <p>This set is quite dangerous to play against due to how difficult it is to answer if your Chansey is paralyzed. Nearly every other common Pokemon is threatened by either Body Slam or a boosted Blizzard, with Water-types like Starmie and Lapras being the best answers defensively but struggling to deal significant damage in return thanks to the Special boost. However, a healthy Chansey usually has no issues switching in and walling this Snorlax variant until it's forced to use Rest, which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable against Tauros. The conditions for this set to excel are difficult to set up, but when they are achieved, this Snorlax set can decide games on its own.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting one of the highest Special stats in the game along with the most powerful special move in OU, Blizzard, there's no denying that Articuno is a powerhouse. OHKOing Golem and Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor are feats few Pokemon can muster, but Blizzard allows Articuno to do just that. It can force switches and deal heavy damage throughout the match, softening up your opponent's team and possibly causing a freeze. It can even make for a very nice end-game sweeper by boosting its mediocre base 85 Speed with Agility and blasting away with its STAB Blizzard, potentially getting a freeze in the process.</p> <p>Why isn't Articuno more common, then? Again, its Speed stat is frustratingly low, as it is not able to outspeed Pokemon like Tauros and Alakazam without a boost, while both are capable of paralyzing Articuno. It is walled to kingdom come by the many OU Pokemon that resist Blizzard, namely Lapras, Starmie, Cloyster, and to an extent, Slowbro, as well as Chansey with its massive 250/105 Special bulk. Its movepool is shallow as well, as it leaves Articuno relying on mediocre Ice / Normal coverage, the latter of which runs off its so-so Attack stat. Other Ice-types such as Lapras and Cloyster are generally preferred, due to access to helpful moves such as Thunderbolt and Explosion respectively. However, they can never dream of matching the raw power of Articuno's Blizzard. All-in-all, if you are looking to unleash a nasty surprise on your opponent, don't overlook Articuno.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Articuno's barren yet focused movepool, there are very few other options it can run. Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if Articuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will always 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body Slam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it find itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against Tauros, which needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is typically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as they don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a freeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras and Cloyster are some of the best Articuno counters, as they 4x resist Blizzard and can wear it down with any of their attacks. Starmie has to worry about the freeze chance, but can otherwise shrug off all of Articuno's attacks with Recover and threaten it back with any attack of its choosing. Cloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk, allowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be running, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp, Blizzard, or Explosion. Slowbro is also a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one because it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not recommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey is as good a special wall as ever, shrugging off attacks with Soft-Boiled and firing back with Thunderbolt or Seismic Toss. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little hope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low. Alakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam Psychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard, meaning it needs to be weary of switching in if paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Though they are far from solid defensive checks to Articuno, Zapdos and Jolteon naturally outspeed it and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, which makes them effective offensive options to take it down if no more defensive options are available.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>The best way to get Articuno on the field is to switch it in when you predict that your opponent will switch in Exeggutor; if it has lost over 33% of its health already, Blizzard is a guaranteed KO. It can also switch in on a predicted Earthquake from Snorlax or Tauros, dealing heavy damage with Blizzard and hopefully causing a freeze. Rhydon and Golem are a bit harder to switch in on, as Rock Slide will KO Articuno, but if you are fortunate enough to switch in on Earthquake, Blizzard will OHKO either. Double-Edge does chip damage to Lapras, who laughs at a 4x resisted Blizzard, as well as Starmie. Don't use Double-Edge against Chansey though, as it only does 5% more than Blizzard, causes recoil, and does not have a freeze chance. Don't use Agility until the late-game, when the remains of your opponent's team are within KO range. Finally, Hyper Beam is there to finish off weakened Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a viable alternative over Double-Edge for a 99.6% accurate STAB, but it is significantly weaker than Blizzard and further weakens Articuno against Lapras and Starmie. Rest is great for recovering from status, allowing Articuno to act as a status sponge throughout the battle until you need it again. Another interesting option Articuno has is Sky Attack, which is its most powerful physical attack, possessing a huge 210 Base Power after STAB. With a critical hit, it is guaranteed to OHKO Chansey and has a 52% chance to OHKO Starmie; without a critical hit, it has a 46% chance to OHKO Alakazam, who would normally be 3HKOed by Blizzard. However, it forces you to lose an entire turn and is difficult to find a slot for.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is without a doubt the best Electric-type in the metagame thanks to its high stats and two powerful moves in Thunderbolt and Drill Peck. It is an incredible late-game sweeper, being a mixed attacker on top of having access to Agility. However, Rhydon and Golem hinder Zapdos's effectiveness. While they do take slight chip damage from Drill Peck, they can't be hit by any of Zapdos's other moves and must be dealt with by the rest of the team. Due to this, Zapdos generally requires minor support to work effectively in all matchups, keeping it from being considered one of the best Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is an option for Zapdos to get some HP back, but you'll rarely ever get the chance to use it. Generally, Zapdos should be attacking or use Thunder Wave anyway; there's not a lot of room to put it on the set, as you lose out on either a pivotal attack, the ability to consistently paralyze opposing Pokemon, or the ability to pull off a late-game sweep. Thunder is usable to OHKO Starmie and to 2HKO Tauros and Slowbro, but it is not as used due to its poor accuracy. Toxic is a nice option in order to pressure the Rock-types, but this is generally not worth using over other moves. Final options for Zapdos are Reflect and Light Screen. Generally you would choose one over the other and replace Agility. Having Reflect or Light Screen up mid-game can be incredibly useful; however, due to Zapdos's lack of recovery without Rest, which is already noted to be unreliable, this option is generally not favored. The combination of Rest and Reflect can also be good at letting Zapdos check the Rock-type Pokemon that it usually loses to, but it risks taking a potential critical hit from Rock Slide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: The Ground-types of the metagame, Rhydon and Golem, are Zapdos's biggest threats to deal with. They soak up any attack Zapdos has to offer, which forces you to play around them before Zapdos can be effective. One can scout early-game for these Pokemon, but if you spend the whole game trying to play around them, you may find yourself in a pickle by late-game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Jolteon can also make good checks to Zapdos, although unlike the above Ground-types, they are susceptible to Thunder Wave. Jolteon would preferably use Rest to better check Zapdos, but ones without Rest work as well. Zapdos itself gets a special mention because it can come in on a Drill Peck to create an even matchup. Despite this, it is still worse than Jolteon as a check, as it is neutral to Thunderbolt damage which should be noted is unable to paralyze Electric-types making it a bit harder for Zapdos to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can act as a good check to Zapdos thanks to its high Special Defense and access to Reflect, but it is generally unfavorable as a check due to the tendency of Drill Peck landing a critical hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's STAB moves. Zapdos hits most targets for strong damage, comfortably 3HKOing Tauros and threatening 3HKOs on Snorlax and Alakazam. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt cannot paralyze other Electric-types. Drill Peck hits two of the main Pokemon that tank Thunderbolt, Exeggutor and Chansey. Exeggutor is sometimes 2HKOed by Drill Peck, and while Chansey can take two Drill Pecks comfortably, it tends to lose to repeated Drill Pecks, as it can't hit Zapdos very hard, and a single critical hit or full paralysis tends to end the fight in Zapdos's favor. However, Chansey does have access to Reflect to increase its chances of winning the matchup. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze Pokemon such as Tauros and Chansey to give openings for Zapdos to sweep late-game or get a chance to prevent recovery to get an extra turn of damage. Agility can be used on a free turn to allow Zapdos to outspeed faster threats like Alakazam and Tauros. It can also be used to remove the Speed drop from paralysis, which can allow Zapdos to sweep through Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>In general, you want to keep Zapdos as healthy as possible throughout the match in order to give it sweeping potential. However, this doesn't mean that you should keep it in the back the whole game, as it has a lot of potential to be useful in the early- and mid-game stages. For example, Zapdos can take advantage of sleeping Pokemon such as Snorlax as long as it comes in on the turn the Pokemon uses Rest. One should try to use Zapdos to spread status through Thunder Wave. This is especially helpful to do on a Pokemon like Chansey, which can be prevented from recovering through status, allowing Zapdos to potentially 3HKO with Drill Peck. Early-game, be sure to scout for the Ground-types of the tier, Rhydon and Golem. Do this with Pokemon like Exeggutor, Tauros, Cloyster, and Lapras, which can pressure them through super effective or status moves. Tauros is probably the best example there, as it has a great matchup versus Exeggutor, Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros, as well as being a great late-game cleaner on top of that. You could also lure them out with Zapdos itself, which can be done fairly early on, putting you at an information advantage. Whether or not you manage to find a Rock-type, though, you should keep Rock-type checks like Exeggutor and Lapras healthy so they better check them if they come out later in the match. Don't use Agility unless most Pokemon on the opposing team are weakened enough for Zapdos to sweep. To give a reference frame, you should probably wait until Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey have about a third of their health left. However, if they Rest, you can take advantage of them earlier.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as the strongest special attacker in RBY OU, tied with Articuno. It shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the other legendary bird: Moltres can also 2HKO Tauros and threaten Snorlax significantly while nailing Exeggutor and having Agility to clean up late-game. However, it too has a hard time breaking through very common special walls such as Starmie and Chansey, which holds it back tremendously. Should these walls be incapacitated or removed, Moltres can wreak havoc and make great use of its titanic Special stat.</p> <p>Due to these shared traits with Articuno, it is worth analyzing where they differ to understand which fits your team best. Moltres has access to Fire Spin in tandem with higher Attack, giving it a stronger Hyper Beam. These two qualities allow Moltres to muscle through checks like Starmie and Chansey more effectively than Articuno, especially when these Pokemon have been paralyzed and chipped beforehand. Moltres also possesses no hard walls: while Articuno really struggles against Lapras and Cloyster, there aren't any Pokemon that shut down Moltres quite so hard. However, Moltres's lower physical bulk and a weakness to Ice make it considerably easier to take down. Additionally, the type chart is unkind to Fire-type attacks in RBY, making Moltres considerably weaker in various matchups compared to Articuno, such as Zapdos and especially Rhydon. Furthermore, Fire Spin's accuracy makes it very unreliable; Fire Blast also suffers from this problem to a lesser degree. Overall, Moltres is a phenomenal late-game threat, despite being niche overall, as the ability to beat Tauros one-on-one is of crucial importance; while supporting it can be difficult, this Pokemon remains a sweeping threat that can tear down passive builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moltres possesses a few other viable moves, but they are all hard to justify in most cases. Double-Edge gives it a strong move to hit Chansey on the switch, and to a lesser extent Starmie, which might make its job of taking down these checks a little easier, though you will usually be content to source your extra damage from an additional Fire Spin. Sky Attack hits for over 50% on both Starmie and Chansey, threatening to OHKO on a critical hit, but it requires good prediction to get away with the charge turn. Toxic allows Moltres to functionally empower its own Fire Spin without needing to land a Fire Blast burn, which helps with working around Chansey as long as Moltres can chain enough Fire Spins without missing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie and Slowbro stop Moltres dead in its tracks thanks to their great special bulk and lack of concern for burns, which allows them to switch into Fire Blast frequently. Starmie is particularly brutal, being faster and threatening hefty damage with any of Blizzard, Thunderbolt, or Surf, or even paralysis from Thunder Wave. Slowbro can use Moltres as setup fodder after paralyzing it, usually forcing it to try and pivot out with Fire Spin as to not give it a free Amnesia boost, though it needs to be wary when burned, as Fire Spin chains can rapidly rack up sufficient residual damage for Moltres to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can put a hard stop to Moltres thanks to its gargantuan Special bulk; however, Moltres outspeeds it and can therefore stop it from recovering with Fire Spin. Therefore, it can muscle through Chansey with some luck, especially with a Fire Blast burn alongside Fire Spin, as Hyper Beam hits for over 40%. However, this can be quite risky for Moltres, as a miss lets Chansey cripple its late-game with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: While neither is particularly willing to take a Fire Blast, both Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed Moltres while 2HKOing it with STAB Thunderbolt. However, Moltres can beat a chipped or resting Jolteon, having a good shot at 2HKOing it with Fire Blast + Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While it looks enticing to switch Rhydon in on Fire Blast, its pathetic Special makes it take surprisingly high damage; there is even a chance of a 3HKO. Additionally, being burned is an utter death sentence for Rhydon, making it little more than fodder in the long run. However, Rhydon is otherwise one of the better Moltres checks, absorbing Hyper Beam well and PP stalling Fire Spin better than most OU staples, all while having an OHKO against it in Rock Slide; if it drops Rock Slide in favor of Rest, it gives up the OHKO, but it gains the ability to heal off the burns and can stall Moltres out of Fire Blasts, which is just as good.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the main draw to Moltres. It threatens significant damage to a majority of the tier, including notable 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Cloyster, and has a nice 30.1% burn chance that forces sturdier physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon to tread very carefully around Moltres. However, much like most special attackers in RBY OU, it must contend with the existence of Chansey and Starmie. These two Pokemon can comfortably heal off all damage taken by Fire Blast, and due to Fire Blast only having 8 PP, Moltres usually doesn't want to waste any on Pokemon that can just shrug it off; furthermore, landing a burn on these Pokemon can sometimes be counterproductive, as it removes the option of paralyzing them. Moltres packs a relatively powerful Hyper Beam to help it deal with special walls, thankfully; in tandem with a Fire Blast, it can hit both Chansey and Starmie for over 60% of their HP over two turns, meaning that, if such walls have been weakened, it stands a good chance of finishing the job. Agility is extremely helpful to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis and gain the upper hand on other fast late-game Pokemon such as Tauros and Zapdos; it is especially powerful in combination with Fire Spin, as a fast partial trapping move completely shuts down the opponent's ability to attack as long as it doesn't miss. Fire Spin excels when the opposition has been statused; it has great synergy with paralysis, which enables Moltres to move faster than any foe even without setting up Agility, and with burn, as repeatedly stopping the foe from moving racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Moltres's specialty is cleanup. If you are running Moltres, you ought to spend the early-game trying to cripple, chip, and potentially even remove the opposing Chansey and Starmie. Moltres is very unconventional in that it doesn't synergize particularly well with the two most powerful statuses in RBY, freeze and sleep. Fire Blast will thaw frozen opponents, and Fire Spin provides sleeping enemies with opportunities to wake while only taking minimal damage per turn. This means Moltres needs a very deliberate plan early-game and beyond to weaken checks and make your opponent play into your hand, especially against Starmie. Many teams are willing to let Starmie absorb sleep early-game, which is great for other Pokemon that struggle with it, like Articuno and Slowbro, but Moltres's resisted Fire Spin is the perfect opportunity for Starmie to burn sleep turns. You might want to try luring your opponent into letting you sleep a different Pokemon, even forgoing sleep altogether if you are feeling creative, or hoping sleeping Starmie falls victim to players' willingness to sacrifice sleeping Pokemon. Similarly, it won't be much use gambling your early-game trying to freeze a Chansey.</p>"

  "Dragonair": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonair has a small niche in the tier as it fits onto Wrap teams thanks to its unique typing and access to Thunder Wave and Wrap; it forces paralysis onto fast foes such as Starmie and Alakazam thanks to these traits—which allows it to chip down and force out slower paralysis absorbers such as Chansey—while shielding its stronger teammates such as Dragonite and Victreebel from paralysis. Dragonair's unique mono-Dragon typing gives it useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks. However, Dragonair's base stats are atrocious; it barely threatens anything offensively and is 2HKOed or 3HKOed by most neutral hits. Its weakness to Ice-type attacks also exacerbates Wrap teams' weaknesses to Ice-type attacks even further. Dragonair is also extremely hard to fit on teams; even dedicated Wrap teams usually only include Dragonite and Victreebel, as these teams are more reliable than teams with three or four Wrap users, which are the teams Dragonair fits on.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap": {
        "description": "<p>Dragonair's main purpose is to land Thunder Wave on fast Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie to enable Wrap from its stronger, more versatile teammates. Wrap allows Dragonair to force paralysis past slower common paralysis absorbers, such as Chansey. It also allows Dragonair to pivot out of uncomfortable situations to one of its teammates safely. Blizzard is Dragonair's most versatile coverage move; it hits Flying- and Grass-types such as Zapdos and Exeggutor for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Rhydon. Blizzard is also Dragonair's best option to finish off weakened foes. Thunderbolt is Dragonair's strongest move against Water-types, 3HKOing Cloyster and Starmie. Hyper Beam allows Dragonair to meaningfully threaten and finish off physically frailer foes such Chansey and Alakazam, doing 37.4% minimum to the former and 48.2% minimum to the latter. Agility can be used in favor of a secondary coverage move, as it allows Dragonair to spread chip and paralysis across the opposing team and not just become a useless sacrifice after it becomes paralyzed. Dragonair can also use Agility against foes that do not carry paralysis-afflicting moves, such as Rhydon.</p> <p>Dragonair wants to be used early-game to get paralysis off on faster threats as soon as possible, as the Wrap teams it fits on live and die by their ability to paralyze these foes. Dragonair can hit the field safely either by being pivoted in on Wrap from one of its teammates or by coming in after one of its teammates has been KOed. It can also switch in on a predicted Recover. After Dragonair becomes paralyzed, if it lacks Agility, the best use for it is to enable its other, more powerful Wrap teammates by being used as a sacrifice or a pivot.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is one of the most well-known Pokemon in RBY OU, thanks to its access to Wrap, which gives Dragonite a niche in OU as a mid-game wallbreaker and pivot as well as a late-game cleaner. As a sweeper, Dragonite wears down opposing Pokemon with Wrap then finishes them off with a strong attack, such as Hyper Beam or Blizzard. Its high attacking stats and wide movepool provide plenty of offensive power, more than making up for its lack of good STAB moves. Wrap also makes Dragonite an excellent pivot. If Dragonite uses Wrap on a Pokemon then switches out, the opposing Pokemon won't be able to attack on the turn Dragonite switches, allowing teammates such as Tauros to switch in for free. Dragonite's base 80 Speed, in combination with Wrap, allows it to shut down metagame staples such as Chansey, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. Although a good potion of the tier still outspeeds Dragonite, this can be remedied by Dragonite's two forms of speed control: Agility and Thunder Wave. Agility makes Dragonite faster than every unboosted Pokemon, allowing it to chain together Wraps until it runs out of PP or misses. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, can allow Dragonite to threaten faster Pokemon, such as Tauros, Alakazam, and Starmie, with paralysis, crippling them for the rest of the game. Dragonite is great at forcing paralysis onto foes that run away from other Thunder Wave users, since they might stay in and attack Dragonite in fear of Agility. Dragonite is not frail either; even with a 4x weakness to Ice, it survives Tauros's Blizzard, even having the chance to survive it after taking Body Slam. Dragonite also has a 61.5% chance to survive Starmie's Blizzard. Dragonite's typing also gives it a nice immunity to Ground, letting it switch into Rhydon and scaring it with Blizzard.</p> <p>Despite these positive traits, Dragonite is held back by a mediocre typing and inconsistency. Dragonite's typing makes it 4x weak to Ice-type moves, which are everywhere in OU. Dragonite is also deathly afraid of paralysis, since it prevents Dragonite from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon while also decreasing Wrap’s already mediocre accuracy. This forces Dragonite to run away from Body Slam, a move that it would otherwise be able to take thanks to its high bulk. These traits mean Dragonite has a lot of trouble getting on the field, let alone trying to find a free turn to set up. Likewise, Wrap only has 84.4% accuracy, and a miss leaves it open to a potential Thunder Wave or Blizzard. Although Dragonite is fast relative to the OU tier, Jynx and Starmie outspeed it and OHKO it with Blizzard, though the latter is not guaranteed. Offensively, although Dragonite is strong, the lack of a STAB move means Dragonite can't use its high attacking stats to its fullest potential. Due to these flaws, Dragonite requires heavy team support in order to take advantage of the offensive traits it offers. Additionally, since Wrap is a very weak move, it is the perfect move for sleeping Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie to burn sleep turns on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Dragonite has a wide variety of options, almost all of them are hard to fit on a set, as Wrap and a speed control move are undroppable, while Hyper Beam and Blizzard are both powerful options. Despite this, Surf can be used over Blizzard to guarantee a KO on Rhydon and Golem from full health. However, this will require patience before revealing Dragonite's moves. All other options apart from Surf are either sacrificing the power of Hyper Beam or the anti-Ground-type coverage of Blizzard, so they should be treated more carefully. Thunderbolt can be used in order to do increased damage on Cloyster, Slowbro, Lapras, and Starmie. Body Slam can be used over Hyper Beam to deal damage on opposing Pokemon while also threatening paralysis, as well as not requiring Dragonite to recharge if it fails to KO them, and Fire Blast can be used to burn opposing Pokemon, most notably Gengar, in order to put them on a timer with Wrap.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>PP Stalling:</strong> Once Dragonite sets up Agility, the primary way to deal with it is PP stalling. Wrap's 32 PP, can easily be stalled out by constant switching, and once Dragonite runs out of Wrap PP it becomes much less threatening. Wrap-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as well as physically bulky Pokemon such as Cloyster and Slowbro, should be accounted for because of this. Gengar is particularly pressing due to it taking minimal damage from any of Dragonite's coverage moves, forcing Dragonite out immediately. However, Gengar remains immobilized from Wrap, giving partners that can contest it, such as Tauros or Alakazam, a safe switch in. When PP stalling, it is very important for the opponent to count how many times Dragonite has used Wrap. If Dragonite uses its final Wrap, and the opponent switches out their Pokemon while it is still locked into Wrap, then Dragonite will be forced to use Wrap again, causing its PP to underflow to 63, making it near impossible to stall it out at that point. Once Dragonite uses its final Wrap, the opponent must make sure their Pokemon stays in until it is completed.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralysis is essentially a death sentence for Dragonite. If it's not running Agility, it no longer outspeeds Pokemon such as Cloyster, Lapras, and Chansey. Although Agility will allow Dragonite to ignore its Speed drop, Wrap's accuracy will be an effective 63.6% after accounting for full paralysis, making the strategy even more inconsistent than it already is. This means Thunder Wave users such as Alakazam and Starmie, Body Slam users such as Tauros and Snorlax, and Stun Spore Exeggutor are all able to force out Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon:</strong> Every viable Pokemon faster than Dragonite except Persian can either threaten it with status, such as Alakazam and Jolteon, or with Ice-type moves, such as Jynx and Articuno. Some Pokemon such as Tauros and Starmie threaten Dragonite with both. In addition, since Dragonite will attack second against these Pokemon, they will always be able to get off an attack before Dragonite can use Wrap, meaning Dragonite has to either paralyze these faster threats or use Agility to outspeed them.</p> <p><strong>Ice-Type Attacks:</strong> Since Dragonite is 4x weak to Ice, most Pokemon with Ice-type attacks force it out. However, Dragonite can use Wrap on slower Pokemon such as Cloyster and Lapras to safely switch to something that can deal with them. Additionally, Dragonite is capable of taking a non-STAB Ice-type move from Pokemon like Tauros and Chansey to set up Agility, so it is important for the opposing team to damage it beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types:</strong> Because of their strong physical bulk, Cloyster, Lapras, and Slowbro are capable of staying in against non-Thunderbolt Dragonite to fish for Blizzard or, in Slowbro's case, Thunder Wave during a Wrap sequence, usually forcing it out. However, what they force in, such as Starmie and Zapdos, can often put severe pressure on them thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Poison:</strong> Although both of these status effects are rare in OU, they severely cripple Dragonite. The passive damage from these status effects puts Dragonite's Wrap chain on a timer. A burn is especially detrimental, since it halves the damage from Wrap and Hyper Beam, and it can often be inflicted when Dragonite attempts to switch into Pokemon like Moltres.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Wrap is mandatory on Dragonite, as it lets Dragonite pivot against foes as well as tear down weakened and paralyzed teams. Hyper Beam is Dragonite's strongest move, dealing a minimum of 51.4% to Chansey and a minimum of 45.5% to Starmie. If the opposing Pokemon is out of Hyper Beam's KO range, Dragonite can chip its HP with Wrap in order to get it to the desired HP. Blizzard is used for dealing with Rhydon and the rare Golem, which resist Wrap and Hyper Beam, while also helping against Gengar, Zapdos, and Exeggutor. Since Wrap relies heavily on Dragonite outspeeding its foe, the fourth move is a form of speed control, either Thunder Wave or Agility.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is used to incapacitate foes with paralysis, making it easier for Dragonite and its teammates to break through the opposing team. What makes Dragonite unique compared to other Thunder Wave users is that the threat of Agility generally forces a foe to stay in and attack it, giving Dragonite an opportunity to crucially paralyze a foe that would run away from other Thunder Wave users, such as Tauros and Starmie. However, this exchange typically means Dragonite either trades paralysis with a foe or loses a significant chunk of its HP, although trading damage on Dragonite for paralysis on Tauros is almost always a favorable trade.</p> <p>Agility is Dragonite's less commonly used option. If Dragonite finds a chance to switch in on a Pokemon that has used Rest, it can find the free turn necessary to set up Agility and proceed to chain together Wraps. Although this sequence is hard to stop once started, it is not unstoppable. Wrap only has 32 PP, and constant switching will drain it quickly. In addition, physically bulky Pokemon such as Cloyster and Lapras can stay in on Dragonite and wait for Wrap to miss before OHKOing with Blizzard. Dragonite also has to make sure Gengar is accounted for before attempting a sweep, since Gengar is immune to Wrap, although it is still immobilized, so you can safely switch to something else that forces it out.</p> <p>Due to the abundance of Ice-type moves and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY, Dragonite struggles to find opportunities to get in safely. As mentioned before, this is typically done against a Pokemon that has used Rest or with an aggressive prediction. Alternatively, you can utilize other partial-trapping moves to get Dragonite in safely. This makes Pokemon such as Victreebel and Cloyster good teammates. Victreebel can also force out Reflect Snorlax, which could otherwise stay in and stall out Dragonite's Wrap PP. In addition to partial trapping support, Cloyster has a 4x resistance to Ice and an immunity to freezing, meaning it complements Dragonite defensively quite well. Starmie and Chansey can also switch into Ice-type moves from opposing Starmie, Chansey, Jynx, and Articuno, as well as providing Dragonite with paralysis support, which it greatly appreciates to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon. Alakazam, Zapdos, and Jolteon also provide paralysis support to Dragonite as well being good teamamtes for it to pivot to. Alakazam also has a great matchup against Gengar, one of Dragonite's hardest counters.</p>"
