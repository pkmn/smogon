  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Charizard is the fastest user of Belly Drum in the whole tier and also packs a respectable special punch. However, due to its poor defensive stats and typing, Charizard fills very few defensive niches and is rather dependent on support from its teammates. Compared to other Belly Drum users, it lacks the bulk and recovery options to work consistently and won't be able to overcome most bulky Water-types, but it outshines them with its Speed and the ability to beat walls like Skarmory and Steelix with its powerful Fire Blast. Generally, Charizard needs quite a lot to go right for it to succeed, but with the right support, this fan-favorite Fire-type starter can become a powerhouse that can end games much like its anime counterpart.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Miracle Berry is a great alternative to Leftovers. When paired with Light Screen or Reflect support, Miracle Berry can be used to take advantage of Pokemon that may try to cripple Charizard with status-inducing moves such as Gengar's Hypnosis and Snorlax's Body Slam. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for its higher accuracy, but misses out on the OHKO on Skarmory. Hyper Beam is an interesting option that can be used after Belly Drum to eliminate certain bulky Pokemon like Snorlax and Suicune with minimal prior damage. The recharge turn will make Charizard basically useless afterwards, but you can still take down something that Charizard wouldn't be able to otherwise, which can potentially lead to beneficial situations. Sunny Day is a possibility, since not only does it boost Charizard's Fire Blast for useful 2HKOs on Zapdos or Raikou, it also weakens incoming Water-type attacks and makes the common Thunder less accurate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie is probably the best counter, as it outspeeds Charizard and can take it down with Surf after it uses Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Raikou and Gengar</strong>: Raikou and Gengar outspeed Charizard and beat it with Thunder or Thunderbolt, but they have to be wary about the OHKO from a boosted Earthquake. A low damage roll from Gengar's Thunderbolt can fail to KO after Leftovers recovery, so it may be forced to use Explosion instead.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is not a reliable check because it Speed ties with Charizard, may be reliant on Thunder hitting, and gets OHKOed by a boosted Rock Slide. However, it still has a decent shot at stopping a sweep through winning the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Keeping bulky Pokemon like Suicune and Snorlax healthy throughout the game is a good way to stop an attempted sweep. Machamp can take a boosted Earthquake if it is kept healthy and retaliate with a Rock Slide for a KO. Vaporeon also survives a boosted Earthquake and easily KOes Charizard with Surf after it has used Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Status: Charizard cannot sweep if it has been paralyzed as it relies heavily on its Speed to be effective. Poisoning Charizard before it can set up is another good way to make it more difficult for it to set up a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Keeping Key Pokemon Healthy</strong>: Preventing the necessary support Charizard needs to set up is usually enough to render it useless, so make sure to not let status conditions get spread too far and try to preserve key Pokemon such as Starmie and the Electric-types if you suspect a Charizard may be waiting in the wings.</p> ",

        "name": "BellyZard (Belly Drum)",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Belly Drum is a high-risk, high-reward move that boosts Charizard's Attack to the maximum level. Earthquake and Rock Slide form an arsenal of physical attacks that hits everything in the tier for at least neutral damage. After a Belly Drum, Earthquake gets several notable OHKOs against the likes of Tyranitar, Raikou, Misdreavus, Nidoking, Gengar, and Rhydon. Everything else that doesn't resist it or is immune to it gets 2HKOed. Rock Slide is necessary for Zapdos and other less common Flying-types such as Dragonite, Moltres, and opposing Charizard. It can also come in handy in situations where you need the 30% flinch rate to overcome bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax and Suicune. Fire Blast uses Charizard's high Special Attack and Fire typing to get the OHKO on Skarmory, Steelix, Forretress, and Exeggutor after Spikes as well as a 2HKO on Cloyster and Heracross.</p> <p>For a successful Charizard sweep, you want everything that outspeeds it paralyzed or removed completely. That includes Raikou, Starmie, Gengar, Jolteon, and the rarely seen Alakazam. Charizard Speed ties with Zapdos, Miltank, and Tentacruel, so it is best to paralyze or eliminate them too. Pokemon such as Cloyster, Machamp, Marowak, Suicune, Snorlax, and Vaporeon should also be weakened beforehand, as they can survive a hit from +6 Attack Charizard. The other issue you have with Charizard is getting a free turn to use Belly Drum without being taken down in the process. Threatening with the immediate OHKO on Steelix, Skarmory, Forretress, or Exeggutor is a good way to force a switch and get off the Belly Drum. It can also be done with Reflect or Light Screen support or by channeling your luck against paralyzed or sleeping Pokemon. Charizard will usually not get any opportunities to switch out and attempt another sweep at a later point in the game, which means that often you will have to go for Speed ties and flinches—the fact that it is a realistic possibility for Charizard to succeed in these scenarios is a major reason it's considered so dangerous. It should also be noted that the probability of getting two flinches in a row from Rock Slide is greater than that of getting a critical hit with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cloyster pairs well with Charizard, as it can use Explosion to take out Suicune, Raikou, Zapdos, and most importantly Starmie. It also provides Spikes support, which can wear down the Pokemon listed above, other than Zapdos. Paralysis and sleep spreading is quite essential to prevent key Pokemon on the opposing team from blocking a sweep. Exeggutor can be quite useful, since it can inflict both of these status problems thanks to its access to Sleep Powder and Stun Spore; it can also use Explosion on Zapdos, Raikou, or Umbreon. Body Slam or Dragon Breath Steelix can also attempt to paralyze Zapdos and can use Explosion to eliminate bulky Water-types. Dragonite also does a good job of luring in the Electric-types and catching them with Thunder Wave on the switch. Gengar can be an effective teammate because it can land an Explosion against Raikou quite reliably. Snorlax can be used to spread status with Body Slam or Lovely Kiss or take out walls like Suicune with Self-Destruct or Belly Drum. Reflect or Light Screen users also pair up well with Charizard to support it when it's setting up.</p> "

Your best bet is to stick to defensive measures--Blastoise is not an attacker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blastoise's HP is mediocre. As a result, the OU metagame proves too powerful with Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon knocking off over 50% HP with STAB Thunderbolts.

    "overview": "<p>GSC Pikachu is a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon and is actually not too bad of a choice for a UU team.

With a Light Ball, Pikachu's Special Attack is the second highest in GSC, after only Mewtwo. The flip side, of course, is the fact that Pikachu is OHKOed by most decent STAB attacks, so only switch Pikachu in when you know it is not going to get hurt.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder can be a gamble, but if you're using Pikachu you're probably a risk-taker anyway, and it hits hard with Light Ball. Thunder Wave gives paralysis support, which is never a bad thing, and status is about the only thing Pikachu can hope to do against Blissey, Raikou, and Snorlax. Charm can hit Snorlax when it comes in to soften the blow it deals to whatever you decide to switch in. Hidden Power Grass can work if you're really paranoid about Quagsire.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pikachu's main counter is good prediction as far as switching into attacks go. Since Pikachu usually cannot take a single strong STAB hit, if something switches in that isn't in KO range after the initial hit, then Pikachu will have to switch out. However, Snorlax and Blissey in OU will wall Pikachu all the time. Exeggutor can absorb Thunder and Surf with no problem, but can get hit hard with Hidden Power. Ground-types can naturally switch into Thunderbolt, but be wary—if the Ground-type switches into a Surf, it can probably be KOed the next turn. If you're facing a UU team, your most reliable counter is Quagsire, who can take all three of Pikachu's attacks and KO it with Earthquake. Muk is also somewhat of a reliable counter with the high HP and Special Defense (and also a powerful STAB Sludge Bomb).

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Raichu's Speed, along with Rain Dance, lets it become a very good middle-to-late-game threat, where incurring 60-70% with a Surf looks a lot better than it did when everything was at full health. A Grass-type works excellently alongside Raichu to help buffer Earthquake, along with the fact that Fire-types won't be at full strength if you use Rain Dance. While once BL in tiers, it has sunk more towards UU as time progressed due to the strengthening of teams and Raichu not matching up well to the new standards: there was a time where Miltank was more popular than Blissey; that was Raichu's prime in GSC. Raichu is simply too fragile to be considered for today's OU play. At the same time, however, it isn't quite the run of the mill useless Pokemon. It isn't very difficult to use, and since it is valuable early in the game to paralyze, in the middle to inflict doses of damage as well as setting up Rain Dance, and late-game to sweep away entire teams of crippled and paralyzed Pokemon. It is a viable, although often neglected, Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Raichu's movepool is somewhat limited, the few alternatives it does possess can prove vastly useful. Raichu can make use of Endure and Reversal thanks to its good Attack stat, something other special attackers lack. With good Speed and the ability to spread paralysis, it could cause some problems late-game. If improving your Defense is more your thing than lowering their Attack, Reflect helps out Raichu and any other team members who may be soft defensively. Hidden Power Ice can be used for Grass-types if you choose not to go the Seismic Toss route, as it gives Raichu a special-based attack that is super effective on them rather than fixed damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything that is faster than Raichu can prove to be a mess to handle, due to its 298 Speed being its most valuable weapon. Ground-types, while suffering from Raichu's Surf, will be able to KO Raichu in one hit if it doesn't have Charm or Reflect--even then it will only buy Raichu an extra turn. Most of its weaknesses come from simple type-based match-ups that are difficult for it to overcome. The most important thing to remember about Raichu is don't be a hero; if it isn't faster and can't kill the opposing Pokemon, make sure the game is in hand before committing to an attack. If a strong Pokemon survives Raichu's attack, that will be the last of it for the battle.</p> ",

Rain Dance comes natural to it as it is one of two (along with Lanturn) who can take advantage of both the perfect accuracy of Thunder along with Surf, due to Thunder being boosted by STAB and thus all the more powerful. Surf will take out many of Raichu's natural enemies, including every Ground Pokemon that's not named Quagsire. Substitute is great when a Pokemon with Earthquake switches in because, along with Leftovers, it will only cost you around 13% of your total health to get a cheap hit in on whatever switched in.

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is the quintessential blue-collar Pokemon. It evolves from one of the earliest Pokemon you encounter in RBY, its stats aren't flashy--the best it gets is base 92 Attack--and its typing is a strange Poison / Ground mixture that you wouldn't expect to be great defensively. Regardless of these reasons for humility, Nidoking has all the right tools to get the job done as the premier mixed attacker of GSC. For starters, its movepool gives it a fairly strong STAB Earthquake coupled with solid super effective coverage moves for physical walls and Pokemon that resist it. Nidoking's immunities to Toxic and Thunder and its base 85 Speed, which is particularly fast by GSC standards, are also nice advantages that Nidoking totes over other attacking threats. However, that's not all Nidoking has to offer, for if that were the case, it would still be outclassed by Pokemon with flashier stat spreads such as Tyranitar and Dragonite. Access to Lovely Kiss is Nidoking's ace in the hole, allowing it to instantly take one of its chief counters out of the game, something the other mixed sweepers can't do.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast is an attacking option that allows Nidoking to cleanly 2HKO Steelix and Exeggutor while granting it an OHKO against Forretress and a 3HKO against Heracross. However, Fire Blast must go over either Ice Beam, which leaves Nidoking unable to touch Zapdos, or Thunder/Thunderbolt, which leaves Nidoking unable to do as much damage to Water-types, especially Suicune. Using Fire Blast over Thunder/Thunderbolt also makes Nidoking unable to significantly damage Charizard, which, while uncommon, can then threaten to set up Belly Drum and sweep. Counter is an interesting option for surprise KOs. Morning Sun can be used to allow Nidoking to last longer and heal off potential Hidden Powers from Zapdos and Raikou, but it cannot be used with Lovely Kiss. Counter even works against special Hidden Powers in GSC, so it allows Nidoking to bounce back Hidden Powers from Zapdos for major damage, in addition to attacks from Snorlax and Miltank. However, Counter requires careful use to ensure the opponent is definitely in KO range before it is revealed, and ultimately makes Nidoking less effective as a mixed attacker by taking away one of its attacking moveslots.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>RestTalk Suicune, Heracross, and Snorlax are probably the most complete Nidoking counters in existence. All three of these Pokemon can absorb Lovely Kiss and can tank whatever attacks Nidoking can use. Suicune must watch out for the 3HKO from the inaccurate Thunder, Heracross must watch out for the rare Fire Blast 3HKO, and Snorlax, being slower than Nidoking and taking more from Earthquake than the other two counters, must be wary of switching in, especially with Spikes down. Zapdos is also a fine switch-in to Nidoking, although Ice Beam is very common, averages a 3HKO against Zapdos, and, unlike Thunder against Suicune, is 100% accurate. However, unlike the other counters, Zapdos is guaranteed to outspeed Nidoking, is immune to Earthquake and Spikes, and can 3HKO Nidoking with a super effective Hidden Power.</p> <p>When Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss, many more options for countering it open up. Suicune and Snorlax without RestTalk can switch in to sponge hits and scare it out. Miltank is a fantastic switch-in when Sleep Clause is active, as Nidoking is slower and cannot penetrate its defenses with its attacks. Miltank can also force Nidoking to switch out with the threat of Body Slam paralysis. However, if Sleep Clause is not active, Miltank balks at the prospect of being put to sleep, since it is then unable to cure its teammates of status with Heal Bell. Starmie is also a solid check that outspeeds Nidoking, gets Recover to shrug off its attacks, and 2HKOes it in return. Starmie is also often common sleep bait to offer against Nidoking on teams without a Sleep Talk user. However, Starmie is 2HKOed by Thunder. Umbreon is slower than Nidoking, which makes switching into Earthquakes difficult at times, but otherwise it is a stellar wall that avoids even being 4HKOed by any of Nidoking's attacks. Umbreon, however, does struggle to threaten Nidoking in return; it can pass Mean Look to another counter that can threaten to KO Nidoking, or it can use Charm to weaken Nidoking's Earthquake to allow an easier switch to another counter.</p> <p>Aside from the checks listed above, Sleep Talk Vaporeon also makes a somewhat decent answer to Nidoking. It is slower than Nidoking, is 4HKOed by Earthquake unlike Umbreon and Snorlax, and is even 3HKOed by Thunder, so it is, admittedly, a very shaky check. However, it can absorb Lovely Kiss with a Sleep Talk set and can threaten to 2HKO Nidoking in return. Other slower Pokemon that can nonetheless threaten Nidoking include Quagsire and Porygon2. Unlike Vaporeon, these Pokemon cannot absorb Lovely Kiss, but on the other hand, they are not 3HKOed by any of Nidoking's moves, either. Quagsire gets to guarantee a 2HKO in return with Earthquake, whereas Porygon2 gets access to Recover instead of relying on Rest to stay healthy.</p> <p>Other slower Pokemon that struggle to switch into or threaten Nidoking are Forretress and even Blissey. Forretress generally does not have a good way to threaten Nidoking and fears the possible Fire Blast, but otherwise tanks Nidoking with ease and can even attempt to stall it out if it runs the uncommon Rest. Obviously, it wants to switch in only after Nidoking has used Lovely Kiss so that it is not rendered unable to lay Spikes. Blissey, on the other hand, is generally a cleric and so obviously wants to avoid taking a Lovely Kiss, but otherwise avoids being 2HKOed by Earthquake, which permits the use of Soft-Boiled to attempt to stall Nidoking. In addition, Ice Beam can threaten to 3HKO Nidoking while Growl and even the odd Reflect (which cannot be used along with Heal Bell) can make tanking Earthquakes a lot easier.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set allows Nidoking to threaten as wide an array of opponents as possible. STAB Earthquake running off a decent Attack stat is Nidoking's main attacking move, and it does solid damage to most threats. However, it does run short of hitting relevant KO thresholds against certain walls, such as Snorlax, Miltank, and Umbreon; Earthquake will shave off roughly 25-30% of these threats' HP, which is well short of a 3HKO and just short of even a 4HKO after Leftovers. That's where Lovely Kiss comes in. With a well-timed Lovely Kiss, one of these walls can be indefinitely incapacitated, allowing Nidoking to go for the KO itself by spamming Earthquake or permitting a teammate to switch in and start setting up. As for the other two moves, these are for hitting foes that resist or are immune to Earthquake for super effective damage. Ice Beam is a must to 3HKO Zapdos, as otherwise Nidoking cannot touch it even with Lovely Kiss since most Zapdos run Sleep Talk. Ice Beam also allows Nidoking to 3HKO Exeggutor and, when all else fails, to play for the freeze against Miltank. The last moveslot is a bit more flexible, although Thunder is the preferred option because it guarantees a 2HKO against Starmie and Skarmory, can 3HKO Suicune and Vaporeon, and has a 21% paralysis chance, factoring accuracy, to facilitate these KOs. However, Thunderbolt is an option if you don't want to chance a miss against a Cloyster, Skarmory, or weakened Suicune in KO range. That said, Nidoking will miss out on the KO thresholds that Thunder achieves, and furthermore it will do more damage to Vaporeon with Earthquake than it would with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Nidoking is a bit easier to get to work than other heavy hitters in GSC because of its good Speed stat, access to Lovely Kiss, immunity to Electric moves and Toxic, and defenses that, while not great, are passable. However, just as with any mixed attacker, Nidoking will require a bit of prediction to be able to use appropriately. It should be switching in whenever you anticipate an opponent switching to a Pokemon that does not want to be put to sleep or that cannot afford to take a super effective attack. Being able to double-switch effectively or, alternatively, to predict Thunders from Electric-types to prevent Nidoking from taking damage or status on the switch will go a long way toward keeping Nidoking healthy enough to still pose a threat. To facilitate these double-switches, Nidoking appreciates Rapid Spin support from Starmie, Cloyster, or Forretress to keep Spikes off the field. Spikes support from Cloyster and Forretress can also be helpful to Nidoking, especially since it struggles to KO the likes of Snorlax and Umbreon without such help. However, since Nidoking already has Lovely Kiss to deal with the Pokemon it struggles to outright kill, and because one of the more common switch-ins to Nidoking is Zapdos, Spikes don't help Nidoking as much as you might expect.</p> <p>While Nidoking is, for the most part, self-sufficient offense, there are Pokemon that pair well with Nidoking by KOing or weakening its counters. Self-Destruct Snorlax can bait and explode on these threats, in addition to Suicune and Miltank, to make Nidoking's life easier. Exeggutor is a fine partner as well, since it can bait Zapdos and Explode on it to allow Nidoking to aim for a better sleep target with Lovely Kiss. Tyranitar with Rock Slide and Pursuit can help Nidoking chip away at Zapdos to put it in Ice Beam KO range to prevent it from switching in to absorb Lovely Kiss. Tyranitar also helps to weaken Exeggutor so that Nidoking does not have to be concerned with its inability to 2HKO it. Steelix can bait and Explode on Miltank, Suicune, and even Zapdos to make life easier for Nidoking as well.</p> <p>Other good partners for Nidoking are those that can capitalize off Nidoking's ability to weaken their counters or put them to sleep. CurseLax generally works well with Nidoking's ability to target Charm Umbreon and opposing CurseLax with Lovely Kiss. Marowak and Quagsire appreciate Nidoking's ability to target opposing Water-types with Lovely Kiss. Cloyster and Machamp can take advantage of Nidoking's ability to target Starmie with Lovely Kiss or Thunder paralysis. Vaporeon can capitalize off Nidoking's ability to weaken Zapdos, Snorlax, and Roar Suicune.</p> "

It is only limited by the amount of maintenance required to set it up, which usually is done by paralyzing most of the opposing team and killing any Ghost-types that may be in the area. It is more durable than one might expect due to its nice and plump HP and decent Special Defense. Clefable can take over the game early on, but this will not likely lead to a clean sweep.

Sunny Day allows Moonlight to heal more, allows Solar Beam to take just one turn, and boosts Flamethrower's power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types generally can clear Clefable out. Suicune can survive a Belly Drum-boosted Return and phaze it out with Roar, but gets heavily crippled by this. Ghosts such as Misdreavus will take care of it unless Clefable has Shadow Ball. Skarmory and Steelix will counter it if it has Shadow Ball, but if it has Fire Blast watch out. Golem and Rhydon can Roar it out after easily taking a Double-Edge. Clefable has to watch out for Encore Pokemon even more than Curse users do, or it will be out 50% of its health for nothing.

His stats are actually even all around, but therein lies the problem; he isn't quite good enough at anything in particular to be of much use. In a UU arena dominated by Pokemon like Lapras and Clefable, he could be potent with STAB on Fighting moves, but he has nary a chance to make an impact on the OU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Poliwrath certainly learns a lot of moves, not many of them are going to be much use on him. Counter is quite possibly the only one that stands out... with his Defense and HP, he can survive a really hard hit and Counter it back for a KO.

The first two of these are extremely common, and Slowbro is one of those crazy \"BL\" types, so many teams can counter Poliwrath with ease without even considering him. Other common counters would be Raikou, Zapdos, Umbreon, Suicune and even Snorlax if Poliwrath doesn't have a Fighting move. If you're in UU, there are plenty of counters to be found as well. Gyarados can wall Poliwrath's typing, Lanturn can take him on, and Muk can absorb Poliwrath's attacks with little trouble (unless Poliwrath has Earthquake). Grass-types like Meganium and Venusaur will also take on Poliwrath with ease. There are just a lot of counters to the poor tadpole.</p> ",
    "sets": [{"name": "Belly Drum", "description": "<p>Thanks to the NYPC, Poliwrath gets Lovely Kiss, which is a great surprise to utilize since most people don't know what moves Poliwrath even learns.

Hydro Pump will really hurt those Rock-types and can soften up physical walls like Skarmory. Lovely Kiss is Poliwrath's wild card, so whenever they bring out a Pokemon they think can beat it, use Lovely Kiss and put it to sleep before it can take Poliwrath out. While this is a good idea in theory, Poliwrath is hindered by horrible typing and a bad physical movepool and can't hit anything directly hard off the bat. You can try out other attacks like Earthquake or Hidden Power Fighting (for STAB) to hit various other Pokemon.</p> "}]

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>With the highest Special Attack in GSC OU, ultra high Speed, and STAB Psychic, Alakazam is well positioned to take advantage of the popular offensive Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Nidoking, and Machamp and severely threaten a broad swath of the metagame. Compared to Espeon, which has Growth and Baton Pass, Alakazam has Dynamic Punch, which allows it to use a mixed set, and Encore to stop setup Pokemon. Its Speed advantage over almost all other Pokemon makes it one of the best late-game cleaners and ensures that other fast Pokemon like Raikou and Gengar can't threaten it with Thunder or Explosion without taking a heavy hit first.</p> <p>However, Alakazam faces one very large problem. Snorlax, as well as other specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, can make it very difficult for Alakazam to deal lasting damage to the opposing team if they are not first weakened or removed by its teammates. Alakazam does have Dynamic Punch in its arsenal to give it a fighting chance at breaching these Pokemon, but it is unreliable due to its poor accuracy. In addition, status effects, especially paralysis from Pokemon such as Exeggutor, will compromise its potential. Furthermore, compared to Jynx, a much more common offensive Psychic-type, Alakazam has better defensive properties and unique coverage options, but it lacks Lovely Kiss and the ability that Jynx has to 2HKO Zapdos with STAB Ice Beam.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave has good synergy with Recover, potentially allowing Alakazam to return to full health by waiting for the foe to miss a turn. Inflicting paralysis is also an excellent way of supporting its teammates, especially if it can land paralysis on speedy foes such as Starmie, Raikou, and Zapdos. However, it is incompatible with Encore. Hidden Power Dark can be used for Psychic-types like Exeggutor, Starmie, and Jynx, while Hidden Power Water can be used for Tyranitar, Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon. Light Screen helps Alakazam against special attackers and supports its team, but can be tricky to fit in Alakazam's moveset. Counter can be used to land a surprise OHKO against Double-Edge Snorlax. While Encore can't be used alongside Counter, the threat of Encore can be enough to deter Curse and Belly Drum from Snorlax and encourage it to attack Alakazam immediately. However, if Snorlax sets up in anticipation of Alakazam switching out, dealing with a boosted Snorlax could prove to be very challenging. Thief can steal an item from an opposing Pokemon, which will often deprive Alakazam's checks such as Snorlax, Blissey, and Starmie of the recovery from Leftovers; however, this is typically done better by Jynx and Gengar, as they don't need the moveslot as much. Miracle Berry can help Alakazam shrug off status effects from Pokemon such as Exeggutor, but it can only work once.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Snorlax and Blissey have great bulk to take Alakazam's special attacks and inflict status ailments with Body Slam, Toxic, or Thunder Wave. The former frightens Alakazam with its STAB moves, while the latter can run Present or Light Screen. However, Dynamic Punch can hit them super effectively and cause confusion.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Crunch from Tyranitar and Houndoom is useful to 2HKO Alakazam, but they should be wary of Dynamic Punch on the switch-in. In particular, Tyranitar without Rest will be severely crippled by Toxic. Umbreon can wall many Alakazam sets even if it struggles to trap it and can threaten it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Starmie can use Thunder Wave or Thunder to cripple Alakazam, but it will struggle to KO Recover Alakazam without them and could be crippled by Toxic or take heavy damage from Thunder Punch or Zap Cannon. Exeggutor can run Stun Spore or Sleep Powder to cripple Alakazam and Explosion for a trade KO, but Alakazam can potentially have Fire Punch or Ice Punch to hit it super effectively and Substitute to block status moves, Explosion, and Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix can force a trade with Explosion to remove Alakazam, Skarmory can cripple it with Toxic, and Forretress can threaten it with Explosion or Toxic, but all of them, especially Forretress, are heavily threatened by Fire Punch variants. Substitute Alakazam can cause major problems to Forretress and Steelix; the former struggles to break Alakazam's Substitute without Hidden Power Bug or Hidden Power Ghost and is OHKOed by Fire Punch, whereas the latter must guess whether Alakazam will use Fire Punch or Substitute and use Earthquake, Roar, or Explosion accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou and Zapdos can paralyze Alakazam with Thunder or Thunder Wave in Zapdos's case, but neither can break its Substitute with neutral Hidden Power, so if they are using the inaccurate Thunder, they may be forced to hit several in a row to beat Alakazam. Alakazam can also 3HKO Zapdos with Ice Punch reliably and has a chance of 3HKOing it with Psychic, whereas Raikou survives three hits from Psychic but must be wary of Spikes damage racking up. Alakazam can also force them to switch out by using Encore to lock them into Rest.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Vaporeon can wall most Alakazam sets with Rest. Suicune can threaten to poison it, while Vaporeon can potentially PP stall Encore if Alakazam is being relied upon to check Vaporeon due to its high PP count.</p> ",

Recover gives Alakazam a survivability tool to function as a switch-in to said Pokemon, but Substitute can be used instead to block status effects and scout for Explosion from Pokemon like Forretress. Since Hidden Power from Zapdos and Exeggutor breaks Alakazam's Substitute less than 10% of the time, Alakazam can use its Speed to set up a Substitute, avoid status ailments from Stun Spore and Thunder, and exploit Thunder's low accuracy. Dynamic Punch hits not only Snorlax and Blissey, but also Tyranitar for super effective damage, and its guaranteed confusion can potentially open up an opportunity to break past them.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Fire Punch is nice for Forretress and threats such as Exeggutor, Jynx, Steelix, and Skarmory.

Ice Punch hits Exeggutor, secures the 3HKO against Zapdos, and has a chance to inflict freeze.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is used more on offensive teams with Explosion users. With access to Explosion, Dynamic Punch, and Destiny Bond, Gengar can be used to wear down Snorlax, Blissey, and Dark-types, which Alakazam appreciates.

Its coverage moves such as Earthquake can also be used to weaken Alakazam's other checks like Tyranitar. Spikes from Pokemon such as Cloyster are helpful to chip down the opposing team and eventually bring them into Alakazam's 2HKO range. Cloyster can also potentially use Clamp to trap Snorlax, nullify any of its Defense boosts with Screech, and use Explosion to remove it. Rhydon is a great choice for a complementing offensive Pokemon thanks to its ability to pivot into Electric-type attacks and take on unboosted Snorlax, although it needs to be wary of Curse + Earthquake Snorlax if it lacks Counter. Finally, although Alakazam has Zap Cannon, paralysis support from teammates such as Zapdos is still recommended to achieve parafusion when combined with Dynamic Punch.</p> "

If Alakazam is brought in by a phazing move, it can also lock that Pokemon into said move, buying a free turn for the next Pokemon to be brought in. It also pairs well with Recover, as it allows Alakazam to stall out weak attacks such as Pursuit. However, although Encore may give you momentum to attack or switch out, an opponent can predict it and switch out. Moreover, it always fails against a Pokemon that last used Sleep Talk. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to wear down Alakazam's checks so that they will use Rest or be knocked out, which pairs well with Recover against Pokemon such as Starmie without Thunder Wave in the long run. In addition, it puts Tyranitar without Crunch or Rest on a timer as long as it doesn't land a critical hit on Alakazam. Despite being the selling point of the set, Encore can also be dropped for the combination of both Fire Punch and Toxic, which shines once Snorlax is removed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is used more on bulky teams that do not require consistent pressure on the opponent. Offensively, Snorlax's coverage and status moves such as Earthquake and Toxic can be used to weaken Alakazam's checks such as Tyranitar.

Skarmory and Umbreon help Alakazam against Snorlax and Exeggutor, while Alakazam can switch into dangerous foes such as Gengar and Machamp.</p> <p>If Alakazam is using Toxic and Spikes are set by Cloyster or Forretress, Roar Raikou can pose a serious offensive threat by racking up residual damage, especially since all of its checks are affected by Spikes and many of Alakazam's checks are also used to check Raikou.

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The main reason to use Golem instead of similar Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix is its access to Rapid Spin, which it can use to give your team the all-important advantage of removing Spikes. Golem's resistance to Snorlax's Normal-type attacks allows it to find opportunities to switch in, and its ability to OHKO Gengar with STAB Earthquake makes it very difficult for the opponent to block Rapid Spin, as even Misdreavus, which takes neutral damage from it, is still 2HKOed after Spikes. Sadly, a healthy Cloyster has little to fear from Golem and can just switch in, forcing it out by threatening it with Surf or Ice Beam; Cloyster can then use Spikes again and Golem will need to find another opportunity to remove them later on. Forretress needs to worry about a possible Fire Blast but can otherwise threaten Golem with either Giga Drain or Toxic. Due to this, it can be helpful to hide Golem until Cloyster and Forretress are afflicted with status or weakened to make it more difficult for the opponent to get their Spikes back onto the field once Golem has spun them away.</p> <p>Explosion is generally a very strong move in GSC and that is no exception for Golem. The threat of spinning Spikes away with no consequences can lead to your opponent deciding to pressure Golem more aggressively. Potentially, if you deem Golem no longer needed for defensive purposes, this can allow you to surprise your opponent with a less expected Explosion and take out huge threats like Zapdos using Hidden Power Ice or Snorlax wanting to use Earthquake. Doing this prematurely, however, can leave you vulnerable to other threats that Golem previously could have checked.</p> <p>Roar is the most common fourth move, allowing Golem to fulfill the key defensive role of checking Snorlax, although it must watch out for Earthquake and Mean Look trappers. Roar also provides Golem with the ability to pressure the opposing team by racking up Spikes damage, especially against more defensive teams, which tend to have fewer Pokemon that threaten Golem. If you don't need another phazing move for your team, Fire Blast is a good alternative to prevent Forretress from switching in or even KOing it should the opponent play carelessly, as well as offering coverage for Skarmory and Exeggutor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Unlike Starmie or Tentacruel, Golem is terrible at checking most Spikes users, so Pokemon that can lure them like Snorlax with Thunder for Cloyster or Fire Blast or Flamethrower for Forretress are good partners. Your own Cloyster can help to weaken the opposing Cloyster or Forretress with Toxic and Surf, respectively, so that it is more difficult for them to use Spikes a second time later in the game. In most cases the opponent's Spikes setter must be removed or severely weakened because otherwise, the opponent is likely to set them up again. Rapid Spin Golem does not handle Hidden Power Ice Electric-types particularly well, having neither the Steel typing of Steelix nor the powerful Rock Slide that Rhydon has to threaten Zapdos. Due to that, on defensive teams, Golem is often used in combination with Raikou, which can safely switch into any Electric-type, and Skarmory, which covers the Ground-type weakness that the other two have. As a Ground-type with access to Thunder and Lovely Kiss, Nidoking is not handled well by that core, so an additional Pokemon like Sleep Talk Snorlax, Suicune, Vaporeon, or Heracross is recommended. Golem is less commonly used on very offensive teams, but if it is they usually try to ensure that many team members have a decent matchup versus Electric-types or can take them out with Explosion.</p> "

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Articuno may not have nearly as much influence over the metagame as its Electric-type sibling Zapdos, like many other UUBL Pokemon it still finds a small niche in OU. While it may not have the best defensive typing or movepool, Articuno still avoids taking damage from Spikes, has decent defensive stats, and is able to reliably absorb sleep from all of the metagame's sleep spreaders besides Snorlax. Articuno faces fierce competition in the form of its fellow legendary Pokemon Suicune. Suicune performs the exact same roles as Articuno while having a resistance to Fire, a neutrality to Rock, the ability to threaten back Rock-types with super effective damage, and a typing with generally superior offensive coverage, which means it can check more Pokemon than Articuno. This can make it difficult to fit Articuno on teams without introducing weaknesses to Pokemon like Charizard and Machamp. Spikes immunity does give it an edge in longer, drawn-out battles, and STAB Ice Beam makes it harder for RestTalk Zapdos to take Toxic, but most teams have a Rest Snorlax to wall Articuno anyway. While generally left out in the cold in terms of usage, the king of Seafoam Islands has just enough useful defensive traits that it retains viability in OU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to stop Forretress from getting a free switch into Articuno while also giving Articuno a move to break Jynx's Substitute, but giving up one of the main options on the set makes Articuno worse off against everything else. If you wish to compromise Articuno's ability to absorb sleep status, you could use Toxic alongside Reflect and drop Sleep Talk. This would give Articuno a better matchup against Snorlax, but by doing so it trades reliability against sleep inducers Articuno normally checks. Blizzard can be used for more power, which can OHKO Pokemon such as Rhydon, Marowak, Exeggutor, and Nidoking, though the latter two require prior Spikes damage, and Articuno generally does well against them with Ice Beam anyway. Blizzard's low PP and accuracy also makes Ice Beam the better option, though the PP issue can be supplemented with Sleep Talk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Attacks: Pokemon with Rock-type attacks such as Machamp and Tyranitar threaten Articuno with super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Forretress: As said before, Forretress can freely switch into Articuno and can proceed to remove Spikes or set them up. However, it does always run the risk of being frozen by Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Raikou can freely switch into Articuno and threaten it out with an Electric-type attack or begin shuffling Articuno's team with Roar, but it must be careful of Articuno using Toxic to hit it on the switch. Snorlax with Rest counters Articuno in a similar fashion with its hard-hitting Normal-type attacks. Blissey shrugs off Ice Beam and has Heal Bell to undo the freeze and poison that Articuno can spread.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Tentacruel is safe from all attacks that Articuno can throw at it and can either set up with Substitute or Swords Dance or take advantage of the free turn to remove Spikes with Rapid Spin. Cloyster and Starmie do not fear Ice Beam and can Rapid Spin—or use Toxic, Explosion, or Spikes in Cloyster's case—in retaliation, but they lack an immunity to Toxic. Vaporeon can set up Growth boosts against Articuno, and although Toxic may force it to use Rest, Sleep Talk variants will not mind this too much.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk Users: Pokemon that run Sleep Talk with Rest and do not fear Ice Beam such as Umbreon, Snorlax, Heracross, and Suicune can switch into Articuno and not worry about being inflicted with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Entei, Typhlosion, Charizard, and Moltres can all switch into Articuno and threaten it with Fire Blast. Moltres in particular typically runs RestTalk, and so doesn't fear Toxic.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>As Articuno can safely switch in on Jynx, Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Blissey, Sleep Talk and Rest make a lot of sense to ensure that Articuno is effective as a designated sleep absorber. Alternatively, Roar can be used over Sleep Talk to make Articuno harder to set up on for Snorlax and Vaporeon and allow Articuno to pressure Pokemon that it has poisoned and stop them from switching in and using Rest. Ice Beam provides some offensive utility coming off a Special Attack stat that isn't too bad. A 10% chance to freeze should never be underestimated, either. Toxic is used to weaken incoming Pokemon that can beat Articuno one-on-one, such as Raikou, Snorlax, and Tyranitar. It can also be used to buy some time against sweepers like Vaporeon by forcing them to use Rest and wear down enemy Cloyster in an attempt to win the all-important Spikes war. Reflect may also be used to provide some defensive support for Articuno's teammates and help Articuno against the many Explosion users in the metagame.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Articuno generally plays a supportive role and can be taken advantage of by a lot of common metagame threats, it works best when supporting defensive teams. Pokemon that do not mind stomaching a Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, such as Raikou and Blissey, cover Articuno's weakness to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Articuno's shallow movepool means that Forretress, which has an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Ice, can freely switch into Articuno and proceed to remove Spikes. Hence, Ghost-type Pokemon that can block Rapid Spin and Pokemon with Fire-type coverage to lure Forretress make good partners for Articuno.</p> <p>Articuno's big weakness to Rock-type attacks means that Pokemon that can safely switch into them can cover the frosty bird's weakness. Golem, Rhydon, and Nidoking can all do this, but they must be careful of other moves that may threaten them. Skarmory is a blanket check to physical attacks and can sometimes fill this role as well. Miltank's fast Growl and Umbreon's Charm mean that both Pokemon can help out in an emergency, especially when supported by Reflect from Articuno. Suicune can also be used as a partner to Articuno, as if one caries Roar and the other has RestTalk, they can cover a lot of threats together. They both spread poison effectively, and Articuno can take Explosion for Suicune reasonably well thanks to its Spikes immunity making it harder to wear down.</p> <p>Pursuit support from Umbreon helps Articuno out against Starmie, which Articuno is otherwise passive against and can only hope to poison or freeze. Pursuit support can also help out in the Gengar matchup, which can be difficult for Articuno if it has to switch into Thunder.</p> <p>Speaking of Starmie, it too makes a good partner for Articuno thanks to its effectiveness against Machamp, Rhydon, and Charizard.</p> <p>Offensively, Articuno's most effective teammates are those that aim to win in the long term, such as Forretress through its use of Spikes, Snorlax with a STAB attack and two coverage moves, and Belly Drum Snorlax. The status inflictions Articuno provides can give these teammates the opportunities they need to switch in and make a long-lasting impact on the game.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is a dominant and defining Pokemon in GSC OU. It has tremendous base 125 Special Attack and near perfect coverage between STAB Electric-type moves and Hidden Power Ice, making it an offensive force to be reckoned with. It is particularly deadly when used with Spikes support, as no Pokemon immune to Spikes can stomach hits from it for long, and even grounded foes that can withstand a beating from it, such as Raikou and Snorlax, become crippled if Zapdos's Thunder inflicts paralysis on them. Zapdos also has defensive traits that its main competition, Raikou, can only look to the sky in envy at. Its Flying typing grants it immunity to Earthquake from the tier's many Ground-types as well as useful resistances to Fighting and Bug—all without the usual accompanying weakness to Electric-type attacks. Its phenomenal typing and formidable defensive stats make it one of the best candidates for using RestTalk, which gives Zapdos excellent longevity and makes it one of the best Pokemon at taking Toxic from foes such as Skarmory, Cloyster, Suicune, and Blissey, although it should be more wary of taking paralysis when it doesn't need to. Thanks to its spectacular damage output, even the few Pokemon that can 2HKO it, such as Jynx, Tyranitar, and Marowak, can struggle to find an opportunity to advantageously trade hits with it, especially since Zapdos often finds chances to recover lost health with Rest. This excellent balance between offense and defense makes Zapdos an easy fit on many teams. However, Zapdos will often find itself having to trade hits with Snorlax, which is one of the very few Pokemon that can do so favorably. Furthermore, while it generally has the upper hand in most matchups, many common offensive Pokemon such as Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Steelix will often try to trade themselves for Zapdos with Explosion, which almost always OHKOes it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Running Drill Peck with an Electric-type move and Hidden Power Water will give Zapdos a better matchup against threats such as Heracross, Machamp, and Exeggutor, and its high PP and solid damage output can put pressure on Blissey's Soft-Boiled PP, but Zapdos will still have problems with Raikou, Snorlax, and Quagsire. When used alongside Whirlwind, Reflect is helpful when dealing with Tyranitar, Machamp, and Snorlax; Light Screen is similarly useful when fighting Nidoking, Jynx, and opposing Zapdos. Light Screen also tends to be valuable in helping setup sweepers find opportunities to boost without losing too much health in the process. Toxic is a possibility to force Snorlax and Raikou into a predictable Rest, which can grant momentum. In addition, if Snorlax is unable to safely absorb Toxic, this can put Blissey in a difficult position due to its limited Heal Bell PP. Zapdos can consider running Hidden Power Grass to deal a lot of damage to Quagsire, but this will severely impact Zapdos's HP stat and lose crucial super effective coverage against Nidoking, so it is therefore almost never recommended. With Magnet, Zapdos can possibly 3HKO Snorlax with Thunder after Spikes, though losing Leftovers reduces Zapdos's longevity by such a huge amount that Zapdos loses much of its usual defensive effectiveness. Zapdos's high Speed means that it can use Substitute + Swagger somewhat effectively with prior paralysis spreading and Spikes support. This can give it a better chance of getting through some of its bulkier checks, such as Snorlax and Quagsire. However, this strategy can easily fall apart against RestTalk Zapdos and Raikou if they are able to use Rest, and the set suffers from the inability to fit Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou is the best counter to Zapdos, as it can take any of Zapdos's moves while phazing or hammering Zapdos with a powerful STAB Thunder of its own. Jolteon can use Zapdos without Whirlwind as setup bait. After it uses Agility or Growth, it can use Baton Pass to send a deadly boost to a teammate to sweep Zapdos's team. Jolteon can also easily dispose of Zapdos itself after using Growth. Other less common Electric-types such as Ampharos also have a good matchup against Zapdos. However, none of them appreciate being paralyzed by Zapdos's Thunder or Thunder Wave, and none of them can immediately threaten a 2HKO on Zapdos, which can give Zapdos a chance to fish for paralysis against them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Blissey walls Zapdos all day long; however, it is largely unable to do anything significant to Zapdos other than use Light Screen to support its team or fish for a freeze with Ice Beam while Zapdos is awake. With RestTalk or Heal Bell support, Snorlax will easily take on even Thunder Zapdos. Even without such support, Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon at tanking Zapdos's moves and threatens it back significantly with its STAB attacks. However, Zapdos's Thunder is capable of 4HKOing Snorlax, so pairing Snorlax with a Ground-type Pokemon to bait Hidden Power can be useful in limiting the damage it takes switching in. Rapid Spin support also helps immensely in this regard, as Spikes damage counteracts Leftovers recovery and causes Thunder damage to accumulate far more quickly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix works as an effective pivot for teams looking to bring in a check to Zapdos against a relatively weak Hidden Power Ice. Steelix can also use Explosion to trade itself for Zapdos, phaze, or paralyze Zapdos with Body Slam or Dragon Breath. Piloswine and Quagsire can also check Hidden Power Ice Zapdos reliably and potentially threaten it in return with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Rock. Quagsire also has the advantage of taking neutral damage from Hidden Power Water, unlike the other Ground-types that also take neutral damage from Hidden Power Ice. Marowak can 2HKO Zapdos with Rock Slide and almost always avoids a 2HKO from Hidden Power. Nidoking usually 3HKOes with Ice Beam and has the threat of Counter up its sleeve—Counter always succeeds against Hidden Power in GSC, although Nidoking should weaken Zapdos before attempting to pull this off. Rhydon 2HKOes Zapdos with Rock Slide and narrowly evades being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice almost all of the time. However, the slim margins in this matchup, as well as the potential Hidden Power Water OHKO, make fighting Zapdos with Rhydon head on a risky proposition. Rhydon and Marowak both also have access to Counter; Rhydon will OHKO if targeted by Hidden Power Ice about 85% of the time and can guarantee an OHKO if it has slightly lower Special DVs than maximum, whereas to KO with Marowak, Zapdos must be weakened or Marowak's Special DVs and Special Stat Experience must be significantly lower than maximum, which may not be worth the serious loss of special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar:  Tyranitar has STAB Rock Slide, which achieves the rare feat of 2HKOing Zapdos. Furthermore, it has Pursuit to chip away at Zapdos as it switches out. However, Tyranitar cannot afford to switch in on Zapdos's Thunder, which 3HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx cannot afford to switch into a an Electric-type move from Zapdos, but usually avoids a Thunder 2HKO and threatens a 2HKO in return with Ice Beam, making it a good option to switch in as Zapdos uses Rest.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Zapdos makes a great target for Explosion users such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, Golem, Steelix, and Gengar. With the exception of Gengar, which can use Ice Punch to bring it into KO range beforehand, most Explosion users in OU can always OHKO Zapdos, and this is often an excellent trade to make. Removing Zapdos from the picture often paves the way for attackers such as Vaporeon, Nidoking, and Machamp to wreak havoc.</p> <p><strong>Sunny Day: Pokemon with Sunny Day can turn a winning matchup into a potential losing one for Zapdos variants relying on Thunder. Entei, Typhlosion, and Houndoom can also 2HKO Zapdos with Fire Blast in sun, and Moltres often survives one hit from Thunder to land a 2HKO. However, if Zapdos manages to land Thunder, it has good odds to 2HKO Typhlosion and Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Zapdos's tendency to use the inaccurate Thunder can be exploited by fast Pokemon with Substitute, such as Alakazam, Espeon, Tentacruel, and Starmie. As Zapdos fails to break Substitute with Hidden Power most of the time, Thunder misses can generate free turns to set up, fire off attacks, or spin away Spikes.</p> ",

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Great Special Attack, combined with the ability to continuously get rid of status and restore health with virtually no drawbacks, turns Zapdos into a powerful tank. The choice between Thunder and Thunderbolt depends on what your team needs more: power or consistency. Offensive teams will typically favor Thunder's higher Base Power, which allows Zapdos to possibly 4HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Miltank. The damage roll on Snorlax is particularly notable against non-Sleep Talk Snorlax, as Zapdos without Thunder will require multiple critical hits within a few turns to KO Snorlax, whereas Thunder Zapdos can potentially KO it if Thunder lands a critical hit within three attacks. Thunder's high chance of inflicting paralysis also makes Electric-types such as Raikou shakier at checking Zapdos, as they depend on their Speed to reliably deal with other foes such as Vaporeon and Cloyster. This high chance of paralysis on such a powerful move is an important reason why Zapdos can be so difficult to deal with—aside from Raikou, Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Tyranitar, Porygon2, and Gengar lose considerable effectiveness when they become paralyzed, and they will all need to risk this occasionally. Still, some teams may prefer the high PP and accuracy of Thunderbolt, which gives Zapdos more consistency against foes such as Vaporeon, Cloyster, Starmie, and Tentacruel. Zapdos's coverage attack is primarily used to threaten Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak. Hidden Power Ice has the benefits of hitting Grass-types such as Exeggutor super effectively and crucially increasing Zapdos's odds at beating opposing RestTalk Zapdos with Sleep Talk rolls. Hidden Power Water is an alternative option to hit Golem, Steelix, and Rhydon harder, but the resulting HP DV drop and neutral damage to opposing Zapdos make Zapdos substantially less likely to come out on top against RestTalk Zapdos with Hidden Power Ice. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Zapdos makes a great status absorber and a more consistent check to Vaporeon, Exeggutor, and Nidoking. Its defensive stats and typing pair together so well that, with the right Sleep Talk rolls, it can sometimes beat almost an entire weakened team by itself, especially if the team lacks Explosion or attacks that 2HKO it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos possesses several qualities that make it fantastic at taking advantage of Spikes: its attacking moves hit all Spikes-immune Pokemon extremely hard, its immunity to Spikes makes it excellent at double switching to rack up Spikes damage, and very few of the Pokemon that can withstand its powerful attacks pose an immediate KO threat in return. Cloyster not only provides these Spikes, but it also switches into many of the Pokemon that can switch into Zapdos, with the notable exception of Raikou. Offensive partners such as Gengar and Exeggutor lure in the three major walls that trouble Zapdos—Raikou, Blissey, and Snorlax—and can use a strong Explosion to KO or severely weaken them. Gengar also acts as an effective lure to Quagsire, which, while uncommon, walls Zapdos effectively. Exeggutor, on the other hand, can check Quagsire with ease. Zapdos also enjoys support from Snorlax, which can take on problematic foes such as Raikou, Blissey, and Jolteon, while a Raikou of your own will take on opposing Electric-types. If Snorlax has Self-Destruct, it can also bait and KO opposing Snorlax to give room for Zapdos to wreak havoc. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Machamp appreciate paralysis support from Thunder, and teams that have Raikou will almost certainly switch it into Zapdos, giving Zapdos plenty of chances to inflict this paralysis for its teammates. Zapdos enjoys support from Snorlax checks such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Machamp on offensive teams and Skarmory, Misdreavus, Umbreon, and Miltank on defensive teams; Tyranitar and Golem are also commonly found on both kinds of team. Skarmory can also take Explosion from Steelix and deal with Quagsire. Machamp, Vaporeon, and Ground-types such as Nidoking help Zapdos against Tyranitar. Ground-types also help against Electric-types, especially Raikou.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Offensive Phazer",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Zapdos can take its already respectable offensive presence to another level by using Whirlwind in tandem with Spikes support. This set works due to Zapdos's huge threat level against a vast majority of the metagame. Few Pokemon can afford to stay in to trade hits with Zapdos—notably, fewer than can take Roar Raikou on—with many risking being OHKOed if they stay in. Most teams rely on Snorlax and Raikou or a Ground-type to combat Zapdos's onslaught, but repeatedly taking Spikes damage on entry and then immediately being phazed, forcing another entry, can bring even the sturdiest checks into KO range of its attacks. There is no reliable answer to such a strategy other than to anticipate Whirlwind and attack Zapdos or hope that Whirlwind drags in a healthy Pokemon that has a favorable matchup. Whirlwind also lets Zapdos punish Snorlax for setting up Curse against it by preventing it from burning through any of its sleep turns if used when Snorlax is forced to use Rest. Thunder Wave can cripple most healthy Pokemon, making the target easier for Zapdos and its team to deal with. It is particularly useful when dealing with RestTalk Zapdos, which is one of the only Pokemon that can give this Zapdos significant trouble due to its immunity to Spikes and ability to avoid being 2HKOed. Thunder Wave is not the only option for this moveslot; rather, it is the clear best option for a majority of teams. One alternative is Protect, which can block Explosion from the likes of Exeggutor, Steelix, and Gengar and allow Zapdos to recover health with Leftovers to help compensate for lacking Rest, potentially turning 3HKOs into 4HKOs against foes such as Nidoking and Gengar. While this Zapdos is typically considered an offensive variant, Whirlwind also allows it to play defensive roles, such as phazing Mean Look variants of Misdreavus and Umbreon, Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax that have used Rest, and other foes with boosting moves. On more defensive lineups, it may elect to use Rest over Thunder Wave and pair up with a Heal Bell user such as Blissey.</p> <p>In terms of attacks, this variant of Zapdos is much more dependent on Spikes support and therefore prefers to have the most powerful and accurate moves against Rapid Spin users. Thunderbolt is slightly preferred over Thunder, as it consistently eliminates Starmie and Cloyster and deals reliable heavy damage to Forretress, and Hidden Power Water is preferred over Hidden Power Ice so that Zapdos can nail Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix, which is useful to deter use of Rapid Spin from Golem, Rock Slide from Rhydon, and Body Slam or Roar from Steelix. In addition, Whirlwind somewhat compensates for Hidden Power Water's worsened Exeggutor matchup, as Zapdos can phaze it as it switches in. However, Exeggutor is a much bigger threat to this Zapdos and can be especially problematic if the team cannot maintain Spikes support. Hidden Power Ice can therefore still be useful, and it also helps against opposing Zapdos when using the less reliable Thunder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cloyster is the preferred teammate for Spikes support, as it provides a significant offensive threat alongside its Spikes and can blow a hole in the opponent's defenses against Zapdos. It also provides a decent temporary answer to Curse Snorlax thanks to its high Defense, tendency to run Toxic in its standard moveset—which can force Snorlax to use Rest, and ability to threaten Snorlax with Explosion. Cloyster also provides a temporary answer to Ground- and Rock-type foes that Zapdos may not always want to trade hits with, such as Rhydon and Marowak. Forretress is a valid alternative, although its offensive capabilities are lacking. It is great at taking advantage of foes such as mono-attacking Snorlax and capitalizes well when opponents are stacking their teams with anti-Cloyster measures, such as Thunder Snorlax and Toxic Skarmory, which are less effective against Forretress and can grant it easy opportunities to set Spikes. Gengar is another useful teammate for its ability to spinblock, as losing Spikes can significantly impair Zapdos's offensive capabilities against defensive teams. Without RestTalk, Zapdos is far more susceptible to status. RestTalk Snorlax is therefore a great choice of teammate, especially on teams that lack other good candidates for a RestTalk user, as it can absorb status from most foes safely. Zapdos generally appreciates having offensive teammates that punish foes for trying to recover. Some of these include Nidoking, Gengar, Exeggutor, and Jynx. In particular, it is important that Zapdos's teammates do not allow paralyzed opposing Zapdos opportunities to switch in and use Rest without threatening a 3HKO in return or a trade with Explosion.</p> <p>However, if Zapdos is instead found on a defensive lineup, pressing a favorable position is much less important and its teammates can instead be focused on gaining and maintaining a Spikes advantage while walling the enemy team. Skarmory is a commonly chosen teammate that can take on Curse + Earthquake Snorlax reliably and check Marowak and Machamp, which are two Pokemon that Zapdos does not want to be the lone check against. Blissey is a great choice for checking special attackers and offering Heal Bell support to Zapdos. When paired with other formidable mixed tanks such as Snorlax, Zapdos can also help against foes such as Nidoking, Machamp, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, despite lacking RestTalk.</p> "

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres is GSC OU's most consistent Sunny Day attacker. It has the highest Special Attack out of any Fire-type, and with the help of Charcoal and Sunny Day, it has extremely high odds to 2HKO Snorlax after Spikes. Moltres's defensive stats are also quite solid, and its typing enables it to answer common threats like Exeggutor, Steelix, Forretress, and Heracross. In addition, it makes for a decent sleep absorber, and its Spikes immunity can be quite useful for longer games. Moltres best matches up versus offensive teams that lack Fire-resistant Pokemon, in particular when Steelix is used as the only Normal-type check with a Zapdos / Snorlax / Cloyster core; unless Vaporeon or Charizard is used in one of the slots, the other two Pokemon likely do not resist Fire. Some examples of those Pokemon are Nidoking, Jynx, Exeggutor, Machamp, and Gengar. In addition, Moltres can wreak havoc versus traditional defensive teams that replace Suicune with Umbreon.</p> <p>Despite Moltres's potential to 2HKO Snorlax, it's still not favored in a one-on-one matchup; its best chances are if sun has already been set up, but Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to take Moltres down with it. Usually Moltres's only attack is Fire Blast, so Water- and Rock-types like Vaporeon, Suicune, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem will often stop it in its tracks. Moltres also struggles versus Zapdos and Raikou if they switch in safely, as they outspeed it and threaten it with their powerful Electric-type attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more PP and higher accuracy, but this is generally not worth it, as the additional power is extremely important and Moltres can somewhat compensate for Fire Blast's low PP with Rest and Sleep Talk. Leftovers can also be used over Charcoal for increased longevity at the expense of more power. Hidden Power Grass gives Moltres better coverage, enabling it to turn the tide against Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire; however, the move is far too weak to make a significant difference versus Vaporeon, Starmie, and Suicune. Whirlwind is a decent option, since Moltres is able to force many switches with its offensive presence. Sleep Talk can be used without Rest on more offensive sets so Moltres can still function as a sleep absorber, but its longevity will be significantly hampered. Toxic could be used to cripple Rock-types like Rhydon, Golem, and Tyranitar, but it's quite difficult to find room for this move. Substitute is an interesting option alongside moves like Sunny Day and Toxic, which can potentially enable Moltres to more safely combat Electric-types like Zapdos and Raikou. Overall, however, Moltres has an extremely difficult time giving up any of its main moves and will lose a large portion of its effectiveness if any of them is replaced.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Vaporeon, Quagsire, Starmie, and Suicune can completely shut down Moltres, as they can shrug off Fire Blast, even in the sun, and hit Moltres with super effective Water-type attacks or, in Quagsire's case, Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon can check Moltres, as Fire Blast is usually its only attacking move. While Tyranitar and Rhydon can fire back with a 4x super effective Rock Slide, Golem typically needs to use Explosion to remove Moltres as it often forgoes Rock-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou both outspeed Moltres and can threaten it with powerful STAB-boosted Electric-type attacks. While Moltres can deal massive damage back with Fire Blast, it doesn't usually want to stay in and take an attack. Moltres is able to take one Thunder, however, so it may want to go for a KO in a pinch. If sun is up, Moltres may also want to stay in and bank on a 50% chance for Thunder to miss, which may open the gate for it to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax have a lot of natural Special Defense, which enables them to check Moltres. While Blissey checks Moltres defensively by shrugging off Fire Blast, Snorlax can hit Moltres with powerful STAB-boosted Normal-type attacks like Body Slam, Double-Edge, and even Self-Destruct. Snorlax needs to be careful of a Charcoal-boosted Fire Blast in the sun, though, which has high odds to 2HKO it after damage from Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: Gengar outspeeds Moltres and can attack it with a super effective Electric-type attack, use Explosion to remove it, or even take Moltres down with it by using Destiny Bond. Gengar can never switch into Moltres safely, though; it needs to be very healthy to take a hit. While sun is up, Gengar should never switch into Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Rock-type attacks</strong>: Machamp and Marowak can always take a hit from full and hit Moltres with a devastating 4x super effective Rock Slide, landing a 2HKO and an OHKO respectively. Neither of these Pokemon can switch into Moltres safely, however, because they risk being 2HKOed by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Charizard is a great Moltres check because it can switch into Fire Blast safely from full, and it can outspeed and 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Entei resists any of Moltres's attacks, but it can't do too much damage back to Moltres. Still, it can be used in hopes that Moltres wastes its Fire Blast PP on it. Moltres can check itself, but that often results in a PP war.</p> ",

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>RestTalk is Moltres's most consistent moveset because of its overall longevity and ability to compensate for Sunny Day's and Fire Blast's low PP. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk enables Moltres to check Pokemon like Exeggutor and Jynx, which would otherwise be a bit difficult to switch into. In addition, thanks to Sunny Day reducing Thunder's accuracy, Moltres can also absorb Nidoking's Lovely Kiss relatively well. If Nidoking tries to use Thief, it ends up stealing Charcoal, which significantly reduces Thief's effectiveness. Sunny Day significantly increases Moltres's damage output, which enables it to OHKO Cloyster and Gengar after Spikes, as well as 2HKO several Pokemon such as Machamp, Zapdos, and Raikou. With Charcoal, it even has high odds to 2HKO Snorlax after Spikes, which is significant in that no other Sunny Day attacker is capable of accomplishing that feat.</p> <p>Although it may seem inconvenient for Moltres to use Sunny Day with Sleep Talk, this can be useful to restart sun's timer and also make it more difficult for Pokemon like Zapdos, Raikou, Snorlax, and Nidoking to land Thunder. While Moltres is awake, try to conserve Fire Blast's PP carefully, as 8 PP is extremely low and may be difficult to manage in a long game. It may also be best to keep Moltres hidden as long as possible, because compared to other Pokemon, Moltres can become much easier to manage once it has been revealed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>For Moltres to successfully sweep a team, it needs quite a bit of support. Sleep inducers like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Gengar make it easier to switch Moltres in and set up. As an added bonus, all of these Pokemon can use Explosion or Self-Destruct to potentially remove a Moltres check like Vaporeon, Suicune, Zapdos, or Raikou. Cloyster is an almost mandatory teammate, as Spikes are what enable Moltres to have high odds at 2HKOing Snorlax. In addition, its Explosion is also very useful, especially for removing Moltres checks like Starmie, Vaporeon, and Suicune. Steelix's Steel / Ground typing allows it to support Moltres with its Electric immunity and Normal and Rock resistances. It can often use a combination of Curse, Roar, and Explosion to force in and KO Zapdos, assisting in Moltres's eventual sweep. Other Ground-types like Nidoking and Golem can be useful to combat Electric-types; Nidoking can use Lovely Kiss, and Golem can use Explosion to disrupt typical Moltres checks. Your own Raikou can support Moltres by shrugging off Electric-type attacks from Zapdos, using Roar to phaze the opposing team and identify Moltres checks early, and pressuring Water-types like Suicune and Vaporeon. Raikou can potentially use Hidden Power Water to lure in and remove Rock / Ground types like Rhydon and Golem, but both should be worn down slightly before using the move, as it is not a guaranteed OHKO. Also, using Thunderbolt over Thunder on Raikou should be considered so as to not be messed up by your own sun. Moltres can directly support Tyranitar by using Sunny Day to weaken Water-type attacks and enable it to take on Electric-types with slightly more ease. In return, Tyranitar can switch into Starmie and threaten it with Pursuit and Crunch, which frees up Moltres and Cloyster significantly.</p> "

The beauty in Body Slam is its ability to cripple something like Starmie, who needs its speed to be effective.

From there, bulk up with Swords Dance and go to town.</p> <p>One may be tempted to put a Grass STAB move here, but it's generally not needed. You're better off trying to paralyze Suicune and Starmie, and after a Swords Dance, either of the physical attacks will do as much or more than a super effective Razor Leaf. The only things that Razor Leaf or Giga Drain will do more damage to are Cloyster and Rhydon, which is far from enough to merit use over the 50% recovery of Synthesis. Rhydon will get hit hard with a +2 Earthquake anyway. Though Meganium doesn't pack the instant firepower of Exeggutor, it also isn't completely debilitated by Pursuit-carrying Dark types, which is something to consider.</p> "

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Typhlosion has a small edge over its main competitors Charizard and Moltres with its Electric neutrality and lesser weakness to Rock, which allows Typhlosion to directly take on Zapdos as well as avoid an OHKO from some Rock-type move users like Tyranitar. Typhlosion also has Dynamic Punch, which despite its abysmal accuracy, allows it to threaten Tyranitar and annoy Snorlax.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even when considering the above traits, Typhlosion is still generally outclassed by other Fire-types. As a Sunny Day sweeper, Typhlosion struggles to stand out from Moltres, Houndoom, and even Entei, which have better Special Attack, typing, or bulk, respectively, that allow them to take on a much larger range of threats; notably, unlike Typhlosion, Houndoom and Entei can use Solar Beam, an incredibly useful move under sun. Typhlosion also faces competition from Charizard, which has the same base stats, a Flying typing that gives it an immunity to Ground-type moves, and access to Belly Drum to bolster its offensive prowess even further. Additionally, Typhlosion's poor bulk and common weaknesses mean that it heavily relies on prediction and team support to work effectively. Even when predicting correctly and having the right support, Typhlosion relies on moves with unreliable accuracy such as Fire Blast and Dynamic Punch, so it is generally inconsistent.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Typhlosion can use Hidden Power Ice to 2HKO Dragonite, which usually hard counters it. However, running Hidden Power Ice over Hidden Power Grass leaves Typhlosion more vulnerable to Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire, which are able to pressure Typhlosion offensively much harder than Dragonite, so Hidden Power Ice is usually not worth it. Typhlosion can also run a RestTalk set with Rest / Sleep Talk / Fire Blast / Dynamic Punch, which can separate itself from the only other Fire-type RestTalk user Moltres with its access to Dynamic Punch, no Electric weakness, and a Speed tier that lets it Speed tie with Zapdos. This set also pairs well with Zapdos because it can absorb sleep from Pokemon that would threaten to 2HKO or use Explosion on Zapdos such as Exeggutor, Jynx, and Gengar. Unfortunately, frequent bad matchups and the issue of moves with unreliable accuracy cut down on the set's viability a lot, so it isn't very effective. Toxic can wear down typical switch-ins such as Suicune and Snorlax and force them to use Rest. However, Toxic is difficult to fit on the mixed set because it removes coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: With the notable exception of Cloyster, Typhlosion is completely shut down by most Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Suicune, and Hidden Power Grass fails to do significant damage to them. Vaporeon is also able to use Typhlosion as setup fodder. Starmie is one of Typhlosion's strongest offensive counters, as it 2HKOes Typhlosion with Surf, outspeeds it, and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, hindering its offensive presence. Tentacruel resists or is neutral to most of Typhlosion's coverage, 2HKOes with Hydro Pump, and can use Typhlosion as setup fodder. However, Tentacruel is not a fan of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax completely walls Typhlosion due to its incredible HP and Special Defense stats and can use Curse to raise its otherwise poor Defense and already excellent Attack, meaning that even Dynamic Punch doesn't do enough damage to take down Snorlax. Furthermore, Snorlax can retaliate with Earthquake or STAB-boosted Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite invalidates Typhlosion, as it resists or is immune to nearly all of Typhlosion's coverage and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave to try to take it out. However, Hidden Power Ice can prevent Dragonite from checking Typhlosion.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar takes little damage from Hidden Power Grass and Earthquake and resists Fire Blast. It also threatens to KO Typhlosion with STAB Rock Slide, but Dynamic Punch can possibly take out Tyranitar if it hits. If Typhlosion isn't running Hidden Power Grass, it is hard countered by Rhydon and Golem, which can KO Typhlosion with Earthquake or Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Charizard and Moltres: Charizard and Moltres take little to no damage from any attack if Typhlosion is not running Thunder Punch. Moltres outdamages Typhlosion and often runs RestTalk, and Charizard can retaliate by hitting it with Earthquake. These Fire-types can also take advantage of Sunny Day if Typhlosion sets it up.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Fire Blast is Typhlosion's STAB move that super effectively hits common Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Steelix, and Skarmory as well as doing decent neutral damage to Pokemon like Zapdos and Machamp. Dynamic Punch does the most amount of damage to Tyranitar and has the added bonus of confusing the target if it hits. Hidden Power Grass hits Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire that would otherwise wall Typhlosion. Thunder Punch is an alternative that hits Flying-types, such as Charizard and Moltres, as well as hitting Water-types, such as Starmie and Suicune. Earthquake reliably 3HKOes Raikou and 2HKOes Gengar without having to rely on Fire Blast's 85% accuracy, and it is also the best move to use against Tentacruel, Jolteon, and Houndoom. Sunny Day is an alternative that boosts Typhlosion's wallbreaking potential with Fire Blast and reduces the accuracy of Thunder, giving it the advantage against Zapdos and Raikou.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Typhlosion is helpless against teams with Water-types barring Cloyster, so Pokemon that can weaken or take them out for Typhlosion make useful teammates. Starmie and Suicune are especially problematic for Typhlosion, and one of the best partners that can deal with Starmie is Cloyster due to its resistance to Water and access to Explosion. Cloyster also has Spikes to assist it and its teammates in sweeping or cleaning teams. Pokemon that can take advantage of Suicune's passivity such as Tentacruel and RestTalk Vaporeon are also valuable teammates, as they can wall Suicune and use it as setup fodder if it is not running Roar. Zapdos and Snorlax can absorb sleep for Typhlosion and can pressure Water-types. Lures for Water-types are also very helpful too, and Thunder or Thunderbolt Nidoking and Explosion Steelix are examples of such Pokemon. Nidoking is also a decent check to Tyranitar and can potentially weaken Pokemon Typhlosion dislikes such as Zapdos and Snorlax.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Gengar is an interesting Pokemon. It gets a wonderful movepool with super effective coverage and sacrificial moves that can hurt pretty much anything the OU tier has to offer. However, since Shadow Ball is physical, Gengar gets no special STAB moves to run off that amazing base 130 Special Attack stat. Gengar is also very frail, and while its Ghost typing is very useful for capitalizing off foes that only run Normal-type STAB moves, it's vulnerable to Pursuit and cannot take a hit that it doesn't resist. Moreover, as a Ghost-type, Misdreavus outclasses it as a spinblocker, Perish trapper, and Snorlax counter because of Gengar's unfortunate weaknesses to Earthquake and Starmie's Psychic. Furthermore, its Speed, while great, is eclipsed by that of Raikou and Starmie, which leads to particularly relevant match-up problems. In spite of these issues, Gengar is the tier's best assassin, being able to take down pretty much anything it wants to with Explosion, Destiny Bond, wonderful type coverage, or some sort of surprise. To get the most out of it, Gengar users should be sure to play to its strengths, maintain good prediction, know how to utilize the element of surprise, and be wary of letting it take any kind of status-inducing move or unresisted hit.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aside from the aforementioned move choices, Counter makes for an intriguing option, as it can bounce back non-STAB Earthquake from Snorlax and Tyranitar, or even weaker STAB Earthquake from the likes of Steelix and Nidoking, for a surprise KO. STAB Rock Slide from Tyranitar, as well as non-STAB Hidden Power and Rock Slide from Machamp, are also excellent moves to bounce back with Counter. However, the move is fairly situational, as many Snorlax do not carry Earthquake; many Tyranitar pack Crunch; Nidoking has a slight chance to OHKO Gengar with Earthquake; and most of the move's intended targets can boost with Curse to be able to OHKO Gengar. However, should the foe indeed pack Curse, Destiny Bond synergizes well with Counter, giving Gengar an alternative way to surprise and KO its foe.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar has no true counters due to the many tools it has in its movepool. The best option for a check is Raikou, as it outspeeds Gengar, can survive Explosion at full health, can use Reflect to weaken Explosion, and can even use Sleep Talk to negate Hypnosis or Roar to eliminate the threat of Perish Trap. Umbreon is another top check, as it does not take a lot of damage from Dynamic Punch, takes only 65-77% from Explosion, and can either use a combination Mean Look and Baton Pass, which is especially effective against Perish trap sets, or simply spam Pursuit. However, Umbreon can still lose to Explosion if it is not at full HP, is vulnerable to caught by Hypnosis, and is not powerful enough to outlast Perish Song with Pursuit spam. Dark-types with higher Special Attack such as Tyranitar and Houndoom make for better Pursuit users, and Tyranitar resists Explosion while frequently carrying Roar to deal with a healthy Perish trap Gengar. However, these threats, in addition to being vulnerable to Destiny Bond and Hypnosis, take heavy damage from Dynamic Punch. Steelix makes for a solid check to Gengar as well, since it is immune to Electric, resists Explosion and Ice Punch, and just barely misses out on an OHKO with Earthquake. However, Steelix can always be caught by Destiny Bond or Hypnosis, is weak to Fire Punch, and lacks the special bulk to switch into Ice Punch too many times. Snorlax also makes for a great check for Gengar, especially if it has Earthquake. It takes paltry damage from Gengar's non-STAB special attacks, and without a Defense boost from Curse, it still takes only 28-33% from Dynamic Punch and 69-81% from Explosion. However, without Earthquake, Snorlax has to rely on trying to outstall Gengar, making it vulnerable to a freeze from Ice Punch or a KO from Perish Song. Even with Earthquake, Gengar can always surprise Snorlax with Destiny Bond, incapacitate it with Hypnosis, or KO it with Explosion after some prior damage. Quagsire makes for an okay check, as it does not take super effective damage from BoltBeam and can hit back hard with its STAB Earthquake; like most Gengar checks, though, it can be beaten by Hypnosis, Destiny Bond, or Explosion. Blissey also sponges Gengar's special moves easily, but it cannot force Gengar out, takes a lot of damage from Dynamic Punch, is usually OHKOed by Explosion, and hurts the team greatly if hit by Hypnosis due to the supportive role it plays.</p> <p>Aside from the above checks, there are a few other Pokemon like Zapdos that don't match up as well against Gengar one-on-one but can still threaten it if need be. Zapdos frequently runs Sleep Talk, so Hypnosis isn't too big of a deal, and it can hit Gengar hard and possibly paralyze it with STAB Thunder, although it is 3HKOed by Ice Punch and can always be KOed in return by Explosion or Destiny Bond. In addition, Ground-types such as Rhydon, Nidoking, and Marowak can hit hard enough to OHKO Gengar, so they can force Gengar out as they switch into a predicted Thunderbolt, transferring the offensive momentum to their team. However, they cannot switch into Ice Punch, so the Gengar user can beat them with good prediction. Any other Pokemon that does not fear the BoltBeam combination can also act as a Gengar counter in some form. Misdreavus, your own Gengar, Heracross, and even Miltank can all switch into Gengar to take its hits and force it to use its surprise tactics to win, even though Heracross fears Fire Punch. However, keep in mind that unless such a Pokemon has away to force Gengar out, Gengar can always stay in and spam Ice Punch to try to freeze its foe.</p> ",

        "name": "Assassin",
        "description": "<p>This is the standard Gengar set that maximizes its ability to threaten the GSC metagame, dealing significant damage to almost every viable Pokemon. An Electric-type move functions as a pseudo-STAB attack and, running off Gengar's high base 130 Special Attack, is what keeps specially bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, from switching in. Thunderbolt is generally preferred because Gengar is too frail to afford to miss a lot, but Thunder is a good option for the increased paralysis chance, which is particularly useful against the speedier Raikou. Ice Punch keeps Ground-types at bay and also hits Zapdos and Exeggutor super effectively. It can also be used for its freeze chance in matchups where the foe cannot touch Gengar, such as when Gengar switches in against Miltank or Seismic Toss Heracross. The next moveslot is generally reserved for Gengar's non-sacrificial method of dealing with checks. Generally, Hypnosis is the most effective move, being able to put any one counter out of commission. However, Hypnosis can be caught easily by a Sleep Talk user if it is well-predicted, so it must be used cautiously. Furthermore, because of Sleep Clause, Hypnosis is an unreliable move for dealing with foes such as Pursuit Tyranitar. For this reason, Dynamic Punch is a viable alternative, as it hits Tyranitar hard enough to 2HKO it. Dynamic Punch is also good for putting Snorlax and Umbreon switch-ins into Explosion's KO range after Spikes damage. Finally, the last moveslot deals with Gengar's sacrificial tactics for taking out foes. Explosion is the preferred choice, as Gengar tends to draw in sleep absorbers and physically weak special walls and has no other options with which to eliminate Raikou. However, if Raikou isn't a problem, you can opt instead for Destiny Bond, which is a more reliable–and often game-saving–way to take out opposing Tyranitar, CurseLax, and Steelix. All of these Pokemon are slower than Gengar, take little damage from its BoltBeam coverage, and can frequently have multiple Curse boosts under their belts.</p> <p>Gengar pairs well with teammates that enjoy having its targets removed. Zapdos makes for an excellent partner, as two of its main counters, Raikou and Snorlax, are also two of Gengar's more common Explosion targets. If Gengar is using Destiny Bond, it can lure a Pokemon like Tyranitar, Snorlax, or Steelix into attacking and then going down; this is useful because physical tanks and switch-ins to Normal-type moves can frequently give Gengar trouble.</p> <p>Gengar is not just a role-playing assassin, but also works fantastically as an offensive powerhouse in its own right. It really enjoys using its immunities and Speed to avoid taking as many hits as possible. While it can be effective as a lead, Gengar is often better used later in the match, when opposing Pokemon are weakened and likely in OHKO or 2HKO range of Gengar's super effective attacks. However, if the opponent is using a Normal-type without any coverage moves, such as Miltank or Snorlax, be sure to switch Gengar in early and often to take advantage of that foe's inability to deal damage to it. If you plan to do this with Gengar, though, you should either run Dynamic Punch or be very careful with Hypnosis to ensure that Gengar can deal with Tyranitar, which is likely present on the opponent's team because of the fact that they are using a Pokemon incapable of touching Gengar. Furthermore, if the opponent is using a wall that Gengar is typically used specifically to KO, such as Raikou, do not be afraid to pull the trigger with Explosion, especially if you have been throwing out attacking moves the whole time. The opponent will likely be perfectly willing to risk having their Sleep Talk Raikou eliminated when the risk of trying to predict an Explosion is more damaging than the risk of more super effective attacks and a possible Hypnosis against the rest of their team. Just make sure that Raikou has taken a slight amount of damage or is paralyzed when you pull the trigger, as Raikou can usually survive Gengar's Explosion from full health and, since it outspeeds everything, easily use Rest to undo the Explosion damage without the fear of being revenge killed.</p> <p>Gengar can also make use of Mean Look in the third moveslot. Using Mean Look prevents a switch-in such as Raikou from switching back out in an attempt to predict Explosion, allowing Gengar to use the move safely. Mean Look also pairs well with Destiny Bond, as it prevents a mixed attacker such as Tyranitar from switching out to avoid knocking Gengar out when it's using Destiny Bond. Alternatively, the third moveslot could be forgone to allow room for Gengar to use Destiny Bond and Explosion on the same set, allowing Gengar to be more flexible depending on what Pokemon the opposing team has. Explosion allows it to do serious damage to Raikou, Zapdos, and unboosted Snorlax, whereas Destiny Bond allows Gengar to take down Tyranitar, Steelix, and Curse-boosted Snorlax.</p> <p>Fire Punch could be inserted somewhere on the set, usually in the second or third moveslot. It's mostly useful for Steelix, which does not take super effective damage from BoltBeam, deals heavy damage to Gengar with STAB super effective Earthquakes, and can tank Explosion thanks to its ludicrous Defense and Steel typing. Fire Punch also allows Gengar to counter Curse Heracross, which otherwise sets up with impunity against Gengar's coverage moves, and OHKO Forretress, which can otherwise set up Spikes against Gengar without taking too much damage in return. However, Fire Punch is a poor coverage option outside of these particular matchups. Ice Punch is rarely foregone, as it 3HKOes Zapdos and Ground-types, whereas Dynamic Punch or Hypnosis is preferred in the third moveslot to give Gengar a way to beat Tyranitar, which can spam Pursuit to KO it.</p> "

        "name": "Perish Trapper",
        "description": "<p>Gengar's Poison typing makes it take a lot more damage from Earthquake and Psychic, making it an inferior Perish trapper relative to Misdreavus. However, because Gengar rarely carries Perish Song, this set carries the element of surprise. Opponents will likely stay away from bringing their phazer in on a potential Hypnosis when scouting out Gengar's set. Instead, they will frequently bring in their Sleep Talk Raikou or Zapdos looking to absorb Hypnosis or will try to stall your team out with their non-Earthquake Snorlax only to find out that Gengar has just used Mean Look and plans to eliminate its foe Perish Song. This move combination helps Gengar beat any foe that lacks a phazing move, and Protect allows Gengar to survive an onslaught of damage from a Sleep Talk Zapdos or Raikou while it waits out the Perish Song turns; this is necessary because these two Pokemon can 2HKO Gengar otherwise. Gengar should run an Electric-type move in the fourth moveslot for two reasons. The first reason is to threaten Skarmory and Roar Suicine, which would otherwise be able to switch in against Gengar and phaze it. The second reason is to keep Perish Song concealed and to maintain the element of surprise; as mentioned previously, without this factor, Misdreavus makes for a better Perish trapper. Thunderbolt is typically preferred for its accuracy given Gengar's low defenses; however, Thunder can be used for the increased paralysis chance, which can be helpful when trying to pull off this strategy against a foe such as Roar Raikou.</p> <p>Above all else, it should be stressed that Gengar needs to utilize the element of surprise to make this set work, lest it be outclassed by Misdreavus. As such, it's probably best to scout the opposing team a bit beforehand by using Thunderbolt or, if you expect a Pursuit Tyranitar to come in, switching out. Furthermore, because most opponents will fear Hypnosis, it is generally not a good idea to run the move if any of Gengar's teammates packs a sleep-inducing move, unless it is absolutely necessary that Gengar incapacitate any phazer that might try to switch into it. If your opponent keeps sending phazers into Gengar, it's a good idea to wear them down and either force them to use Rest, paralyze them, or simply bring them down to Gengar's KO range before you bring it out again. If your opponent brings in a Sleep Talk user or Snorlax to check Gengar the first time you bring it out, you can try to catch these switch-ins with Mean Look on the next attempt. If all else fails, if you suspect that the opponent's Snorlax does not carry Earthquake, you can switch Gengar in as Snorlax is setting up Curse and see how the opponent reacts. If Snorlax continues to boost, it's liable to try to stall your team out, out and Gengar should be safe to try to KO Snorlax with Perish trap. In general, just make sure you are reasonably certain the opponent is not going to switch a phazer into Gengar as it uses Mean Look, lest you lose the surprise factor for nothing.</p> <p>Gengar could run a couple of other attacking options in its attacking moveslot to hit different threats. Ice Punch is almost always seen on Gengar, and it can be useful to prevent the Ground-type Pokemon that can phaze or OHKO Gengar from switching in. Dynamic Punch, while uncommon, can hit Tyranitar for major damage and confuse other phazers should you need to buy a turn to pull off Perish trap. Fire Punch is even more uncommon, but it can keep Steelix from switching in and stopping you cold. Still, an Electric-type move is Gengar's strongest and most common attacking option, so it will help more than any other coverage move could with keeping this set concealed.</p> <p>This Gengar set also has the option of running two attacking moves; for example, Gengar can forgo Protect in favor of Ice Punch, completing the BoltBeam combination and making it easier to bluff an offensive set. However, without Protect, Gengar cannot withstand enough neutral hits from any reasonably strong STAB move to net a KO with Perish trap. Thus, it becomes difficult to KO Sleep Talk Raikou, Zapdos, and Snorlax, but the latter is still easy to beat as long as it does not have Earthquake.</p> <p>Gengar could use Confuse Ray to mess with phazers or Destiny Bond to try to take certain threats down with it if the opponent knows the set. However, these options leave Gengar either without a damaging move, thereby making this set much more likely to be discovered, or without Protect, which makes the strategy more difficult to pull off.</p> "

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>With a very high Special Attack stat, solid STAB attacks, dangerous status moves, and a powerful Explosion, Exeggutor is easily one of the most threatening Pokemon in GSC OU. While it will rarely sweep a team by itself, it often plays a key role in dismantling the opposing team's defenses through its ability to incapacitate or trade for crucial targets. On the defensive side, Exeggutor can serve as a check to threatening sweepers like Vaporeon, Marowak, and Machamp thanks to its resistances to their powerful STAB attacks. Unfortunately for Exeggutor, a lot of OU Pokemon run coverage moves that hit it hard, so you should time its entry onto the battlefield carefully to ensure it isn't forced to use Explosion too quickly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A four attacks set is viable, where the status move is forgone in favor of maximum coverage, but dropping a status move is likely to lower Exeggutor's utility overall. Exeggutor is also a decent Thief user, often being able to take Zapdos's Leftovers, which makes 3HKOing it with Psychic possible. Just make sure Exeggutor has no item when using it, of course.</p> <p>If you'd rather spread as much status as possible, you can forgo a coverage move on the standard set and go double status, taking advantage of your opponent's likely assumption that you will be using a coverage move to land status on something that isn't expecting it. However, having Psychic and Explosion as Exeggutor's only attacking moves means that you are highly likely to run into a Pokemon that resists all of its attacks, such as Steelix, Tyranitar, or Skarmory.</p> <p>Synthesis and Moonlight are possible options for the last slot on the Leech Seed set. They allow Exeggutor to play a more defensive role and stick around longer, although they are both illegal with Explosion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In terms of switching into Exeggutor, RestTalk users tend to be the best options due to their ability to sponge status-inflicting moves. Common ones include Zapdos, Snorlax, and Suicune. Do keep in mind that all of them fear Explosion, so beware of possible mind games such as Explosion on the switch. Baiting the Explosion is also possible, of course, and most Pokemon that resist Normal, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar, can take one rather well. Skarmory is also capable of pulling off a Sleep Talk set that can completely shut down non-Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor. Other notable Explosion mitigators include Reflect Raikou and Charm Umbreon. Umbreon also takes little damage from Exeggutor's other attacks, outspeeds it, and has Pursuit, albeit a rather weak one. Stronger Pursuit users in the tier are Tyranitar and Houndoom, although Houndoom tends to fear status a lot and Tyranitar must play mind games against Giga Drain Exeggutor. Toxic from Umbreon, Suicune, or Snorlax can also significantly reduce Exeggutor's longevity and force it to use Explosion predictably or risk not getting it off at all. Jynx is a terror for Exeggutor to face, resisting Psychic and completely blocking status moves and Giga Drain with its Substitutes, but it loses much of its effectiveness if Exeggutor lands status on it on the switch. Lastly, Forretress with Hidden Power Bug or Toxic can switch in and threaten Exeggutor lacking Hidden Power Fire, although it must beware of status.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>First, pick your status move of choice—opponents won't want to risk a Pokemon without Sleep Talk taking Sleep Powder, so using Stun Spore can be an excellent way to paralyze sleep absorbers such as Zapdos, potentially setting up another sweeper or sleep move user on your team for success. However, Sleep Powder is of course very powerful and is an easy choice if your team lacks another sleep move user. Psychic is Exeggutor's main attacking move, dealing solid damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it and even potentially threatening Snorlax with its chance to drop Special Defense. Giga Drain threatens Water-types and gives Exeggutor a chance against Tyranitar, healing off Crunch or Fire Blast damage and preventing it from trapping Exeggutor with Pursuit. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire disintegrates Forretress and dents Skarmory, which walls Giga Drain variants, although dropping Giga Drain makes Pursuit Tyranitar much more dangerous and comes at the cost of 25 HP, 2 Attack points, and 6 Defense points due to DV requirements. Rounding off the set is Explosion, which can secure OHKOs on most Pokemon that don't resist it (Suicune, one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, takes up to 92% from Exeggutor's Explosion), making switching into Exeggutor quite risky at any point in the game.</p> <p>This Exeggutor set is one of the best enablers in the tier, handily setting up Machamp, Marowak, Charizard, or Tentacruel for a potential sweep with its Stun Spore on Raikou and Zapdos or removing said Electric-types for Vaporeon with its Explosion. It can be used as a lead to begin spreading status immediately or even attempt to take something out with its Explosion on turn one. While it is more of an offensive Pokemon, it can also be put to use as a check against Machamp (although it should be noted that Machamp Speed ties Exeggutor and can have Hidden Power Bug), Vaporeon, Marowak, Rhydon, or Steelix and find ways to wreak havoc from there. A well-played Explosion Exeggutor can literally blow through an opponent's defenses, leaving them open to a wide variety of possible threats.</p> "

While Leech Seed in GSC only deals damage immediately after the seeded Pokemon attacks rather than at end-of-turn, it still forces switches like nobody's business. Very little can take repeated hits from Exeggutor's Psychic while also losing an eighth of their HP per turn from Leech Seed, so theoretically, Exeggutor can freely spread its Stun Spore across the enemy team as the opponent helplessly tries to run Exeggutor out of PP, all the while taking significant residual damage. Exeggutor can also drop Substitute for Explosion, potentially catching a crucial Pokemon by surprise and also raising Exeggutor's utility significantly in the event something goes wrong.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, because this Exeggutor is one of the most effective paralysis spreaders in the tier, slow but powerful sweepers such as Machamp and Marowak or Belly Drum users such as Snorlax and Charizard make excellent choices.</p> <p>There are good reasons this is not Exeggutor's main set, however.

Spikers and spinners like Forretress and Starmie may also be eager to take advantage of Exeggutor's lack of coverage to gain an advantage in the Spikes game, particularly if they are supported by Heal Bell users that can undo all of Exeggutor's hard work such as Blissey and Miltank.</p> "

Crunch on the RestTalk is a more effective way to damage opposing Raikou and Exeggutor, and the possiblity of a Special Defense drop will also come in handy versus opponents with large special bulk. However, STAB Thunder, even when resisted, is stronger than a neutral Crunch. Considering Thunder's high paralysis chance, Crunch is usually not worth dropping Hidden Power for Raikou match-ups. Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice or Water will give Quagsire a nasty surprise if it should come in on Raikou. Rhydon and Marowak are also covered by Hidden Power Grass. However, losing out on the super effective coverage from Hidden Power Ice against Nidoking and Exeggutor is less than preferable. Toxic is a possibility to wear down Snorlax and any walls that switch in. However, Thunder is often powerful enough to render Toxic unnecessary; giving up Reflect, and thereby leaving Raikou totally and completely walled by Nidoking and Steelix, is usually not worth the trouble of adding Toxic, either.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Raikou easily checks a large swath of the metagame, but some opponents will flip the tables on the electric tiger. Snorlax is the defining member of OU and threatens nearly everything that tries to come in, including Raikou. Even if Raikou has Reflect, Snorlax will still be able to set up with Curse or paralyze Raikou with Body Slam. As such, Raikou will almost always be forced to switch out of Snorlax, giving the latter an extra turn to either set up, attack, or switch to another teammate. With its wonderful Electric immunity, Quagsire is an excellent Raikou check as long as the latter doesn't pack Hidden Power Grass. Quagsire easily threatens with Earthquake and can set up with Belly Drum as Raikou switches in fear of being severely damaged. Rhydon and Marowak can come in on a predicted Thunder and threaten Raikou with a super effective Earthquake. However, both will need to be wary of switching in on Hidden Power. Steelix also makes a good check to Raikou as long as it doesn't use Hidden Power Water. Even if Raikou has Reflect up, Steelix can phaze with Roar, potentially racking up Spikes damage. Jolteon resists Thunder and can use RestTalk Raikou as an opportunity to set up Agility or Substitute, then Baton Pass to a Ground-type such as Marowak or Rhydon that can come in and fire away with STAB Earthquake. However, Jolteon won't be able to set up against phazing Raikou at all, and it especially won't like the 30% paralysis chance from Thunder. Blissey also deserves a mention as a check because of its ridiculous Special Defense and HP, as it can also use Light Screen to completely neuter Raikou and go for the freeze with Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>When it comes to dependable phazers, it doesn't get much better than Raikou. This set will stop numerous special attackers and setup sweepers such as Growth Vaporeon, Zapdos, Gengar, Suicune, and Growth Jolteon. Raikou will also serve as an effective check to any Misdreavus trying to Perish trap. While Roar phazes opponents and racks up entry hazard damage, Raikou can also threaten opponents with STAB Thunder. It can choose between both Thunder and Thunderbolt. Thunder has extra power and a 30% paralysis chance, while Thunderbolt is more accurate and has more PP. Hidden Power Ice and Water are used to hit Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak as they switch in. Hidden Power Water has the additional benefit of hitting Golem and Rhydon 4x effectively as well as dealing super effective damage to Steelix, but leaves Raikou without an option to hit Exeggutor, requires Raikou to use a lower HP DV, and slightly reduces its ability to reliably take out Zapdos. Alternatively, Reflect can be used to halve the damage from physical sweepers such as Snorlax, Marowak, and Heracross, making it easier to switch out to a counter or safely burn sleep turns. Reflect will also greatly benefit Snorlax trying to set up Belly Drum, but without Hidden Power, Raikou will be unable to threaten Exeggutor or Ground-types. Rest is in the fourth slot to keep Raikou alive once its health has become dangerously low. Status from opponents, especially paralysis, will still be a pain, and without Sleep Talk, Raikou will be forced to either switch out or wait for the sleep from rest to end. Raikou's Rest is incredibly fast and with its superior bulk opponents will often fail to KO or significantly damage Raikou as it regains its health before they can attack. Raikou also has the option of reducing its Speed EVs in order to prevent faster foes such as opposing Raikou with maximum Speed from phazing it, even while it's asleep, as phazing moves require the user to move second in order to work. However, this leaves it at risk of losing to foes like Starmie with Nightmare, which it would usually perform well against due to having equal Speed. It's also worth noting that while the EVs listed will allow Raikou to outspeed Gengar, they will have equal Speed when they're both paralyzed.</p> <p>Raikou is, without a doubt, the best offensive phazer in OU. With Spikes support, it will easily rack up damage from forced switches and offensive pressure. Cloyster makes a great partner since it has Spikes, super effective STAB against most Ground-types, high Defense, and Explosion to open holes in the opponent's team. Forretress is a less solid teammate because of its inability to check Ground-types, but it is better geared towards providing long-term Spikes support for Raikou. Both Skarmory and Suicune are excellent phazing partners. Skarmory will cover Raikou's Ground weakness, while Raikou can absorb powerful Electric attacks, such as Thunder, aimed at Skarmory. Skarmory's high Defense and ability to wall Snorlax complements Raikou's strong special bulk and ability to damage some of Skarmory's key checks, namely Zapdos. Suicune offers great mixed bulk and long-term recovery. Raikou, Suicune, and Skarmory form a potent defensive combo that few OU threats will be able to break. Because of its high Speed, Raikou is vulnerable to status, especially paralysis. Without Sleep Talk, it will really appreciate Heal Bell support to remove sleep from Rest. Miltank is arguably the best choice as a Heal Bell user, since it boasts high Defense and instant recovery in Milk Drink.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With its excellent base 115 Speed, Raikou is the second fastest Pokemon in OU behind Jolteon. This means that Raikou will almost always have a chance to hammer the opponent before they can fire back. Incredibly fast recovery in Rest and the ability to continue attacking opponents with Thunder once asleep make Raikou a potent tank. Rather than phazing common special threats such as Zapdos, Gengar, Growth Vaporeon, and Exeggutor this set aims to abuse Raikou's great tanking ability. This Raikou set will also prevent Skarmory, Starmie, and Suicune from phazing, or Rapid Spinning in Starmie's case. Switching into this set can be deadly as Raikou can hit the opponent very hard twice before they can even move. The difference between using Thunder or Thunderbolt comes down to the classic argument of accuracy versus raw power. Thunderbolt will provide more consistency but Thunder will provide the power necessary to muscle through opposing tanks such as Zapdos. The paralysis chance from Thunder is beneficial in general, but its low accuracy and PP are a pain, especially in longer matches. Hidden Power Ice and Water are both great options for this set. Hidden Power Ice provides super effective coverage against Exeggutor, Ground-types, and Dragonite. However, Hidden Power Water will hit certain Ground-types such as Steelix and Rhydon much harder. One side note regarding Hidden Power Water—the IV drop from using Water over Ice will cause many moves to KO Raikou more often and more quickly than if it used Hidden Power Ice. For example, with Hidden Power Water, Raikou will almost always be OHKOed by Gengar's Explosion, while Tyranitar's Rock Slide will go from a 4HKO to a 3HKO.</p> <p>Raikou is a powerful tank, but there are a few threats that it will have trouble breaking, namely Snorlax, Quagsire, and Steelix. Skarmory makes a great Snorlax check and has the added benefit of providing physically defensive synergy with Raikou. Skarmory will check Snorlax with its ever-useful Whirlwind, while Suicune will provide additional phazing support against any pesky Ground-types. Not only does Exeggutor resist Earthquake, but it also threatens most Ground-types, including Quagsire, with STAB Giga Drain. The paralysis rate from Thunder can help out slower attackers such as Marowak and Rhydon. Physical threats such as these will also give Raikou's team an option against opposing Raikou and Blissey. Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress is also nice, as the additional damage from Spikes against threats like Exeggutor and Ground-types is very welcome.</p> "

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Entei's main function in GSC is to break through the opposing team's defenses with its powerful sun-boosted Fire Blast and complementary Solar Beam. Unlike its more powerful Fire-type competitor Moltres, Entei is quite bulky, has no Electric weakness, and has base 100 Speed, which makes it possible for it to defeat Zapdos and Raikou, two of the best Pokemon in the tier. Unfortunately, even with sun up, Entei fails to land the crucial guaranteed 3HKO on Snorlax that Moltres can achieve. Additionally, Moltres's immunity to Ground gives it a chance to defeat Nidoking and allows it to destroy most Steelix sets, whereas Entei struggles to switch in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A RestTalk set with Rest / Sleep Talk / Sunny Day / Fire Blast can function as a durable attacker that performs as an excellent answer to Gengar, Exeggutor, and Jynx due to not fearing status from them, and it can separate itself from Moltres with its better bulk and Electric neutrality, letting Entei have a better time against Electric-types. However, Moltres still mostly outclasses this set due to its significantly higher Special Attack which lets it 3HKO Snorlax under sun, as well its Ground immunity which gives it immunity to Spikes and allows it to handle Ground-types better. Additionally, this set's lack of coverage makes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar, Vaporeon, and Rhydon significantly more dangerous.</p> <p>Roar can replace Hidden Power Fighting to allow Entei to gradually wear down its counters with Spikes support, and it is especially useful if the opponent has many Fire-weak Pokemon on the same team.  Unfortunately, Roar has poor synergy with Sunny Day, and the removal of Hidden Power Fighting makes it more difficult to take down Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Houndoom. Entei's Fire typing also lacks useful resistances and gives it weaknesses to common types in Ground and Water, so it's not a very good user of Roar despite its good bulk. Entei can use Charcoal to usually 3HKO Snorlax with sun-boosted Fire Blast, but losing Leftovers recovery means Entei becomes less durable; notably, it is 2HKOed by Zapdos's Thunder after Spikes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax's incredible HP and great Special Defense leave Entei incapable of doing any significant damage even under sun, while Curse can make Hidden Power Fighting too weak to threaten Snorlax. Snorlax can also take Entei down with Earthquake or STAB-boosted Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite's great bulk and resistance to all of Entei's coverage moves leave Entei completely incapable of getting past it, and Dragonite can paralyze Entei with Thunder Wave to try to defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: With the notable exception of Cloyster, Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, Thunder Wave Starmie, and Tentacruel pose serious threats to Entei. Vaporeon can heal any damage taken with Rest and use Entei as setup fodder. However, Entei can still possibly take down Vaporeon with Solar Beam, especially if Vaporeon switches in on Sunny Day and is asleep. Tentacruel is similar to Vaporeon in that it is able to use Entei as setup fodder, but it is especially notable in that it is neutral to Solar Beam and resists Hidden Power Fighting, which leaves Entei completely incapable of doing anything to it. Starmie can paralyze Entei with Thunder Wave and stall out sun turns with Recover. If sun has not been set up, Quagsire can threaten Entei with its STAB-boosted Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Marowak and Nidoking can switch in on Sunny Day, survive a sun-boosted Fire Blast, and threaten to maim Entei with Earthquake. Specifically, Marowak has a high chance to OHKO it, and Nidoking can 2HKO it. Nidoking is notable in that it has Lovely Kiss to put Entei to sleep, letting it easily beat Entei. If sun has not been set up or Entei does not have Solar Beam, Rhydon and Golem will crush it, since they resist Fire Blast and take little from Hidden Power Fighting. If sun has been set up, however, Solar Beam easily dispatches the two.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Status Spreaders: Bulky Pokemon with status-inducing moves such as Blissey, Suicune, Umbreon, and Porygon2 can easily stall out both Entei and Sunny Day. Specifically, Blissey, Umbreon, and Suicune can use Toxic against Entei and then heal off damage, although Suicune and Blissey are likely to be 3HKOed by Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fighting, so they aren't completely consistent. Moonlight Umbreon is notable in that its recovery move is strengthened by Sunny Day, which makes it easier for it to wall Entei. Porygon2 can use Thunder Wave to paralyze Entei and stall it out with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Charizard and Moltres: Charizard and Moltres resist Fire Blast along with all of Entei's coverage. Charizard can take Entei down with Earthquake, and Moltres outdamages Entei and often runs RestTalk. These Pokemon can also take advantage of sun if Entei sets it up.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Sunny Day",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Sunny Day boosts the power of Fire Blast and allows Solar Beam to charge instantly while weakening Water-type attacks and lowering the accuracy of Thunder to 50%, giving Entei the advantage against Zapdos and Raikou. Fire Blast hits common threats like Exeggutor, Steelix, Forretress, and Jynx. Solar Beam beats Pokemon like Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire that would otherwise wall Entei while usually 3HKOing Water-types, which gives it a better matchup against them than Moltres. Hidden Power Fighting has a very high chance of 2HKOing Tyranitar and a decent chance of 4HKOing Snorlax, which means if the latter is forced to Rest without a Curse boost and doesn't have Sleep Talk, it can't safely burn sleep turns against Entei because it risks eventually being taken out by a critical hit.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Exeggutor is a good partner for its Ground and Water resistances and lack of weakness to Rock. Exeggutor can also spread status and use Explosion on threats Entei dislikes such as Snorlax and Water-types. Spikes support is very useful for Entei, as it helps compensate for its somewhat underwhelming damage output; thus, Cloyster and Forretress are valuable teammates. Raikou and Snorlax are helpful if Entei is against a Water- or Electric-type without sun up, as they are bulky enough to switch into many Water- or Electric-type Pokemon and take them down with STAB or coverage attacks. Machamp, especially Fire Blast variants, forms a good offensive core with Entei, as sun helps Machamp with many of its typical checks such as Zapdos, Suicune, Starmie without Psychic, Heracross, and Skarmory, and Machamp can also check Snorlax and Tyranitar and lure in Pokemon like Skarmory and Exeggutor so Entei can set up sun. Nidoking can lure in Entei's checks such as Zapdos, Snorlax, and Water-types and put them to sleep with Lovely Kiss or take away their Leftovers with Thief so they become less reliable in checking Entei; most notably, Snorlax has a harder time checking Entei if it has been put to sleep or has its Leftovers taken away. Nidoking is also a solid check to Tyranitar if it's not running Earthquake or much less common coverage moves like Surf and Ice Beam. Other Fire-types like Charizard, Houndoom, and Moltres greatly appreciate Entei's ability to set up sun, since it boosts their Fire-type STAB moves, and Entei can help overwhelm checks they have in common.</p> "

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is definitely a utilitarian, defensive tank. No physical weaknesses and only one glaring special weakness (Electric) grants it the ability to switch in on a lot of different attackers and Roar them out before they can set up and get rolling. Suicune is a Pokemon that benefits immensely from Spikes support; since it walls so many things, and is hurt by relatively few, it forces a lot of switches. Coupled with Roar, this can turn into two switches per turn, which means two Pokemon hit with Spikes (and hopefully poison) damage, and the forced switch with Roar could pull out something that needs to switch again.</p> <p>Suicune requires a lot of patience to use since it is such a tank and doesn't have the ability to take out a lot of Pokemon on its own. Recognize its role as a team player, however, and you'll find that Suicune's abilities are excellent on stall teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mirror Coat is always there, but keep in mind that, like Counter, you really only have one shot at using it. However, the ability to completely flip the tables on your opponent by taking out their Zapdos or Raikou is amazing, and surprises like that can easily win a match.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Suicune has solid defenses all-around, so it is hard to kill with a few hits. Your best bet would be Zapdos or Raikou, who hit it super effectively and will probably force it to switch out. Snorlax and Tentacruel always run the risk of being phazed out, but assuming they are not, they will beat Suicune one-on-one. Blissey can stall Suicune for a while, but fails to achieve much else. Keep in mind that while not a lot can do major harm to Suicune, Suicune itself rarely possesses the offense to take down something one-on-one, so if your opponent starts trying to stall Suicune out, use that information to make a good switch next time. Also, poisoning Suicune can be effective, as it needs its Leftovers every turn to retain its walling abilities.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Suicune isn't a complicated Pokemon, but that doesn't mean that it's not useful. This is the oft-seen phazing set, and it's generally easy to get Suicune in on either another Water-type or something that can't seriously harm it right off the bat; think Pokemon like Skarmory and Steelix. From there you can opt to just attack with Surf, but it's important to keep in mind that attacking isn't Suicune's primary purpose. In fact, you'll find that Surf is often the least-used move on this set, as Suicune's walling abilities are used to force switches.</p> <p>This is where Toxic and Roar come in handy. Since Suicune lacks attacking power, Toxic is used here to spread status and chip away at the opponents that will try and switch in to it. When you feel that status has been spread enough, it's time to start forcing as many more switches as you can with Roar, which helps to rack up poison damage. This strategy can be absolutely brutal if you can reliably get Spikes down, so strongly consider incorporating them if you have Suicune on your team.</p> "

Though Suicune's Ice Beam isn't extremely powerful, it's useful enough to guard against threats like Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Dragonite from getting a worry-free switch in. The downside to this set, however, is the free switch ins it does provide for Pokemon like Snorlax, Starmie, and Raikou, so keep in mind that you could also use this to bait these kinds of switch-ins and use them to your advantage.</p> "}

  "Raticate": {

I will admit, Raticate sees almost zero playing time because it's quite frankly not all that good. Its typing is not unique (in fact it is one of the most common), all of its stats are really subpar or borderline average, and its movepool isn't exactly something to drool over when compared to others on Pokemon with better stats. However, there is hope for this cool-looking rodent yet. Super Fang puts huge dents all over the place, which is hard to do with UU teams that go up against OU teams. Raticate makes a decent UU lead with its Speed, and it can steal fun stuff like Spikes and Sleep Powder with Mimic. It's definitely not the best Normal-type of the bunch, but it is somewhat cool and usually very unexpected. Plus it can always wave around the fact that it can 2HKO Blissey.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>You can also generalize Raticate a bit more and follow the format of Super Fang; a STAB move of choice such as Return, Frustration, or Double-Edge; Shadow Ball; and filler that works with the moves above. You can always use Hyper Beam after Raticate strips the foe of half its health with Super Fang, but don't really expect a guaranteed OHKO. An Endure + Reversal set isn't promising, but it's there for its other options. Thief, Toxic, and Screech give Raticate that element of surprise, but just using Raticate is already surprising, and Super Fang is a much bigger hindrance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There's so many, to be honest–Raticate's weak defensive stats make anything an easy kill. Any strong attacker hits Raticate hard. The move Counter is always something fun to use against Raticate... Pokemon like Nidoking can't OHKO Raticate with Earthquake, but they can if they use Counter after Raticate's Super Fang.</p> ",

Raticate has a lot of Speed, so on the first turn it can come out and set up a Substitute against certain other leads.

If Raticate just avoided a Toxic or Thunder Wave, or better yet a Sleep Powder, while setting up Substitute, throw that status move right back at the foe with Mimic. Body Slam is on the set because Speed is important when toying around with Substitute, and there are a lot of threats out there just barely faster than Raticate with its annoying base 97 Speed.</p> "}]

Once its Attack is boosted, Sandslash can do some decent damage to many of the slow, tankish Pokemon that are often played in GSC. With paralysis support, this thing does usually pretty well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam is a great option over Substitute since it provides the added paralysis that Sandslash usually needs to sweep teams and beat Water-types like Starmie. Sand Attack is an option for annoyance purposes against walls like Skarmory who will attempt to Whirlwind Sandslash out. Counter is a cool move since it works on all types of Hidden Power, so a sweeper like Hidden Power Zapdos can get Countered for the KO since Sandslash has enough Special Defense to take the blow and still be usable. Sandslash could use Hidden Power Bug for Grass-types, but the hit would have to be on the switch. Sandslash can make some use of Rapid Spin but there are generally better Pokemon for this role.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Water-types, such as Quagsire, have good Defense with which to take Earthquake, and while Sandslash's Defense is great, its Special Defense is not. A strong Surf or Ice Beam will knock it out quickly. Grass-types like Meganium and Tangela are resistant to Earthquake and can also reply with super effective attacks.

Roar is kind of stupid with all that Speed and no real defenses to speak of behind it, but if you need a UU phazer it can do that. Thief is of note because Persian is so fast. Using Curse is always nice, but it ruins Persian's only great stat, and Bubble Beam will really nail a Rhydon coming in and is RBY nostalgia as well. Persian can utilize Charm against Curse users, but unless Persian has Roar, it has nothing to take out their high Defense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Rock and Steel Pokemon that aren't weak to Electric wall Persian badly, as do Gengar and Misdreavus as long as Persian doesn't have Shadow Ball. RestTalk Pokemon such as Zapdos and Raikou, the latter of which ties in Speed with Persian, will stop Persian's most crippling move, Hypnosis. It has weak defenses, so many decently strong attacks will 2-3HKO it.</p> ",

Taking advantage of paralyzing status effects to impair faster Pokemon will make Primeape all the more devastating. It's able clean house with the best of them during the late stages of a match due to its high Attack and stat enhancement options. Keep Primeape a secret if at all possible, because unless the opponent has certain Pokemon, Primeape cannot be completely shut down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam is a great option over Rock Slide if you are willing to sacrifice type coverage for a physical attack that paralyzes. Counter is pretty tempting if you're struggling against Skarmory and Zapdos, but requires a good deal of prediction capability seeing as Skarmory does so much more than attack physically and Zapdos is almost as effective using Thunderbolt in the same situation. Thunder will hit Skarmory hard and has a long shot at paralyzing Starmie, but Primeape's Special Attack is lacking, so while the surprise is effective the impact may be lessened. You can also use Screech if forcing switches plays into your game, such as on a Spikes team, but for the best individual performance Meditate is more useful. All of those moves are viable options despite their drawbacks; it just depends on the rest of the team and the style of play one uses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Nidoking and Nidoqueen are natural counters to most Primeape sets, as their typing allows them to shrug off Fighting, Rock, and Bug moves. In UU, Primeape will also have a lot of problems with Gligar. Faster Psychic-types cripple Primeape before it even gets a chance to move, not allowing it to set up at all. Tentacruel's resistance to Fighting-type moves along with being faster than Primeape will end most hopes of sweeping. Primeape has major problems with Skarmory and Heracross, but they can both be overcome by boosting with Meditate late-game while they switch in.

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>With Snorlax being the king of GSC, Machamp seems like a pretty good idea given its mighty Fighting STAB. However, it takes as much as 49% switching into Snorlax's Double-Edge, making it a shaky check for the big lug. However, while Machamp is a shaky Snorlax check, on offense it's a monster -- half of the Pokemon on most teams are weak to Fighting-type attacks, severely limiting what can switch into Machamp. Furthermore, a few teams do not even have a Fighting resist, allowing Machamp to steamroll these teams when it comes across them if it manages to OHKO Skarmory with a +1 critical hit Cross Chop. Cross Chop has a 20% critical hit rate after factoring accuracy, so going for the critical hit is a viable strategy and not just a pipe dream. Machamp also has decent 90 / 80 / 85 defenses, allowing an all-out attacker much more leeway to switch in than the similar Marowak, and permitting the use of a more defensive RestTalk set to tank mixed sweepers. Machamp does have its flaws, though. Its low Speed, Spikes vulnerability, lack of useful resistances, and good-but-not-great defenses make it extremely vulnerable to simply being beat down upon, and it's also often the victim of bad luck and PP issues thanks to Cross Chop's 80% accuracy, meager 8 PP, and dependence on the critical hit to break walls such as Skarmory.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Earthquake or Body Slam over one of the coverage options on the Curse sweeper set is a possibility, but generally an inferior possibility because it deprives Machamp of crucial coverage against either the ultra-common Zapdos or Exeggutor. In addition, the Curse sweeper could also ditch one of the coverage moves in favor of Rest to permit it to setup, break a wall, then Rest off damage and status for later carnage, but this is not recommended without Heal Bell support as Machamp is dead weight while asleep. Counter, too, is a good option for Machamp, but honestly it's only really viable on the all-out attacker set as, again, the Curse sweeper relies on its specific coverage moves to get past common threats. Counter allows Machamp to KO Skarmory or even Zapdos going for the Drill Peck, and also punishes foes such as Nidoking and Heracross trying to wear Machamp down with Earthquake and Seismic Toss, respectively. However, while Counter can catch these foes off guard, Machamp's vast attacking movepool, excellent Fighting STAB, and huge 358 Attack stat mean that it's usually better off using an attacking move to maximize coverage rather than waiting to catch something off guard with Counter. Meditate is an interesting option over Curse on the Curse sweeper set to allow Machamp the opportunity to boost its Attack without lowering its Speed. Generally, the extra Defense from Curse is preferred to allow Machamp to tank Drill Pecks from Skarmory and Double-Edges from Snorlax as it attacks, but not suffering a Speed drop can be useful if Machamp is being passed Agility boosts or for preserving the Speed tie against Exeggutor and allowing Machamp to OHKO with a +1 Hidden Power Bug with a 50% chance of not having to take a Psychic in return. Hidden Power Rock can be used over Rock Slide if Machamp isn't using an anti-Psychic Hidden Power. Hidden Power's perfect accuracy can be preferred over Rock Slide's 90% accuracy, whereas Rock Slide is not likely to be flinching anything relevant. A particularly interesting, but generally not very effective, gimmick would be the use of Berserk Gene over Leftovers on the all-out attacking set. The +2 Attack boost without setup can sometimes catch opponents off guard, and if Machamp gets lucky and consistently hits past confusion it can quickly take one or two Pokemon down with it before it succumbs to confusion damage and damage sustained from attacks by faster foes. However, Berserk Gene gives Machamp one shot at making a difference, as once Machamp is switched out, Berserk Gene is consumed, leaving Machamp a regular all-out attacker but with much less longevity thanks to the lack of Leftovers. Furthermore, the 50% likelihood during any given turn of simply having Machamp smack itself for non-trivial damage makes Berserk Gene a very high-risk item that generally isn't worth it. Along the lines of gimmicks that generally aren't worth it, Vital Throw and Light Screen fall into this category. Vital Throw is often prized for its -1 priority, thereby preventing Machamp from being phazed after a Curse. The problem is that Vital Throw is so very weak compared to Cross Chop's raw power, and the phaze immunity hardly matters to Machamp as most phazers aren't able to safely phaze with the threat of a +1 Cross Chop looming over them. In addition, Vital Throw's negative priority can screw Machamp over if it needs to outspeed Snorlax (e.g., after a Belly Drum) and KO it with its STAB Fighting move. Light Screen, on the other hand, is often seen as a good move as the biggest threats to a Machamp sweep are STAB Psychic users and accumulated damage from STAB Surfs and Thunders. However, giving up a coverage move on Machamp itself is not a good way to set up Light Screen for Machamp, as it reduces the impact of Machamp once it does get a Light Screen boost. Rather, Light Screen is best used by a teammate, such as Blissey or Zapdos, to permit Machamp the best use of its attacking movepool while still enabling it to tank Psychics and other powerful special moves when a teammate pseudo-passes Light Screen to it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Starmie is widely considered the most dependable check to Machamp, and for good reason. It resists Cross Chop, avoids being 2HKOed by an unboosted Hidden Power, and can 2HKO back with Psychic. Of course, without Psychic, Starmie risks having RestTalk Machamp set up on it, as Surf is only a 4HKO, and also risks being KOed by any Machamp with Curse and Hidden Power; after a single Curse, Machamp 2HKOs Starmie without a defense boost, and after 3 Curses, which Machamp can easily set up in the face of Starmie's Surf, Machamp can 2HKO even Starmie behind a Reflect. Exeggutor is also a prime Machamp check, being able to switch in easily on a Cross Chop or Curse and 2HKO with Psychic. However, Exeggutor must be wary of Hidden Power Bug, which 2HKOes without a Curse boost and OHKOes after Machamp uses Curse. Zapdos is another Pokemon that acts as a soft check to Machamp; it 3HKOes with Thunder or Thunderbolt and resists Cross Chop, although most Machamp carry Rock Slide specifically for Zapdos and will be able to 2HKO after a Curse boost. Suicune can repeatedly smack Machamp with Surf for the 4HKO; this isn't enough to guarantee Machamp is killed before it is able to kill Suicune in return though, because Suicune is 3HKOed by non-critical hit Cross Chop, it will usually be enough to weaken Machamp to where it won't be able to accomplish anything else after killing Suicune, and might be enough to flat out beat Machamp if Cross Chop misses. All-out attacking Machamp is walled much harder by Suicune, as it fails to be 3HKOed by an unboosted Cross Chop, whereas RestTalk Machamp will outright beat any Suicune without Roar due to its ability to use Rest to restore health lost to Surf. Skarmory is another check that works well against non-Fire Blast Machamp; it can use Curse to match Machamp's boosts and threaten to 3HKO in return with STAB Drill Peck. Critical hit Cross Chops or the uncommon Fire Blast can beat it, though. The observant should notice a pattern with these checks: Machamp has some way of beating them all. Still, all of these checks can go up against Machamp well enough to ensure, at the very least, Machamp is too crippled to do more than break that one check, and at best, they abuse Machamp's propensity to beat itself with Cross Chop's low accuracy and PP.</p> <p>Machamp also has a few other checks that are more situational and less common than those listed above. Most Machamp do not use Earthquake because it's generally a poor coverage move to run alongside Cross Chop, which is excellent news for Muk as a Machamp counter. Without Earthquake, Machamp really has no way of getting past Muk, as Muk can match Machamp's attempts to Curse up and beat it while being able to deal heavy damage to Machamp with STAB Sludge Bomb. Heracross makes a solid check to Machamp as well. It resists Cross Chop, Machamp rarely has a coverage move specifically for dealing heavy damage to Heracross, and Heracross can slowly but surely 5HKO Machamp with Seismic Toss, or use Curse to match Machamp's boosts. Curse Heracross, unlike Seismic Toss variants, can also wall Sleep Talk Machamp and out-PP it thanks to Cross Chop's meager 8 PP. Fire Blast Machamp threatens to 3HKO Heracross, though, but Fire Blast, much like Cross Chop, is fairly easy to stall out of PP. Nidoking and Tentacruel can also check non-Earthquake Machamp to an extent by virtue of their Poison typing, the former being able to use Lovely Kiss to incapacitate Machamp and the latter being able to outpace Curse's defense boosts with Swords Dance. Machamp ultimately beats both of these threats with enough Curse boosts in spite of their ability to resist Cross Chop, rendering RestTalk Machamp thoroughly uncheckable by these particular Poison-types. However, while RestTalk Machamp gets credit for matching up well against Heracross and non-Cursing Poison-types, the fact that it can only attack using Cross Chop renders it incapable of touching Ghost-types entirely. Machamp can't afford to PP stall Gengar, as Cross Chop has terrible PP, and Gengar can always play for the freeze with Ice Punch or kill Machamp with a timely critical hit Thunderbolt. Misdreavus, on the other hand, immediately forces Machamp to switch out. In addition to hardwalling RestTalk Machamp, Ghosts are also good checks to Machamp variants lacking Earthquake or Hidden Power Ghost, as Machamp can only 3HKO with Rock Slide after a Curse boost, whereas Gengar can severely wear Machamp down with Thunderbolts and a full-health Misdreavus needs to be 2HKOed to guarantee that it fails to kill Machamp with Perish Trap. Meganium makes another uncommon but effective Machamp check. Behind Reflect, with Leech Seed sapping Machamp's health, and with Synthesis to provide instant healing, Meganium acts to thoroughly outstall Machamp. Slowbro rounds out the list of uncommon checks, but it certainly is a good one; it can use Growl or Reflect to neutralize Curse variants, or threaten to outright kill Machamp with Psychic. Its reliance on Rest for recovery coupled with its Hidden Power weakness can render it beatable by Machamp, though.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>Machamp is one of GSC's deadliest attacking threats, mostly thanks to its 358 Attack-backed STAB Cross Chop. Cross Chop is not only an incredibly useful Fighting-type STAB move, which is super effective or at least neutral against most of GSC's big players, but it also has a 20% critical hit rate after factoring accuracy, adding to its already devastating strength. Curse is what really allows this Machamp set to shine, as after a Curse boost, Cross Chop is able to OHKO even the vaunted Skarmory with a critical hit. As a pure physical attacker, being able to kill Skarmory, much less in one hit, is an impressive feat indeed. Furthermore, even though it's a Curse sweeper, Charm Umbreon and Growl Miltank can't just switch in to stall it thanks to its super effective Fighting-type STAB. A few teams fail to carry a Fighting resist; for these teams, Skarmory is often all they have to attempt to wall Machamp, and Skarmory will die if it gets hit by a boosted critical hit Cross Chop, forcing the team to crumble shortly thereafter.</p> <p>Of course, there are several common Fighting-type resisting Pokemon that can step in to serve as more capable Machamp walls. Even then, though, Machamp gets a slew of coverage moves to handle them. Rock Slide 2HKOs the ever-present Zapdos after a Curse boost, whereas the choice of Hidden Power is able to 2HKO other defensive threats. An unboosted Hidden Power Bug 2HKOs the common Exeggutor. An unboosted Hidden Power Ghost on the other hand is able to 2HKO the Ghost-types on average while still retaining the ability to 3HKO Exeggutor. Hidden Power Bug is usually preferred because Exeggutor directly forces Machamp to switch out with its STAB Psychic whereas Ghost-types still take a lot of damage from Curse-boosted Rock Slides and can't threaten direct damage to Machamp to force it out easily. Regardless of which Hidden Power is chosen, they both also give Machamp some recourse against its number one check: Starmie. Starmie without Reflect are 2HKOed by Hidden Power after a Curse boost, and Reflect variants are 2HKOed after three Curse boosts, which are easily obtainable without taking too much damage from Surf if Machamp Curses on the turns that Starmie switches in and uses Reflect. Thanks to the combination of Curse and Hidden Power, in addition to the fact that Starmie's Surf only 4HKOes Machamp, Starmie needs to run Psychic to consistently scare Machamp into switching out with the threat of the 2HKO, and even then Machamp can still kill a weakened Starmie (62-73% health) with a Curse-boosted Hidden Power while being able to tank a single STAB Psychic with plenty of health to spare. Even considering all of this, though, Machamp could simply rely on its team to clear out Starmie for it and instead use Fire Blast in the last slot, which handily 3HKOes Exeggutor and allows Machamp to easily KO Skarmory without burning through precious Cross Chop PP attempting to score the critical hit.</p> <p>Machamp's ability to tank hits, especially STAB Water-type attacks, constitutes one of its main selling points over the similar Swords Dance Marowak (the other being the raw wallbreaking potential of a boosted critical hit Cross Chop). However, while Machamp has an easier time setting up because of its ability to take hits, it shouldn't be switching into attacks very often, as if it does, its lack of resistances or a recovery move means that it will simply be worn down without being able to use that extra bulk to set up. Because of this, it needs to be played similarly to Marowak in that it needs to be switched in judiciously on predicted non-attacking turns on the opponent's part, preferably on predicted switches to Snorlax to nab a free turn to set up Curses or predict switches to Exeggutor as the opponent will undoubtedly switch out to avoid taking the possible STAB Cross Chop. However, while Machamp isn't immediately forced out by anything with an attacking move and a modicum of Defense the way Marowak is, it does rely on a much less accurate, less reliable, and more PP-starved STAB move than Marowak does. Indeed, as often as Cross Chop can win games by breaking key walls with timely critical hits, it can also disappoint with untimely misses, forcing Machamp to become worn down without accomplishing anything on the offensive, even if played perfectly.</p> <p>Curse sweeping Machamp, much like Swords Dance Marowak, loves plenty of support to help it get in position to break walls. Paralysis is first and foremost the biggest assistance to this Machamp. A paralyzed Skarmory is unable to use Curse after switching in on Machamp's Curse, rendering it unable to stall out Machamp's Cross Chop PP as it attempts to score a critical hit. Furthermore, paralyzed Umbreon cannot switch in on a turn that Machamp uses Curse to neutralize Machamp by setting its Attack stage to -1; Machamp can't afford to waste Cross Chops on turns when its Attack stage is so low, as even against Umbreon, which takes super effective damage, a -1 Cross Chop fails to 2HKO without a critical hit. In general, paralysis is great even against the foes Machamp is supposed to set up against and beat; it prevents Machamp from being worn down every turn that it chooses to attack, and can transform the possible Cross Chop miss from a potential sweep-ender to a minor inconvenience. Some of the better paralysis-spreading partners for Machamp include Stun Spore Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, Thunder Wave Zapdos, and Body Slam Snorlax.</p> <p>Other support that is appreciated by Machamp includes Pokemon that can bait its counters to switch into Explosions. Cloyster is probably the best at this, as it can bait Starmie in to spin away its Spikes, only to subsequently Explode on it and free up Machamp to rampage. Exeggutor and Steelix often end up catching foes such as Zapdos and Suicune that can otherwise wear Machamp down with their STAB special attacks. Machamp usually beats these foes if it Curses on the turn that they switch in, but it takes a lot of damage in the process, so being rid of the likes of Zapdos and Suicune beforehand is a great help to Machamp's sweeping efforts. Further support includes Pursuit users. Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom are all adept at catching Exeggutor, which otherwise causes Machamp problems by forcing it out with STAB Psychic. They are also all good at forcing Ghost-types to take residual damage to put them in +1 Rock Slide 2HKO range if Machamp opts for Hidden Power Bug over Hidden Power Ghost. Furthermore, Tyranitar can severely weaken Zapdos with Pursuits on the switch out, whereas Umbreon can use the combination of Toxic and Pursuit to force Starmie into +1 Hidden Power OHKO range before it can switch in to combat Machamp. Finally, Rapid Spin support from Starmie can be a great help to give Machamp more leeway to predict opportunities to switch in. However, it's not absolutely necessary for Machamp, as it can often restore the health lost to Spikes with Leftovers as it stays in to set up, whereas other heavy-hitters such as Marowak and Rhydon need Rapid Spin support much more because they are usually limited to using one attack before being forced to switch out.</p> <p>While this Machamp is well-tailored to take on its most common checks, there are still a few things it will struggle mightily to get past. Nidoking resists everything it has except for the weak Hidden Power Ghost, although its offensive nature means that it lacks a recovery move itself, and its moderate attacking stats mean that it won't be able to do much damage to Machamp in return, thereby allowing Machamp to set up fairly safely against Nidoking unless it has yet to use Lovely Kiss. Heracross poses a bigger problem to Machamp; it resists Cross Chop and can either Curse up alongside Machamp or wear it down with Seismic Toss. A +2 Rock Slide will 3HKO an unboosted Heracross, though, as will an unboosted Fire Blast should Machamp be using it, so Seismic Toss will not KO Machamp in time if it Curses on the switch unless Heracross gets lucky and consistently hits Rest and Seismic Toss with Sleep Talk at critical moments. Muk is probably the toughest thing for Machamp to deal with, as it resists Cross Chop, Curses up alongside Machamp, and can dish out heavy damage in return with Sludge Bomb. However, Muk is usually on a suicide mission and often uses Explosion to take itself out of commission, thereby effectively dealing with itself to allow Machamp an opportunity to sweep. These threats are far less common and effective as Machamp checks than the likes of Zapdos and Exeggutor, and as a result, using moves such as Earthquake and Fire Blast to deal with these threats is rare and generally not worth the trouble.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Pure Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This Machamp gives up the ability to set up with Curse in return for more coverage. While being able to set up Curse is helpful for beating the likes of Suicune and weakened Starmie, in most cases Machamp doesn't even need to set up to threaten major damage against most threats, and the extra moveslot gives Machamp another coverage move to help it beat what it normally couldn't. Cross Chop is the obvious STAB move, running off of Machamp's ludicrous Attack stat, having a high critical hit rate for breaking walls, and having a great STAB typing for hitting half of most teams for super effective damage. However, not having Curse to boost its power means that Machamp must waste a lot of Cross Chop's PP looking for the critical hit if it's beating Suicune or Skarmory with it. Rock Slide is another non-negotiable moveslot, as it guarantees a 3HKO on Zapdos, something that otherwise walls Machamp entirely. The other two moveslots ultimately depend on what threats you want Machamp to be able to handle. Earthquake is an excellent move that isn't usually considered a good coverage move alongside Fighting STAB. However, it does hit Poison- and Ghost-type switch-ins hard, and it's a 100% accurate 100 Base Power move that helps to preserve Cross Chop's PP against Ground-weak foes and that ensures low-health foes can be finished off. Body Slam could also be used to paralyze Starmie switch-ins, which otherwise walls Machamp completely and is very adept at avoiding paralysis. The last moveslot depends further on what Machamp wants to be able to hurt. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move, as it preserves Cross Chops against Steel-types (most notably Skarmory), and can also be used to handily 3HKO Exeggutor and to 3HKO Heracross on average. Using one of the Hidden Powers in this slot is also an option; Hidden Power Bug 2HKOs Exeggutor switch-ins, whereas Hidden Power Ghost can 2HKO Ghost-types if Earthquake is foregone for Body Slam. If Body Slam is used as the third move, using Hidden Power in the last slot allows Machamp to both paralyze and KO Starmie on its own, which other sets cannot accomplish.</p> <p>As always, Cross Chop can be very annoying with its unreliable accuracy and meager 8 PP. However, Machamp sporting Earthquake and Fire Blast can preserve its Cross Chop PP in many situations, including against Steel-types and Raikou, and Earthquake also allows Machamp to finish off low-health foes with a reliable 100% accurate move that, unlike Hidden Power, is actually strong enough to ensure reasonable KOs. As a result, all-out attacking Machamp isn't as dependent on the use of Cross Chop as other Machamp variants are, although it is still just as likely to miss against Snorlax in a critical moment to lead to Machamp being KOed by Double-Edge as it is to score the timely critical hit to KO Suicune. Also, like the Curse sweeper, this Machamp needs to be played cautiously to ensure it doesn't take too much damage on the switch in. All-out attacking Machamp is more of a hit-and-run type of Pokemon than it is a set-up-and-sweep Pokemon, so it isn't as desperate to be at full health to ensure it can set up. Regardless, it's still slow and doesn't have any resistances to common attacks, so it can be quite an easy task to wear down Machamp before it can break anything if one isn't judicious about when Machamp is switched in. This means no switching Machamp directly into Snorlax's STAB moves, but rather switching Machamp into predicted Snorlax switch-ins.</p> <p>This Machamp, while less impactful on offense, is more self-sufficient and therefore doesn't require as much support to ensure some kind of setup. Its goal is simply to come in, hit something, switch out, then repeat until the opponent's team is dented enough to go for the kill. Still, Machamp's low Speed means that paralysis support from Stun Spore Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Starmie, and Body Slam Snorlax is still extremely appreciated so that Machamp, upon switching in, might be able to force walls such as Zapdos and Suicune to take two hits upon switching in, thereby vastly improving Machamp's ability to KO these walls or to force the opponent to either predict around Machamp or sacrifice a Pokemon to get their wall in safely. Paralysis support also allows Machamp to outspeed Umbreon to prevent it from switching in on a predicted non-Cross Chop turn and subsequently neutralizing Machamp with Charm. In addition, using Explosions to take out Machamp's walls is probably more important for this set than it is for the Curse sweeper, as this Machamp can't just use Curse to muscle its way past threats that resist its attacks. In particular, using Cloyster or even Steelix to Explode on Starmie is key to allowing Machamp to do relevant damage to other Pokemon, especially if it forgoes Body Slam for broader coverage against other threats. Steelix and Exeggutor can help Machamp out by targeting Suicune and Zapdos with Explosion, as they otherwise make life difficult for all-out attacking Machamp. Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom also helps Machamp immensely against Exeggutor, and Tyranitar has the added bonus of being able to chip away at Zapdos. Umbreon is a poor partner for the all-out attacking Machamp set, as it doesn't do enough to Starmie with Pursuit on the switch out to ensure it will be KOed by an unboosted Hidden Power as it switches back into Machamp, not to mention that all-out attacking Machamp might not even be carrying Hidden Power. This set also appreciates Rapid Spin support a lot more than Curse Machamp does, as this Machamp is more of a hit-and-run Pokemon and is therefore not likely to get a lot of Leftovers recovery to restore health lost to Spikes. Having its own Spikes to aid in getting kills is also more appreciated by all-out attacking Machamp, as it's a much more opportunistic killer than the Machamp that sets up with Curse, and Spikes makes it much more likely that walls switching into all-out attacking Machamp are either put into KO range, or are limited to the Spikes-immune Zapdos and Skarmory to ease prediction.</p> "

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<p>Machamp has pretty decent defensive stats to accompany its mammoth Attack and Fighting STAB; this set aims to take advantage of this bulk by using it for longevity and allowing Machamp to act as a mixed wall, rather than simply using it to allow Machamp the leeway to switch in and set up a sweep. This Machamp, thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk, is an excellent Snorlax check, being able to Rest off Double-Edges on the switch, force Snorlax to switch out with the threat of Cross Chop, and be constantly available thanks to Sleep Talk. Sleep Talk also allows Machamp to get around one of its biggest downfalls by conserving Cross Chop PP via PP-free uses of the move with Sleep Talk turns. Curse rounds out the set by allowing Machamp to match Snorlax's Curses and to allow it to Curse up and sweep when Fighting-resisting Pokemon have been cleared out of the way. This Machamp set does not have the coverage options that other sets have, and as such, having Cross Chop as its only attacking move means that it will be unable to touch Ghost-types and will either be beaten or outstalled by Fighting-type resisting Psychic- and Flying-types as well. Still, once these Pokemon are defeated, this Machamp set absolutely ravages opposing teams and cannot be killed very easily in return.</p> <p>RestTalk Machamp is not a purely offensive being; in fact, it's more defensive than offensive by virtue of the many things that wall it. It's bulky enough to avoid being 3HKOed by the big 3 mixed attackers: Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite without Hidden Power Flying (which is most Dragonite). Furthermore, it scares them out with the threat of a Curse-based setup, and manages to, unlike other mixed walls, force Snorlax to switch out by virtue of STAB Cross Chop (and beats last-Pokemon CurseLax to boot). While this set struggles to get past any Fighting-type resisting Pokemon (and is therefore less offensive than other variants), this Machamp can brutalize those few teams that fail to use a Fighting resist because it not only has the ability to set up with Curse and KO walls such as Skarmory with a critical hit Cross Chop, but also the ability to stick around with Rest and Sleep Talk unlike sweeping Machamp sets. Still, though it has incredible offensive setup potential by virtue of its longevity, this Machamp's main selling point is its aforementioned defensive virtues, as a single Ghost-type will render it useless, and any Fighting-type resist should be able to beat it fairly easily.</p> <p>While Sleep Talk does help Cross Chop's PP problems to an extent, it still only has a paltry 8 PP, making it fairly easy to stall out, and it also still has a very unreliable 80% accuracy. Because of this, Machamp usually needs to use a couple of Curses before it begins firing off Cross Chops so that it has enough power to minimize its Cross Chop PP consumption and also to minimize the impact of misses by being able to KO most Pokemon in a single hit. However, Machamp can't start Cursing while Fighting-immune Ghosts or Fighting-resisting special attackers such as Exeggutor or Zapdos are on the field; these foes will either threaten Machamp into switching out or stall Machamp out of Cross Chops. Because of this, this Machamp set appreciates Pursuit support much more than other sets that have coverage moves specifically for beating these threats. Tyranitar, as always, is an excellent partner, being able to Pursuit trap Ghosts and Exeggutor while also being able to chip away at Zapdos. Houndoom also traps Exeggutor and Ghost-types with Pursuit, and Umbreon shines against Exeggutor but can struggle to Pursuit trap Ghost-types because it fails to KO them with Pursuit before Perish trap manages to kill it. Using Explosion with Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Steelix to bait and kill the likes of Starmie and Zapdos is also solid support to wipe out Machamp's checks and clear its way for a sweep. Having paralysis support from the likes of Stun Spore Exeggutor and Body Slam Snorlax is, as with all Machamp sets, very valuable, as Skarmory can safely switch in and match Machamp's Curses otherwise, and Umbreon can switch in on a predicted Curse and Charm Machamp's Attack down to effectively waste any Cross Chops to follow. Additionally, Rapid Spin support is very handy for this Machamp, as it is very slow and lacks good resistances. It normally walls the big 3 mixed attackers because it fails to be 3HKOed by any of them, but it is outsped by all of them and there is no guarantee that it will be able to take Spikes damage on top of two Nidoking Earthquakes or Dragonite Double-Edges as it switches in. Having Spikes cleared means that Machamp is also guaranteed to avoid being 2HKOed by Snorlax's Double-Edge if it manages to mispredict and switch into it, thereby giving Machamp the leeway to switch in and deter Snorlax from setting up.</p> "

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>As a Water-type, Tentacruel distinguishes itself from its competition thanks to its secondary Poison typing and access to Swords Dance and Rapid Spin. With the former move, Tentacruel can act as a dangerous sweeper due to its good Speed and ability to exploit a lot of passive Pokemon like Forretress, Umbreon, and Blissey as well as other Water-types like Vaporeon and especially the omnipresent Cloyster. As a spinner, Tentacruel has a great matchup against the two best Spikes users in the metagame in Cloyster and Forretress thanks to its Toxic immunity and resistances.</p> <p>However, Tentacruel's mediocre offensive stats mean that even with a Swords Dance boost, it fails to 2HKO important Pokemon like Snorlax and Zapdos. Additionally, crippling weaknesses to Electric, Psychic, and Ground mean that you cannot rely on Tentacruel to check the likes of Steelix, Marowak, Nidoking, and Rhydon, something you would typically want from your Water-type. These factors also mean that Tentacruel is plagued with a large number of checks like Raikou, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Starmie. Starmie is also a huge competitor to Tentacruel as a spinner due to its Speed and secondary Psychic typing, which allows it to better deal with common spinblocker Gengar and check Machamp much more effectively. Furthermore, Tentacruel cannot use Swords Dance and Rapid Spin on one set, forcing the player to choose what they feel will be most beneficial.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mirror Coat can be game changing if you successfully pull it off against Zapdos, Raikou, or Gengar, but it is incompatible with both Swords Dance and Rapid Spin. Giga Drain is an option on the Rapid Spin variant to directly threaten Cloyster. Rest can be considered on the Rapid Spin set if you're looking for increased longevity, but using it will grant the opponent an opportunity to create pressure with Spikes, which it is the entire purpose of Rapid Spin Tentacruel to avoid.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Just like almost every Water-type in the metagame, Tentacruel suffers from the popularity of Electric-types like Zapdos, Raikou, and to a lesser extent Jolteon, although their reliance on Thunder to deal with it can bite them if Swords Dance Tentacruel avoids the attack.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Gengar and Misdreavus have a weaker Thunder and aren't as bulky, but they still remain solid answers due to their resistance to Sludge Bomb and immunity to Rapid Spin. However, Misdreavus needs to watch out for Toxic and can fail to take on a Tentacruel that keeps spamming Substitute thanks to its higher Speed and Thunder's poor accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: While not as common, faster Psychic-types like Starmie, Espeon, and Alakazam are big threats to Tentacruel due to their powerful STAB attacks and access to instant recovery. They fear potentially being poisoned by Sludge Bomb or Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Other bulky Pokemon like Snorlax, Miltank, and by a smaller margin Skarmory can interrupt Tentacruel's attempts to sweep. Snorlax is so strong and bulky that Tentacruel will often lose even if Snorlax switches in as it uses Swords Dance, whereas Miltank will not go down quickly and threatens Tentacruel with Body Slam paralysis. Skarmory doesn't care how many Swords Dance boosts Tentacruel has acquired, and it can phaze Tentacruel in exchange for a blow from Tentacruel's Water STAB attack. This is disadvantageous for Skarmory in the long run, but poses difficulties for Tentacruel early on.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Although Tentacruel doesn't look like an offensive threat with such average offensive stats, it's surprisingly one of the most effective Swords Dance users in the metagame, mostly due to the many opportunities it has to set up throughout the match. Substitute makes this task even easier, as it discourages Cloyster and Forretress from using Explosion in front of Tentacruel to trade, prevents Pokemon like Umbreon from using Charm or Growl, and allows Tentacruel to exploit the overuse of Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, Raikou, and Misdreavus due to the move's accuracy. Sludge Bomb is Tentacruel's best physical STAB attack, and the added probability to inflict poison to the opposing Pokemon can prove to be very handy. Hydro Pump is another important STAB attack that deters all of Tyranitar, Steelix, Marowak, Nidoking, Rhydon, Golem, and Piloswine while hitting Skarmory, Gengar, and Misdreavus relatively hard. Surf is an alternative that lacks Hydro Pump's low PP and accuracy, but you'll miss the guaranteed 3HKO on Skarmory, Gengar, and Misdreavus and the 2HKO on Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even though Tentacruel can take advantage of the popularity of Thunder with Substitute, Zapdos and Raikou remain two big annoyances. Hence, Pokemon that can check them like Steelix and Snorlax or bait them in like Exeggutor and Gengar are teammates of choice. Likewise, Gengar and Misdreavus usually pack an Electric move, making the aforementioned Steelix, as well as Pursuit users like Tyranitar, Houndoom, and Umbreon, good partners too; Umbreon also deals nicely with another Tentacruel nemesis in Starmie. Outside of those with a natural typing advantage, Tentacruel's enemies include other bulky Pokemon with the ability to damage it significantly or phaze it such as Snorlax, Skarmory, Miltank, and Roar Suicune. Therefore, Pokemon that can cripple most of these like Zapdos, Misdreavus, and Gengar should be considered. Most of Tentacruel's problems are naturally fast Pokemon; thus, it's a good idea to pair it with paralysis spreaders like Exeggutor and Porygon2, which are suited to lure out most of the above targets. This improves Tentacruel's matchup against these significantly, especially if they rely on Thunder to deal with it, as they will be even less likely to break the Substitute. Finally, Tentacruel not only needs to have its checks crippled or out of the picture if it wants to sweep, it also requires a setup opportunity, namely on Pokemon like Cloyster, non-Acid Armor Vaporeon, non-Roar Suicune, Forretress, and Blissey, something greatly appreciated by the likes of Tyranitar and, once again, Steelix, as they tend to draw in most of these Pokemon for Tentacruel to take advantage of.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Even if it doesn't act as a sweeper that enjoys the popularity of Cloyster and Forretress, Tentacruel remains a big nuisance to these two with this set. They have no way to keep Tentacruel from getting rid of their Spikes with Rapid Spin, and the best they can do against it is trade themselves for it with Explosion after Tentacruel clears the field. Surf reliably hits Ghost-types neutrally and prevents Ground-types like Marowak and Nidoking from taking advantage of Tentacruel.  Sludge Bomb, when used in tandem with Screech or Curse, allows Tentacruel to directly threaten the likes of Exeggutor and check non-Acid Armor Vaporeon. Screech tends to be more effective against the likes of Snorlax, as Tentacruel doesn't want to fight a Curse war against it; however, Curse still holds some merits, like boosting Tentacruel's Defense and making it a potential wincon in some scenarios. On the other hand, you can opt for a less offensive approach by using Toxic, which bothers just about any Pokemon that isn't a Steel- or Poison-type itself, including Misdreavus, which will have a harder time spinblocking Tentacruel if poisoned. Protect has some desirable features, especially when coupled with Toxic, like stalling for free Leftovers recovery, punishing a reckless Cloyster or Forretress trying to trade with Explosion, and scouting the opposing Pokemon's moves while burning its PP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Unlike Starmie, Tentacruel has a hard time against Gengar, which can spinblock it without much trouble; hence, Dark-types like Tyranitar and Umbreon are teammates of choice due to their ability to severely damage Ghost-types with Pursuit. Tentacruel tends to invite dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon in due to its tendency to use Rapid Spin every time it switches in, so Pokemon that can reliably handle them, such as Skarmory, Misdreavus, and Raikou, make for excellent teammates. However, keep in mind that you can cripple all of the aforementioned Pokemon with Toxic. This is something to take into account if you're playing the likes of Nidoking, Zapdos, and Machamp alongside Tentacruel, as they will greatly appreciate having these annoyances poisoned or forced into using Rest.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Magneton is a really cool Pokemon, but it's also kind of an oddball. Like Ampharos and Lanturn, Magneton lacks the distinguishing Speed of most Electric-types. Gaining a Steel typing gave it a few more resistances, and it has good Defense, but it also has horrible HP (also, its Special Defense leaves something to be desired). Its movepool is pretty limited, but it does have awesome Special Attack and STAB on Thunderbolt. Magneton is a good choice for a UU team, as it can counter all of those Curse + RestTalk Pokemon with Reflect and repeated Thunderbolts. In order to work in OU, however, Magneton needs support to take out those special walls that will almost always block it. Once they are out of the way, however, Magneton can actually be a formidable opponent, and that resistance to Normal attacks can always come in handy.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The type of Hidden Power you use can vary widely; in addition to Water, viable choices include Ice for most Ground- and Grass-types, Grass for most Ground-types, and Fire for Grass-types and Steelix. Reflect is good to pass around the team, and if your team is cut out for it, you can use Toxic on special walls (Snorlax especially) and make them take damage every turn. The poison damage Snorlax takes in addition to a Thunderbolt will translate into a good chunk of its health.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Prediction, really. Anything that has a Ground, Fire, or Fighting move will kill Magneton, but make sure it can absorb a strong Thunderbolt or Hidden Power. The most obvious counters are Blissey, Snorlax, and Fire Punch Electabuzz and Ampharos.</p> ",

If your opponent sends in Exeggutor or a special wall, Thunder Wave will ensure that they don't leave completely unscathed.

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk is by no means a fantastic Pokemon, but it has a few unique traits that distinguish it as viable. Its large HP, Attack, and Special Defense allow it to have decent matchups versus Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune. Furthermore, its access to Curse and ability to outpace Snorlax mean that it has the potential to hold its ground against it in a one-on-one matchup. Muk's access to Explosion makes it a decent fit on offensive teams centered around the move, and with Curse, Muk is one of the best Pokemon at forcing at least a trade, similarly to Curse + Explosion Steelix and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax.</p> <p>However, Muk has a bad Speed tier, and its typing doesn't grant it many useful resistances. Besides Machamp without Earthquake and Heracross, it doesn't check any offensive threats well. If Muk has been worn down, many faster Pokemon are capable of revenge killing it. Muk can also have a hard time dealing with non-Steel-type Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb and Explosion like Gengar, Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon. These flaws make it difficult to justify Muk's place on offensive teams over other Explosion users like Exeggutor and Gengar, which offer significantly more defensive utility and are more effective at luring Pokemon like Raikou, Snorlax, and Zapdos. However, Muk distinguishes itself by majorly threatening stall teams with its coverage, Toxic immunity, and ability to boost with Curse.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain is Muk's most viable other option, enabling it to hit Rhydon and Golem for massive damage. Since Muk is faster than both of these Pokemon, it can even force them out if they're hit on the switch; it also hits Cloyster super effectively. However, without Curse, Muk will not be able to pressure Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, Misdreavus, Vaporeon and even Psychic-less Starmie nearly as effectively. While Giga Drain alleviates pressure from the likes of Golem and Rhydon and can even serve to bait in these Pokemon, it can make Muk significantly less dangerous overall and force it to use Explosion to go for a trade much earlier in the game.</p> <p>Besides Giga Drain, Muk doesn't have many other viable options. Dynamic Punch could be used to bait Tyranitar, other Rock-types, and also deal significant damage to Snorlax. Zap Cannon and Thunder can be used to spread paralysis and hit Skarmory and Cloyster, but other Pokemon are significantly better at doing this, and Fire Blast is much more consistent, especially against Forretress and Steelix. Thief can be used with no item on hand to steal a foe's item, but the loss of a coverage move or Curse is almost never worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock- and Ground-types: Tyranitar, Rhydon, Golem, Nidoking, and Marowak resist Sludge Bomb, shrug off Fire Blast, and can all threaten Muk with a powerful Earthquake; Rhydon, Golem, and Tyranitar additionally resist Explosion, but they would hate to get poisoned unless they carry Rest. If Tyranitar doesn't carry Earthquake, it might not be immediately threatening against Muk, which could stay in and try to inflict poison with Sludge Bomb. Rhydon and Golem resist Explosion, but they don't want to take a Giga Drain in the rare case that Muk is carrying it. Marowak and Nidoking need to watch out for Explosion, and Muk can also inflict poison on the former. There are also a few niche defensive Rock-types that can check Muk quite well or at worst trade with it. Shuckle, Omastar, and Aerodactyl shrug off Muk's common attacks, resist Explosion, and carry Rest to cure poison from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory and Steelix resist Explosion and are completely immune to Sludge Bomb. They need to watch out for Fire Blast, but can take one hit from it if necessary. While Steel-types don't check Muk well overall, they can still be very useful due to their Poison immunity and resistance to Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are immune to Explosion and shrug off all of Muk's other attacks, although Sludge Bomb can poison Misdreavus. Gengar and Misdreavus can threaten Muk with Hypnosis and even a combination of Mean Look and Perish Song, but Perish trap Misdreavus should only check Muk as a last resort, since it doesn't want to be poisoned. Without these moves, Misdreavus will struggle versus Muk because a +1 Sludge Bomb from Muk does more damage to Misdreavus than a Psychic does back to Muk. Gengar's Thunder does about as much damage to Muk as its Fire Blast does back, so this matchup without earlier-mentioned moves is about even until they trade when Gengar decides to use Explosion, assuming neither Pokemon switches out.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Exeggutor and Jynx can hit Muk with a strong Psychic or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder and Lovely Kiss. Neither of these Pokemon wants to take a Sludge Bomb or Explosion, however, so they must be careful when trying to check Muk. Starmie can switch into Muk relatively well and can 2HKO it with Psychic after Spikes while not minding Poison that much thanks to Recover; however, it risks trading itself with Muk, as Muk can often be paired with sweepers that want Starmie gone, like Vaporeon. Overall, Psychic-types can offensively threaten Muk but none can switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers: Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune can use Rest to cure poison from Sludge Bomb and wear down Muk to the point at which it will either use Explosion or be easily revenge killed by another teammate. That said, this can often be to the Muk user's advantage, as it often aims to trade with these Pokemon. Only use Zapdos, Raikou, and Suicune to check Muk if you don't mind trading with it or if you have no other checks on your team.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: RestTalk Umbreon can reduce Muk's Attack with Charm and check it quite well; however, it risks trading itself for Muk if the Muk user decides to use Explosion as Umbreon switches in.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster has very high Defense, so it can take advantage of Muk by setting up Spikes early-game; however, Muk could use Cloyster to set up Curse, potentially forcing it to use Explosion. Although Cloyster's Explosion doesn't OHKO Muk after one Curse boost, it still deals a large amount of damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set aims to maximize Muk's potential versus top threats in the metagame like Snorlax, Zapdos, and Raikou while also trying to cover as much ground as possible. Sludge Bomb has strong neutral coverage, can be quite powerful with a Curse boost or two under its belt, and can spread poison decently well. Fire Blast can hit Skarmory and Steelix on the switch with high odds to 2HKO them and also hits Forretress for an OHKO. Explosion can be used in a pinch to remove most Pokemon from the battle. Curse gives Muk decent odds versus Snorlax in a one-on-one matchup and can also enable Muk to threaten Vaporeon, Machamp, Suicune, Misdreavus, and Electric-types with Sludge Bomb.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Muk fits best on offensive teams centered around Explosion. Cloyster is an important teammate that lays down Spikes for Muk, making it more difficult to switch into, and forces Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon out, like Rhydon and Golem. Vaporeon fits well with Muk, as it appreciates Muk's decent matchup versus Electric-types and ability to use Explosion. Tyranitar can use Pursuit to trap Gengar and Misdreavus, which can be nice because both Pokemon are immune to Explosion. If you're using Muk with a Pursuit trapper, a Snorlax set with Curse, Lovely Kiss, Double-Edge / Body Slam, and Rest can work effectively because Muk can serve as an emergency backup check for Electric-types in case Snorlax gets pressured while asleep. While Muk can take Thunder from Raikou and Zapdos reasonably well, it would prefer to only switch into it if necessary, as it would be forced into Explosion mind games earlier than it'd like. Muk also has some potential as a breaker on a more defensive team alongside Skarmory and Raikou, which works due to the lack of Pokemon that are able to completely wall it. Muk can support Curse Snorlax with a Fire-type move quite well, as it can often inflict poison on common checks like Rock-types and Misdreavus.</p> <p>Houndoom is a niche pick, but it has decent offensive synergy with Muk because it can trap Ghost-types as well as Exeggutor and Jynx with Pursuit while resisting both of their STAB moves. In return, Houndoom appreciates Muk's Explosion to remove threats like Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, and Vaporeon. Using Houndoom alongside Muk compounds a Ground-type weakness, however, so proceed with caution.</p> "

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a top pick for a reason: it's one of the very few Pokemon blessed with Spikes, a very important move in a metagame filled with Pokemon that heavily benefit from the extra chip damage. It distinguishes itself from other Spikes setters thanks to its Water typing; coupled with excellent physical bulk and a powerful and relatively fast Explosion, this allows it to check Ground-types like Steelix and Marowak and act as an a tricky-to-play-around offensive threat, since its decently powerful Surf keeps most Pokemon that resist Normal at bay that otherwise would be tempted to take the Explosion. Furthermore, Cloyster can further expand its utility thanks to its access to Rapid Spin, a very useful tool in a metagame where Spikes are so rampant, although it unfortunately cannot be used alongside Explosion.</p> <p>However, while Cloyster remains the premier Spikes setter and Water-type in the tier, Forretress sports a typing with more resistances and an immunity to Toxic, which usually grants it more opportunities to set up Spikes than Cloyster. As a spinner, Starmie has a much easier time taking on Gengar thanks to its secondary typing and less trouble using Rapid Spin throughout the game by virtue of its access to Recover. Finally, due to its abysmal special bulk and subpar defensive typing, Cloyster is outclassed as a pure defensive Water-type by Suicune.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is a secondary STAB option that pairs well with Hidden Power Electric and puts a big dent in powerhouses like Zapdos, Exeggutor, and Dragonite, but the lack of Surf puts Cloyster at a disadvantage if the opponent happens to use Forretress. Icy Wind can prove to be a very effective tool, as you can potentially keep Spikes up against Starmie and Rapid Spin Tentacruel with the right support, but its power is lacking, and other moves may be more optimal. Hidden Power Fire can eliminate Forretress quickly so its Rapid Spin is no longer an issue, but it doesn't OHKO Forretress, is too situational to warrant a moveslot most of the time, and comes with an even bigger IV issue than Hidden Power Electric, so much so that the Defense and HP loss means that a Swords Dance-boosted Marowak can now potentially OHKO Cloyster. Clamp traps the foe and ensures that Explosion cannot be avoided, and it can work well in tandem with Screech, which enables Cloyster to ideally trap a target like Snorlax, nullify its Defense boosts from Curse, and remove it from the game. However, there is no guarantee that the Pokemon you aim to trap will stay in against Cloyster, and once you've revealed Clamp, the opponent will be more careful. Rest is an option on Rapid Spin variants to improve their longevity and ability to clear and lay down Spikes throughout the game, but it should only be used on stall teams alongside a cleric, as Cloyster will have a hard time staying healthy for two turns and has to give up the very valuable Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Spinners: Since Cloyster's purpose revolves around Spikes, keeping these away is the best way to check it. Starmie is widely regarded as the best spinner available, mainly because it does a good job of clearing Spikes after Cloyster has set them up. While Cloyster can choose to use Explosion, Starmie remains faster and is likely to accomplish its job most of the time. Forretress has more trouble using Rapid Spin against Cloyster, since it's slower and takes a lot of damage from Surf, but it can potentially retaliate with Toxic and Giga Drain, which may be enough to significantly hinder Cloyster and to clear the field afterwards. Although far less common, Rapid Spin Tentacruel might be even better than Starmie at preventing Cloyster from keeping Spikes up, since its immunity to Toxic means that Cloyster can't do anything against it bar Explosion. Swords Dance Tentacruel, on the other hand, cannot use Rapid Spin, but it remains a nuisance, since it can freely set up on Cloyster as long as it uses Substitute to avoid Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Cloyster aims to make good use of Explosion or Rapid Spin once Spikes are up. Therefore, Ghost-types like Gengar and Misdreavus can prove to be very annoying with their Normal immunity preventing Cloyster from accomplishing anything else along with their fast Thunder to force it out. However, Gengar has trouble taking Surf too often, whereas Misdreavus badly wants to avoid Toxic unless it carries Rest, and it can still be worn down with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Thunder: Fast Thunder users like Zapdos, Raikou, Nidoking, Jolteon, Dragonite, and even Starmie all threaten Cloyster, in most cases for a guaranteed OHKO; Starmie in particular might take Cloyster by surprise, thus nullifying its impact on the game.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Exeggutor and the rarer Meganium also deal heavy damage to Cloyster with their STAB attacks, but they should be wary of the potential Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with strong special attacks: Pokemon such as Jynx, Espeon, and Thunder Snorlax threaten to 2HKO Cloyster with their powerful special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Toxic users: Toxic spreaders like Suicune, Umbreon, and Blissey will wear down Cloyster, urging it to use Explosion sooner and making it more predictable and easy to play around as a result. Poisoning Cloyster will also make it much easier to keep Spikes off the field with spinners.</p> ",

        "name": "Spikes",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The chip damage Spikes provides can be extremely beneficial for offensive and defensive teams alike. A single layer of Spikes makes offensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Nidoking significantly more threatening and provides defensive teams with a way to wear down the opposing team in the long run. Cloyster is widely considered the best source of Spikes available due to its other attributes. Surf is the preferred STAB option, as it is very likely to 3HKO Forretress, a common spinner that would be tempted to get rid of Spikes, and heavily damages the likes of Steelix, Marowak, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem, allowing Cloyster to act as check to these and prevent Golem from using Rapid Spin. Toxic is Cloyster's best tool besides Explosion to cripple important targets like Starmie, Snorlax, and opposing Cloyster. The added residual damage can be very effective when coupled with Spikes. Nonetheless, since the opposing team carrying a Cloyster of their own is a common scenario, Hidden Power Electric is a good option to weaken the opposing Cloyster quicker. It is preferred over Hidden Power Grass, since it offers a decent chance of breaking Tentacruel's Substitute, which is a more important target than Quagsire, the only other noteworthy Pokemon covered by Hidden Power Grass, and doesn't force Cloyster to give up as many HP IVs. However, the loss of HP IVs is still pretty substantial, and it's still unlikely to 2HKO opposing Cloyster unless they run the move as well. Explosion forces the opponent to be careful, as it gives the ability to remove valuable targets like Zapdos and Raikou from the game instantly. It is especially scary to deal with because most Pokemon that resist it like Steelix, Tyranitar, and Skarmory have a hard time taking Surf. In addition, Explosion's immediate raw power and its ability to prevent slower Pokemon from moving on the turn it is used makes it a great tool for stopping dangerous threats like Curse or Belly Drum Snorlax and Growth Vaporeon. However, you can forgo the threat of Explosion in favor of Rapid Spin, which might be more beneficial for defensive teams or some teammates that really benefit from having Spikes removed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the tremendous usefulness of Spikes, Cloyster can fit onto practically any kind of team, hence why it sees so much usage. Both Gengar and Misdreavus make good teammates, as they can serve as spinblockers and exploit Spikes with their various disrupting options that force more switches; the former can also absorb Toxic aimed at Cloyster, whereas the latter is fit to prevent Starmie from using Rapid Spin. Other notable Pokemon that can exploit Spikes include phazers, especially those with a significant offensive presence like Raikou and Rhydon. Other forms of residual damage pair nicely with Spikes, since they wear down the opposing team even quicker, so various Toxic and Thief users like Nidoking, Exeggutor, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Jynx do well alongside Cloyster. Overall, every Pokemon with significant offensive pressure like Zapdos, Machamp, and Marowak or with sleep-inducing moves like Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Snorlax tend to force a lot of switches and benefit from the additional damage against bulky foes. Finally, Cloyster has trouble setting Spikes up safely against special attackers like Zapdos, Raikou, Gengar, Nidoking, Exeggutor, and Starmie, many of which can OHKO Cloyster with a powerful Thunder. As a result, Pokemon suited to take these assaults like Snorlax, Steelix, Blissey, Umbreon, and Raikou make good backups for Cloyster. Raikou in particular tends to attract opposing Steelix and Snorlax, two Pokemon that are Spikes bait for Cloyster most of the time. This trait can also be exploited by Zapdos, since just like Raikou it can threaten most relevant spinners, doesn't have any counter immune to Spikes, and is a magnet for Ground-types for Cloyster to take advantage of. Due to this, the core of Cloyster + Electric-type is extremely common and metagame defining.</p> <p>Explosion variants of Cloyster are a good asset for offensive teams, as they can lure in Starmie, Zapdos, and Raikou and get rid of them, opening the field for sweepers like Machamp and Vaporeon. Therefore, Cloyster finds a solid place on Explosion-based teams, since Electric-types are usually primary targets for this archetype. Rapid Spin variants, on the other hand, find their support greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Marowak and Belly Drum Snorlax, which want to avoid any kind of damage before setting up. A field cleared of Spikes is also very beneficial for stall-oriented teams because they won't face nearly as much pressure when switching.</p> "

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>Marowak has, by far, the highest Attack stat in the game with a Thick Club equipped. Furthermore, it gets access to Swords Dance to instantly hit the 999 Attack cap and a STAB Earthquake to run off that impressive Attack stat. However, Marowak is very frail and very slow, and despite its impressive attacking strength, it still fails to guarantee OHKOs against several prominent threats even after a Swords Dance boost. Therefore, a lot of prediction and team support is required to get Marowak to perform well on a team. However, when everything does come together for Marowak to work properly, it can single-handedly demolish the opposing team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Body Slam over Hidden Power on the Swords Dance set allows Marowak to create its own paralysis support, but forces Marowak to miss out on that crucial OHKO against Exeggutor. Fire Blast could be used over Swords Dance and possibly paired with Body Slam to make Marowak an all-out attacker. Fire Blast handily 3HKOes Skarmory without requiring the use of a boosting move beforehand, but that's about all it's good for. Hidden Power Flying can be used over Hidden Power Bug on the Swords Dance set to OHKO Heracross while still 2HKOing Exeggutor and nearly ensuring an OHKO against Exeggutor after a Swords Dance boost. Finally, Marowak can attempt to use a RestTalk set to give it some semblance of longevity. However, RestTalk Marowak hardly compares to other RestTalk users since its defenses, typing, and lack of Leftovers recovery prevent it from switching in very easily. Thus, it's less of a status-absorbing tank and more of a watered-down sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory is one of the best counters to Marowak, as it doesn't fear anything Marowak can dish out aside from Swords Dance-boosted Rock Slides and the uncommon Fire Blast. Even if Marowak has used Swords Dance to threaten with Rock Slide, Skarmory can use Whirlwind to phaze, chip away at Marowak's health with Drill Peck (which only does 22%-26% to Marowak, but every bit of damage counts), or even use Curse to take only 29%-34% damage from +2 Rock Slides (not even a guaranteed 4HKO with Leftovers) while threatening to hit back with boosted Drill Pecks. Suicune is also an excellent Marowak counter, especially with a RestTalk set. Suicune threatens to easily 2HKO Marowak, although it does take heavy damage when switching into an Earthquake. With Sleep Talk, however, Suicune is able to freely use Rest to shrug off those Earthquakes while still threatening to 2HKO Marowak. Cloyster is another good switch-in, but unlike Suicune it takes the same damage from both Rock Slide and Earthquake, so baiting Rock Slides with Zapdos does nothing to make Cloyster's switch in any easier. Furthermore, Cloyster does not last nearly as long as Suicune, so it is much easier for Marowak to wear Cloyster down on the switch. Starmie and Vaporeon are other solid checks that can force Marowak out by threatening to 2HKO with Surf, but they must be wary when switching in, as Earthquake handily 2HKOes them and can OHKO after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Aside from Skarmory and Water-types, Exeggutor can switch into anything except for Hidden Power Bug and then threaten to use Sleep Powder, Explosion, or a strong special attack. If nothing else, Exeggutor poses enough of a threat to Marowak to bait Hidden Power Bug, which in turn makes it much easier for Water-types to switch into Marowak. Heracross resists Earthquake and only really fears Hidden Power Flying while dealing heavy damage to Marowak in return with Megahorn. However, Megahorn is an unlikely 2HKO against Marowak (it deals 45%-52%) whereas, after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak is guaranteed to 2HKO Heracross with Earthquake. In addition, Zapdos is somewhat of a Marowak check. Zapdos's Hidden Power Grass or Ice will do 43%-50% damage to standard Marowak, so it cannot outpace Marowak's damage output in a one-on-one situation unless it gets very high damage rolls, but it can do significant damage to Marowak while avoiding being OHKOed by Rock Slide and baiting Rock Slides to make it easier for other Marowak checks to switch in.</p> <p>In general, the best way to neutralize Marowak is to simply attack it. For example, the 46%-54% Snorlax takes from Earthquake isn't necessarily permanent, but the 41%-48% Snorlax does to Marowak is forever due to the lack of Leftovers and defensive aptitude. Zapdos can recover off the heavy damage it takes from Rock Slide, whereas the Hidden Power damage Marowak takes is permanent. Being able to take \"temporary\" damage to get hits in on Marowak tends to neuter its ability to threaten your team significantly. Just make sure that you don't leave anything in on Marowak that actually does end up being OHKOed.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Marowak is the hardest hitter in the game, and this set takes a very basic approach toward maximizing Marowak's wallbreaking capabilities. Earthquake is the STAB move that guarantees a 3HKO against everything that doesn't resist it. This doesn't sound terribly impressive at first; given how frail Marowak is, you'd expect at least 2HKOs all over the place. However, Marowak doesn't just 3HKO foes, it comes very close to 2HKOs, as illustrated by the following damage calculations. Note that, for these calculations, Marowak's Attack stat is set to 254 (508 after the Thick Club boost) by lowering the Attack DV to 13. Also, be aware that defending Pokemon have maximum values (without a nature boost) for all stats in GSC.</p> <ul> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 46.08% -- 54.01% -- 4.47% chance to 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 32.01% -- 37.77% -- 0.12% chance to 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 45.55% -- 53.44% -- 1.12% chance to 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 41.69% -- 49.13% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 39.93% -- 46.86% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 44.02% -- 51.91% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Tyranitar 86.10% -- 101.24% -- 10.26% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Steelix 63.17% -- 74.50% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 42.49% -- 50.14% -- guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers</li> </ul> <p>Of course, being close to 2HKOs is not ideal, but with some team support and a little bit of residual damage, these KOs can become a reality. Additionally, Marowak runs Rock Slide to 2HKO Zapdos. Hidden Power Bug is the final coverage move, and it allows Marowak to OHKO Exeggutor as it switches in (although it is just short of being a guaranteed KO). However, if Marowak is paired up with Heal Bell support, Hidden Power can be forgone for Rest to allow Marowak the ability to heal off damage and make a second attempt at wallbreaking. Finally, Swords Dance is the move that allows Marowak to transform from an instant offensive threat to a hole-punching wallbreaker by raising its Attack to the 999 cap. However, Swords Dance can be very difficult to set up, and even after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak can miss out on guaranteed OHKOs against important foes, as illustrated in the damage calculations to follow. Note that, in the following damage calculations, Marowak has used Swords Dance to boost its Attack two stages to reach the maximum possible Attack stat of 999.</p> <ul> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Snorlax 90.25% -- 106.12% -- 38.46% chance to OHKO <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Snorlax 60.23% -- 70.94% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Miltank 89.06% -- 104.58% -- 30.77% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Suicune 81.64% -- 95.78% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Cloyster 77.89% -- 91.42% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +0 Def Umbreon 86.26% -- 101.27% -- 10.26% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Earthquake vs. +1 Def Steelix 82.44% -- 97.17% -- guaranteed 2HKO with Leftovers</li> </ul> <p>Thus, the secret to using Swords Dance is to first put the appropriate support in place; a defensive landscape with a lot of paralysis and residual damage allows Marowak to easily clean up, as do dual screens and passing Agility boosts. However, one crucial moment to consider using Swords Dance without a huge amount of support is when you believe the opponent will be switching to Skarmory. Skarmory takes very little damage from any of Marowak's unboosted attacks, but after Swords Dance boosting Marowak's Attack to 999, Rock Slide does 43%-50% to Skarmory, which is a solid 3HKO. Even if Skarmory tries to use Whirlwind to phaze or Curse to reduce Rock Slide's damage to below the 3HKO threshold (29%-34%), the 27% flinch rate (factoring in accuracy) makes KOing Skarmory possible. However, unless you use Swords Dance on the switch, Skarmory can easily tank whatever Marowak has to dish out while whittling away its health with Drill Pecks, and attempting to play for the flinch against a +1 Skarmory can be risky thanks to its boosted Drill Peck.</p> <p>One thing to note about the Swords Dance set is that, due to a bug in GSC, the Attack stat before the Thick Club boost must be 255 or lower. Otherwise, after a Swords Dance boost, Marowak's Attack stat after the Thick Club boost will roll over to something hilarious like 8 instead of simply capping at 999. That kind of Attack stat barely scares a Level 2 Rattata, let alone the top physical walls of GSC. Using Hidden Power Bug forces the use of a 13 Attack DV (the GSC equivalent to an IV), which automatically sets Marowak's Attack at 254. However, if you decide against using Hidden Power on Swords Dance Marowak for whatever reason, be sure to lower Marowak's Attack stat, either by lowering the Attack DV to 13 or by reducing Stat Experience (roughly equivalent to EVs) to achieve 255 Attack.</p> <p>Marowak has poor HP, low Speed, and no Leftovers. Therefore, if Marowak takes any hits not deliberately planned for, its ability to function goes down the drain. For this reason, Marowak needs to be brought in on predicted double switches to ensure it isn't switching in on attacks. Pokemon that can bait good match-ups for Marowak to switch into are excellent teammates. Gengar and Zapdos are good at baiting Raikou, which is forced to switch out or risk being OHKOed by Marowak's Earthquake. In addition, Rapid Spin from a Pokemon such as Starmie is incredibly welcome support to pair with Marowak, since Spikes damage is terrible for Marowak to be taking every time it switches in. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave Zapdos or Stun Spore Exeggutor is great for mitigating Marowak's poor Speed and preventing it from taking as many hits. Passing Agility to Marowak is another way to mitigate its poor Speed. In early GSC, using Jolteon to pass Agility to Marowak was such a prominent combo that it was dubbed \"JoltWak.\" Finally, passing screens to Marowak, particularly Light Screen, can allow it to tank more hits while setting up Swords Dance and dishing out hits. Light Screen is the recommended screen to use, as it allows Marowak to tank Suicune's Surfs and Zapdos's Hidden Powers, although Reflect support can allow Marowak to do a better job of tanking Snorlax's Double-Edges and Skarmory's Drill Pecks.</p> <p>Of course, Rest can be used to mitigate Marowak's frailty by allowing it to recover from prior damage, something most Marowak cannot do otherwise. This allows you to be a bit more daring with when you choose to bring Marowak in, although you still want to avoid bringing it in on any kind of attacking move if you can. However, if Marowak chooses to forgo Hidden Power for Rest, it MUST be paired with either Miltank or Blissey to provide Heal Bell support. Otherwise, Marowak will never be able to wake up from its nap, as it is too frail. Additionally, it is also a good idea to pair Rest Marowak with Pursuit support from a Pokemon such as Umbreon or Tyranitar. This is because, without Hidden Power, Marowak will not be able to damage Exeggutor switch-ins.</p> "

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon is a physical juggernaut capable of dismantling an opposing team's defenses with its powerful STAB attacks. Not only is it powerful, but it also fills the valuable defensive niches of Normal-resistant phazer and Electric-immune Pokemon capable of threatening both Zapdos and Raikou. However, its physical Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses and many special weaknesses can hold it back. Moreover, it faces competition with other Normal-resistant Pokemon, namely Golem, Steelix, and Tyranitar, each of which fulfills the same primary defensive role—checking Snorlax—while offering defensive and team support capabilities that Rhydon lacks: Golem has access to Rapid Spin and Explosion; Steelix lacks double weaknesses, lacks an Ice-type weakness, is immune to Toxic, and also has access to Explosion; and Tyranitar can check Exeggutor, lacks an Ice-type weakness, and offers Pursuit support. Nonetheless, as a recipient rather than a provider of team support, Rhydon uniquely blends potent wallbreaking ability with defensive role-playing capabilities.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Zap Cannon, Rhydon itself can inflict paralysis and thereby support teammates such as Machamp and Charizard. Thunder is also a worthwhile alternative, since it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes Skarmory a lot more consistently than Zap Cannon, and it has a decent chance of inflicting paralysis to assist with wallbreaking. Counter can deal heavy damage against Snorlax using Earthquake or Zapdos using Hidden Power Ice, although Hidden Power Water threatens to OHKO, and an opponent can switch out instead of attacking. Rhydon is one of the most effective users of Counter against Curse + Earthquake Snorlax, as the fear of being phazed and losing boosts for nothing tends to encourage them to attack once Rhydon shows its face. Rest provides Rhydon with longevity to shrug off damage and poison. This allows Rhydon to fit on a defensive lineup and play the role of an answer to opposing Snorlax that have Fire-type moves, as well as accompany Belly Drum Snorlax in offensive duties, although it competes with Curse Tyranitar, which is less easily forced out by special attackers. Being able to use Rest makes Rhydon a much more reliable long-term check to Curse Snorlax that lack Earthquake, but it can fail to actually KO a boosted Snorlax if it fails to score a critical hit, potentially even losing to Snorlax in a Struggle-off if it comes down to that. Dropping Roar for Rest also leaves Rhydon without a tool it can use to break through sturdy walls such as Skarmory. Hidden Power Bug targets Exeggutor, which can be problematic for standard Rhydon sets. Fire Blast is a decent surprise option that has some merits against Exeggutor and pressures Forretress and Skarmory. Substitute not only helps block status afflictions while Rhydon uses Roar or attacks potential threats such as Snorlax, but it also provides a way to get around Umbreon and Miltank. It is effective with a wide variety of options, including the aforementioned Electric-type moves, and also synergizes with the paralysis inflictions that are a common theme on teams featuring Rhydon. However, it must be kept in mind that in order to use these options, Roar or Curse must be replaced. These moves are not entirely mandatory on Rhydon, but replacing Roar limits Rhydon's defensive capabilities, takes away its ability to use a slower Roar to beat Skarmory, and, barring a critical hit or timely flinch from Rock Slide, actually makes a Curse war against Snorlax a losing proposition. Meanwhile, replacing Curse causes it to struggle to do enough damage to paralyzed or sleeping Umbreon, Suicune, Miltank, and Skarmory, thereby limiting Rhydon's wallbreaking capabilities and forcing it to rely on Spikes and its teammates to avoid being PP stalled.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Although Cloyster, Suicune, Starmie, and Vaporeon don't resist Rhydon's attacks, they threaten an OHKO with Surf. Cloyster can set Spikes or spread Toxic against Rhydon teams. However, it should be noted that Rhydon is often chosen partly because of its ability to punish switches to Cloyster with its powerful Rock Slide. Suicune has mammoth-like defensive stats, making it an especially reliable check to Rhydon, especially if it is using its RestTalk set. Starmie can predict switch-ins and spread Thunder Wave against Rhydon teams or use Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor: Exeggutor resists Earthquake and can use status moves against Rhydon teams. Its STAB moves also deal heavy damage to Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory with Toxic can put Rhydon on a timer. Without Toxic, Skarmory struggles against Rhydon, whose slower Roar makes it impossible to phaze and neutral Rock Slide with Curse boosts threatens heavy damage. However, even without Toxic, Skarmory's immunity to Earthquake and neutrality to Rock Slide still make it a fairly safe option to switch into Rhydon in the event that one must PP stall it or attempt to get a Water-type dragged in by Roar without letting it take a boosted Earthquake on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon and Miltank</strong>: Umbreon can use Charm and Miltank can use Growl to stall out Rhydon. Amusingly, however, Rhydon can check Mean Look variants of Umbreon.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Machamp can 2HKO Rhydon with Cross Chop or set up Curse against it, but it should be wary of taking Earthquake from Rhydon too often.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx cannot switch into either of Rhydon's attacking moves and does not bait Rhydon into switching into its super effective STAB Ice Beam. However, if it switches into Curse or is dragged in by Roar, it can threaten an OHKO and can guarantee one if Rhydon has taken chip damage that has left it at 86% health or less, thereby forcing Rhydon to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Pure Ground-types</strong>: Thanks to STAB Earthquake and higher Speed, Marowak can take advantage of Rhydon, although it struggles to switch directly into Rhydon's Earthquake. Alternatively, Donphan is sturdier and can check Rhydon effectively even if it needs to switch into Earthquake, although it naturally poses less of an offensive threat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Spikes and Toxic from Pokemon such as Snorlax and Misdreavus can wear Rhydon down before it can deal too much damage. This can also open a lane for Snorlax to deal heavy damage to an opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage moves allow Pokemon otherwise threatened by Rhydon to 2HKO or even OHKO it in return. Common examples include Hidden Power Water or Ice from Raikou and Zapdos, Ice Punch from Gengar, Surf or Ice Beam from Tyranitar, Ice Beam from Dragonite, Surf from Snorlax, and Giga Drain from Forretress. Snorlax and Forretress can even switch into Rhydon with minimal prediction if they are carrying the appropriate coverage move, whereas Zapdos and Dragonite can attempt to switch into an Earthquake. To a lesser extent, Ground-type coverage moves such as Earthquake from Snorlax and Tyranitar can also chip away quickly at Rhydon's health in matchups that it would normally relish.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>With this set, Rhydon threatens to break walls and can even function as a late-game sweeper. Earthquake and Rock Slide form an unresisted combination of moves that, when both are backed by STAB and Rhydon's high Attack stat, deals high damage to most Pokemon in the tier. Rhydon can boost its Attack stat even further with Curse, which can help it to break particularly resilient physical walls such as Skarmory. With Roar, Rhydon can guarantee that no foe will be slower than it after a Curse, meaning as long as Rhydon uses Roar, it won't be phazed out by Pokemon such as Skarmory. In addition, it can prevent opposing Curse users such as Snorlax from setting up, in fact even allowing Rhydon to threaten to counter-sweep if an opposing Snorlax foolishly engages in a Curse war. The Defense boosts coupled with Rhydon's naturally high physical bulk can even make Rhydon effective against Earthquake variants of Snorlax, provided Snorlax is switching into Rhydon and not the other way around. In addition, Roar allows Rhydon to perform vital defensive duties such as phazing Mean Look Umbreon and Misdreavus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rhydon fits well on teams that want an offensive phazer that can at least temporarily check opposing Snorlax.</p> <p>Paralysis support is very effective alongside Rhydon, as it allows Rhydon to outspeed checks such as Umbreon, Miltank, Suicune, Vaporeon, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Skarmory then threaten them with boosted Earthquake or Rock Slide. Paralysis also makes it more difficult for Pokemon such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Snorlax to make Rhydon's job complicated with the appropriate coverage moves. Pokemon such as Snorlax, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Starmie, and Porygon2 can use Body Slam, Stun Spore, and Thunder Wave toward this end. Note, however, that paralyzing Skarmory renders it slower than Rhydon even after a Curse and, therefore, able to phaze. However, Rhydon is compensated by the damage output and flinch potential of boosted Rock Slide coupled with the chance of full paralysis, which together affords Rhydon a decent chance to KO Skarmory should it attempt to phaze.</p> <p>Starmie is a particularly potent teammate, as it also carries Rapid Spin, which can be useful because Rhydon tends to get worn down pretty quickly by Spikes; its numerous special weaknesses often force it to switch out before it can heal too much damage with Leftovers, and its defensive role as a check against Snorlax will force it to switch in and take chip damage quite frequently. Other spinners whose typings do not overlap with Rhydon's, such as Cloyster, are also effective teammates for this reason.</p> <p>Spikes and Toxic from Pokemon such as Cloyster can help Rhydon use Roar to whittle down an opposing team. Cloyster can also use Explosion to remove a Rhydon check, such as Starmie, Exeggutor, Zapdos, Vaporeon, Suicune, Umbreon, or even opposing Cloyster. Machamp can chip down Exeggutor with Hidden Power Bug and Skarmory with Fire Blast or a critical hit Cross Chop. Tentacruel can take advantage of some of Rhydon's Water-type checks, such as Cloyster and Suicune, to help it put pressure on Zapdos and Raikou. Vaporeon can similarly help Rhydon apply pressure to the aforementioned Electric-types and can handle threats like Jynx.</p> <p>An effective team with Rhydon also needs teammates that can absorb hits typically aimed at its numerous weaknesses. For instance, Electric-types are good teammates that can handle Water-types. In particular, Raikou, by virtue of its Ice-type neutrality, also offers insurance against opposing Electric-types and Gengar, which can be important because Rhydon takes a lot of damage from their coverage moves. Snorlax works similarly, and, as with all Ground-types, it synergizes well with Rhydon against Zapdos and Raikou; Rhydon goads the Electric-types into using Hidden Power, thereby allowing Snorlax more opportunities to switch into the low-damage coverage move rather than the high-damage STAB move. In addition, Water-types, Exeggutor, and Heracross are good teammates for Rhydon, as they cover the Ground-types to which Rhydon itself is weak. Exeggutor and Starmie are also solid checks to Machamp, whose Cross Chop targets another of Rhydon's physical weaknesses. The additional offensive synergy of Exeggutor and Starmie has been discussed earlier, whereas Heracross can use Seismic Toss to bait Skarmory into taking chip damage, or even a potential 4HKO if either Rhydon or Heracross has forced it to Rest. Additionally, Skarmory itself can check threats such as Exeggutor, Machamp, and Marowak and counters Snorlax with Earthquake coverage to complement Rhydon's ability to check Snorlax with Fire-type coverage.</p> <p>Pokemon that use Heal Bell, such as Blissey and Miltank, are also welcomed teammates, as they allow Rhydon to risk taking a potential Toxic without being put on an inevitable timer. Blissey additionally offers a more reliable Electric-type check to use alongside Rhydon, thereby relieving it of its duty to dissuade Thunder usage so that Snorlax can switch in safely. However, both Heal Bell users are weak to Fighting-type moves, which can often make it difficult to build the rest of the team in a manner that is not too weak to Machamp.</p> "

The other big thing with Kangaskhan is its ability to put up with special attacks too. It can survive 3 Thunderbolts from Raikou, meaning if it Cursed up and Rested on a Raikou switch-in, it could survive the Rest to KO it. Kangaskhan's just not hard to use at all. However, due to the presence of Snorlax, it quietly remains in the shadow of BL.

Hidden Power Ground punishes Electric-types, although it will have to be set up nicely before it can be used to your favor effectively.

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>With an amazing base 115 Speed, a good Water / Psychic typing, reliable recovery, and a great support movepool consisting of moves like Thunder Wave and the coveted Rapid Spin, Starmie is very much a solid Pokemon. Starmie's access to Rapid Spin is massively helpful for many teams, as it can prevent Starmie's team from being worn down over time, and Starmie is easily the most consistent Rapid Spin user in the tier due to its ability to threaten all Spikers and spinblockers. Additionally, Starmie's typing gives it useful resistances to Fighting-, Ice-, and Psychic-type moves. That, combined with its great Speed tier and access to Recover, allows it to counter critical offensive threats like Machamp and Charizard as well as letting it check many important Pokemon such as Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, Marowak, and Nidoking. However, Starmie struggles to do any significant damage to the very common Raikou and Zapdos as well as the ubiquitous Snorlax, all of which pose a massive threat to it. Therefore, Starmie does not usually run offensive sets and tends to run a more defensive set with Rapid Spin and Thunder Wave utility. Unfortunately, this can prove to be problematic due to Starmie's below average bulk and constant need to use Recover or Rapid Spin, which can give free turns to extremely dangerous Pokemon such as Snorlax, Zapdos, and Exeggutor.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder can be used to hit Cloyster, Vaporeon, and Suicune super effectively, but using it over Psychic makes taking down Machamp and Gengar, two crucial Pokemon, much more challenging. Light Screen allows Starmie to become a near-perfect counter to Vaporeon and helps its teammates by doubling their Special Defense. Substitute can make it even harder for Cloyster to keep Spikes up by blocking Toxic or Explosion attempts while also wasting Thunder PP from the likes of Zapdos and Raikou, blocking Giga Drain from Exeggutor, and easing prediction against spinblockers. However, both Light Screen and Substitute remove crucial coverage, so they are less than ideal. Hydro Pump is more powerful than Surf and allows Starmie to land many KOs more easily, notably granting it a guaranteed 2HKO on Tyranitar, a good chance to OHKO Marowak, and a guaranteed OHKO on Steelix. However, Hydro Pump's unreliable accuracy and lower PP mean that Surf is often the better option. Toxic can force typical counters like Snorlax and Zapdos to eventually use Rest, but if it's used over Psychic, Gengar becomes a much greater threat, and Starmie becomes setup fodder for Tentacruel. Reflect can be used to help soften blows from Snorlax, which Starmie allows in almost for free, and can also be used on turns where Explosion is anticipated. It can also support setup sweepers like Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak by putting them out of range of physical attacks, most notably Explosion, in specific situations. However, Reflect leaves Starmie more vulnerable to Gengar, does nothing against Electric-types, which are also common answers, and fails to reliably protect it from Snorlax, as it still risks paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder, sleep from Lovely Kiss, and an OHKO from a critical hit from Double-Edge. Ice Beam lets Starmie hit Zapdos and Exeggutor super effectively, but it results in poor coverage if Starmie is using Rapid Spin, so it is usually only run on Growth Pass recipient sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax's absurd HP and Special Defense allow it to sponge Starmie's special attacks quite well. Snorlax can take advantage of this by using Starmie to set up Curse or Belly Drum and threaten to deal significant damage with STAB moves like Body Slam, Return, and Double-Edge; Body Slam also has a 30% chance to paralyze Starmie, which will significantly hinder its capabilities if it doesn't have Heal Bell support.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raikou and Zapdos can tank any of Starmie's moves and can take it down with their super effective STAB moves, and if they are running RestTalk, the threat of paralysis from Starmie is also less of a concern.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Exeggutor and Meganium resist one or both of Starmie's STAB attacks and force it out with their own STAB moves. Exeggutor can also either paralyze Starmie or put it to sleep, which massively hinders or even flat out removes Starmie's ability to remove Spikes and check powerful Pokemon. However, neither of them run Rest, so they should try to avoid switching into Starmie's Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types like Gengar and Misdreavus are able to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. While the standard Psychic Starmie 2HKOes Gengar and 3HKOes Misdreavus, they can switch in on a predicted Rapid Spin before either switching out or attempting to take it on. Specifically, Gengar can OHKO Starmie with Explosion, Misdreavus can annoy it with Pain Split and possibly Perish trap it, and both can put Starmie to sleep with Hypnosis and 2HKO it with Thunder. The potential paralysis from Thunder can also turn the tables on Starmie. However, Gengar needs to come in completely healthy to check Starmie, as it is weak to Psychic and greatly dislikes being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey boasts even higher special bulk than Snorlax, has recovery in Soft-Boiled to scoff at any of Starmie's attempts to damage it, and threatens Starmie with Toxic, Present, or even Thunder or Thunderbolt. Blissey also has access to Heal Bell, which can undo all of Starmie's paralysis spreading efforts.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon's incredible special bulk and immunity to Psychic mean that it completely walls Starmie, and Rest will get rid of any status Starmie inflicts it with. Umbreon can also cripple Starmie with Toxic and Pursuit trap it if it has both moves, or it can Pursuit trap Starmie if it has already been hit with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Vaporeon resists Surf, takes very little damage from Psychic, and is able to cure any status inflicted on it with Rest, which means Vaporeon can sometimes use Starmie as setup fodder. However, Vaporeon needs to be cautious about Special Defense drops from Psychic, and it has difficulties setting up against Starmie if it has Light Screen or Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross threatens to OHKO Starmie with STAB Megahorn and can remove status with Rest. However, it can only safely check Starmie if it doesn't have Psychic, which 2HKOes Heracross.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Surf is Starmie's Water-type STAB attack that hits Pokemon like Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Charizard super effectively. Psychic is another form of STAB that allows Starmie to take down Pokemon like Machamp and Tentacruel and makes it more risky for Gengar to try to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. Thunder Wave can be run over Psychic to support Starmie's team, particularly slow but powerful attackers like Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, and Machamp, by slowing down faster Pokemon like Raikou and Zapdos and forcing them to use Rest more often, making them much easier to handle. However, dropping Psychic reduces Starmie's ability to counter Machamp and hurt Cloyster. Rapid Spin removes Spikes from Starmie's side of the field, preventing it and its team from being gradually worn down as the match goes on. Starmie can keep itself healthy throughout the match with Recover, which allows it to consistently check what it needs to, prevents it from being worn down as easily by Spikes and Toxic, and makes it much harder to Pursuit trap.</p> <p>There are three main strategies that Spikers can use to keep Spikes up against Starmie. Toxic can be used to force Starmie to eventually use Recover, which gives the Spikers a window of opportunity to either use Explosion on Starmie or switch to an Electric-type. Ghost-types can switch into a predicted Rapid Spin from Starmie and either attempt to beat it with Hypnosis, Thunder, Thunderbolt, Mean Look + Perish Song, or Explosion or otherwise immediately switch out again to Zapdos or Raikou. This forces Starmie out and preserves both Spikes and the Ghost-type's HP even if Starmie chooses a STAB attack. Lastly, Forretress can use Hidden Power Bug as Starmie attempts to spin, which just barely does enough damage for Starmie to be unable to Recover it off safely in the long run.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slow but powerful attackers like Marowak, Belly Drum Snorlax, and Machamp greatly appreciate Starmie's Rapid Spin support, as it increases their longevity; all of these Pokemon also like Starmie's ability to support them with Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats. Since Starmie is heavily threatened by Snorlax, Skarmory makes for a great partner due to its ability to reliably check most non-mixed Snorlax sets, and it doubles as a reliable answer to Heracross. Skarmory appreciates Starmie's ability to remove Spikes against Cloyster, which tends to take advantage of Skarmory to set up Spikes. Starmie also detests Electric-types, so good answers to them like Raikou and Blissey are very helpful. Both of these Pokemon greatly appreciate Rapid Spin support, and Starmie appreciates Blissey's ability to cure it of status with Heal Bell. Another option for a cleric is Miltank, which can also check Curse and mixed Snorlax sets decently. Spinblockers like Gengar and Misdreavus can be very annoying for Starmie, as they prevent it from removing Spikes, so Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Umbreon are greatly appreciated; Tyranitar and Umbreon also double as decent checks to Snorlax.</p> "

Its Special Attack, Speed, access to Lovely Kiss, and combination of STAB attacks that is scarcely resisted in GSC OU make it a great sweeper and status inducer. It 2HKOes a huge number of the viable offensive Pokemon in the metagame, which can force somewhat of a passive response, allowing the Jynx user to gain momentum. Jynx is the only sleep inducer that straight up 2HKOes the most common sleep and general status absorber, Zapdos, and can even take it on one-on-one without relying on Sleep Talk rolls going in its favor. In the absence of one of a few specific viable Sleep Talk users, like Snorlax or Vaporeon, opponents must often effectively sacrifice one Pokemon to sleep and then have an additional healthy Pokemon capable of taking Jynx on. However, Jynx also comes with significant liabilities, which are its frailty, due to its poor defensive typing and stats, and its almost total uselessness when inflicted with status. These traits make it difficult to bring in at times. Nevertheless, Jynx has changed the way that offensive teams are structured in GSC OU and has gone from a niche pick to a metagame standard.</p> ",

Perish Song + Mean Look can take huge advantage of more passive responses to Jynx such as Suicune and already sleeping Sleep Talk Snorlax. However, these sets are somewhat inconsistent due to Jynx being unable to stomach much damage, and foes can threaten it with heavy damage even if they cannot phaze to cancel Mean Look. This set is also harder to bring in than other users of this strategy, such as Gengar, due to its lack of notable resistances or immunities. Counter can be used on some sets to target physically offensive checks to Jynx such as Snorlax. Hidden Power Fire hits Forretress but can be hard to justify over one of the utility moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Blissey, Raikou, Suicune, and Snorlax can all switch into Jynx and threaten it out with status or damage.

Houndoom and Tyranitar threaten it with an OHKO if it does not switch, although Houndoom will fail to OHKO the majority of the time and Speed ties Jynx.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>The coverage of Ice Beam and Psychic is resisted only by Starmie and Forretress in OU, neither of which commonly run Sleep Talk. Even many special walls such as Blissey and Raikou don't appreciate being put to sleep, although the latter can mitigate this by using Sleep Talk. Substitute allows Jynx to mitigate its frailty and weakness to status, as well as giving it extra turns and safety. These turns better its odds to put something to sleep and let it fish for freezes or Special Defense drops with its STAB attacks, which can allow Jynx to break through its supposed checks. Thief is commonly used over Substitute to steal Leftovers from common switch-ins such as Snorlax, Suicune, Raikou, and Blissey that attempt to wall it. This allows Jynx and its teammates to break through these Pokemon more easily and subsequently inflict sleep on a Pokemon the opponent would rather have kept free of status. Thief Jynx is often used as a lead to steal Leftovers early on, supposing the lead matchup is advantageous. Jynx threatens a lot of common leads such as non-Sleep Talk users, Exeggutor, and Nidoking. Nightmare is sometimes seen over Substitute or Thief to beat down sleeping Pokemon that Jynx cannot 3HKO like Suicune and Snorlax. It can force them into Rest loops, in which they are highly susceptible to Special Defense drops and critical hits, and also punishes Sleep Talk users by putting them at great risk if they call Rest while inflicted with Nightmare. The overall purpose of Nightmare is to force switches, which Jynx is very effective at punishing if the opponent does not have numerous Pokemon capable of taking its powerful special attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jynx appreciates teammates that can keep up offensive momentum. While losing momentum occasionally is acceptable, Jynx teams commonly struggle when the opponent is aggressively playing around them rather than taking them on passively. This means using Pokemon that are very difficult to respond to passively like Cloyster, Whirlwind Zapdos, and Gengar or, if a threat requires a passive response, using Pokemon like Curse Snorlax that similarly force passive responses from the opponent rather than allowing them to gain momentum. Jynx also helps offensive teams overwhelm the opponent's defensive measures by softening up or gaining advantages against defensive Pokemon through Lovely Kiss or Thief, and Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress helps Jynx dish out damage more effectively. Pokemon that can deal with varieties of RestTalk Snorlax complement Jynx particularly well, as it typically draws them in. Gengar is immune to the Curse set and only fears the Earthquake set or a burn from Flamethrower; it also switches into Forretress without Hidden Power Ghost to stop it from getting a Rapid Spin off against Jynx. While Golem still takes super effective damage from Earthquake and the rare Surf from Sleep Talk Snorlax, it can get a Rapid Spin off against it and shuffle the opponent's team with Roar. Pokemon that check Jynx, such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Umbreon, are commonly threatened by Machamp, making it a great partner. A sleeping Snorlax makes an especially great entry point for Machamp, which is typically not a Pokemon you want to give opportunities to. Jynx and Machamp together can also apply pressure on poisoned Starmie by making it switch in and take residual damage. Sweepers that appreciate Raikou being worn down, such as Vaporeon, appreciate Jynx stealing its Leftovers or gradually weakening it. Jynx still appreciates Pokemon that can reliably stomach Thunders from Raikou, though, such as Steelix and Sleep Talk Snorlax. Jynx also makes for an excellent recipient of Special Attack boosts from Baton Pass users such as Vaporeon.</p> "

The reason it's not used as much as Pokemon like Raikou is that it is really fragile. This means that you have to predict switches, non-damaging moves, or bring it in on a weak attacker or after one of your Pokemon is KOed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Electabuzz can use Thunder Wave to hit enemy Electric-types, but it has two problems. First, Thunder Wave + Cross Chop is an illegal combination, so you cannot hit Blissey, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Umbreon very hard. You can solve this by using Zap Cannon instead of Fire Punch. You do not want to lose Thunderbolt here because, although you would already have Zap Cannon as an Electric attack, you'll find that its consistency of damage is far more useful than hitting Forretress, Piloswine, Scizor, and Steelix, so drop Fire Punch and keep Thunderbolt and Cross Chop. However, this still runs into the other problem of trying to counter Electric-types in this manner. You stop Jolteon and cripple enemy Electabuzz, but the most common Electric-type by far, Raikou, almost always carries Rest, meaning it will just heal itself of status. You can use this to your advantage, however, if you want to set up a Belly Drum Charizard. BellyZard has trouble sweeping if the opponent has a healthy Raikou kicking around on their team, because it's faster than Charizard and easily OHKOs it with Thunderbolt. If you can paralyze their Raikou, when you bring out Charizard later in the game, you can use Belly Drum and not have to worry about them switching to Raikou and forcing you to switch. The other popular Electric, Zapdos, is weak to Ice Punch and doesn't resist Thunderbolt, so it's not as much of an issue.</p> <p>Reflect and Light Screen help both Electabuzz and the team survive. Which one you use depends on what you have problems with. Reflect helps Electabuzz take on Snorlax better, letting it actually take an Earthquake, but Light Screen helps versus those enemy Electric-types that Electabuzz always gives free switch-ins to. Electabuzz can also use Counter, as it survives most physical hits that aren't Earthquake with a little bit of HP, and Counters it back for a near guaranteed OHKO. Electabuzz still has enough Speed after doing this to be useful, unlike, say, a weakened Counter Snorlax.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Other Electric-types are Electabuzz's best counters, since they can take all three of its main attacks without much trouble. Once you have Electabuzz in, there aren't really any real counters besides said Electrics; it's just that it has a tendency to die quickly and is hard to switch in a lot of the time.</p> ",

Ice Punch hits all Ground-types but Piloswine, Quagsire, and Steelix super effectively. Fire Punch covers Steelix and the rare Piloswine, leaving only Quagsire, who, like Piloswine, is rare. Fire Punch also nails Scizor and Forretress on their 4x weakness as an added bonus. That leaves only Grass- and Electric-types resisting Thunderbolt (all fully evolved Dragons are neutral to Thunderbolt, although Ice Punch still hits Dragonite hard). Grass-types are covered by both Fire Punch and Ice Punch. This means that only enemy Electrics (and the UU Quagsire) can resist your primary STAB attack and not be weak to one of the punches.</p> <p>However, Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon can just wall most special attackers with ease, so if those were Electabuzz's only attacks, then it still couldn't dent them, neutral Thunderbolt or otherwise. This is where Cross Chop comes in. Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon, the three most common special walls in GSC, all share a common weakness: Fighting. Cross Chop has a 25% chance to get a critical hit, so if that goes off once, it will 2HKO Snorlax and potentially OHKO Blissey. It has to roll max damage on both hits to 2HKO Umbreon with one critical hit, but Umbreon isn't as dangerous to Electabuzz as the other two, nor is it as common. Another advantage of Cross Chop is that critical hits ignore stat-ups entirely, meaning that it will do the same damage to a Snorlax that has six Curses as it does to one with no Curses. Cross Chop also nails the common Tyranitar for a cool 60-71%, an easy 2HKO.</p> <p>Leftovers is generally the preferred choice for Electabuzz, because it lets it switch into Thunderbolts, Surfs, and non-STAB Ice Beams more often, and it also lessens the effect of Spikes. Miracle Berry is a sound choice, however, as constant switch-ins to Thunderbolts and Ice Beams give Electabuzz a high risk of being paralyzed or frozen. Electabuzz is too frail for Leftovers to make that much of a difference, so it's not as important as on sturdier Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>There are two things that keep Tauros at bay from the OU ranks, and they are Skarmory and Forretress. Both of them wall Tauros exceptionally well, and are usually so prevalent in OU teams that they, by themselves, have rendered Tauros almost obsolete.</p> <p>However, if Skarmory and Forretress are absent from the field, it may come as a surprise that, similar to RBY, there isn't very much that will stop Tauros from just bulldozing through its opponents, especially if they have sustained any kind of prior damage. What distinguishes Tauros is the fact that it's so fast, meaning that whatever switches in will more than likely have to eat two Double-Edges before being able to act, and by then it may well be too late. When considering Tauros, be sure to have a solid plan to dismantle Skarmory and Forretress, and should they be brought down, let the rodeo begin.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Slam is an acceptable alternative for that nice shot at paralysis should you need it. Fire Blast is a gimmicky option that will hit Forretress and Skarmory for a load of damage, but Tauros will be hard-pressed to give up any of its moveslots for such a situational move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As mentioned earlier, Skarmory and Forretress will just about always wall Tauros. Forretress will take a really hard hit from Fire Blast, Skarmory not so much, but remember that to have Fire Blast, Tauros will have to sacrifice part of what makes it so good. Aerodactyl works very similarly as a UU counter; Aerodactyl also benefits from being faster than Tauros and can carry Reflect too to buffer Tauros's assaults.</p> <p>Next in line is probably Starmie, but only if it has Reflect; since it's one of the only common Pokemon faster than Tauros, it only has to take one Double-Edge before setting up Reflect and healing off damage with Recover. Raikou can be used similarly, but since it takes a lot of damage from Earthquake and has to Rest instead of Recover, it can't switch in more than once or twice. Note that if Starmie or Raikou get paralyzed, they are no longer legitimate counters.</p> <p>Other options for counters can include Pokemon with high Defense and/or Charm, Reflect, or Growl--Pokemon like Miltank, Umbreon, Donphan, and Suicune are examples--but remember that they'll take two large hits before being able to act.

Tauros also doubles as a nifty switch-in to Nidoking, as Tauros isn't weak to any of Nidoking's attacks. Tauros is a very simple Pokemon to use, but it is very good at what it does.</p> "}]

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Jack of all trades, master of none. Lapras has incredibly well-rounded stats and a good movepool, but it lacks both a particularly exceptional stat and a particularly exceptional movepool that separates it from its competitors. In most cases, Lanturn is superior to Lapras due to learning Thunder Wave and having STAB on the always-useful Electric attacks. Lapras has a decent Attack stat, but it isn't really enough to warrant using any physical attack on it since Ice Beam will usually cause more damage, in addition to Thunder's paralysis chance eclipsing the usefulness of Body Slam. When considering Lapras, keep in mind the things it has that Lanturn doesn't, namely Reflect and STAB Ice Beam. The transition from RBY stripped Lapras of most of the things that made it great in RBY (no Leftovers, more low-defense Pokemon, 90% Blizzard accuracy, Snorlax with 228 Special Defense), so make sure to use what little it has left.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As with most Water-types, Toxic deserves a mention for its ability to whittle away Snorlax's health, which is indeed very useful; combined with Confuse Ray and a little luck, this can make life very hectic for Snorlax indeed. Let it be noted that Lapras does learn a variety of moves, but only gets good use of some of them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Electric-types handle Lapras well, with the exception of Zapdos who gets hit hard with Ice Beam. Most Pokemon with a high Special Defense with no weaknesses to Lapras's attacks will also pass through easily; these include Umbreon, Snorlax, Blissey, and Hypno. In UU, Magneton is a great option since it resists both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and has a very powerful Thunderbolt. In addition, if Lapras does not sport Surf, many more Pokemon become reliable switch-ins, especially more from the UU and BL tiers such as Scizor, Arcanine, and Typhlosion.</p> ",

      {"name": "Tank", "description": "<p>This set blends the subtle combination of support and attacking that Lapras provides. Confuse Ray is a tad underrated as a move, but the 50% chance of incapacitation it provides is quite useful indeed for things like Snorlax. Ice Beam and Thunder, again, is a solid attack combination; Thunder gets the nod here due to its increased chance of paralysis, which makes adding an attack like Body Slam nigh redundant, as either Ice Beam or Thunder will do more to any of Lapras's switch-ins than Body Slam (the exception being Blissey, which Body Slam doesn't damage enough to be useful). The last move is a tossup; Surf grants a bit more attacking versatility against the likes of Tyranitar and Steelix. If the opponent is confused, Lapras has a better chance of not getting hurt while trying to surprise an opponent with Sing. Finally, Reflect is an honorable option which will soften the potential blow that a physical counter like Snorlax can inflict.</p> "}

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon was a mediocre defensive Pokemon outclassed by Suicune for the majority of GSC's history. Its draws over Suicune were access to Reflect and Haze, but ultimately not having that monstrous Defense stat left it unused in OU. Then, the NYPC gods gave Vaporeon and its Eeveelution brethren a gift from Pokemon heaven--Growth--which catapulted Vaporeon into legitimate OU territory. Growth is the only move in GSC that boosts the Special Attack stat, and Vaporeon is by far the best user for a standalone special sweep thanks to its bulk and high Special Attack. Nowadays, while Vaporeon still has the same defensive prowess, Growth boosts its Special Attack, which is high even without a boost but often overlooked, and makes it one of the premier offensive threats in the game. Vaporeon is a threat that must not be underestimated despite its initial lack of popularity.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As for options in the fourth moveslot of the main set, Vaporeon has a couple of okay options other than the ones listed. Hidden Power Electric 3HKOes Suicune as well as other Vaporeon at +1 and also wrecks the odd Tentacruel looking for a free boost. Blizzard is also an option as it can 2HKO Zapdos without a boost and OHKOes Exeggutor about 50% of the time at +1 after factoring accuracy. However, Blizzard's low PP and accuracy are major turnoffs.</p> <p>A Baton Pass set could work. In this case, Vaporeon is best off forgoing Rest for Acid Armor as a second stat boost to pass. Good recipients include Zapdos, Raikou, and Exeggutor. Growth boosts the recipient's Special Attack to scary levels, while Acid Armor boosts Defense to render the normally threatening Snorlax unable to do meaningful damage in return. Vaporeon is a great user of Baton Pass because, aside from Roar Suicune, no other popular phazer is capable of stopping Vaporeon from passing its boosts without taking a lot of damage from a boosted Hydro Pump or Surf. Even then, Suicune can be beaten by using Roar on Baton Pass Vaporeon. However, Raikou will usually make life difficult for a Baton Pass set. While it can't comfortably use Roar against Vaporeon without taking a lot of damage in return, it will do tons of damage to Vaporeon if it decides to stay in against Raikou, and it can tank most special attacking Baton Pass targets, even at +1. Zapdos is also a tough foe for Baton Pass Vaporeon; it cannot tank +1 special attackers the way Raikou can, but it does heavy damage to Vaporeon if it decides to stay in to use its slower Baton Pass, thereby preventing Vaporeon from trying again later in the match.</p> <p>The classic pre-Growth defensive Vaporeon set of Rest, Surf, Haze, and Reflect is an option for those who want a Suicune with worse defenses but better support moves. However, Vaporeon is better off using Growth to play offensively than trying to be a Suicune, especially since it was BL before the advent of Growth.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most of Vaporeon's common checks don't wall it completely, but rather threaten to smash its face in. Zapdos and Raikou are the most common checks and can 2HKO with their STABs. However, they can't take too many Surfs or Hydro Pumps on the switch. Snorlax is the second most common answer to Vaporeon, but it's a shaky check. Snorlax is 3HKOed by a +1 Hydro Pump and Acid Armor variants of Vaporeon beat it without relying on a move with iffy accuracy. Exeggutor is a good stop-gap against Vaporeon but won't last forever. It's easily targeted by Pursuit, dies quickly to Ice Beam Vaporeon, and if Spikes are down it will eventually be put into +1 Surf or Hydro Pump KO range. Cloyster can outspeed Vaporeon and Explode on it, but Cloyster isn't doing anything to stop Vaporeon without sacrificing itself with Explosion. Gengar 3HKOes with an Electric-type attack, and can Explode or use Destiny Bond if things go south, although it struggles to take Vaporeon's attacks. As for less common checks, Tentacruel resists Surf and sets up a counter-sweep with Swords Dance. Dragonite resists Surf and threatens Vaporeon with Thunder and Double-Edge, but loses to Ice Beam variants. Heracross outspeeds Vaporeon and very narrowly misses out on 2HKOing it at full health, although Acid Armor mitigates this damage and Heracross has trouble switching into Vaporeon.</p> <p>While Vaporeon is usually countered by using high damage output, there are quite a few Pokemon that wall it entirely. Roar Suicune is the most common full stop to Vaporeon, although it fails to stop last-Pokemon Vaporeon or variants that use Roar themselves. Suicune can also play to freeze Vaporeon with both Ice Beam and Mirror Coat, with Mirror Coat keeping Vaporeon wary of attacking while Suicune tries to freeze it. Aside from Suicune, Light Screen Blissey can help teammates such as Zapdos to switch more easily into Vaporeon. It can also try to outstall Vaporeon, but Blissey will usually lose the PP war and, on turns when Light Screen wears off, a combination of a high damage roll and a critical hit from a +5 Surf will put Blissey in KO range on the following turn. Vaporeon can also use Ice Beam to freeze Blissey. At the very least, Light Screen Blissey will be difficult to defeat for Hydro Pump Vaporeon and its meager 8 PP. Starmie resists Surf and can use Thunder hoping for three consecutive hits to 3HKO Vaporeon or Light Screen to flat-out stall Vaporeon out of PP. Starmie, unlike Blissey, can outstall Vaporeon because of Rapid Spin's high PP. As for less common walls to Vaporeon, Meganium can wall Vaporeon with Leech Seed, Synthesis, and possibly Light Screen, although Ice Beam Vaporeon can beat it. In addition, Kingdra can Curse in Vaporeon's face, uses Haze, or even go for the freeze with Ice Beam while only being 5HKOed by +5 Surfs, although it can be 2HKOed by +5 Ice Beams or stalled out by Acid Armor variants.</p> <p>Furthermore, Vaporeon is a good check to itself. Even after switching in to give the opposing Vaporeon a turn advantage, a Sleep Talking Vaporeon has only slightly less than even odds at beating an opposing Sleep Talk Vaporeon and better odds if the opposing Vaporeon is not a Sleep Talking variant. +4 Surf and +3 Hydro Pump both 3HKO an opposing Vaporeon, so boost this far before you stop setting up and start attacking. Alternatively, you can just use Roar so that you can phaze opposing Vaporeon after you gather a couple of boosts in the Growth war.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Growth Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>Vaporeon is a unique offensive Pokemon in GSC OU. It's a legitimate special threat that can take a hit and can set up with Growth. Unlike the legendary Electric-types that are GSC's other prominent special threats, Vaporeon is more geared towards setting up and sweeping rather than scoring opportunistic KOs. Vaporeon sets up on the special side, which makes it immune to stall tactics such as Growl and Charm, as opposed to other reliable setup Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax. Dissimilar to more daring setup Pokemon such as Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak, Vaporeon is able to break stall while having an easy-to-use setup move and the ability to take hits.</p> <p>Vaporeon's STAB is the choice between reliability and power. Hydro Pump is great for wallbreaking. It can 3HKO Snorlax after a single Growth and it also does 36-43% to Raikou without a boost, meaning that if Spikes are down and Vaporeon's Hydro Pump connects, Raikou can only afford to switch in once more before having to use Rest. Surf, on the other hand, isn't going to miss and doesn't suffer from Hydro Pump's horrendous 8 PP. Growth is the whole point of the set, allowing Vaporeon to take advantage of its good defenses and set up the sweep. Rest keeps it alive and gives it the longevity that allows it to play defensively and to set up when needed. As for the fourth move, Sleep Talk is the standard and keeps Vaporeon around to tank hits from Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon. Furthermore, Sleep Talk also minimizes downtime when trying to set up. Acid Armor, however, beats CurseLax in a head-to-head match-up. Acid Armor is also nice for PP wars with its incredible 61 PP, and buffers Vaporeon against other dangerous physical attackers such as Heracross, Machamp, and Explosion users.</p> <p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Umbreon get rid of Exeggutor, a prominent Pokemon with a resistance to Water-type attacks that also has the offensive prowess to force Vaporeon to switch out. Tyranitar in particular can also chip away at Zapdos and Raikou, which force Vaporeon out with strong STAB Electric-type moves, but can be rendered unable to switch in on Vaporeon with some residual damage. Other great partners for Vaporeon are offensive Explosion users; Exeggutor and Steelix frequently target Zapdos with their Explosions, Gengar commonly takes down Raikou, Steelix and Self-Destruct Snorlax can KO Roar Suicune, and Cloyster has a good chance of taking out any of these threats. Paralyzing Raikou and weakening Snorlax can also go a long way towards helping Vaporeon pick up the pieces. Thunder or Thunder Wave from Zapdos or even your own Raikou can paralyze an opposing Raikou, while the combination of Toxic and Spikes will eventually force Snorlax to Rest, giving Vaporeon an opening to set up against it.</p> <p>When using Vaporeon, it's vital to use prediction to beat its checks. When you predict an Electric-type switch-in, use Vaporeon's STAB move; even without a boost, Vaporeon's STAB does a lot to Zapdos and Raikou, especially if Vaporeon is using Hydro Pump. When you expect Snorlax, use Growth. Vaporeon isn't scaring Snorlax with an unboosted STAB move, but Snorlax isn't instantly forcing Vaporeon out either, especially not Acid Armor variants, so having the Special Attack boost can put a Snorlax switch-in in a pretty awkward position, particularly if Vaporeon is touting Hydro Pump's potential 3HKO. If some other wall such as Roar Suicune or a high-health Exeggutor is going to switch in, Vaporeon should duck out and give the opportunity to another Pokemon to do its damage. Suicune is a fine double-switch opportunity for Roar Raikou to start Spikes shuffling or Cloyster to set up its Spikes, whereas Exeggutor is put in a bind if you predict and double-switch to a Pursuit user such as Tyranitar. If the opponent has none of these available, Vaporeon is free to sweep, so just set up Growths and finish the job. This includes situations where the opponent is using Blissey to try to wall Vaporeon, as Blissey cannot stop Vaporeon from setting up to the point where a single critical hit can destroy it, never mind the fact that Vaporeon wins most stall wars against Blissey by virtue of Growth's titanic PP count.</p> <p>Vaporeon can use other moves effectively in the last moveslot. Thanks to GSC's phazing mechanics, Vaporeon's slower Roar prevents Roar Suicune from phazing it. Roar also allows Vaporeon to win mirror matches and can also be used to Spikes-shuffle with Vaporeon's ability to force switches. Ice Beam is an excellent coverage option for destroying Exeggutor, Dragonite, and Zapdos. The ability to freeze foes such as Suicune and Blissey can also facilitate a sweep. However, Sleep Talk or Acid Armor is generally the way to go.</p> "

  "Jolteon": {
    "overview": "<p>As a pure Electric-type, Jolteon faces heavy competition from Raikou due to the latter's better bulk and power, which means that it outclasses Jolteon as a special wall and as a phazer. Furthermore, the popularity of other Electric-types such as Zapdos makes Pokemon like Steelix and once again Raikou popular, which hinders Jolteon even more. However, there's still a reason why Jolteon is viable in OU: Baton Pass. With boosting moves such as Agility and Growth, a sky-high Speed stat, and an Electric STAB attack that allows it to pressure common phazers like Skarmory and Suicune, Jolteon makes for a very effective user of this move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is useful for taking advantage of Gengar and Electric-types that lack phazing moves, as these foes are unable to break Jolteon's Substitutes consistently, which can give it time to set up Growth boosts safely. Although it's outclassed as a defensively oriented phazer, Jolteon can still make good use of Roar by lowering its Speed below 328 in order to be slower than Raikou and prevent it from phazing Jolteon; it can possibly even drop it to 320, since some Roar variants of Raikou lower their Speed for the same reason. Be wary of going further, though; at 319 Speed, Jolteon will merely Speed tie with Gengar if both are paralyzed. This move can also be a pain for other answers like Snorlax and Steelix if used in tandem with Spikes. Rest is an option that allows Jolteon to switch in on Thunder without taking the huge risk of being crippled by paralysis for the rest of the game and improves Jolteon's chances of sweeping late-game with Growth if it has a solid defensive core to back it up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Raikou: Preventing Jolteon from passing any boosts is the best way to check it. Roar Raikou is arguably Jolteon's worst nightmare, since Raikou can take numerous hits from Jolteon and only really fears paralysis from it. Raikou can also attempt to paralyze Jolteon with its own Thunder, which if successful is a death sentence for Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Other Phazers</strong>: Steelix is another phazer that deals heavy damage with STAB Earthquake if Jolteon tries to stay in, but it takes a significant amount of damage from Hidden Power Water in return. Tyranitar is bulky enough to withstand three Thunders most of the time, enabling it to phaze Jolteon at least once or go for either the 3HKO with Rock Slide or the 2HKO with Earthquake if it carries it, but just like Steelix, it will have to check other Pokemon too and thus can be worn down pretty quickly. Rhydon and Golem also pack Roar most of the time and can be used as emergency checks to Jolteon, since they can both take a Hidden Power Water at full health and threaten Jolteon with their STAB Earthquake, which is an OHKO most of the time. None of these phazers are completely safe against Jolteon, so it is important to always consider the risk of allowing Jolteon to get away with the Baton Pass against the risk of allowing it to land a hit on your phazer. Sometimes it can be best to try to trade hits or to use Explosion instead of phazing Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Pokemon: Snorlax, Exeggutor, Nidoking, and Marowak are all common offensive Pokemon that can throw out powerful hits, spread sleep and paralysis, and use Explosion or boosting moves in front of Jolteon.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire: Quagsire, although far less common, walls Jolteon but isn't as immediately powerful as the aforementioned Pokemon, so it usually doesn't threaten the recipient as much.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Most special walls can shut down Jolteon, since it doesn't hit hard enough to keep them at bay. Blissey can threaten Jolteon and most of its recipients with Sing and Toxic, and it can be very painful for Growth Pass teams to face if it has Light Screen or Present. Umbreon ensures that physically oriented Baton Pass recipients won't pose much of a threat with Charm, but it has to watch out for the potential paralysis from Thunder and for some recipients like Belly Drum Snorlax or other Belly Drum users, which can overpower it.</p> <p><strong>Meganium and Venusaur: Meganium and Venusaur, although uncommon, can cripple any switch-in with Leech Seed and use either a screen or Sleep Powder to neutralize the foe.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set exploits Jolteon's main advantages over Raikou, with Baton Pass being the selling point. Jolteon itself doesn't benefit from Agility due to its natural Speed; it's meant to be passed to a slower Pokemon that could attempt a sweep. Alternatively, Jolteon becomes more individually threatening with Growth because of its Speed and the damage output of a boosted Thunder. The type of Hidden Power depends on your team, but because Steelix is one of Jolteon's biggest problems, Hidden Power Water is often the preferred option, as it allows Jolteon to 3HKO it, as well as doing plenty of damage to Rhydon and Golem, which are even more threatening offensively. Hidden Power Ice, on the other hand, gives better overall coverage and dents dangerous Pokemon like Exeggutor. Similarly, the choice between Thunder and Thunderbolt is based on personal preference. Thunder hits much harder, especially when boosted by Growth, and is more likely to land paralysis on opposing Pokemon like Raikou, whereas Thunderbolt is a weaker but safer option.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jolteon's access to multiple boosting moves can be worrying at first for your opponent, but you must keep in mind that once you've revealed the boosting move, your opponent can get a pretty clear idea of the remaining members of your team if you haven't shown them already. Jolteon is best paired with slow and powerful Pokemon if using Agility or with other special attackers if using Growth. In the former case, common partners include Machamp, Belly Drum Snorlax, and especially Marowak, with which it forms a well-known combination called \"JoltWak\". Growth Jolteon's teammates, like Exeggutor, Gengar, and Jynx, will probably not sweep an entire team at +1, but they will potentially be able to overpower their usual answers, especially if they manage to put them to sleep. Nidoking deserves a special mention for its ability to immediately threaten Raikou, arguably the best special wall overall, while still benefiting from Growth, since boosted Ice Beam and Thunder are much more punishing for Zapdos and Suicune. Finally, Jolteon makes for an excellent addition to dedicated Baton Pass teams alongside Smeargle and to a lesser extent Scizor and Umbreon.</p> "

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Behold, the single most dominant Pokemon in any OU tier in history. Snorlax combines power and resilience with deadly unpredictability, a set of traits that lands it a spot on virtually all serious teams. Its presence defines the GSC metagame, all but forcing teams to play one or more sturdy Normal-resistant Pokemon while simultaneously killing off the viability of manifold special attackers with its enormous HP and sky-high Special Defense. Snorlax is a constant threat to offensive teams as a Curse sweeper, a team sweeping machine as a Belly Drum user, a relentless battering ram as a mixed attacker, and a reliable wall as a RestTalk user. However, it isn't completely unstoppable. Snorlax's Defense stat is on the low side, meaning that despite its massive HP stat, Explosion from common OU Pokemon like Cloyster and Exeggutor is enough to take it out with minimal prior damage. It will usually be forced to use Rest if it gets poisoned, giving the opposing team a reprieve that they can use to gain an advantage. Defensive teams will nearly always have Skarmory for Snorlax and usually pair it with a semi-reliable counter to mixed Snorlax as well, which can sometimes leave Snorlax unable to do any meaningful damage by itself. However, make no mistake: these constitute but minor flaws among Snorlax's array of overwhelmingly powerful attributes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While the sets above represent most of what Snorlax can do effectively, there are times when using other sets makes sense. A Snorlax with a STAB attack and two coverage attacks alongside Rest is a viable option, particularly on more defensive teams where a different mixed attacker such as Nidoking cannot easily be used to capitalize off of Spikes support, or where Toxic would be wasted on Snorlax due to its teammates' ability to spread paralysis. Some attack combinations that can be used include Double-Edge / Thunder / Fire Blast, which punishes both Cloyster and Forretress and only falters against Rock- and Ghost-types; Double-Edge / Earthquake / Flamethrower or Fire Blast, which can get past all but the sturdiest physical walls given enough free turns; and Double-Edge / Earthquake / Thunder, which is also very difficult to stop in the long run and is better at getting past sturdy Pokemon with Thunder's paralysis chance, but such a combination takes much longer to KO Forretress, a trait that can cause problems in longer games. Lovely Kiss can also be utilized over one of the coverage moves for the surprise factor, which can be extremely effective due to the long potential sleep duration. However, these sets can be less reliable than those with just two coverage moves, as their effectiveness relies in part on surprising an opponent with more coverage than anticipated—once the set has been revealed and the opponent is able to work out a plan regarding how to check these mixed sets, Snorlax's inability to boost its stats or trade with Self-Destruct can limit its effectiveness during the later phases of a game, particularly when it comes to fighting opposing Snorlax. Moreover, relying on coverage rather than Toxic forces one to land multiple Earthquakes rather than a single Toxic to wear down Misdreavus and Rock-types.</p> <p>A variation of all-out attacker Snorlax that can be used to surprise particular kinds of teams is Curse / Double-Edge / Fire Blast / Self-Destruct or Lovely Kiss. This variant is particularly effective at taking apart teams that depend on Miltank or Umbreon + Skarmory to handle Snorlax, since they depend on Lovely Kiss Snorlax not having coverage for Skarmory. However, this set has major issues against Ghost- and Rock-types and is therefore not a common choice.</p> <p>Dropping Rest for a move other than Self-Destruct is also an option for numerous other sets, though this removes much of Snorlax's defensive capabilities and is very risky due to the possibility of being inflicted with poison. Nonetheless, it can prove to be a very effective option if utilized well. One moveset that does this is Curse / Lovely Kiss / Double-Edge / Earthquake. To get the most out of this set, it is best to find an opportunity for Snorlax to come in unscathed and to have hopefully weakened or at least identified the opponent's initial answers to Curselax, which are often Spikers with Toxic. If the opponent has Skarmory, this set is much less likely to work, but landing Lovely Kiss on it may induce your opponent to switch to a secondary Normal-resistant Pokemon, at which point Snorlax should have enough Curse boosts to inflict heavy damage with Earthquake. Many more offensive teams will only have a single Normal-resistant Pokemon, in which case this set is particularly effective—they will likely be forced to use multiple Explosions to avoid being swept by your boosted Snorlax. To avoid potential coverage woes against Skarmory, this set can also use Fire Blast over Lovely Kiss, but the risk of being poisoned is extremely high, so it is worth considering using it alongside a Heal Bell user.</p> <p>Another variant of the set uses Lovely Kiss / Belly Drum / Return / Earthquake. This set works best on teams that can pass Speed boosts to Snorlax with Baton Pass, but it can also be used on teams with very sturdy defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and a spinner. Once Snorlax receives a +2 Speed boost from a teammate, the only OU Pokemon it is outsped by are Gengar, Raikou, and Starmie, and there are few Pokemon it can't OHKO. On defensive teams, it is used to sweep the opposing team once the opponent's offense has been neutralized or an opportunity arises otherwise. The advantage this set has is that it is almost completely unstoppable defensively as long as Lovely Kiss hits Skarmory, but the disadvantage is that Snorlax is entirely reliant on Leftovers to recover its health. This can be made easier by using Protect instead of Lovely Kiss, an option that functions best with Body Slam as the complementing STAB attack. This set works well on more aggressive teams as a general offensive threat, but it faces major issues against Skarmory. With Protect, Snorlax can nullify Explosions aimed at it after it has used Belly Drum. This set is also quite good at using Belly Drum to gain +2 Attack when under 50% health thanks to its ability to get extra Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Snorlax can also use Curse together with Belly Drum, which theoretically allows it to boost its Defense against a Growl or Charm user before boosting to 999 Attack. Additionally, once you have shown Curse, no one will expect that Snorlax's last move is Belly Drum under any normal circumstances, so there is surprise value to be gained from using both boosting moves. However, the downside is that this restricts Snorlax to using a STAB move as its only attack, meaning Normal-resistant phazers will easily dispatch of Snorlax.</p> <p>Belly Drum Snorlax can also make use of Mega Kick over Return when receiving a Speed boost to secure a few extra notable OHKOs, such as against Suicune and Umbreon, as well as gaining a chance to OHKO Cloyster. Double-Edge has the same power as Mega Kick, but the recoil makes it a poor choice on a Belly Drum Snorlax that lacks Rest and is going all-in on a sweep. The obvious downside to Mega Kick is having to rely on an attack with imperfect accuracy. Counter can also be used on Snorlax as a surprise option that can potentially take out opposing Snorlax and do more damage than expected to many physical attackers thanks to its high HP. Counter also comes with the added benefit of preventing any faster Pokemon from phazing Snorlax, which can be used to regain Snorlax's health against non-Toxic Skarmory and force it to use a lot of PP to get rid of Snorlax. However, this comes at the very significant cost of a moveslot, and the benefits of the move are mostly reliant on surprise value, so it is far from a standard option.</p> <p>Finally, Snorlax can use Defense Curl with Rollout, a combination that many defensive teams will fail to prepare for due to its obscurity. This is one of the only Snorlax sets that can best combinations such as Curse Skarmory + non-Perish Song Misdreavus as the last remaining Pokemon, although Snorlax will struggle to contribute anything other than being a glorified punching bag prior to when it can no longer be phazed. For a fourth move alongside Rest, Snorlax can use Amnesia to ensure that Growth users, Pokemon like Zapdos, and Pokemon that can lower its Special Defense with Psychic can't get past it. Alternatively, Counter gives it a fighting chance against Pokemon that can boost with Curse alongside it like Machamp, Heracross, and opposing Snorlax. No matter which option is chosen, there will be some strategy that beats it, so going with this set is a risky decision and thus not recommended in most cases.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Skarmory: Due to its high Defense, resistance to Normal, and immunity to Earthquake, Skarmory is considered the best answer to Snorlax. This unique combination of traits virtually necessitates its inclusion on defensive teams. Almost any purely physical Curselax variation is soundly beaten by standard Curse Skarmory. However, it is unable to contain Snorlax that target its weaker Special Defense with Fire Blast, Thunder, or Flamethrower—the former two are likely to 2HKO Skarmory, whereas Flamethrower guarantees a 3HKO. Even without Curse, Skarmory still fares well against Curselax, since it can simply phaze Snorlax to nullify any Curse boosts. However, if Curselax is the last remaining Pokemon, Skarmory will have no way of stopping it from boosting to maximum power, so it's wise to have a contingency plan, such as running Growl Miltank, Charm Umbreon, or Perish Song Misdreavus. Skarmory is also the best defensive check to Drumlax, although it is not a safe counter by any means. +6 Body Slam from Snorlax is a 3HKO on Skarmory and threatens to paralyze it, whereas +6 Double-Edge can 2HKO an unboosted Skarmory and potentially 3HKO it at +1 Defense. Consequently, it is crucial to time Skarmory's Rest such that it will wake up before Drumlax can KO it. Snorlax can also utilize Lovely Kiss alongside either Curse or Belly Drum to help it overcome Skarmory. One adaptation Skarmory can make against Lovely Kiss Snorlax is to run Sleep Talk and Curse, although this typically entails forgoing Whirlwind. Lastly, Snorlax is capable of luring Skarmory and using Curse with Self-Destruct to land a surprise KO, which can pave the way for Pokemon like Curse Heracross to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Other Normal-resistant Phazers</strong>: Pokemon that resist Normal such as Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem make for solid checks to Snorlax with their high Defense and powerful STAB attacks. However, they struggle to beat Earthquake Curselax when switching in, meaning it is often most practical to take a hit and phaze away its boosts with Roar. Steelix takes less damage from Earthquake than its Rock-type counterparts but has a weakness to Fire, making it particularly susceptible to Curselax that have a Fire-type move. Both Steelix and Golem have access to Explosion, which they can use to deal heavy damage to Snorlax,  but if Snorlax has one or more Curse boosts, Explosion may be insufficient to put it into the KO range of a teammate's follow-up attack. Tyranitar can use Dynamic Punch to deal an unexpectedly large amount of damage to Snorlax, but its low accuracy makes it very unreliable. When used on defensive teams, Rock-type Pokemon are often paired with Skarmory due to their ability to cover Snorlax with Fire-type moves, while Skarmory can cover Earthquake Snorlax. However, sets such as Toxic Snorlax can be used to overcome this combination in the long run if the Rock-type is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Forretress: Cloyster and Forretress are often among the first Pokemon to switch into Snorlax early in the game due to the possible opportunity to lay down Spikes. Although neither of them actually beat Snorlax one-on-one with their standard sets, their extremely high Defense stats can make it difficult for Snorlax to take them out quickly, and they pose a threat to Snorlax with Toxic and Explosion. Even if Snorlax sets up numerous Curse boosts in the face of Cloyster or Forretress, if it is poisoned and Spikes are up, Snorlax will be forced to use Rest or risk being unable to switch in safely for the remainder of the game. However, Cloyster must beware of the threat of Double-Edge + Thunder from Snorlax, the combination of which has a high chance to KO it. Forretress must likewise beware of an outright OHKO from Fire Blast, whereas Flamethrower also does very heavy damage. Snorlax can also use Lovely Kiss to potentially deny Spikes entirely. While both Spikers are very physically bulky, Cloyster still takes hefty damage from a boosted Snorlax's STAB attacks, whereas Forretress takes little damage from everything other than its Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Misdreavus are very useful to have against Snorlax thanks to their Normal immunity. Gengar can threaten Snorlax with Dynamic Punch, Explosion, Hypnosis, Thief, and Destiny Bond, and if Snorlax lacks Earthquake, it can attempt to inflict a devastating freeze by using Ice Punch repeatedly. Misdreavus poses a big threat to Snorlax with Mean Look + Perish Song, especially considering even +1 Earthquake from Snorlax doesn't reliably 2HKO it. Apart from Perish trapping, Misdreavus also threatens Snorlax with Toxic and Thief, which diminish Snorlax's longevity through negating its Leftovers recovery. Neither Gengar nor Misdreavus take much damage from any of Snorlax's attacks other than Earthquake, but Misdreavus tends to be better equipped to take Snorlax on in the long run, having the option to choose between Pain Split and Rest for recovery, whereas Gengar can get worn down by mixed Snorlax's special attacks and typically runs Explosion rather than a recovery move. If Misdreavus has Rest, not even Toxic Snorlax will be able to wear it down, and in general, Snorlax without Earthquake will have to rely on Pursuit support, which is far from a reliable method to take down either of the Ghost-types. Gengar is also notably the only common Explosion user that outspeeds a Snorlax that has been Baton Passed +2 Speed, which can allow it to shut down a Snorlax that might otherwise be able to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Miltank and Umbreon</strong>: Miltank and Umbreon both have the bulk to take any of Snorlax's attacks on the switch, can negate any Curse boosts with Growl or Charm, and can recover off any damage with Milk Drink or Rest. While they sometimes fear paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder, they can cure themselves with Heal Bell and Rest if they avoid full paralysis, and Miltank can even cure its teammates of status inflictions. Miltank must beware of Lovely Kiss, but Umbreon makes for a solid check to Lovely Kiss Curselax if it has Sleep Talk. However, Snorlax is capable of getting past them in the long run with timely critical hits, especially if it has Double-Edge. Additionally, Drumlax can bypass Growl and Charm entirely and instantly become an existential threat to one's team, so it is best to have Skarmory as a contingency plan and stay wary of the possibility that Snorlax may have Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: While it doesn't want to switch into Snorlax's powerful STAB attacks, Machamp poses a unique threat to Snorlax due to its access to Cross Chop, which has a 25% chance to critical hit and OHKO Snorlax regardless of how many Curse boosts it has set up. Even if it fails to score a critical hit, Machamp's unboosted Cross Chop scores a 2HKO on +0 and a 3HKO on +1 Defense Snorlax, a feat that few other Pokemon can achieve. Aggressively switching Machamp into a boosted Curselax about to use Rest can therefore prevent it from safely burning any sleep turns, which is key to preventing Curselax from regaining momentum after it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: Explosion is an extremely powerful tool that is often crucial to beating Snorlax without having to resort to using a momentum killer like Skarmory. Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Gengar all struggle to deal much damage to Snorlax with their special attacks, but Gengar's Explosion does at least 68% to an unboosted Snorlax, while Cloyster and Exeggutor can possibly OHKO it outright. Golem, Steelix, and Forretress don't have special attacks for Snorlax to try to wall, but they are useful for reacting to Snorlax's attempts to set up and forcing the Snorlax user to guess whether they will use Explosion or simply phaze, poison, or attack it. Another Explosion user that fits into neither category is Muk. Its Explosion is likely to be more telegraphed against Snorlax, but it can be used as a deterrent nonetheless. The fact that Explosion used by a faster Pokemon prevents the opposing Pokemon from moving that turn also contributes to its effectiveness against Snorlax, preventing the possibility that Snorlax could predict it and Rest the damage off. Explosion is particularly effective against Drumlax, since it must sacrifice half its health to set up and Explosion can easily finish it off, which can lead to some high-stakes mind games. It is less effective against a Snorlax that has already set up a Curse boost, but it will often do enough damage that a teammate will be able to finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon such as Suicune, Porygon2, and Dragonite can be used to neutralize or stall out some Snorlax variants. Toxic Suicune makes for a decent initial answer to an unknown Snorlax because it can inflict it—or another Pokemon that switches in—with poison and is not significantly impeded by any possible surprise move that Snorlax may be running, such as Fire Blast or Lovely Kiss. Porygon2 can use Curse and Recover to stall out an opposing Snorlax's attacking PP thanks to Recover's 32 PP. Even a critical hit will not be enough to take out a full-health Porygon2, meaning that unless Snorlax has a method of inflicting status on Porygon2, it will usually be unable to break through Porygon2's defenses. Dragonite can use a RestTalk set with Reflect and Haze to neutralize any of Snorlax's boosting attempts and set up opportunities for its teammates. However, Dragonite is susceptible to being taken out by a critical hit from Double-Edge due to its partial reliance on Sleep Talk choosing the correct moves, its complete lack of offensive presence, and Reflect not reducing critical hit damage. Lastly, Vaporeon is not particularly bulky and should definitely not be switching into Snorlax, but with the combination of Growth and Acid Armor, it can become one of the few special attackers that can beat Snorlax one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Snorlax: Some Snorlax variants have distinct advantages over others. For example, a Curselax with Body Slam is highly unlikely to be able to beat a Curselax with Double-Edge because Body Slam fails to 4HKO once both Snorlax have maxed out their stats. Lovely Kiss Snorlax can be very effective against opposing Curselax by outspeeding it and putting it to sleep for up to six turns. Lastly, Snorlax's incredibly powerful Self-Destruct is easily enough to take out an opposing Snorlax in a single hit, although this comes with the downside of losing one's own Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Marowak and Heracross</strong>: Marowak and Heracross are two of the most powerful physical attackers in the tier and can hit Snorlax hard with their powerful STAB attacks. Neither of them are very good at switching into Snorlax, but Heracross's Megahorn 3HKOes it and Marowak's Earthquake has a small chance of 2HKOing it at +0 and about a 50% chance of OHKOing it at +2. This makes them excellent choices for switching in at the same time Snorlax does or when Snorlax is about to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos does not check Snorlax effectively, but its presence can be key for offensive teams in keeping Snorlax from becoming overbearing. Its powerful Thunder does up to 32% damage to Snorlax and can also inflict paralysis. The fact that Zapdos can do so much damage to Snorlax regardless of how many Curse boosts it may have accrued is often depended on to finish off a Snorlax that has been weakened by Explosion. It also has a strong influence on when Snorlax decides to use Rest, since if it has Double-Edge and is at around 70% health, it will have to be careful to avoid getting KOed by two Thunders from Zapdos in combination with Double-Edge's recoil. Moreover, if Snorlax chooses to use Rest and then switches out without burning any sleep turns, it can no longer switch into Zapdos's Thunder safely due to potentially being 4HKOed before it can wake up. While unlikely, it's notable that Zapdos is also capable of 3HKOing Snorlax with Thunder if one lands a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Thief</strong>: Pokemon such as Jynx, Gengar, Nidoking, Exeggutor, and Skarmory can enter battle with no item and then proceed to steal Snorlax's Leftovers, which sharply decreases its longevity, makes it a much shakier check to numerous special attackers, and makes it more susceptible to being worn down with residual damage from Spikes and Toxic.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Curselax",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Curselax is the standard Snorlax set, and for good reason. Before using Curse, Snorlax is already hitting hard and can trade hits quite well with the majority of Pokemon. After a Curse boost, Snorlax can dish out 2HKOs against nearly any foe that doesn't resist its STAB Double-Edge or Return or threaten to paralyze the opposing Pokemon with Body Slam and outspeed it. Not only does it become a menace offensively, but it also becomes nigh impenetrable defensively, raising its previously low Defense stat higher than its formidable Special Defense. For Pokemon that resist or are immune to Snorlax's STAB attacks, its diverse pool of coverage attacks has something for every Pokemon—just not all at once. A solid choice for its coverage move is Earthquake, which can be used to get past Rock- and Steel-type phazers like Tyranitar, Steelix, and Rhydon. After a Curse boost, it OHKOes Gengar and sometimes 2HKOes Misdreavus. However, should Curselax hope to get past Skarmory, Earthquake will not be enough. Fire Blast usually 2HKOes Skarmory and OHKOes Forretress while still hitting Steelix hard, although its low PP and imperfect accuracy leave Snorlax susceptible to being PP stalled by a clever opponent. Flamethrower is an alternative that misses the aforementioned benchmarks and is therefore harder to get surprise KOs with, but given its greater accuracy and PP, it is more certain to get the job done in the long run. Unfortunately, these Fire-type moves leave Curselax without a good option against Rock-types such as Rhydon and Tyranitar and can cause it to struggle against Gengar and Misdreavus. Yet another option for Skarmory is Thunder, which also has the major benefit of potentially landing a KO on Cloyster if it switches into Double-Edge and can inflict crippling paralysis on Ghost-types. However, it comes with the major drawback of leaving Snorlax without a useful attack against Steelix, Rhydon, Golem, and Forretress. Lovely Kiss is another option that provides both offensive and defensive utility. Although it comes at the significant cost of coverage, Curselax's ability to muscle its way past common Sleep Talk users like Zapdos and Suicune makes it possible to land crippling sleep on a desirable target, something other sleep move users sometimes struggle to do. Furthermore, despite its lack of coverage, Lovely Kiss Curselax can potentially break through even Normal-resistant Pokemon by chipping away at their health while they sleep. Moreover, to a greater extent than other Curselax variants can, Lovely Kiss Curselax can check opposing Snorlax by putting it to sleep. Finally, Rest is needed to keep Snorlax healthy. Unlike most Pokemon in GSC OU, Snorlax has the defensive stats needed to pull off the turns of passivity required for Rest without Sleep Talk, especially with a Curse boost under its belt.</p> <p>Snorlax's choice of a STAB attack comes down to the rest of your team and how you intend to use your Snorlax. Double-Edge is considered the default choice due to its high power, reliably 3HKOing Zapdos when unboosted and coming close to a 2HKO on Cloyster at +1 Attack. It is also the optimal choice for facing opposing Curselax in the common mirror match, substantially decreasing the odds that the opposing Snorlax can switch in on Curse and come out the winner and guaranteeing that an opposing Curselax with an equal number of Curse boosts will be KOed in three hits if one of them is a critical hit. However, Return has its merits when trading hits with mixed attackers and strong special attackers, as the recoil from Double-Edge can sometimes turn attacking into a risk. This is especially relevant when Snorlax is using a special coverage attack and therefore only has one powerful physical option against threats like Nidoking and Raikou. Lastly, Body Slam can be incredibly useful with its ability to inflict paralysis, especially when paired with sweepers that benefit from it such as Machamp and Marowak, but it should be kept in mind that it is a substantially weaker option. For example, unboosted Body Slam cannot 3HKO Zapdos. Moreover, Snorlax with Body Slam relies on paralysis to defeat opposing Curselax—unlike Return and Double-Edge, when both Curselax have maxed out their boosts, Body Slam has no chance to 3HKO the opposing Snorlax with just a single critical hit.</p> <p>One final notable attribute of Curselax is its effectiveness when it is the last remaining Pokemon on one's team. If Curselax is healthy and the opponent is lacking the means to remove it quickly, Pokemon that rely on phazing it to beat it will falter, potentially allowing Curselax to overcome many of its usual counters, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar that don't have Curse, despite lacking a coverage move to hit them with.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Being the most popular set on the most popular Pokemon in its tier, Curselax is naturally a very flexible Pokemon and can be used on all kinds of teams. Once its fourth move is revealed, however, it tends to become a lot less threatening against more defensive teams, which tend to ensure Curselax variants are covered thoroughly. Defensive teams also often depend on Snorlax as a major source of offensive pressure, which can lead them to choose to use Snorlax variants that are harder to handle than Curselax. An exception to this is Fire Blast or Flamethrower Curselax, which can theoretically muscle through the majority of its counters, especially with Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Umbreon, or Houndoom and Spikes support from Cloyster or Forretress. Lovely Kiss Curselax similarly appreciates Pursuit support and can potentially help ensure an opposing Ghost-type goes down by putting it to sleep.</p> <p>When used on more offensive teams, Curselax appreciates being paired with Pokemon that can be used to take Explosions aimed at it, such as Steelix, Tyranitar, and Gengar. It similarly appreciates Pokemon that can take a Cross Chop from Machamp and threaten it in return, such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. Additionally, as Curselax can rarely break a defensive core on its own, it helps to pair it with a Spiker and mixed attackers such as Nidoking, Tentacruel, and Tyranitar, or boosting sweepers such as Machamp, Marowak, and Vaporeon, which can then either help Snorlax become relevant offensively by pressuring Snorlax's checks or fall back on Snorlax's defensive capabilities when they find themselves in an unfavorable matchup. Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor and Fire Blast Machamp also make for good choices when trying to help an Earthquake or Lovely Kiss Snorlax become offensively potent against an opposing team with Skarmory.</p> "

      {
        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set functions by augmenting Snorlax's already-incredible defensive capabilities with Sleep Talk. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk provides Snorlax with greater ability to sponge the myriad special attacks in GSC OU, including those from Zapdos, one of the tier's premier threats. Without Sleep Talk, Snorlax cannot switch repeatedly into Zapdos's Thunder—especially with Spikes up—without having to use Rest, putting it out of commission for two turns and leaving its user in a precarious position against various threats. This set reduces the burden of having to take Zapdos's Thunder for one's team by reducing Snorlax's downtime while asleep. In addition, Sleep Talk turns Snorlax into an excellent status absorber, allowing it to check major threats like Nidoking and Jynx. It can also take Sleep Powder from Exeggutor, though it must be wary of Explosion. With Curse as its fourth move, it also performs better than most standard Curselax variants in a mirror match, as its ability to use moves while asleep denies the opposing Curselax as many opportunities to gain unanswered boosts or land unanswered critical hits. It should be noted, however, that even if a RestTalk Snorlax has Curse and Double-Edge, it typically matches up poorly against a Curse + Lovely Kiss Snorlax, which has a degree of control over when RestTalk Snorlax goes to sleep and can also take advantage of the uncertainties of random sleep duration and Sleep Talk rolls.</p> <p>Double-Edge is the preferred STAB option on this set due to the increased pressure it puts on Zapdos and other bulky Pokemon. Body Slam could also be used for its ability to inflict paralysis, but it comes at the major cost of a disadvantage against opposing Double-Edge Curselax, as well as being unable to 3HKO Zapdos without a Curse boost. The standard option for the fourth move on RestTalk Snorlax is Curse, which provides it with a solid matchup against most variants of enemy Snorlax and lets it serve as an excellent late-game wincon—a last Pokemon Snorlax cannot be phazed, which reduces the number of Pokemon that can take it on significantly. However, with only a Normal-type STAB move, Snorlax can't hope to make much progress in the early-game, as it is all but certain to run into a Normal-resistant Pokemon with high Defense or a Ghost-type. There is no single coverage move that will allow Snorlax to get past all Pokemon that resist Normal, so a dual attack RestTalk Snorlax must choose a coverage move that best suits its team. Thunder can allow Snorlax to surprise a major threat in Cloyster, KOing it after Double-Edge more often than not. It also hits Skarmory hard and is the special attack that poses the biggest immediate threat to Gengar with its chance to inflict paralysis. However, using Thunder comes with the major downside of being unable to touch Steelix, Rhydon, and Golem while also offering little for Forretress. Flamethrower can be used to hit Steelix and Forretress hard and is preferred over Fire Blast on this set due to its higher PP, but it fails to offer coverage against Rock-types and poses only a moderate threat to Gengar and Misdreavus. Surf is another alternative that hits all of Steelix, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Golem super effectively, making it an attractive option against offensive teams, which typically rely on one of these Pokemon to handle Snorlax. The main downside to Surf is that although it can potentially force Skarmory to use Rest, it can't hope to ever KO it. Earthquake is a similar option that does less damage to Golem, Rhydon, and Steelix but is a much larger immediate threat to Gengar and Misdreavus.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>RestTalk Snorlax is typically chosen for its defensive attributes, but it fits well on many team archetypes. Offensive teams enjoy having RestTalk Snorlax to fall back on against the many special threats in the tier, particularly Jynx and Zapdos. Having RestTalk Snorlax as a status absorber can free up Zapdos to use a Thunder Wave or phazer set, making it even more of a threat. Machamp works well with RestTalk Snorlax thanks to its ability to threaten Normal-resistant Pokemon. This combination can be made even more effective through the addition of Pursuit support for taking out Gengar and Misdreavus. Another very useful partner for RestTalk Snorlax is Gengar, which can prevent Forretress and Rapid Spin Cloyster from taking too much advantage of Snorlax's limited coverage while also nullifying Explosions aimed at Snorlax.</p> <p>If used on a more defensive team, RestTalk Snorlax serves as both a powerful attacker and reliable wall but runs the risk of encountering a Pokemon that walls its limited coverage. It can therefore be prudent to try to pair it with Pursuit support for the Ghost-types that can slow down mixed and mono-attacking variants, particularly due to the heightened threat posed by Perish trap Misdreavus. Sets that cannot beat Skarmory are best paired with an Electric-type for the immediate threat to Curse Skarmory and Spikes support to ensure that the enemy team can eventually be worn down in the long run.</p> "

        "name": "Drumlax",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Just when you thought you had Snorlax covered with your Skarmory and Tyranitar, enter the Drumlax. A single misstep against Belly Drum Snorlax often means at least one Pokemon goes down, or possibly even an entire team. Body Slam is used to scout for counters and soften the opposing team, putting them into KO range of Snorlax's Body Slam off 999 Attack and hopefully inflicting some paralysis along the way. Then, given an opportunity, Snorlax will immediately boost itself to the maximum possible Attack stat with Belly Drum and commence the annihilation of the enemy team. Body Slam misses many relevant OHKOs at +6, including against Miltank, opposing Snorlax, and Zapdos, so Return can be used as a more powerful alternative, but not being able to inflict paralysis is a major drawback. Still, Return does have the benefit of potentially 3HKOing Zapdos without any Attack boosts. Zapdos is one of the few special attackers that can remove more than 56% of Snorlax's health in two hits, making this potential 3HKO quite appealing. Double-Edge is another option that can be used to break through Skarmory more easily, being very likely to 2HKO an unboosted Skarmory and 3HKOing +1 Defense Skarmory about half of the time at +6. However, due to recoil, it usually can't sweep a team without first recovering off damage with Rest, so the other options tend to be preferred unless your team is lacking in ways to break through defensive teams. The most reliable choice of a fourth move is Earthquake, which gives Snorlax a tool to get past Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types. With a STAB attack and Earthquake, the only Pokemon Snorlax cannot at least 2HKO after using Belly Drum is Skarmory, which, without Defense boosts, is reliably 3HKOed by Body Slam or Return. The main alternative to Earthquake is Lovely Kiss, a highly versatile move that Snorlax can use to break through Pokemon it would otherwise have difficulties with, such as Skarmory. The move also provides a fallback option for when opposing Pokemon get out of hand, and it can even be used to prevent the opposing team's Spiker from setting up. The main downside to using Lovely Kiss is that Snorlax will have no way of touching Gengar or Misdreavus and must rely on Pursuit support to get past them. Rock- and Steel-types also become much better Drumlax answers when Earthquake is dropped. Fire Blast can also be used over Earthquake to help Drumlax beat Skarmory and Forretress more easily, but the lack of coverage against Ghost- and Rock-types is a major downside—being completely walled after sacrificing half of Snorlax's health is far from desirable. Rest is the typical last move and is used to restore Snorlax's health once it gets worn down or inflicted with status so that it can prepare to set up another Belly Drum later in the battle.</p> <p>When using Drumlax, one must remember that it doesn't have any method of boosting its Defense, so heavy-hitting physical attackers as well as Pokemon with Explosion remain a constant threat and can easily force Snorlax to use Rest or dissuade it from using Belly Drum. Drumlax will ideally set up against a paralyzed foe, as this will usually force the opponent to sacrifice it or another member of their team in order to send out a Pokemon that can finish off Snorlax in one hit. It is also important to remember that Snorlax can boost to +2 Attack with Belly Drum when it is at 50% health or lower at no HP cost; with this, it can suddenly become a huge threat when at around 40% HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Drumlax is typically used on more defensive teams because they tend to have more Pokemon capable of taking hits that Drumlax would prefer not to and can also more readily remove Spikes and provide Heal Bell support, all of which helps Drumlax considerably in its efforts in finding an opportunity to set up. In return, Drumlax provides outstanding offensive capabilities that can break a stall deadlock like few other Pokemon can. Pokemon such as Raikou and Blissey can provide relief against Zapdos. Skarmory pairs fantastically with both of those Pokemon and can stomach hits from Heracross, Machamp, Marowak, and opposing Snorlax while also providing an option for sponging Explosions aimed at Snorlax. Ghost-types are similarly helpful at nullifying predicted Explosions. Spinners such as Starmie and Forretress are also much appreciated, as they enable Snorlax to regain its health via its Leftovers through clever switches, which can create opportunities to use Belly Drum twice without having to use Rest. When it does have to use Rest or is inflicted with status, Miltank or Blissey can provide Heal Bell support. This will decrease the amount of recovery time the opposing team gets after neutralizing Drumlax. Paralysis support is excellent for Drumlax; Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Starmie, Body Slam Miltank, and Thunder Raikou fit the role of a paralysis spreader. Lastly, Lovely Kiss Drumlax very much enjoys Pursuit support from Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Houndoom, and Umbreon.</p> "

        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Snorlax's multitude of options and overall strength lend greatly to its unpredictability, and none of Snorlax's other sets take advantage of that unpredictability more so than this one. Snorlax's STAB Self-Destruct is the most powerful attack in the game, OHKOing any and all Pokemon that don't resist it and heavily denting those that do. The fact that Snorlax can reasonably run Rest or another attack alongside any of the coverage moves listed here means that, at least until Snorlax has revealed a special attack, the opponent may not anticipate Self-Destruct. This can be used to take out a key piece on the opponent's side, such as the enemy Snorlax or Zapdos, or, if Snorlax is using the Body Slam / Earthquake / Curse / Self-Destruct set, even an opposing Skarmory. For STAB, Snorlax usually wants Double-Edge for maximum power unless using the aforementioned Skarmory lure set. Without Double-Edge's power, non-Curse Snorlax will find it a lot more difficult to pressure bulky Pokemon with recovery like RestTalk Zapdos and opposing Snorlax. Aside from Self-Destruct and its other STAB attack, all-out attacker Snorlax is typically focused on causing as much damage as possible by maximizing its coverage against Normal-resistant Pokemon. Earthquake is used to hit Rock- and Ghost-types such as Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Gengar, which Snorlax would otherwise struggle against. It can be dropped for Lovely Kiss, although without Earthquake, Snorlax will struggle to take out the aforementioned Rock-types even while they are asleep, which means that if Snorlax gets worn down, it may be unable to pull off an effective Self-Destruct. Snorlax could theoretically use both Lovely Kiss and Earthquake together, although this leaves Snorlax helpless against Skarmory and in a bad position against Toxic Forretress, so it is preferable to have a special attack alongside either option. Thunder is mainly used to potentially land a surprise KO on Cloyster that switch into Double-Edge while also covering Skarmory and offering a decent chance of inflicting paralysis. However, using Thunder means that Snorlax will be lacking coverage for Forretress and relying on unboosted Earthquake for Steelix, which takes only moderate damage from the move. Fire Blast OHKOes Forretress and 2HKOes Steelix while also hitting Skarmory, making it the option with better coverage overall. However, due to how common Cloyster is and how valuable it can be to remove it, Thunder is typically the preferred choice.</p> <p>All-out Attacker Snorlax's gameplay typically involves coming out early in the game or leading and weakening the opposing team with heavy hits until it finds itself in an unfavorable matchup. If things go right, Snorlax can gain a huge advantage for its team by weakening or KOing key Pokemon and then taking out a valuable Pokemon with Self-Destruct. One of the key targets for Self-Destruct is an opposing Curselax—if the foe uses Curse on the turn your Snorlax uses Double-Edge, it is typically committed to staying in the next turn, unless you have given the opponent reason to believe Snorlax might have Self-Destruct. This provides an easy opportunity to trade your Snorlax for theirs with Self-Destruct, which makes it much easier for fast special attackers such as Gengar and Jynx to wreak havoc.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All-out attacker Snorlax requires very little support to function and can theoretically fit on a variety of teams as a tool to take out or weaken key opposing threats. However, as it does not run Rest, it is less often seen on defensive teams, which generally prefer to have the option to use Snorlax as a general wall if needed. Its knack for trading two-for-one makes it a common choice on Explosion-heavy teams, since they can then \"trade down\" and simplify the game by reducing numbers on both sides. As Snorlax will often attempt to trade itself for the opposing Snorlax, Pokemon that can wreak havoc when Snorlax is out of the way make for good partners, such as Jynx. Lacking Rest means Snorlax must be more wary of taking Toxic or being put to sleep. Having a status absorber such as RestTalk Zapdos is helpful in mitigating this threat. If Snorlax is being used to bait and KO Skarmory with a Curse + Self-Destruct set, Pokemon that can set up to sweep opposing teams once Skarmory is gone such as Curse Heracross are excellent choices for partners.</p> "

        "name": "Toxic",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>When used on a defensive team, Snorlax typically plays the role of a wallbreaker while doubling as a backup check for special and mixed attackers. This Snorlax set excels at this role and differs from other Snorlax sets through its use of Toxic to whittle foes down, putting them on a timer before they are either knocked out or forced to use Rest. The raw power of Double-Edge is enough to KO most Pokemon that don't resist it within the three to four free hits granted by the foe using Rest, while Flamethrower handles Steel-types such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress. Rock- and Ghost-types that typically pose a problem for Snorlax with Fire-type coverage are worn down by Toxic or, in Gengar's case, repeated hits from Flamethrower.</p> <p>With the notable exceptions of teams that use a Rock- or Ghost-type with Rest, this Snorlax set has good odds of breaking through an entire enemy lineup should the opponent have insufficient means to threaten or remove it. Even some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, such as Suicune, Umbreon, and Miltank, will typically eventually fall to a critical hit from Double-Edge or three Double-Edge hits and Spikes damage, or run out of PP to cure themselves of Toxic. Toxic Snorlax also brings benefits in terms of Spikes pressure—a grounded Pokemon that is inflicted with poison will take as much as 25% when switching in, except after a KO or when dragged in by a phazing move. With some clever maneuvering and double switching, this can quickly turn into a death sentence. This can be particularly effective against Cloyster and Golem, which are critical pieces in terms of keeping Spikes on and off the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxic Snorlax gives up Snorlax's Attack-boosting potential to play a war of attrition, and its teammates should support it in doing this. Ample defensive measures are highly recommended, such as Skarmory for opposing Snorlax and other physical attackers and Raikou as a primary answer to Electric-types and Growth sweepers such as Vaporeon. Roar Raikou with Spikes provided by Cloyster or Forretress will provide not only extra damage for Snorlax to keep the pressure on, but also a secondary form of offense through residual damage. To keep Spikes on the field and provide a switch-in for Explosions and Cross Chops aimed at Snorlax, Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gengar also make for good teammates. They can also potentially contribute to breaking an opposing team open with their numerous support options, such as Thief and Mean Look + Perish Song. Mean Look + Perish Song Misdreavus in particular is excellent at taking advantage of phazers that have been forced to use Rest due to Toxic from Snorlax or its teammates, which leaves them helpless against the strategy.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Dragonite's excellent all-around stats and large movepool may make it seem like a top-tier Pokemon. Unfortunately, Dragonite lacks a good and reliable STAB move, which hampers its offensive prowess significantly and makes other wallbreakers like Nidoking and Machamp some serious competition. Additionally, Dragonite's 4x Ice weakness is very exploitable for some powerhouses like Zapdos, Raikou, and once again Nidoking.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Dragonite still has some perks that make it worth using. Its excellent offensive stats and its solid bulk and typing give it a much more favorable matchup against bulky threats like Snorlax, Vaporeon, and non-Ice Beam Suicune than most of its competitors, most notably Nidoking. Furthermore, its defensive stats coupled with its resistances and Haze make Dragonite a usable defensive Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Light Screen improves Dragonite's matchup against Electric-types, as it turns 2HKOs from attacks like Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos and Raikou into 4HKOs. However, it takes up an important moveslot and doesn't guarantee that Dragonite will beat them, as they can simply use Rest and Sleep Talk and stall until the effect of Light Screen goes away. Fire Blast invalidates Heracross as a check to the offensive variant while dealing more damage to Steelix and Exeggutor than any other move in Dragonite's arsenal. Hidden Power Flying provides a physical STAB attack without significant drawbacks that OHKOes Heracross, 2HKOes Machamp, and 3HKOes Misdreavus and Gengar. However, dropping one of the standard coverage options for these will result in losing super effective coverage against key Pokemon like Zapdos, Tyranitar, or Water-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Raikou is Dragonite's biggest threat, as it doesn't fear any of Dragonite's coverage moves, outspeeds it, and 2HKOes it with Hidden Power Ice. Zapdos also threatens Dragonite in the same manner, although it has to be wary of Ice Beam, which can 3HKO it. Neither like being paralyzed by Thunder Wave but they can heal it off with Rest afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Heracross and Misdreavus are 4HKOed at best by Dragonite's usual attacking moves and can slowly wear it down while recovering with Rest and Pain Split. However, the former is completely countered by defensive Dragonite, whereas the latter wants to avoid Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Suicune, Snorlax, Miltank, Umbreon, and Porygon2 all force Dragonite to rely on its inaccurate moves to threaten them and can reduce its threat level by crippling it with status or reducing its Attack, or otherwise KO it outright. However, bar Suicune, which needs Sleep Talk and Ice Beam to reliably check Dragonite, all of the listed Pokemon can be 2HKOed by Dynamic Punch after Spikes, and Thunder Wave hinders them all. Steelix deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Thunder Wave and can survive three Dynamic Punches, but most of the time it lacks a move other than Explosion that can beat Dragonite, so it should be used as a pivot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Ice-type Coverage: Although it has trouble switching into Dragonite, Jynx swiftly OHKOes it with Ice Beam. Nidoking and Gengar have more opportunities to come in and dent it with their Ice-type attacks, but Nidoking takes a lot from Ice Beam and Gengar is badly crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Offensive Dragonite is often underprepared for and can be extremely painful to face for some teams. Thunder Wave inflicts paralysis, which is crucial against some bulky Pokemon like Raikou, Zapdos, Umbreon, and even Snorlax, as it allows Dragonite and its teammates to potentially defeat their supposed answers by outspeeding them or forcing them to use Rest. Double-Edge forgoes paralysis support in exchange for a decently powerful and reliable physical attack, which can be very helpful in some scenarios, for instance against a weakened Snorlax or Machamp. Ice Beam 3HKOes Zapdos and does a nice amount of damage to Exeggutor, Marowak, Nidoking, Rhydon, and Golem. Thunder deals over 85% to Cloyster, 2HKOes Skarmory and Starmie, and 3HKOes Suicune, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon. Thunder notably makes Dragonite a pretty nice check to Vaporeon and also has a chance to inflict paralysis, although its accuracy is iffy. Dynamic Punch is even less reliable, but Fighting-type coverage is invaluable on this set, since it hits important targets like Tyranitar very hard and 3HKOes Snorlax, Umbreon, and Miltank, all of which have to beware of the potential 2HKO after Spikes damage. The added confusion effect can be very awkward for the opponent, especially in tandem with the paralysis induced by Dragonite's other moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite greatly appreciates Spikes support from Cloyster and Forretress, as it secures some notable KOs mentioned above, while additional chip damage makes Dragonite more threatening in general. Even though it can cripple them via Thunder Wave and Ice Beam, Dragonite still needs some support against Raikou and to a lesser extent Zapdos, so typical Electric-type answers like Steelix, Snorlax, and Raikou itself as well as Explosion users like Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Gengar make good partners. However, Dragonite can perform pretty well with other Pokemon that also struggle against Electric-types like Vaporeon and Tentacruel, since they can weaken or paralyze their common nemeses, which may end up leaving them overwhelmed by trying to check two offensive threats. Other notable Thunder Wave targets include Snorlax, Umbreon, Miltank, Suicune, Misdreavus, and Heracross, most of which have to be wary of Dragonite's coverage moves as well. Dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax, Marowak, and Nidoking will have a much easier time breaking through the opposing team once Dragonite has paralyzed these annoyances.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Dragonite is gifted with very solid all-around bulk, useful resistances to Water and Fighting, and an immunity to Ground, making a defensive set perfectly usable, albeit very passive, as it struggles to fit an attacking move. Haze is a key move to this set's success, as unlike phazing moves it isn't plagued with negative priority, allowing Dragonite to erase all stat changes before slower Pokemon like Snorlax, Vaporeon, Machamp, Marowak, and -1 Heracross have a chance to hit it with a boosted attack. This makes Dragonite one of the best available answers to the fearsome Belly Drum Snorlax. Reflect is another important move, since the boost in Defense is invaluable against most of the aforementioned Pokemon. It also enables Dragonite to shrug off most Explosions, helps its teammates switch in more safely, gives it some insurance while it is asleep, and makes it almost unbreakable with physical attacks—even Rock Slide from Rhydon fails to 4HKO Dragonite behind Reflect most of the time. Rest is Dragonite's sole form of recovery. It can be paired with Sleep Talk so Dragonite can serve as a pretty reliable sleep absorber against Exeggutor and Lovely Kiss Snorlax without becoming dead weight while asleep. However, this comes at the cost of not having any offensive move and makes Dragonite extremely passive and reliant on PP stalling, although it will win PP wars thanks to Haze's high PP count more often than not. Choosing Body Slam or Dragon Breath instead makes the use of Rest much riskier but permits Dragonite to actually damage its foe and potentially spread paralysis. Body Slam deals a bit more damage in general aside from some Pokemon like Marowak and Exeggutor, whereas Dragon Breath ensures that Dragonite isn't completely helpless against Ghost-types.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Dragonite variant fits on most stall teams, which can afford to pack very passive Pokemon. They often include cleric support from Blissey and Miltank, which can cure Dragonite's sleep status and reduce the need for Sleep Talk, essentially freeing up the last moveslot. Blissey can also sponge attacks from Raikou, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jynx aimed at Dragonite, whereas Miltank deals nicely with Nidoking and Porygon2. Other Pokemon like Raikou, Steelix, and Umbreon that check most of the aforementioned threats can also be considered. Umbreon and Tyranitar can provide Pursuit support, something that can be very helpful if Dragonite is unable to touch Gengar and Misdreavus because it stops them from coming in on it fearlessly. Aside from these, having additional answers to offensive threats such as Snorlax is useful, since Dragonite usually can't do much back to its foe and will therefore often have to take numerous hits, making it susceptible to critical hits.</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire has always been a competent defensive Ground-type. However, it's generally not thought of as a top OU Pokemon because its ability to counter Hidden Power legends was not needed when they were banned and because it's a lot less offensive than other Ground-types. However, in the modern metagame where the legendary Electric-types regularly carry Hidden Power, Quagsire's neutralities to Ice- and Water-type attacks give it a unique defensive advantage over other Ground-types, although the uncommon Hidden Power Grass can still be used to ruin it. Quagsire is a decent mixed wall that can threaten to sweep if given the chance to set up a Belly Drum, but unlike other Ground-types such as Nidoking and Marowak, it doesn't have the attacking stats to pose an immediate offensive threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A more defensive variant of Quagsire could be built by replacing Belly Drum with Curse. This would allow Quagsire to force out mixed attackers and force the opponent to send walls rather than offensive threats into Quagsire without having to rely on the difficult-to-use Belly Drum. This is important because a Quagsire hovering around half health can't threaten to set up Belly Drum, allowing a threat such as mixed Snorlax to switch in and take the initiative; on the other hand, Curse Quagsire would be able to easily deter this switch-in. A more defensive Quagsire could also use Haze in Belly Drum's slot. This would prevent Baton Pass users, most notably Jolteon, from transferring their boosts to another Pokemon while also neutralizing Curse users and stopping Belly Drum Snorlax sweeps. When using Curse or Haze, Sleep Talk can be used over Hidden Power Rock. Hidden Power Rock's main use is allowing Quagsire to KO Zapdos and Skarmory after a Belly Drum, so without Belly Drum, that slot would be better suited toward a more defensive move. Note that if Belly Drum is dropped, even for Curse, Quagsire is not going to contribute much of anything offensively because too many Pokemon shut it down entirely.</p> <p>In addition to more defensive sets, Quagsire could forgo Rest and run an all-out offensive Belly Drum set. Generally, Sludge Bomb is selected in place of Rest to give Quagsire a powerful move to use against Exeggutor. Even before a Belly Drum, it does quite a bit of damage to Exeggutor and threatens to poison it. Generally, an all-out offensive Quagsire will be used alongside Pokemon such as Jolteon and Smeargle that can pass Agility boosts, thereby negating Quagsire's lackluster Speed and allowing it to set up a sweep legitimately.</p> <p>Another possibility is using Quagsire's special attacking movepool. Surf is generally a poor move choice, but it can help check Rhydon more effectively and instantly threaten solid damage against Skarmory (30% - 35%). Note, however, that Surf still fails to 3HKO Skarmory. Ice Beam is another option; it's a decent attack for instant damage against Exeggutor switch-ins, and might also be useful for attempting to freeze a key Quagsire check such as Skarmory or Suicune. Generally, though, Quagsire shouldn't be using even STAB special attacks because its Special Attack is very poor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory is the chief Quagsire check, safely avoiding a 3HKO even from Quagsire's STAB Surf and comfortably phazing Quagsire after it has used Belly Drum (999 Attack Hidden Power Rock does 40% - 47% to Skarmory). Any other attack does pitiful, insignificant damage to Skarmory. Exeggutor is another potent check; although it fears Sludge Bomb, it switches in on Earthquake and Hidden Power Rock with impunity and threatens to KO with Giga Drain or Psychic. Meganium stops Quagsire even colder than Exeggutor does; it has better defenses, an instant recovery move in Synthesis, and unlike Exeggutor, isn't picked off by Pursuit Tyranitar. However, Synthesis's mere 8 PP erodes quickly, and Meganium is no fonder of taking a possible Sludge Bomb poison than Exeggutor is. Heracross is a potent Quagsire check, too. It resists Earthquake and is neutral to Hidden Power Rock; furthermore, it boasts a powerful Megahorn that threatens to 3HKO Quagsire. Thus, the presence of a medium-to-high-health Heracross effectively prevents Quagsire from using Belly Drum safely. Suicune is another strong Quagsire check, though it needs to be at high health and avoid paralysis if it is going to perform this function competently. Its Surf 3HKOes Quagsire, and if it switches in at full health as Quagsire uses Belly Drum, it KOes Quagsire with Surf before Quagsire can KO it with Earthquake. Cloyster is a decent check; while it can't 3HKO with STAB Surf or Ice Beam, Cloyster has the Defense to survive a 999 Attack Earthquake and hits hard enough with its STAB moves to 2HKO Quagsire after it uses Belly Drum. Marowak can serve as a check if you predict Belly Drum. Quagsire is one of the few Pokemon Marowak outspeeds, and a Thick Club-boosted Earthquake does a minimum of 53% to Quagsire. Thus, Marowak can threaten to KO Quagsire if it sets up Belly Drum on the switch-in. However, Marowak is an unreliable check, as switching it in on an Earthquake can render it unable to survive a hit such as Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos later in the match.</p> <p>If you can reliably keep Spikes down, you can use anything with a strong STAB Surf, such as Starmie or Vaporeon, to effectively trade with Quagsire. Although these Pokemon fail to OHKO Quagsire after a Belly Drum and are OHKOed by a 999 Attack STAB Earthquake, they can lower Quagsire's health to dangerous levels if it decides to go for the KO, thereby leaving it unable to switch back in easily. This, in turn, can open up your own Zapdos or Raikou for an offensive push. However, without Spikes, it becomes much more difficult to handle a possible Quagsire switch-in, so in the event that you cannot keep Spikes down, you should only use these frailer Water-types as Quagsire counters if it has enough residual damage to be put in KO range after a Belly Drum. Of course, anything with a Grass-type attack that isn't weak to Earthquake makes a solid Quagsire counter; even with a Ground-type weakness, having a Grass-type move can catch Quagsire by surprise and ruin it for the rest of the match. However, Grass-type moves are generally not very useful outside of countering Quagsire, so other means of checking Quagsire are preferred.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<p>You can thank Raikou, Zapdos, and the fairly recent (circa 2009) unbanning of Hidden Power on these Pokemon for Quagsire's emergence as a legitimate threat in GSC OU. The most common Hidden Power types used by Zapdos and Raikou are Ice and Water; Quagsire is neutral to both, which gives it the edge relative to other Ground-types that might be used to check Electric-types. It should be noted that Hidden Power Grass, while hypothetically possible, is rare and leaves the legendary Electric-type Pokemon vulnerable to Nidoking switch-ins.</p> <p>Quagsire walls these Electric-types impeccably, but it also serves as a fantastic mixed wall for threats such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Nidoking. Quagsire is also a solid check to Tentacruel, and at decently high health, it can survive a 999 Attack Charizard Earthquake and KO back with Hidden Power Rock. Because of its important defensive capabilities, Rest is recommended on Quagsire so it can keep switching in to wall what it can.</p> <p>However, while Quagsire's walling capabilities are certainly handy, decent mixed walls such as Raikou, Suicune, and Miltank are a dime a dozen. What truly makes Quagsire stand out is its access to Belly Drum. With Belly Drum, Quagsire can threaten to sweep the opposing team, something the aforementioned mixed walls cannot boast. Furthermore, it's capable of setting up Belly Drum safely in the face of the ever-present Hidden Power Zapdos and Raikou, something even the mighty Snorlax cannot accomplish. STAB Earthquake is the main move Quagsire will be using after setting up. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Rock hurts the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake. After a turn of setup, Hidden Power Rock can OHKO Zapdos and 3HKO Skarmory, one of Quagsire's most prominent checks. It should be noted that unlike other offensive sweepers such as Snorlax and Marowak, Quagsire isn't capable of threatening much of anything without a turn of setup.</p> <p>Quagsire likes support to help it wear down its most prominent checks. Tyranitar with Pursuit is one of the best teammates, as it can be used to snipe Exeggutor, which is otherwise a hard counter for Quagsire. Seismic Toss Heracross and Belly Drum Snorlax are other solid teammates that lure in Skarmory, arguably Quagsire's number one check, and hit it for heavy damage.</p> <p>Quagsire's biggest issues as an offensive contributor are its very low Speed and inability to instantly threaten switch-ins the way Marowak can. For this reason, a lot of general support is essential for Quagsire to ever get an opportunity to sweep. In particular, support from Stun Spore Exeggutor and Body Slam Snorlax helps to target key walls such as Skarmory and Suicune with paralysis and to give Quagsire general paralysis support against \"random\" Pokemon such as Miltank and Starmie that can otherwise stop a sweep with a little luck. Spikes support is also handy for forcing Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Suicune to Explode or Rest, thereby giving Quagsire an opening to set up Belly Drum.</p> <p>Rapid Spin is essential, too; having to switch into Spikes really limits Quagsire's ability to set up Belly Drum, and unless the field is clear of Spikes, Quagsire can't go for the kill against Water-types that use STAB Surf to put Quagsire at extremely low health after using Belly Drum. Furthermore, Quagsire appreciates Heal Bell support from the likes of Miltank just as the most popular Belly Drum sweeper, Snorlax, does. With Heal Bell support, Quagsire can Rest off any residual damage, then have its sleep turns negated to allow it to switch immediately back in to threaten another Belly Drum sweep.</p> <p>Quagsire is a fantastic teammate for teams that need its defensive talents, too. A team without Raikou definitely appreciates Quagsire's ability to hard-counter Electric-types that lack the rare Hidden Power Grass; Snorlax may be on every team, but Snorlax alone can't take STAB Thunders from Zapdos and Raikou all day. In addition, Quagsire is also an extremely potent mixed wall that counters key offensive threats such as Tyranitar, Nidoking, and Dragonite. Unlike mixed walls such as Miltank and Suicune, Quagsire does not have an exploitable weakness to a move type commonly used by the most prominent mixed attackers in GSC.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its access to Growth, amazing Special Attack, and high Speed, Espeon can set up and either try to sweep or use Baton Pass to support another special attacker, which can turn manageable threats into devastating powerhouses in the blink of an eye. With a pure Psychic typing, Morning Sun, and STAB Psychic, it can switch into and threaten dangerous Pokemon such as Gengar, Machamp, Nidoking, and Tentacruel, which offensive teams sometimes struggle with.</p> <p>However, Espeon is too fragile to take physical attacks from Snorlax, the most dominant Pokemon in GSC OU. In addition, status afflictions such as paralysis from Thunder Wave will compromise its potential. Furthermore, its movepool isn't ideal, which makes it hard to sweep without having the correct Hidden Power for Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Forretress.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute is a potent option that is especially effective when used in tandem with paralysis support. It can block status from Pokemon such as Umbreon, exploit the low accuracy of Thunder from the likes of Zapdos, shut down Exeggutor, and scout for Explosion from Pokemon like Forretress, but replacing Morning Sun for it will reduce its capacity to function as a check to Pokemon such as Gengar and Machamp. Bite is a decent option to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Starmie, Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Espeon, but it doesn't cover Steelix like Hidden Power Water and Hidden Power Fire. If it is used alongside Hidden Power Water, Espeon will have solid coverage, but Espeon typically benefits more from having Substitute or Morning Sun. Toxic can be used to wear down problematic Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Jynx, but since Espeon is often a late-game Pokemon, Toxic damage racks up relatively slowly. Finally, Reflect is somewhat useful against Explosion users and unboosted Snorlax, but it is difficult to fit and is hard to justify over Espeon's other utility options such as Morning Sun and Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Snorlax and Blissey can easily take Espeon's attacks and retaliate with strong attacks or status moves. The former frightens Espeon with its STAB moves, while the latter threatens Espeon with Present. Although Snorlax cannot stop Baton Pass, it can usually force Espeon to Baton Pass and threaten most recipients. However, without Present, Blissey is setup fodder for Espeon, though it can run Light Screen to potentially outlast recipients.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Toxic Umbreon is one of the best answers to Espeon without Baton Pass, but it is one of the worst answers to Espeon with Baton Pass. Crunch from Tyranitar and to a lesser extent Houndoom can 2HKO Espeon and both also have access to Roar to phaze it, but +1 Hidden Power Water has a decent chance to 2HKO both Pokemon after damage from Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Forretress can threaten Espeon with Explosion or Toxic, Steelix can remove it with Explosion or phaze it with Roar, and Skarmory can cripple it with Toxic or phaze it with Whirlwind. However, all of them, especially Forretress, will be hurt by Hidden Power Fire and boosted STAB Psychic. Steelix will also be worn down by Hidden Power Water.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Exeggutor, Starmie, Jynx, and Alakazam can cripple Espeon with status moves. Exeggutor threatens it with Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, Starmie threatens it with Thunder Wave, and Jynx threatens it with Lovely Kiss and Ice Beam. In addition, Exeggutor has Explosion to potentially trade with Espeon, and Alakazam can dominate Espeon with Encore. However, Espeon has Morning Sun to shrug off most of their attacks, Exeggutor and Jynx should be wary of Hidden Power Fire, and only Encore Alakazam can prevent it from using Baton Pass.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou and Zapdos tend to lose to Espeon if they switch in as it uses Growth, but they may be able to paralyze or phaze it to prevent a sweep. Espeon has reasonably good odds of 2HKOing Zapdos with +1 Psychic whereas Zapdos rarely 2HKOes it in return with Thunder, although Thunder's paralysis rate makes it very dangerous to Espeon.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set is usually seen late-game and is especially dangerous against a sleeping Snorlax because of Growth and STAB Psychic. Hidden Power Water covers two common threats: Tyranitar and Steelix. It also does decent damage to Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire deters Forretress and hits targets such as Skarmory, Exeggutor, Steelix, and Jynx relatively hard, but it doesn't touch Tyranitar. With the combination of high Speed, STAB Psychic, and a pure Psychic typing, which resists Fighting-type attacks while not being weak to Earthquake, Morning Sun allows Espeon to provide a typical offensive team with a solid answer to dangerous threats such as Machamp, Gengar, and Nidoking so long as one of its teammates have already been put to sleep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Machamp and Espeon have both offensive and defensive synergistic qualities. Both of them can also put pressure on key common Pokemon such as Snorlax, Zapdos, Raikou, and Skarmory if given a setup opportunity, and if Machamp can weaken Zapdos or Espeon can weaken Snorlax or Raikou, the other will have a better chance at finding an opportunity at setting up a sweep. Defensively, Machamp checks Steelix and Dark-types such as Tyranitar, while, thanks to Morning Sun, Espeon deals with Gengar, Nidoking, and Tentacruel.</p> <p>Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to take out opposing Snorlax. Its coverage and status moves can also be used to weaken Espeon's other checks such as Tyranitar and Steelix. Gengar runs moves such as Destiny Bond, Explosion, Hypnosis, and Dynamic Punch to cripple special walls, Steelix, and Dark-type Pokemon, against which Espeon has a hard time. Tyranitar attracts Machamp and Nidoking so that Espeon can come in comfortably and get a setup opportunity. In return, Tyranitar takes care of Explosion and Self-Destruct users, Jynx, and the rare Houndoom, which Espeon struggles with. Steelix can answer some variants of Snorlax and Tyranitar that stop Espeon, such as Curse RestTalk variants. In addition, it can paralyze or remove Skarmory and Exeggutor with Body Slam or Explosion, which helps Espeon. Cloyster can lay Spikes, check Steelix, and take down Starmie, while Espeon checks Tentacruel. Zapdos counters Skarmory, absorbs Sleep Powder from Exeggutor, and can force Snorlax to use Rest, which Espeon can take advantage of.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Espeon is among the more difficult Growth passers to deal with defensively. With Growth and Baton Pass, Vaporeon can be stopped by Roar Suicune and Jolteon can be stopped by Roar Raikou. However, +1 Psychic from Espeon can 3HKO both of them and has a high chance of 2HKOing Raikou after Spikes, and Espeon has access to instant recovery. Skarmory can phaze Espeon, but Espeon can just hit it with +1 Psychic until it is forced to use Rest, so it will not stop Espeon from using Baton Pass in the long run. In addition, Baton Pass allows Espeon to escape from Pursuit damage.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Morning Sun makes Espeon last longer while giving it great defensive value because it can handle dangerous threats such as Machamp, Gengar, and Nidoking. While dropping Morning Sun means that Espeon loses instant recovery and has to be more cautious about when it comes in, Hidden Power can be used to hit phazers; Hidden Power Water covers phazers such as Tyranitar, Steelix, Houndoom, Golem, and Rhydon, while Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory and Steelix relatively hard.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos and Raikou make great recipients as long as the opponent doesn't have Roar Raikou, and the threat these two pose can force the opposing Pokemon to use Explosion. Nidoking is one of the most dangerous recipients due to its access to Lovely Kiss and ability to succeed against Tyranitar. Gengar is a good recipient if the opposing Snorlax doesn't have Earthquake or Lovely Kiss. In addition, it becomes much easier to land Explosion on the target you are seeking if Gengar has a boost. Furthermore, Gengar is immune to Normal-type attacks that might be aimed at Espeon or its other potential recipients. Tyranitar not only resists Normal-type attacks but also can become very dangerous after a boost, though this depends on the opposing lineup and its moveset. Machamp is not much of a receiver, but it is still a useful teammate for threatening Snorlax and Dark-types and potentially benefiting from Growth with Fire Blast. Jynx is the Pokemon that is most likely to sweep after receiving a boost, even if its typing has no defensive merit alongside Espeon. Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei can take advantage of Umbreon, Skarmory, and Jynx and will be dangerous when boosted because teams often forgo answers to Fire-type Pokemon due to their rarity. Since Espeon without Hidden Power Water loses to Roar Tyranitar, moves such as Earthquake from Snorlax and Destiny Bond or Dynamic Punch from Gengar can be considered to lure in and remove the behemoth early-game.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Umbreon is one of the toughest walls to bring down thanks to its stellar defensive stats and access to Charm, which allows it to handle GSC's numerous Curse sweepers. It's also a solid Pursuit user despite being very weak offensively, since it doesn't fear much from Starmie and Dynamic Punch Gengar, unlike competing Dark-types Tyranitar and Houndoom. Umbreon can also make good use of the combination of Mean Look and Baton Pass, which is potentially very rewarding if the opponent fails to phaze it. However, with such poor offensive stats and its bare movepool, Umbreon is one of the most passive Pokemon in the tier and is left overly reliant on Toxic to do any sort of damage, which means it can't pose a threat to anything immune to poison except Gengar. Umbreon also despises status and has to use Rest in order to escape from poison and paralysis, and even though it is extremely sturdy, it can be overwhelmed much more easily when it is asleep.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zap Cannon is an option alongside sweepers like Tentacruel, Charizard, and Marowak on teams relying on paralysis; otherwise, Toxic is usually the best option for such a stall-based Pokemon, and losing the surprise factor due to a miss can ruin this strategy. Toxic has some merits on the Mean Look Pass set, as it puts phazers like Raikou, Tyranitar, and Suicune on a timer and forces them to use Rest if they have it, but it's ineffective against Skarmory and Steelix and more situational than the options listed. Umbreon learns Growth and can Baton Pass it, and while it's still very weak even when boosted, it can live long enough thanks to its bulk, typing, and access to Moonlight. It can also dent Skarmory and Steelix with a +1 Hidden Power Fire, but other phazers like Raikou and Tyranitar make it completely useless. Umbreon also has access to both Curse and Substitute, but again, it can't stop phazers from ruining any strategy it might otherwise hope to pull off with these.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Phazers: The safest switch-ins to Umbreon at your disposal are phazers immune to Toxic like Skarmory and Steelix, though those that can cure themselves of poison via Rest like Raikou, Suicune, and Tyranitar are fine alternatives too.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross is one of Umbreon's biggest counters; all it needs is to avoid Charm on the switch in order to leave a big dent with Megahorn, and it carries Rest most of the time, so Toxic won't cripple it too much.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: Faster Explosion users like Cloyster and to a lesser extent Gengar can also threaten Umbreon if they can avoid Charm, but they are obviously less reliable answers, since they have to sacrifice themselves to weaken Umbreon.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon: Most setup sweepers can't take advantage of Umbreon's passivity because of Charm, but there are some exceptions like Growth Vaporeon, which will boost its Special Attack in front of Umbreon fearlessly.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Pokemon with Substitute</strong>: Substitute users like Tentacruel and Kangaskhan can set up against Umbreon, since their Substitute blocks Charm and needs at least three hits of Pursuit to break.</p> <p><strong>Belly Drum Users: Belly Drum Snorlax is a massive threat to Umbreon since it relies on Charm to handle boosting Snorlax and can't reduce Snorlax's Attack fast enough to avoid getting KOed by its boosted STAB attacks. Other users of Belly Drum like Charizard, Clefable, and Quagsire are similarly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Status: A common way to bypass Umbreon is to use status, as a paralyzed one is much easier to break through for powerful attackers like Marowak and especially Machamp, whereas a poisoned one won't be able to stall out anything. Thus Umbreon will have no choice but to use Rest and try to stay healthy during the two turns it is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Rest or Toxic Immunity: Pokemon immune to Toxic or with Rest don't fear anything from Umbreon, although they can't necessarily do much in return. Nonetheless, the likes of Zapdos still have the upper hand against Umbreon, since they can simply force it to use Rest, trade PP with it, and potentially threaten it if their Thunder connects multiple times.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Charm is one of the main reasons why Umbreon is so hard to break through. The purpose of this move is to stop Curse sweepers like Snorlax in their tracks. It can also be used to soften the blows of Explosion and other physical attacks from slower Pokemon like Exeggutor, Rhydon, and even Machamp—though in Machamp's case, Umbreon must beware of Cross Chop's high critical hit rate. Pursuit allows Umbreon to wear down Pokemon like Exeggutor, Gengar, and Misdreavus, none of which can hit it very hard without using Explosion, punishing them with hefty damage if they try to switch out. Rest is Umbreon's preferred recovery option, since it allows it to get rid of poison or paralysis, which both pose a severe threat to Umbreon and limit its effectiveness. Rest also notably enables Umbreon to check threats like Body Slam Snorlax more effectively. However, it puts Umbreon out of commission for two turns, making it more vulnerable to offensive pressure. Therefore, Sleep Talk is recommended so Umbreon keeps fulfilling its tasks when asleep. However, Toxic is also a great option to weaken the foe, force switches, and threaten non-Rest variants of Snorlax, Zapdos, and Tyranitar. In conjunction with Pursuit and Spikes support, Toxic can wear down opposing Pokemon quite quickly. Alongside Toxic, Umbreon's more flexible recovery option in Moonlight can be given consideration if Umbreon can avoid or be cured of status and the low amount of PP isn't problematic despite the fact that Umbreon is an entirely stall-based Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Outside of its defensive utility, the main reason to use Umbreon is its ability to reliably weaken any Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon with Pursuit, something greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Machamp or mono-attacking Snorlax. Umbreon is also a good option for Spikes-based teams,  since it's the only viable Pursuit user that fares well against what is arguably the best spinner available, Starmie. Even though Starmie takes fairly low damage from Umbreon's Pursuit and has plenty of Recover PP, constant residual damage from poison and the threat of Pursuit will eventually see it struggling to keep Spikes off the field. If Umbreon happens to pack Sleep Talk instead of Toxic, your Spikes setter should be able to inflict Starmie with poison so Umbreon can still heavily pressure it. Both Cloyster and Forretress can struggle against Gengar and Misdreavus, so once again Pursuit is a great help. However, keep in mind that Umbreon's Special Attack is so lackluster that Rest Misdreavus can stall it out. As Umbreon relies on Charm to handle boosting Snorlax, its worst nightmare is Belly Drum Snorlax. It is therefore a good idea to use it alongside Skarmory on more defensive teams, as Skarmory is much better suited to handling Belly Drum Snorlax, whereas Umbreon can stave off Snorlax variants that Skarmory struggles with, such as Fire move Curselax.</p> "

        "name": "Mean Look + Baton Pass",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>With Mean Look and Baton Pass, Umbreon works as the bulkiest trap passer available. Charm remains very useful against physical attackers, and it pairs well with Mean Look to prevent the opposing Pokemon from escaping while its Attack stat keeps decreasing. Once you have used Mean Look and potentially Charm several times, use Baton Pass in order to bring in an appropriate counter to face the trapped Pokemon or a teammate that can safely set up on it and attempt to sweep. Confuse Ray is the best option Umbreon has against the omnipresent phazers that are the biggest thorn in this set's side and can be extremely frustrating for your opponent, especially when used in tandem with Mean Look. However, this strategy is unreliable since it's based on luck, and the odds of the opposing Pokemon hitting itself twice in a row may be too low to rely on. Rest remains Umbreon's preferred recovery move due to its ability to heal status ailments and to PP stall a trapped Pokemon. However, this variant isn't as stall based as the first, which means that Moonlight is still a solid option, especially when you can hardly afford to waste turns by allowing Umbreon to sleep with this set. Sand Attack is another option that can be spammed in order to lower the accuracy of the foe and is even more effective when used alongside Confuse Ray. It's also the best tool available in Umbreon's arsenal if it traps a special attacker. While Leftovers remains the preferred item option, Bright Powder can be considered to maximize your chances against opposing phazers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Umbreon can't reliably transfer Mean Look if there is at least one Pokemon able to phaze it on the opposing team, with the most common ones being Skarmory, Raikou, Suicune, Steelix, and Tyranitar. Thus, Pokemon that can lure them in like Lovely Kiss or all-out attacker Snorlax make good partners; keep in mind that the first three need to use Rest in order to heal themselves and that they will rarely carry both Sleep Talk and Roar on the same moveset. Forcing Skarmory, Raikou, or Suicune to use Rest is also a good way to prevent them from disturbing Umbreon. Sturdy sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Vaporeon make good teammates, since Umbreon can give them many opportunities to set up. Pokemon that naturally scare off most of the aforementioned phazers like Nidoking and Cloyster are good partners as well, as this Umbreon variant can also bring teammates in safely with a dry Baton Pass; the latter in particular can use them as an opportunity to set up Spikes. This strategy works especially well due to the huge threat of trap passing almost guaranteeing that the opponent will bring a phazer in when facing this Umbreon.</p> "

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>Misdreavus is the only pure Ghost-type available in GSC OU, which gives it an immediate niche. Its typing grants it a coveted Normal immunity, allowing it to pivot in on a predicted Explosion, as well as check most Snorlax variants and prevent Starmie from using Rapid Spin much more reliably than Gengar. Moreover, Misdreavus has many tricks up its sleeve thanks to its movepool. Its Perish trap set is one of the main reasons why so many teams pack a phazer, and such teams still have to worry about the Disruptor set, which can badly cripple them.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Misdreavus is frail and lacks significant firepower, which means it can be quickly overwhelmed by most offensive powerhouses without doing anything significant beforehand. It also needs to watch out for Pursuit and faces competition from Gengar, which is much more immediately threatening and is immune to Toxic, a move commonly used by Cloyster and Forretress, two Pokemon you typically want to check with your Ghost-type.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Perish Song is usable without Mean Look to back it up, as it allows Misdreavus to force any Curse variants of Snorlax out and can serve as a counter to Baton Pass strategies. Attract can be used over Confuse Ray, as there is no chance of the foe snapping out of it early, but you lose the ability to buy time against Zapdos, Raikou, Suicune, and Pokemon with the same gender. Mean Look has its own merits on a non-Perish Song set, especially when moves uncharacteristic of a Mean Look set such as Toxic are revealed first. Once Misdreavus has trapped the foe, it can force it to stay on the field while suffering from residual damage or PP stall it. However, this set is stopped cold by phazers like Steelix once revealed and Mean Look takes up a valuable moveslot. Growl is another way to handle Curse sweepers like Snorlax, Machamp, and Heracross without having to worry about taking a boosted hit in return, although it doesn't have much merit otherwise. Sleep Talk can be considered if using Rest, but Misdreavus is strapped enough for moveslots as is.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Phazers: Due to the fear of losing a Pokemon to the Perish trap set, most initial switch-ins to Misdreavus are phazers, but there's always a slim chance that Misdreavus can manage to get a KO anyway via multiple turns of confusion damage and Protect stalling. Tyranitar and Steelix in particular really want to avoid Thief, since they rarely carry Rest, and Leftovers is their only form of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users: Pursuit users including Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom all threaten both variants of Misdreavus, especially the disruptor set, since it struggles to outpace the damage from Pursuit with Toxic and Thunder. The Perish trap set also has a hard time fleeing on the last turn of the countdown and will generally be heavily damaged, if not outright KOed, after taking a full-powered Pursuit. Toxic + Protect Misdreavus can typically stall long enough if the foe is simply using Pursuit over and over, but potentially taking a devastating Crunch can ruin this strategy. Houndoom is particularly problematic, as it outspeeds Misdreavus and usually has both Crunch and Pursuit. Tyranitar is also capable of running Crunch alongside Pursuit for Misdreavus, but it must drop another coverage move to do so.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users: Due to Misdreavus's lack of offensive presence, the disruptor variant faces a wall each time a RestTalk user shows up, as such foes don't mind status and only have to be wary about a well-timed Destiny Bond if they're slower; however, any sleeping Pokemon is very vulnerable to the Perish trap set.</p> <p><strong>Immediately Powerful Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Marowak, Rhydon, and Charcoal Moltres pose a unique threat to Perish Song Misdreavus, as they are so powerful that they can 2HKO it without any prior setup, meaning they can potentially switch in against a full-health Misdreavus as it uses Mean Look, not bother to phaze it, and still emerge the victor. If Misdreavus decides to attempt to use Perish Song anyway, it needs to rely on the 50% chance of Protect working twice in a row. The disruptor variant can threaten all of them with Toxic, Marowak with Thief, and Moltres with Thunder. Thunder Zapdos can also threaten a 2HKO on Misdreavus, but it is slightly more likely to come out the loser due to Thunder's poor accuracy and a closer damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Status: Unless it has Rest, any kind of status is a major problem for Misdreavus and should be avoided whenever possible. A poisoned or burned Perish trap Misdreavus will be much more easily 2HKOed or Pursuit trapped, and a paralyzed Misdreavus is unable to KO foes with Destiny Bond and risks becoming fully paralyzed at inopportune moments.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Disruptor",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set aims to use Misdreavus's typing and movepool to their full potential by making it a spinblocker, a check to mono-attacking and all-out attacking variants of Snorlax, and a general annoyance due to its myriad of moves with which to cripple the foe. Thunder is Misdreavus's main attack and hits Cloyster, Starmie, and Forretress hard, making it a much more reliable spinblocker as well as an occasional paralysis spreader. Toxic is Misdreavus's best way to hinder the foe by putting it on a timer, eventually forcing it to heal with Rest—if it even carries it. Moreover, it can be spammed more freely than Thief and Hypnosis throughout the match, since it is not hindered by having an item or by Sleep Clause. Toxic can also stack with the loss of Leftovers and gives Misdreavus some bite.</p> <p>Thief is great at opening a hole in the opponent's gameplan because, unlike status moves, it will permanently hinder RestTalk users like Zapdos and Raikou. It will also cripple just about any Pokemon that isn't a Thief user itself by stealing its Leftovers or power-boosting item like Thick Club in the case of Marowak. It's especially effective when used alongside Toxic, since it will wear down the foe even quicker. Just make sure Misdreavus isn't carrying any item when using it. Alternatively, Protect lets Misdreavus slowly regain its health with Leftovers and allows you to scout your opponent's moves while the foe's health keeps decreasing because of Toxic. This is especially effective against threats like Pursuit Tyranitar and Roar Raikou. Another option is Hypnosis, which can put unsuspecting Pokemon to sleep. This can be very rewarding, since RestTalk users are generally not initial switch-ins to Misdreavus due to the fear of being trapped. Keep in mind that the move's low accuracy can ruin the surprise factor, though. Confuse Ray is also very threatening for a poisoned foe to deal with, and confusion cripples just about any Pokemon, making Misdreavus potentially very annoying to deal with and to eliminate. In the last moveslot, Pain Split gives Misdreavus instant recovery and potentially another way to cut down the opposing Pokemon's HP, but it's unreliable and can be played around. Rest, on the other hand, cures Toxic that Misdreavus is likely to take when switching into Cloyster and Forretress, at the cost of putting it to sleep for two turns.</p> <p>There are also some alternative options available depending on what you need or want to do with Misdreavus. Psychic, which is sometimes used over Thunder, allows it to check Machamp and—to a lesser extent—Heracross more easily, as well as punishing Nidoking, which would switch into Misdreavus almost fearlessly otherwise. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, forgoes recovery options and tries to trick the opponent into giving up a key Pokemon of theirs for what appeared to be a free KO. It can also serve as an emergency button against threats like Belly Drum Snorlax and Vaporeon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Misdreavus fits extremely well on Spikes-focused teams alongside Cloyster or Forretress due to its ability to spinblock and to wear down the foe further with Thief and Toxic. These forms of residual damage are even more effective when exploited by a phazer like Skarmory, which fares well against Earthquake variants of Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax, as well as Raikou, which is also offensively threatening on its own. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon are suited to deal with hard hitters that give trouble to Misdreavus; Marowak can be handled by Skarmory and Zapdos can be handled by Raikou. Misdreavus itself is especially susceptible to Pursuit users like Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Houndoom. Thus, Pokemon that can take advantage of Pursuit users like Machamp, Heracross, and Vaporeon make for good teammates; the last two in particular are sometimes able to use the likes of Nidoking, as well as Steelix in the case of Vaporeon, as setup fodder, two Pokemon that Misdreavus may be unable to threaten significantly depending on its moveset. This Misdreavus variant has the potential to mess with just about any Pokemon, but it is lacking in ways to eliminate Rest users by itself. That's why packing a teammate that appreciates common Rest users being asleep like Belly Drum Snorlax or Tentacruel is a good idea. Finally, Misdreavus's effectiveness is hampered if it is poisoned, paralyzed, or asleep. Therefore, clerics like Miltank and Blissey are welcome, especially if Misdreavus lacks Rest.</p> "

        "name": "Perish Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set sees Misdreavus trading most of its disrupting and defensive capabilities as well as its reliability as a spinblocker for a more immediately threatening approach. Mean Look and Perish Song used in tandem will put the opposing Pokemon on an inescapable timer, unless said Pokemon happens to be a phazer or can eliminate Misdreavus quickly enough. Protect stalls out the opponent's attempts to get rid of Misdreavus or to phaze it while the countdown gets closer to zero. There are plenty of options for the last moveslot, but Confuse Ray is recommended, since it's Misdreavus's best bet against phazers and most hard hitters in general, although Thunder is still something to consider, since it invalidates Skarmory as an answer and allows Misdreavus to remain as an effective spinblocker. On the final turn of Perish Song, Misdreavus can choose to either switch out and give the opposing Pokemon one shot at your team or stay in and trade one-for-one once it has outlived its usefulness.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Despite the presence of Confuse Ray, phazers like Tyranitar, Steelix, Skarmory, Raikou, and Suicune remain answers to this set. Therefore, Pokemon that can cripple them like Lovely Kiss or all-out attacking variants of Snorlax make for good partners. In return, Misdreavus will most likely find opportunities against opposing Snorlax, Machamp, and Miltank, something that your own Snorlax will appreciate. Although its effectiveness as a spinblocker is significantly reduced if it lacks Thunder, Misdreavus can still exploit its Ghost typing if paired with Cloyster or Forretress. Paralysis in conjunction with Confuse Ray can further frustrate attempts to phaze Misdreavus, so teammates such as Raikou, Zapdos, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and Body Slam Snorlax can be useful for the paralysis they can inflict on various targets. Toxic users like Forretress, Skarmory, and Suicune are essential alongside Thunder variants, as being poisoned will force Roar Raikou to use Rest and give Misdreavus a crucial opportunity. Additionally, Misdreavus fears Pursuit users and status ailments, so Machamp, Heracross, Vaporeon, Miltank, and Blissey are effective teammates.</p> "

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress finds a secure spot on many OU teams due to its ability to viably compress Rapid Spin and Spikes support. It also has excellent physical bulk and a fantastic Steel / Bug defensive typing that gives it useful resistances to Psychic-, Ice-, and Normal-type moves and an immunity to Toxic, which allows it to switch in and set up Spikes and use Rapid Spin on passive Pokemon with Toxic like Umbreon and Skarmory. Its resistance to Normal-type moves also allows it to tank Explosion and Self-Destruct from the likes of Steelix and Snorlax, making it a good choice to attempt to take those moves aimed at key teammates after Forretress has set up Spikes. However, Forretress has the lowest Special Defense of any fully evolved Steel-type, meaning that it can often be overwhelmed by strong special attacks. Forretress also has a terrible 4x weakness to Fire, and its poor Special Defense and the popularity of Steel-types as a whole mean that it has a tendency to be lured in and KOed by Pokemon it would usually set up on, such as Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor and Fire Blast Snorlax. Finally, Forretress faces competition as a Spikes setter and Rapid Spin user from Cloyster, which is much faster, has a more threatening Explosion due to its higher Attack stat, and has STAB Surf, which allows it to offensively pressure all Explosion-resistant, physically defensive Pokemon, something that Forretress struggles to do with its pathetic Special Attack and bare offensive movepool. However, Forretress's lack of weaknesses outside of Fire means that it can choose to risk a strong neutral or resisted hit in exchange for setting up or removing Spikes against a wider pool of Pokemon, such as Nidoking and even Raikou and Zapdos. The strategy of wearing down Cloyster with Toxic that stall teams often use will also be ineffective against Forretress, making it a useful pick when trying to outlast them. Lastly, while Cloyster must drop a key move in Explosion in order to run Rapid Spin, Forretress is free to use both on the same set.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Bug is Forretress's best STAB move, which threatens Starmie just enough so that it is unable to reliably remove Spikes against Forretress and also does big damage against Exeggutor and Jynx. However, Hidden Power Bug isn't really good for much else, and Toxic with Pursuit or Ghost-type support can also do the job of beating Starmie. Running Hidden Power Bug over Forretress's other coverage options also prevents Forretress from being able to beat important Pokemon such as Cloyster, Gengar, and opposing Forretress. Reflect doubles Forretress's and its partners' Defense, letting certain setup sweepers have an easier time setting up. Protect allows Forretress to gain additional Leftovers recovery and scout for moves like Fire Blast. Sandstorm is an option that out-damages Leftovers and pairs very well with Toxic and Spikes. Unfortunately, all of these options are very difficult to fit on the standard set, and while Sandstorm is very useful for chip damage, it can also have the adverse effect of wearing down Forretress's teammates, so this is important to consider when building a team with it. Forretress can drop Rapid Spin to free up space for another move like Toxic or Explosion; however, this can mean having to bring an additional Rapid Spin user, and without Rapid Spin, Cloyster is usually better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Misdreavus and Gengar are some of Forretress's hardest counters, since they take negligible damage from most of its attacks barring Hidden Power Ghost, are immune to Explosion, and are able to spinblock Forretress. Gengar is also notable in that it is immune to Toxic. Misdreavus can Perish trap Forretress to remove it, and Gengar can simply overwhelm Forretress with Thunder. However, it is harder for them to counter Forretress if it runs Hidden Power Ghost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves: Any Pokemon that carry Fire-type moves such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Nidoking instantly pose a massive threat to Forretress due to its 4x weakness to Fire. Snorlax notably misses the OHKO with Flamethrower but guarantees an OHKO with Fire Blast. Naturally, all Fire-type Pokemon also threaten to OHKO Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Power Fire Forretress: If Forretress isn't also running Hidden Power Fire and doesn't have a Ghost-type teammate for support, opposing Forretress can set up Spikes, remove Spikes from the opponent's side of the field, and 2HKO Forretress with Hidden Power Fire.</p> ",

Rapid Spin removes Spikes on Forretress's side of the field to prevent the same situation from happening to it. Toxic wears down most Pokemon that come in on it and is good against Pokemon like Cloyster, Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Snorlax. Although Forretress is slow, Explosion lets it be an emergency check to Belly Drum Snorlax thanks to its slightly higher Speed while also checking Vaporeon and Machamp and allowing it to possibly KO Zapdos and Raikou. Hidden Power Fire threatens to 2HKO opposing Forretress, potentially a game-winning advantage, and does decent damage to Skarmory and Steelix. Hidden Power Ghost prevents Forretress from being completely defenseless against Gengar and is a solid alternative to Toxic against Misdreavus. Giga Drain is an alternative that has a chance to 3HKO Cloyster, giving Forretress a chance of beating it one-on-one and creating mind games as to whether Forretress will use Giga Drain again or Rapid Spin, and it has a chance to 2HKO Golem.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Forretress wants to keep Spikes set up against the enemy as much as possible, so Ghost-types such as Gengar and Misdreavus make for good partners by blocking enemy Rapid Spin users.

Forretress also appreciates Tyranitar's ability to take on Snorlax that have Fire-type moves and Umbreon's ability to better trap Starmie. Due to Forretress's 4x weakness to Fire, Pokemon that can take on Belly Drum Charizard and RestTalk Moltres, such as Suicune, are very valuable teammates. Forretress's passivity also means that it allows many scary special attackers, setup sweepers, and general threats such as Zapdos, Vaporeon, Tentacruel, Gengar, and Perish Trap Misdreavus to switch in, so Raikou often makes a good partner with its reliable ability to beat these threats at least once.</p> "

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Steelix is an anomaly in that it's a primarily defensive Ground-type. It has incredible Defense and resists Normal-type attacks, letting it counter Snorlax, and its Steel / Ground typing gives it a crucial Electric immunity paired with neutrality to Ice-type attacks, thereby making it a safe switch-in to Electrics with Hidden Power. It's also one of the best go-to defensive phazers for responding to threats such as Perish trap Misdreavus and Baton Pass Jolteon. However, while Steelix surpasses other Ground-types defensively, it falls incredibly short of their offensive prowess with an Attack stat of 268. Still, Steelix is not totally inept. With Spikes down, it can use Roar to shuffle the opponent's Pokemon with the best of them, and it can set up Curses to pressure the opponent or even sweep in a late-game situation where all the Pokemon capable of hurting Steelix are KOed. It also gets Explosion to instantly take out a wall. Overall, Steelix is an excellent defensive pivot and emergency phazer that, while offensively handicapped compared to other Ground-types, can still threaten foes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Curse could be foregone to allow both Body Slam and Explosion on the same set to maximize Steelix's potential for immediate offensive impact. With a set of Earthquake, Body Slam, Explosion, and Roar, Steelix can still Spikes shuffle and phaze out dangerous threats while both spreading paralysis and having Explosion for walls such as Suicune or Zapdos. However, Steelix is generally better suited to building pressure by setting up Curses. Iron Tail could be used as an alternative STAB that, by virtue of the lack of Pokemon immune to it, actually allows mono-attacking Steelix to sweep at +6. However, Steel is in general a terrible attacking type, and furthermore it is only 75% accurate and also incapable of forcing Raikou to switch out. Substitute can be paired with Curse and Roar to dodge Growl and Charm while setting up a sweep. Iron Tail is the ideal attacking move on such a set to ensure nothing can wall a +6 Steelix. Bind can be paired with Explosion to make sure Steelix takes out the appropriate target.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Water-types are the chief counters that force Steelix to switch out while taking little damage in return from Steelix's Earthquake. Suicune, Vaporeon, Cloyster, and even Starmie are all excellent switch-ins to Steelix. Exeggutor is also a fine switch-in to Steelix that resists Earthquake while threatening to use Sleep Powder or whittle away its health with Psychic, Giga Drain, or Hidden Power Fire. Heracross, while not as common, can switch into Steelix, resists Earthquake, and can whittle away its health with Seismic Toss. Some more passive switch-ins to Steelix are Growl Miltank and Charm Umbreon, which shut Steelix down by negating the Attack boosts it gets from Curse. However, these counters cannot actually hurt Steelix, thereby allowing it to gain Leftovers recovery or switch out to a threatening special attacker, such as Zapdos, that does not mind taking a Growl or Charm on the switch.</p> <p>Steelix is also countered, to an extent, by Flying-types. Zapdos and Dragonite, especially if they use Hidden Power Water or Fire Blast, respectively, are great answers to Steelix. Their Flying typing, at the very least, forces Explosion Steelix to trade lives with them, although switching one of these Pokemon into a Rock Slide Steelix is a dicey proposition, especially if Steelix uses Curse on the switch-in to enable the Rock Slide 3HKO. Charizard is an unconventional Pokemon, but it is similar to Zapdos and Dragonite in that it at worst trades with Explosion Steelix while struggling to switch into Rock Slide Steelix. Charizard, however, can OHKO Steelix with STAB Fire Blast, so it fears switching into Rock Slide more than it fears switching into a Curse. Skarmory, too, is similar in that it forces Explosion Steelix to trade with it, while Rock Slide Steelix ultimately beats Skarmory if it is the only decent answer to Steelix left. However, Steelix must hit Skarmory on the switch with Rock Slide, as it must use Roar against an active Skarmory to avoid being phazed and losing its boosts. Thus, if Skarmory is paired with another Pokemon that can easily tank Rock Slides, Skarmory can attempt to stall Steelix out of PP. This is made even easier if Skarmory is using the uncommon Sand Attack set.</p> <p>Certain physical threats can also come in to capitalize off of Steelix's weaknesses. Marowak can handily 2HKO with Earthquake, although its Earthquake is downgraded to a 3HKO if Steelix has a Curse set up, so Marowak cannot switch into an active Steelix and instead must switch in as Steelix switches in. Machamp is similar, except its unboosted Cross Chop only 3HKOes, although the high critical hit ratio means that Cross Chop can potentially OHKO Steelix. Again, though, a Steelix that has set up Curse can tank these hits (unboosted Cross Chop from Machamp only does 30-35% to Steelix after a Curse), so Machamp must switch in as Steelix switches in, rather than switching into an active Steelix. Of course, these Pokemon and several others could also be using Fire Blast to roast Steelix for at least a 3HKO on the special side, meaning that even if they are brought in by Roar against a Steelix with several Curses, they could stay in despite the Defense boosts and still do heavy damage. Even Pokemon that Steelix normally counters, such as Snorlax, can easily turn the tables on Steelix with Fire Blast.</p> ",

        "name": "Curse + Roar",
        "description": "<p>Unlike other Ground-types, Steelix plays more as a defensive pivot than an offensive powerhouse thanks to its combination of great defensive typing and woefully mediocre Attack. STAB Earthquake is, aside from the Electric immunity, one of the biggest perks to being a Ground-type, so it's a must on Steelix to allow it to threaten relevant damage against foes. Curse is also required, as it allows Steelix to bolster its Attack to levels at which neutral Earthquakes actually threaten significant damage. Curse is the main way Steelix manages to create offensive pressure, especially in conjunction with Roar. Roar allows Steelix to prevent itself from being phazed by Pokemon such as Skarmory while it is setting up Curses, and furthermore can be used to shuffle the opponent's team to either scout or accumulate Spikes damage. Roar is also fantastic defensively, as Steelix is capable of countering several threats such as Curse Snorlax, Perish trap Misdreavus, and Baton Pass Jolteon, Espeon, and Umbreon.</p> <p>The last move depends on what you want out of Steelix. Explosion allows Steelix to break walls instead of simply applying offensive pressure. After a Curse, a full-health Steelix can survive Suicune's Surf and guarantee an OHKO in return with Explosion. Other threats, such as Zapdos and Miltank, are guaranteed to fall to a +1 Explosion, and Zapdos in particular is likely to be OHKOed and takes at least 93% damage from an unboosted Explosion. Explosion can also come in handy against Snorlax, even Fire Blast variants that Steelix otherwise struggles to beat. An unboosted Explosion does 80-94% to Snorlax, so you will need a little bit of residual damage to make this into an OHKO. Skarmory can also be KOed by Explosion if Steelix is able to set up enough Curses beforehand--at least 4 Curses are needed to guarantee an OHKO against an unboosted Skarmory, whereas 6 are needed to have a roughly 70% chance of OHKOing a +1 Skarmory. On the other hand, Rock Slide is a more conservative option that allows Steelix to 3HKO Zapdos after a Curse without needing to Explode. Furthermore, Rock Slide allows Steelix to sweep late-game when none of the opposing Pokemon can hurt it, even if the opponent has an Earthquake-immune Zapdos or Skarmory. Rock Slide can also severely punish Charizard switch-ins without the risk involved with Explosion. However, it's important to note that outside of trying to catch Charizard, Rock Slide is useless without Curses behind it, as it fails to even 3HKO Zapdos without a boost. Finally, Body Slam is an option for Steelix's last moveslot. Body Slam does not threaten to outright KO a wall the way Explosion can, and since it only does 24-28% to Skarmory when Steelix is at +6 Attack, it does not allow Steelix to sweep, either. However, Body Slam allows Steelix to spread paralysis, thereby allowing it to support its team much more effectively than it would have been able to otherwise.</p> <p>Steelix is best used on offensive teams as a defensive pivot to switch into Snorlax and Electric-types. It's immune to Thunder and takes only neutral damage from Ice moves, giving it \"perfect\" defensive coverage against the vaunted BoltBeam coverage touted by Zapdos, Raikou, and Gengar. Its high Defense and Steel typing allow it to tank Snorlax Double-Edges better than any other non-Ghost-type Pokemon, and furthermore its Defense is high enough to take merely 27-31% from Snorlax's unboosted Earthquake. These are the match-ups that make Steelix great, so it's best to use Steelix to either attempt to mount pressure against an opposing Snorlax or to chain-switch around Hidden Power Zapdos to get your own Snorlax or Tyranitar in on an innocuous Hidden Power instead of a powerful Thunder. However, always be wary of Fire Blast on Snorlax and Hidden Power Water on Zapdos or Raikou, as these can ruin Steelix's strong match-up against these foes. The possibility of these moves is part of what makes Explosion the standard fourth move over Rock Slide; at least with Explosion you can salvage the situation when unable to sweep against a non-standard Snorlax or Zapdos set and take something down with Steelix.</p> <p>Steelix tends to work best with Spikes support so it can use Roar to accumulate damage against the opposing team. Typically, Cloyster is the Spiker of choice to pair with Steelix. Defensively, Steelix synergizes well with Exeggutor, which can switch in against and torment Raikou and Zapdos that opt for Hidden Power Water over Hidden Power Ice. Misdreavus is also a good partner since it can handle Fire Blast Snorlax while spinblocking to keep Spikes down for Steelix. As for offensive support to pair with Steelix, this depends on whether Steelix is running Explosion, Body Slam, or Rock Slide. Steelix with Explosion helps break walls for the team, so Pokemon that struggle with its common Explosion targets are good teammates. Vaporeon, Machamp, and Charizard are a few teammates that appreciate Explosion Steelix's ability to take Suicune and Zapdos out of the game. If Steelix runs Body Slam, it isn't breaking walls but rather afflicting them with status to allow other attackers to beat them. Nidoking and Marowak are absolutely thrilled by Steelix's ability to paralyze Zapdos and Suicune for them, whereas Belly Drum Snorlax and Machamp can capitalize off of Steelix's ability to paralyze Skarmory. However, if Steelix uses Rock Slide, it aims to be a more effective Spikes shuffler by threatening damage against Zapdos, while also looking for a potential late-game sweep. Thus, Steelix will need to receive support rather than supply it. Steelix's common counters include Suicune and Growl Miltank, so teammates that can KO or paralyze these threats so Steelix can sweep will help it immensely. In particular, mixed Snorlax with Self-Destruct or Body Slam can threaten to KO or paralyze Miltank and Suicune.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor seems good at a first glance. It has a strong defensive typing that gives it only one weakness to Fire, one of the highest Attack stats in OU, decent bulk, and boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility that could make it a strong Pokemon for Baton Pass teams; however, in practice, Scizor is rather underwhelming. While passing Speed and Attack boosts can be scary for unprepared teams, it often struggles to pull that off effectively due to its poor matchup against the tier's most popular phazers, Steelix and Skarmory, both of which are able to easily tank any hit from Scizor and either force a switch or phaze it. Due to this, it usually can't come out until a partner such as Smeargle, Jolteon, or Snorlax has disarmed the phazers by putting them to sleep or doing serious damage. Additionally, Scizor has to constantly watch out for Fire-type attacks that many common Pokemon run, such as Snorlax and Tyranitar.</p> <p>However, Scizor does have a unique niche on Baton Pass teams that still might make it worth using. It has decent bulk and a Bug / Steel typing that not only grants Scizor an immunity to Poison and useful Psychic- and Ice-type resistances, but also gives it a strong resistance to Explosion and Self-Destruct, which makes it more difficult for offensive teams to prevent it from passing stat boosts. Scizor also has a strong matchup against Exeggutor, which can be a crucial Pokemon to take down due to its ability to threaten Baton Pass teams. Scizor is also able to hit Raikou hard, which very few other Baton Pass users on Baton Pass teams can do.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scizor has access to Light Screen, which can benefit its team by halving the damage of special attacks and assisting in passing boosts to teammates, and it also helps Scizor take some special attackers head on. However, Light Screen cannot reliably fit on Baton Pass sets due to Scizor needing all four slots for other moves. Counter can be used to possibly OHKO Pokemon like Snorlax and Heracross; Earthquake + Normal-type move + Belly Drum Snorlax notably cannot take out Scizor without a critical hit. However, Counter is incompatible with Baton Pass and can make Scizor setup fodder for sweepers if you predict incorrectly. Scizor can attempt to use a Swords Dance sweeper set with Swords Dance, Hidden Power Fighting, Steel Wing, and Return, but due to lack of a strong STAB move and low Speed, other candidates for the physical sweeper role such as Heracross and Marowak tend to make for better choices. Thief can be run over Agility on non-Baton Pass teams to take items from Pokemon like Skarmory and Steelix, which can make whittling them down much easier. However, this gets rid of Scizor's ability to pass Speed onto its teammates, so its effectiveness is lowered.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Skarmory: Skarmory is Scizor's hardest counter, as Scizor is unable to do any significant damage to Skarmory even with a +2 Hidden Power Fighting and gets phazed out without any effort.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Any Pokemon that carries Fire-type attacks such as Nidoking, Snorlax, and Machamp are huge threats to Scizor, preventing it from doing its work as a Baton Passer by KOing it easily due to its poor special bulk and 4x weakness to Fire-type Moves.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos resists both Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Fighting and is able to 2HKO it with Thunder; however, it cannot prevent Scizor from passing boosts unless it has Roar or Thunder paralyzes it.</p> <p><strong>Suicune</strong>: While Suicune doesn't resist Scizor's attacks, its Defense causes Scizor to be unable to threaten it even after a boost, and Suicune can easily phaze Scizor or hit it hard with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Steelix</strong>: Steelix can safely phaze Hidden Power Bug variants multiple times and Hidden Power Fighting variants once or twice. It can also set up a Curse boost and threaten heavy damage with Earthquake.</p> ",

Hidden Power Fighting is also an option to hit Steelix super effectively and threatens to OHKO Tyranitar, though this sacrifices a good matchup against Exeggutor. Leftovers gives Scizor useful passive recovery that might allow it to stay in for a bit longer, but Miracle Berry can be run instead to prevent paralysis or sleep, which would otherwise prevent it from reliably passing boosts to teammates.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Baton Pass staples such as Smeargle and Jolteon are mandatory teammates, as they can threaten or incapacitate most phazers. In return, Scizor can do serious damage to Raikou, which can be a pain for Baton Pass teams due to Roar and its high Special Attack.

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Shuckle is a Pokemon of extremes. Its ridiculously high Defense and Special Defense stats are coupled with other stats that are ridiculously low, which makes it extremely difficult for it to inflict meaningful damage through conventional means. Shuckle's resistance to Normal in combination with its lack of weaknesses to common types, such as Electric, Ground, and Fire, makes it one of the most reliable Snorlax checks in the game. It is unique in that it has high Special Defense alongside its resistance to Normal, meaning it can wall many common Explosion users, such as Gengar and Exeggutor. Its downfalls are its bare movepool and awful attacking stats, which limit its options to spreading poison with Toxic and PP stalling and make it one of the most passive Pokemon in the game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can use Rollout with Curse to attempt to sweep the opposing team, but this requires anything that can potentially KO it quickly, phaze it, poison it, or reduce its Attack to be dealt with beforehand and substantially decreases its effectiveness as a defensive wall. Sleep Talk can be used to increase Shuckle's capacity to absorb sleep as well as improve its ability to take on powerful threats that come close to 3HKOing it, although this comes at the expense of a moveslot. Sandstorm can be used to complement Toxic and wear down foes very quickly, although it may also wear down some of Shuckle's teammates. Lastly, Shuckle has the option of running Hidden Power Fire to put pressure on Forretress, which is one of the Pokemon that can take the most advantage of Shuckle by setting and removing Spikes. However, DV requirements mean that Shuckle's already low HP gets reduced even further when using it, and it takes up a valuable moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Forretress: Forretress is immune to Shuckle's Toxic and can lay down Spikes, which can then be used to pressure Shuckle and its teammates without having to use PP. Forretress can also spin away any Spikes that Shuckle's teammates may have put down.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: As Shuckle is often paired with other passive Pokemon like Skarmory and Blissey, Vaporeon can be extremely dangerous, especially if it is a RestTalk or Baton Pass variant with Growth. Shuckle can poison Vaporeon with Toxic on the switch, but Vaporeon is likely to be able to find an opening due to Shuckle having to PP stall other foes and often has Rest to cure itself in the event it gets caught on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel: Swords Dance Tentacruel is one of the biggest threats to teams with Shuckle due to their passivity and tendency to rely on Toxic to keep dangerous sweepers from switching in. Shuckle can do nothing to threaten Tentacruel, meaning it can come in at any time to set up and threaten Shuckle and its teammates. This weakness is also compounded by the fact that many of the Pokemon Shuckle pairs well with, such as Skarmory and Blissey, struggle against Tentacruel—there is generally at most only a single reliable counter to Tentacruel on these passive teams, which also makes them a target for Explosion users that Tentacruel is commonly paired with, like Cloyster and Steelix.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Steelix: Skarmory and Steelix are both immune to Toxic and can use Curse with a phazing move to prevent Shuckle from walling them with its Defense boosts. However, they can do little to stop it from lowering their accuracy with Flash, so they can sometimes find it difficult to exert pressure despite this advantage.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Suicune, Zapdos, and Raikou</strong>: These Pokemon don't care much about Toxic due to having RestTalk and can threaten Shuckle with their STAB attacks to force it out. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they will be able to create momentum if they are walled by other members of Shuckle's team, unless Spikes are up. Furthermore, being forced to use Rest can result in opportunities for dangerous sweepers that Shuckle may be paired with, such as Belly Drum Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster: Cloyster is not immune to Toxic, but its access to Spikes, STAB Surf, and Explosion makes it a dangerous foe for Shuckle and its teammates. Cloyster can take advantage of its threat level against Shuckle to land Explosion on an important target such as Starmie, which may be the only thing preventing Pokemon like Machamp, Charizard, and Tentacruel from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Belly Drum users such as Charizard, Snorlax, and Quagsire can take advantage of Shuckle's downtime after using Rest to set up a sweep. Belly Drum Snorlax is particularly notable because Shuckle will often switch into it expecting a Curse or Self-Destruct variant but will usually lose to Belly Drum Snorlax unless it lacks Earthquake. Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and Heracross can similarly take advantage of a sleeping Shuckle to set up Attack boosts; Heracross and Machamp notably still outspeed Shuckle after a Speed drop from Curse.</p> <p><strong>Seismic Toss: Seismic Toss 3HKOes Shuckle, so Pokemon such as Heracross and Miltank can potentially use it to threaten both Shuckle and its common partner Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar and Rhydon: Pokemon with STAB Rock Slide such as Tyranitar and Rhydon can threaten Shuckle, although they often lack Rest, so they are fearful of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Nidoking and Gengar</strong>: Nidoking and Gengar are prone to being PP stalled by Shuckle because boosting moves are unviable on them, but they are immune to Toxic and can therefore attempt to beat Shuckle by freezing it, landing a well-timed critical hit, stealing its Leftovers with Thief, or putting it to sleep when it's at low health. Their immunity to Toxic also makes it much easier to press a Spikes advantage or create situations where the Shuckle user must take risks or use up PP in exchange for no gain, and in the absence of Spikes, they are able to use Shuckle to regain health with Leftovers.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "PP Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Shuckle cannot hope to get past any foes by attacking them, so its role is to waste PP and wall a variety of threats. Defense Curl has a massive PP count, which ensures that Shuckle cannot be outdone in terms of PP. Without the ability to boost its Defense, Shuckle would eventually succumb to Curse Snorlax, so Defense Curl is crucial to allow Shuckle to perform its role effectively. Toxic is Shuckle's only damage source and can be used to restrict the number of Pokemon that can switch into it safely to those that are immune to it or have Rest, force Pokemon that have Rest to use it, and punish any Pokemon without Rest that risk staying in against it. As it is a powerful dissuasion tool with limited PP, it is sometimes a good idea to use it sparingly—although, catching dangerous sweepers on the switch can yield significant advantages. Alternatively, Encore can be used to attempt to waste the PP of a particular move or lock the opposing Pokemon into a move, which allows Shuckle's teammates to switch in freely. However, Toxic tends to be preferred because it gives Shuckle a way to punish threatening Pokemon like Cloyster, Machamp, and Tyranitar. Unlike Curse Skarmory, which is at no risk of being defeated by a critical hit from an opposing Curse Snorlax, Shuckle's inability to boost its Defense past +2 and its low base HP mean that it will, on average, be KOed by a critical hit Double-Edge or Earthquake plus two non-critical hits from a +5 Attack Snorlax. Shuckle therefore has Flash to minimize the odds of this situation occurring. Flash is also useful against other setup sweepers such as Steelix, and it contributes to Shuckle's overall goal of ensuring the opponent cannot mount offensive pressure by reducing the threat level of any foe it hits. Wrap is an alternative that forces foes to waste more PP by preventing them from switching out, which can also work well with Encore to attempt to force the opponent to use up more of a particular move. However, forgoing Flash can result in situations where Shuckle is unable to do its job of walling Snorlax effectively. Finally, Rest ensures that Shuckle cannot be worn down by repeated attacks by allowing it to keep itself healthy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle is extremely passive, so it fits best on teams with reliable and sturdy Pokemon such as Skarmory and Blissey. Shuckle is one of the best Pokemon in the game at taking on all manner of mixed, Curse, and Self-Destruct variants of Snorlax, but it struggles against Belly Drum Snorlax due to being outsped by it. It is therefore a good idea to use Skarmory as a check to Belly Drum Snorlax as well as other threats such as Heracross, Machamp, and Marowak, which Shuckle can struggle against. Shuckle can easily be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Growth Vaporeon, so it is a good idea to bring a reliable answer to it such as Zapdos, Roar Suicune, Light Screen Starmie, or Light Screen Blissey. However, it must be noted that Shuckle will be extremely vulnerable to special attacks while Light Screen is active because its Special Defense is so high that Light Screen makes it exceed the stat cap and roll over to a much lower number. Other powerful special attackers like Zapdos also pose a significant threat to Shuckle, especially if Spikes are up. Pokemon such as Blissey, Snorlax, Raikou, and Quagsire make for solid options for taking on Zapdos, and Blissey can also potentially offer Heal Bell support. Due to Shuckle inviting Forretress in, it can be a good idea to pair it with a spinblocker if Shuckle is supported by Spikes and a spinner to prevent Shuckle from being worn down in the long run. Starmie, Golem, and Forretress are common spinners; Starmie is also good against Cloyster and Machamp, Golem boasts a decent Tyranitar matchup and can easily beat both spinblockers, and Forretress has access to Spikes.</p> <p>Due to Shuckle's passivity, it requires its teammates to be capable of exerting offensive pressure in order to have a chance at winning. This pressure can come from Spikes and Toxic, Belly Drum users and powerful physical attackers like Machamp and Marowak, Growth sweepers like Jolteon, and even teams designed to take advantage of Struggle's infinite PP to create offensive pressure. Shuckle can be used on more offensive teams, but doing so introduces significant risk due to there being dangerous Pokemon that can take advantage of its presence, such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heracross's decent Special Defense and high Attack let it take quite a few special hits and fire back hard physically. Furthermore, its key resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks allow it to check Pokemon like Nidoking, Golem, Steelix, and Machamp; when it's healthy, it can safely switch in and check an unboosted Marowak that lacks the uncommon Hidden Power Flying. On top of its high Attack and Special Defense, its Speed is quite good. This allows Heracross to outspeed Exeggutor, Tyranitar, and Umbreon, which all get maimed by Megahorn.</p> <p>However, Heracross's only prominent STAB move, Megahorn, is resisted by very common types like Flying and Steel. This means that Pokemon like a healthy Zapdos, Skarmory, and Steelix can reliably pivot in and cause trouble for the Hercules beetle, with the threats of Thunder from Zapdos, Drill Peck or Whirlwind from Skarmory, and Roar or Explosion from Steelix, among some more niche moves from these Pokemon. Overall, Heracross can be very effective at shutting down difficult threats throughout the game, but patience must be exhibited when using it, as it needs to wait for some Pokemon that may very well be long-lasting to get KOed or weakened before it can try to clean.</p> ",

This set works like Curse Machamp but with better special bulk and key resistances; however, compared to Machamp, it has a worse STAB move, and it's still walled by Skarmory.</p> <p>An Endure + Reversal set is marginally viable, as Reversal can 2HKO Skarmory, but it is difficult to pull off, as its biggest issue is simply that it's difficult to get the opponent to attack and lower Heracross's HP down to 1%. One of Heracross's selling points is its ability to shrug off status via its longevity and Rest, but this variant of Heracross will despise status. Also, if Spikes are in play, it’s only a one-time use, so Rapid Spin support is mandatory with this set. Starmie fits the role well here, as it can potentially remove Gengar with Psychic or slow down faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Counter can be used to bait and take out Snorlax and Machamp, and with Curse it can remove Skarmory, but the RestTalk Curse set is more consistent against Snorlax, and it tends to be more effective for other teammates to remove Skarmory to support Heracross's potential end-game sweep. Counter can also potentially be used against Marowak, but this is far more situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Skarmory and Zapdos are the most reliable Heracross checks. Skarmory is more effective at stopping Curse Heracross, since it always wins the one-on-one matchup, while Zapdos is more effective at stopping Seismic Toss variants because they can't 4HKO it; however, both are very good versus either version. The rarer Reflect Zapdos can shut down Curse variants even more consistently while still doing excellently versus the Seismic Toss variant. Charizard, Moltres, and Dragonite, though far less prominent, are safe switch-ins against Heracross, bar less viable Hidden Power Rock sets. However, Dragonite must have super effective moves like Hidden Power Flying and Fire Blast, or Heracross will chip it down.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Gengar is immune to Seismic Toss, takes negligible damage from Megahorn, and can threaten Heracross with Explosion, Destiny Bond, Ice Punch freezes, or Fire Punch; however, it must watch out for Earthquake if it doesn't want to trade, and Curse sets can mitigate the danger of Explosion while somewhat avoiding Destiny Bond mind games. Misdreavus can force Heracross out with the threat of Perish trap or maybe even engage in Destiny Bond mind games, but it only functions as a soft check at most, since Megahorn still stings and can land a 3HKO with just a little bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Other Bug-resistant Pokemon: Steelix can boost alongside Heracross with Curse and phaze it with Roar or even trade with Explosion, but it does not make for an effective Seismic Toss Heracross counter. Nidoking could potentially turn the tides around with a surprise Flamethrower or Fire Blast, but Heracross can still heal itself by using Rest, and Nidoking almost never has an active form of recovery, so it wants to avoid taking chip damage. Similarly, Heracross also has to watch out for Fire Blast from Muk, which also resists Megahorn and has reasonably decent natural bulk. Machamp can also pack Fire Blast, but it's more uncommon; furthermore, Hidden Power Flying is an option on Machamp to hit both Heracross and Exeggutor with super effective damage. Entei, although a very niche pick, can switch in with ease, set up Sunny Day, and destroy Heracross with its Fire Blast. Heracross can check itself, but you should try to manage its PP well in case you later on decide to engage in a PP war. Seismic Toss Heracross will naturally lose in the long run to RestTalk + Curse Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Miltank: Miltank can switch in safely enough and lower Heracross's Attack with Growl as well as drain Curse's PP while healing up with Milk Drink, but it can't really threaten RestTalk Heracross.</p> ",

        "name": "RestTalk",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Heracross has quite the shallow movepool but a decent combination of bulk and typing, which makes RestTalk the perfect strategy for it. Megahorn will heavily dent anything that doesn't resist it. Combining these attributes, Heracross can have decent matchups against Pokemon like Raikou and Suicune. Raikou sustains massive damage from Megahorn, and Heracross also outdamages Suicune while not minding Toxic too much thanks to Rest, making it a very reliable Suicune pivot and enabling it to force Suicune out often.</p> <p>For the last moveslot, Curse and Seismic Toss are the two best choices. Curse can make Heracross an extremely effective late-game sweeper after checks like Skarmory, Steelix, and Zapdos have been removed from the battle. In more desperate situations, with timely Thunder misses from Zapdos, Heracross may actually be able to edge it out in the one-on-one scenario, but this is unlikely and extremely risky. Curse can also allow Heracross to match up decently versus Snorlax sometimes, as Megahorn does quite a lot of damage, and even after a Curse, Heracross still outspeeds Snorlax.</p> <p>Seismic Toss is more of a conservative and defensive choice, which gives Heracross more consistent damage output against Pokemon like Machamp, Steelix, and even Nidoking, which all resist Megahorn. Seismic Toss does a great job at chipping Skarmory when it enters into Heracross, and if Skarmory uses Rest and is forced out without burning any sleep turns, it can no longer safely switch into Heracross because it gets outsped and 4HKOed by Seismic Toss. Otherwise, Heracross will most likely have to switch out after hitting a healthy Skarmory with a Seismic Toss. Also, Seismic Toss gives Forretress more trouble, especially since it's a Pokemon that usually has no recovery other than Leftovers. However, without Curse, Heracross will not be as potent of an end-game cleaner.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, most Pokemon that resist Megahorn like Zapdos and Skarmory are quite common and shut Heracross down quite easily, so getting rid of its common checks is crucial for it to shine. This means that Heracross really appreciates lures for these Pokemon. Using a Self-Destruct Curse Snorlax with Heracross is a great way to lure in and KO opposing Skarmory. Exeggutor can often cripple and even remove Zapdos with Explosion; it can also use Hidden Power Fire to pressure Skarmory and cripple it with a status move. Tyranitar is a great teammate for being an essential Normal-type switch-in and a Pursuit trapper that can assist in taking down meddling Ghost-types like Gengar; it can even take advantage of Skarmory's fear of Fire Blast to chip it with Pursuit, bringing it closer to the range Seismic Toss Heracross can KO it from. An additional sleep absorber like Sleep Talk Raikou or Sleep Talk Snorlax can pair decently well with Heracross to help against both Zapdos and Jynx. In Raikou's case, Heracross can absorb sleep from Nidoking and Snorlax, while Raikou covers Jynx and Exeggutor. Golem provides Rapid Spin, a Normal resistance, and offensive presence as a spinner, which pairs nicely with Heracross both offensively and defensively. Raikou will check both Zapdos and Skarmory defensively, two of Heracross's worst nemeses, while Heracross checks Nidoking and Machamp, giving the two Pokemon great defensive synergy as well.</p> "

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Ursaring has the highest Attack stat of any Normal-type at base 130, allowing it to KO some Pokemon that its main competitors Snorlax and Kangaskhan cannot. It also has a decent Special Attack and special movepool, letting it perform as a niche mixed attacker. Unfortunately, Ursaring's positives end there, as it still faces far too much competition in all of its roles. Other Normal-types such as Porygon2, Snorlax, and even Tauros mostly outclass Ursaring due to their superior bulk, coverage, or Speed. As a Curse phazer, Ursaring is usually outdone by Rhydon and Kangaskhan, where the former sports better physical bulk and a Ground/Rock typing and the latter making up for its worse Attack with better overall bulk, allowing it to stay in longer. Ursaring's subpar bulk and Normal typing also provide its team with no useful defensive utility, and since Snorlax is often considered mandatory on OU teams, both can create a big Fighting-type weakness for its team together. Due to these traits, Ursaring should rarely, if ever, be considered on a serious team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ursaring can use a RestTalk set with Curse and Return to give it some more longevity, but must deal with the same measures the opponent will have prepared for Snorlax while also being thoroughly outclassed by it. A mixed attacker set with Return / Earthquake / Dynamic Punch and Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, or Zap Cannon can be run. However, this set is mostly outclassed by Snorlax and Porygon2, which have better bulk and access to Flamethrower and Fire Blast for the former and Ice Beam for the latter, though Dynamic Punch has the benefit of KOing Tyranitar, which Porygon2 struggles to do. Counter takes advantage of Ursaring's rather average bulk to potentially KO threats such as +1 Attack Skarmory and Steelix, but this can take the slot of an important move, so it is difficult to fit on any set. Incorrectly predicting can lead to the opponent boosting freely, spreading status, or phazing Ursaring, so it is rather risky. Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful STAB move that can land a surprise KO on Pokemon that stay in on Ursaring. However, using Hyper Beam renders Ursaring immobile for a turn afterwards, which can give the opponent a free turn to boost, set up Spikes, or status Ursaring. Berserk Gene can be used alongside Hyper Beam for even more instant power, but has the issue of confusion, which can hurt Ursaring quite a bit if it is unlucky. Thief hinders some of Ursaring's common checks and counters such as Skarmory and Steelix by removing their Leftovers to reduce their longevity, something that Kangaskhan and Snorlax cannot do. However, Thief is very weak and is only able to be used once before becoming useless.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Forretress, Steelix, and Skarmory completely wall any of Ursaring's sets barring its mixed set. Steelix has such high bulk that it takes Ursaring two Curse boosts just to 2HKO it with Earthquake, and Steelix can retaliate by phazing or setting up on Ursaring. Skarmory laughs at Ursaring's Return and is immune to Earthquake. It too can phaze Ursaring in return, which can be an issue for Ursaring, as it lacks the bulk and resistances to switch in often. Forretress takes neutral damage from Earthquake and requires Ursaring to use Curse four times to get a guaranteed 2HKO. Forretress can also set up Spikes and cripple Ursaring with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: If Ursaring is not running Earthquake, it is walled by popular Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Rhydon. These Pokemon are also able to threaten Ursaring with their high Attack and STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster: Cloyster can take advantage of Ursaring by easily tanking its attacks, setting up Spikes, and using Toxic or Surf on it before either using Explosion or switching to the appropriate counter.</p> <p><strong>Miltank and Umbreon</strong>: Due to Ursaring's lack of access to Body Slam and Double-Edge, it doesn't have a STAB option that would allow it to potentially get past Miltank or Umbreon. They can negate any Attack boosts with Growl or Charm and heal off any damage, allowing both to run Ursaring out of PP or weaken it for a teammate to finish it off.</p> ",

STAB Return can do a considerable amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake gives Ursaring coverage to help take down Rock-types that would otherwise wall it. Roar allows Ursaring to beat enemy Curse users as long as it gets a Curse boost first. With the Speed drop from Curse, Roar also allows Ursaring to get around Pokemon that would otherwise counter it through phazing such as Skarmory. However, this strategy is ruined if Ursaring gets poisoned, so it can elect to use Rest instead of Earthquake. If it selects Roar while asleep and is slower, it will still block enemy phazing attempts. Leftovers gives Ursaring essential passive recovery. This set faces heavy competition for a teamslot from Kangaskhan, whose superior bulk better suits the Curse phazer role and mostly makes up for its significantly lower Attack stat.</p> "

It does get countered by just about any standard Water-type, but besides that it's a great UU choice. Unfortunately, as good as Ground / Ice is offensively, it is a garbage typing defensively.

All it has going for it is Spikes and Rapid Spin, and it can't use both at once, which is really bad. Use this guy as a UU Spiker and watch out for Rock moves, STAB or not.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin is cool, and Delibird is the only Rapid Spinner who also resists Spikes, but you can't use both Rapid Spin and Spikes, so if you have to choose between the two, you should probably go with Spikes instead. Quick Attack can be used with Curse for a poor man's Dragonite Curse + Extreme Speed set. If you feel like taking a super risk and having some fun, use Present in Gold and Silver only. Present is a glitchy move in those two games, and can possibly deal a ton of damage to certain Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kabutops, Omastar, Corsola, and Scizor all resist Ice Beam and can hit it with a STAB super effective move. Electric-types like Raikou and Jolteon usually have high enough Special Defense to take Ice Beam, resist Hidden Power Flying, and have STAB Thunderbolt to hit Delibird with, but Zapdos isn't so good of a choice because it's weak to Ice Beam.

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Since the very beginning of the GSC metagame, Skarmory has proved to be a force to be reckoned with. With an amazing base 140 Defense stat, 9 resistances, 2 immunities, and no physical weaknesses, Skarmory is easily the best physical wall available in GSC. Throw in Skarmory's ability to phaze opponents with Whirlwind and boost its already ridiculous Defense with Curse, and you have an excellent check to top threats such as Snorlax, Marowak, Heracross, Exeggutor, Machamp, Umbreon, Quagsire, and Espeon. In addition, Skarmory's resistance to Normal-type attacks also makes it a good switch-in to most predicted Explosions.</p> <p>While Skarmory is an amazing physical wall, it lacks the ability to effectively deal with special attacks from most special and mixed attackers, the reason being its measly base 70 Special Defense and poor base 65 HP. Skarmory's movepool is also rather limited; beyond Toxic and Drill Peck, it has little in the way of offense, and is forced to rely upon Rest and Leftovers for healing off damage due to its lack of recovery options. While sleeping, Skarmory will no longer be able to check some threats, such as Belly Drum Snorlax, Marowak, Machamp, and trappers, although others, such as Curse Snorlax, non-Seismic Toss Heracross, and most Exeggutor, still won't be able to get past Skarmory. That said, Skarmory is still an incredible defensive Pokemon that should always be considered when team building, especially when creating a stall-based team. Ignore this bird of steel at your own risk!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the moves already mentioned, Skarmory has a few options that it can use over Curse. Thief is an interesting possibility because it can remove Leftovers from an opponent, making them more susceptible to being worn down over time. Keep in mind that Thief only works when Skarmory is not carrying an item. Toxic is another option over Curse to drain the opponent's health. However, many Pokemon carry Rest, and Heal Bell support is also fairly common, so Skarmory will often find it difficult to sufficiently wear down many of the tanks that Toxic is meant to counter; however, Toxic is still useful for forcing certain Pokemon to waste a turn Resting. Pokemon that often carry Rest without Sleep Talk, such as Raikou, are especially susceptible to this strategy. Wearing down Electric-types looking to switch in can be very useful, especially with Spikes support. Toxic will also wear down Tyranitar, Rhydon, Cloyster, and Dragonite looking for an easy switch-in, and is effective against defensive Pokemon that don't have Rest and Sleep Talk, such as Starmie and Miltank. Sand Attack is another option for Skarmory to use against Kangaskhan, and makes a great ploy for annoying opponents in general. The accuracy drops can really ruin opponents, especially those that rely on moves without perfect accuracy, such as Thunder Zapdos and Raikou.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Strong special attacks remain the best way to deal with Skarmory, as they hit its much weaker Special Defense. Electric-types such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon can easily switch into Drill Peck and force Skarmory out with a super effective STAB attack. Mixed sweepers such as Nidoking, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Fire Blast Snorlax can all come in and do a great deal of damage to Skarmory. Vaporeon is a deadly special sweeper which can scare out Skarmory and use the free turn to boost. While not common, Charizard can come in on Skarmory, threaten it with Fire Blast, and use Belly Drum as it switches out. Cloyster and Forretress can easily set up Spikes on Skarmory. Steelix, Kangaskhan, Rhydon, and Tyranitar are all slower than Skarmory after a Curse boost, allowing them to force Skarmory out with Roar after it uses Whirlwind--in GSC, phazing moves fail if they go before the opponent moves. Houndoom and Tyranitar can rack up Pursuit damage on Skarmory by threatening it with powerful Fire-type moves. Starmie and Suicune can threaten Skarmory with a STAB Surf, and Starmie can even get a free turn to clear away Spikes with Rapid Spin. However, be aware that many of the counters mentioned above will be surprised by the occasional Toxic. Snorlax with Fire Blast can surprise Skarmory with a 2HKO, while Lovely Kiss versions can cripple Skarmory and then proceed to use Belly Drum to rip through the rest of the team.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physical Wall",
        "description": "<p>This set gives Skarmory everything it needs to succeed. With access to Whirlwind and Curse, as well as fantastic resistances, Skarmory will be able to counter many top OU threats with ease. It can easily come in on Curse or Belly Drum Snorlax and phaze it with Whirlwind. Curse allows Skarmory to effectively wall Belly Drum Snorlax as well as last-Pokemon Curse Snorlax after only one or two boosts. Skarmory can also deal with the likes of Heracross, Marowak, and Machamp, preventing them from sweeping or setting up. Additionally, it can serve as an effective check to Umbreon and Misdreavus without Thunder, as Whirlwind will stop their respective trap-passing and Perish-trapping attempts.</p> <p>Curse gives Skarmory additional Defense boosts, increasing its general longevity. The sheer physical durability of Skarmory after a Curse cannot be understated. For example, at +1 Defense, Skarmory will almost never be 3HKOed by Snorlax's 999 Attack Double-Edge, 999 Attack Marowak cannot 3HKO with Rock Slide, boosted Steelix can't OHKO with Explosion, 999 Attack Rhydon never 2HKOes with Rock Slide, and Machamp will fail to OHKO with a +1 Cross Chop even with a critical hit. Curse also gives Skarmory a Speed drop that lets it phaze other Curse and Roar users, such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Tyranitar, that would otherwise phaze Skarmory instead. While not common, Skarmory can occasionally sweep thanks to Curse if Growl users and special attackers such as Zapdos and Raikou are removed, but this is a very situational scenario. A quick note on Curse: when using Pokemon Netbattle Supremacy, Skarmory will be one Speed point faster at -1 than Snorlax; however, when using Pokemon Online, Skarmory at -1 Speed will tie with Snorlax.</p> <p>With Drill Peck, Skarmory has an option to deal a good chunk of damage to threats such as Machamp, Exeggutor, and Heracross. Skarmory resists both of Exeggutor's STAB moves, and barring Sleep Powder or Hidden Power Fire, it can switch in with impunity. When going up against Curse Machamp, it is a good idea to boost with Curse first before using Drill Peck in order to prevent Skarmory from losing a good chunk of its health to Cross Chop. Rest is for recovering health and removing paralysis; a paralyzed Skarmory will find it more difficult to check Pokemon it would normally beat, such as Swords Dance Marowak, Curse Machamp, and Belly Drum Snorlax. However, keep in mind that a sleeping Skarmory won't be able to counter threats it normally would, such as setup sweepers and trappers. As a word of warning, opponents can and will capitalize on the two free turns from Rest. It is recommended that you only use Rest when completely necessary; Heal Bell support is also a good idea.</p> <p>Skarmory is a fantastic physical wall and defensive pivot, but it will enjoy help dealing with special threats. Skarmory absolutely loves support from switch-ins to Electric-types that try to ruin its day. Steelix, Quagsire, and Blissey are all able to counter Zapdos and Raikou effectively; Nidoking, Rhydon, and Snorlax can also help play around these threats if need be. However, Snorlax will not enjoy being forced to absorb powerful special attacks over the course of a longer match. Playing Snorlax defensively is seldom a good idea because it would rather use its large bulk to prolong its offensive use. Nidoking and Rhydon will also have issues against Raikou and Zapdos packing Hidden Power Ice or Water. Beyond Raikou and Zapdos, Skarmory will also want mixed and special attackers such as Nidoking, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Vaporeon covered. Zapdos and Raikou can take on Vaporeon, Dragonite, and special attackers in general with their special bulk and high Special Attack. Suicune is also a good choice for countering special and mixed sweepers because of its resistances to Water- and Ice-type attacks, good mixed bulk, and access to STAB Surf and Toxic.</p> <p>Skarmory also needs help dealing with certain physical threats that can play around it. Lovely Kiss, Thunder, and Fire Blast versions of Snorlax are notable for their ability to beat Skarmory one-on-one. Lovely Kiss versions will cripple Skarmory with sleep, while Fire Blast versions can score a surprise 2HKO should Skarmory choose to switch in. Tyranitar, Rhydon, and Misdreavus are all excellent counters to the aforementioned Snorlax sets. Gengar and Steelix work best against Lovely Kiss versions, though Gengar will have to watch out for a possible Earthquake. Curse users with Roar, such as Tyranitar, Kangaskhan, and Rhydon, are also troubling for Skarmory, as their Roar will go after Skarmory's Whirlwind after they set up a Curse, causing it to fail. With the combination of Curse and Roar, these Pokemon will be able to beat Skarmory without special attacks. Miltank and Umbreon can neutralize most Curse and Roar users with Growl and Charm, respectively.</p> <p>Skarmory and Miltank are great partners, as together they counter virtually every physical threat in the metagame. Miltank can also take on the mixed Snorlax versions that give Skarmory trouble. Blissey and Skarmory complement each other well as partners and make up the famous \"SkarmBliss\" combo. However, in GSC, this partnership is not as strong as it is in ADV. Blissey can provide Heal Bell and screen support for Skarmory, but other than that it will do little to secure victory. Skarmory enjoys phazing support; Raikou works well in this regard because of its high Special Defense, resistance to Electric-type attacks, and access to Roar. Suicune also deserves a mention for its great mixed defenses, access to Roar, and ability to check mixed Snorlax with Fire Blast. Other great phazing partners include Tyranitar, Steelix, and Rhydon, which are notable for their resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Defense. Having an extra Snorlax check is a wise idea in case Skarmory is put to sleep by Lovely Kiss or surprised by Fire Blast. Stall teams should especially consider extra phazing support for Snorlax in order to prevent it from sweeping once Skarmory has gone down. Additional phazers such as Rhydon can also work well against Misdreavus with Thunder trying to Perish trap. Skarmory enjoys the stallbreaking prowess that Misdreavus brings to the table with Perish Song and Mean Look. Misdreavus can also block Rapid Spin, thereby keeping Spikes on the field. Skarmory is often used in a phazing role and therefore loves entry hazards; Forretress and Cloyster are both good options for providing Spikes support.</p> "

While other Pursuit users fail to do notable damage or even force out their targets for said Pursuit, Houndoom's strength forces Ghost- and Psychic-types to choose between getting 2HKOed by a STAB attack or potentially fainting to such a strong Pursuit. Combined with good neutral coverage in its STAB types, good Speed, and even better Special Attack, Houndoom is very difficult to switch into and out of overall. Houndoom's typing also makes it the best offensive check to Jynx and Exeggutor by resisting both of their STAB moves and having a pick of super effective STAB attacks to hit back. It can even run a Sunny Day set to become even stronger. However, Houndoom's low Defense stat means that even neutral hits can 2HKO the poor dog. Houndoom is also walled by very common Pokemon, most notably Snorlax and Tyranitar, and can struggle to achieve proper 2HKOs against some of its more valuable targets. Regardless, Houndoom's combination of utility and power makes it an addition worth considering.</p> ",

Houndoom is also unable to Pursuit trap while asleep. Miracle Berry is a viable option that is arguably more effective at dealing with sleep inducers because it gives Houndoom a chance to Pursuit trap them even if it switches in as a sleep move is used.</p> <p>Toxic is an option to wear down common bulky checks, such as Snorlax and Tyranitar, but it can struggle to be justified because Houndoom is very frail. Toxic is ideally paired with Roar, but using both means that Houndoom will have to give up another attack.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can hit foes such as Golem and Rhydon hard, but Crunch already hits them hard and Hidden Power Grass fails to OHKO. Similarly, Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Tyranitar as it switches in, as Tyranitar would otherwise completely wall Houndoom. However, it fails to 2HKO Tyranitar from full health, and therefore Houndoom's standard options are recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Pokemon such as Snorlax and Blissey can consistently soak up any damage that Houndoom throws at them. Snorlax does have to be careful about a potential Counter, and Fire Blast in the sun can 3HKO, but Snorlax remains an excellent stop to Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon do not fear Fire Blast or Crunch, and they only mildly fear the rare Solar Beam. This allows them to consistently switch into Houndoom and threaten it with their STAB attacks, and RestTalk variants can stall out Sunny Day as well. Even Starmie can revenge kill Houndoom with its superior Speed, but it has to be wary of switching into a potential Crunch or Sunny Day. Tentacruel is also worth mentioning  thanks to its resistance to Fire Blast and its high Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar can switch into a Fire Blast or Crunch with ease and potentially OHKO Houndoom with a STAB Rock Slide. Golem and Rhydon also resist Fire Blast and threaten Houndoom with their STAB attacks, but they're more afraid of Grass-type coverage and chip damage from Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Raikou</strong>: Zapdos and Raikou both outspeed Houndoom and can threaten a 2HKO or paralysis with Thunder, whereas Houndoom can only hope to 3HKO in return. The SunnyBeam set puts this matchup in jeopardy, though, as the sun lowers Thunder's already-shaky accuracy further and makes Houndoom's Fire Blast a solid 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Machamp and Marowak can take a hit from Houndoom and OHKO in return without even having to set up. These Pokemon need to be relatively healthy, however, as Houndoom can muscle through them if they are below 50%.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Fire Blast is Houndoom's primary STAB move, with Crunch being excellent coverage for would-be threats like Gengar and Starmie on the switch. Being forced to switch out for fear of taking a strong Fire Blast or Crunch plays directly into Houndoom's excellent Pursuit, allowing it to trap valuable targets such as Exeggutor, Gengar, Jynx, Misdreavus, and even Cloyster effectively. Houndoom further differentiates itself from fellow Pursuit user Tyranitar by resisting Giga Drain from Exeggutor, making the Pursuit trap considerably cleaner. Houndoom can also relatively easily double switch in on its preferred targets due to how predictable they can be coming in. A Gengar coming in to block Rapid Spin against Forretress or a Cloyster seeing an easy opportunity to set Spikes against Golem are both fairly easy double switches for Houndoom to Pursuit trap. In fact, thanks to Houndoom's frailty, it prefers this method of coming in.</p> <p>Roar and Counter are both good choices for the fourth moveslot. Roar prevents threats such as Snorlax from using Houndoom as a setup opportunity, and it can also drag in a valuable Pursuit target on which to force heavy damage. Due to its negative priority, however, Roar can leave Houndoom open to attack, which is risky due to its low defenses. Counter is another option for punishing what would normally be a safe attack from Snorlax, but a Counter used at the wrong time loses all surprise factor, and it makes Houndoom a true sitting duck against Curse Snorlax.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Houndoom's Pursuit is extremely effective at removing Ghost- and Psychic-types. This is heavily appreciated by partners such as Snorlax, Machamp, and Golem, which can struggle against Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Exeggutor otherwise. Teammates that can switch in on the common Water- and Ground-type attacks thrown at Houndoom, such as Exeggutor, are also appreciated to help offset Houndoom's low bulk and improve team cohesion. Machamp gets a special mention for its ability to reliably switch in on Tyranitar and ward off Snorlax, Houndoom's two biggest counters. Ground-types such as Nidoking are also useful for switching into Electric-types such as Raikou that Houndoom is not keen on taking on.</p> <p>Spikes support is always handy for additional damage to further solidify potential 2HKOs and 3HKOs. It also lets Roar rack up more damage. Cloyster and Forretress both excel in setting Spikes and can even keep Spikes off of Houndoom's side. Houndoom doubles down on the synergy by Pursuit trapping the Ghost-types that would try to block the aforementioned spinners.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>This set trades some of the utility of a more focused Pursuit set for more firepower and an improved matchup against Water-types, allowing Houndoom to wallbreak better. Sunny Day lets Fire Blast 2HKO even neutral foes and do as much as 40% to Snorlax, making it a potentially shaky switch-in where it is a reliable check otherwise. It also lowers the accuracy of Thunder, which is a problem for the very popular Electric-types Zapdos and Raikou. Sunny Day also allows Houndoom to use Solar Beam, improving its matchups against Rock- and Water-types, most notably 3HKOing Vaporeon and Suicune. Pursuit remains the main justification to using Houndoom and gives it versatility. However, lacking Crunch means that the set is less reliable for KOing Gengar and Misdreavus.</p> <p>This set does not need to set up sun in order to function. Houndoom's Fire Blast is still strong without sun, and its ability to Pursuit trap is always invaluable; keep in mind that Pursuit damage is sometimes more valuable than setting up sun. Additionally, due to Houndoom's low defenses and common checks, setting up sun can be difficult, so it is sometimes better to simply attack and wait for a better moment to set up sun, such as when the opponent has made it clear that they will switch to a Water-type, Electric-type, or sleeping Snorlax against Houndoom.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even with the power boost from Sunny Day, Houndoom can have a difficult time breaking through specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and RestTalk Snorlax. Because of this, partners that can pressure or simply eliminate these walls, such as Machamp or Explosion Cloyster, are a great help. Prior Spikes can make the difference between 2HKOs and 3HKOs, encouraging setters like Cloyster and Forretress. Golem is also noteworthy for providing Rapid Spin while being able to check Snorlax thanks to its resistances.</p> <p>Even though this set takes a more offensive focus, Houndoom is still able to support its team. Pursuit can still be reliably used to KO Ghost- and Psychic-types early- and mid-game, which is a big help for teammates like Machamp. This set is primarily a wallbreaker and less of wincon, great at wearing down foes for sweepers later in the game. Excellent choices for these sweepers include Machamp, which also provides defensive synergy, as well as Tentacruel and Vaporeon.</p> "

You pretty much will always know what it's going to do, but it's good at what it does. Donphan is actually a pretty unique Pokemon in that it has bulky physical stats (Attack, Defense, and HP) but remains a pure Ground-type, which is both a pro and a con. It has no real gaping 4x weaknesses, but it lacks certain resistances (notably the resistance to Normal-type attacks), and thus it isn't seen more than, say, Steelix or Rhydon. Also, while its Attack is great, most people looking for a pure Ground-type attacker will usually opt for the Thick Club and Swords Dance potential of Marowak. Nevertheless, Donphan is a very solid tank with both good Attack and Defense, and it won't let you down.</p> ",

As for all other sturdy Pokemon, Toxic can be a good idea.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Donphan has relatively poor Special Defense, so Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks deal a lot of damage to it. In fact, most strong special attacks in general will put a dent in Donphan.

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the most versatile Normal-types in GSC OU thanks to its fantastic stats and movepool. It can be difficult to deal with thanks to its wide coverage options, mixed damage, decent power, and ability to spread status with Thunder Wave as well as its solid bulk and access to Recover. Porygon2 especially shines as a Thunder Wave user thanks to its ability to nail Ground-type switch-ins with Ice Beam. It also makes for a decent Curse user because it can recover its health without being forced to fall asleep, as well as hitting Pokemon that resist its Normal-type STAB moves hard with Ice Beam thanks to its good Special Attack. Its well-rounded stats, great movepool, and consistent damage output can make even top Pokemon like Snorlax, Zapdos, and Raikou think twice about taking it on. However, despite access to Recover, Porygon2 is extremely vulnerable to status conditions, especially Toxic poison. Porygon2's lack of super effective coverage against threats such as Tyranitar, Umbreon, and Miltank can also give it issues. As a Curse sweeper, Porygon2 is outclassed by Snorlax thanks to the latter's much better offensive and defensive stats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>It is rather difficult to recommend anything over the standard sets because Porygon2's functionality is already severely limited by the obligation to run a Normal-type STAB attack, Recover, and Ice Beam on every set. Tri Attack is another alternate recoil-less STAB move that can possibly burn, paralyze, or freeze the foe, but the status inflicted is random; Thunder Wave is a more consistent option to paralyze the foe, and Return and Double-Edge are much more powerful. Toxic can be used to help pressure Pokemon like Cloyster, Snorlax, Machamp, and even Heal Bell users like Miltank, but it is useless against Steel-types like Forretress and Skarmory, unlike Thunder Wave. Thief can also be used to steal the foe's item. However, this move is very weak and is an inferior support move compared to Thunder Wave. Reflect can also be used to increase Porygon2's team's Defense for 5 turns.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Phazers: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Skarmory, and Steelix can easily stop the Curse set by phazing it with Roar or Whirlwind. Skarmory can also poison Porygon2 with Toxic, beating it and shutting it down. Steelix can take Porygon2 out with Explosion, although this is more of a last resort option. Tyranitar can beat Porygon2 with Toxic, Crunch, Dynamic Punch, or its Curse + Roar set. Raikou can only beat Porygon2 with Reflect and Roar, so it is a shaky check at best.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Forretress: These two Pokemon can set up Spikes in front of Porygon2 and then poison it with Toxic or take it out with Explosion. Cloyster doesn't want to take a potential Thunder, however.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Miltank and Umbreon can stomach an unboosted Return, heal off the damage, and lower Porygon2's Attack with Growl or Charm. Miltank in particular can heal the damage done with Milk Drink and remove any paralysis inflicted by Porygon2 with Heal Bell. Misdreavus tanks any of Porygon2's attacks and threatens to Perish Trap it or inflict status on it.</p> <p><strong>Machamp: Machamp is one of the best checks to Porygon2 because it can stomach Porygon2's moves and 2HKO it with Cross Chop. However, when switching in, Machamp should try to time its entry on a turn that Porygon2 is using Recover or Ice Beam, as it takes hefty damage from Double-Edge and does not want to get paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Porygon2 is shut down by common Toxic users such as Cloyster, Umbreon, and Forretress, as the status condition's residual damage makes it much harder for Porygon2 to heal itself. Paralysis is also annoying for Porygon2 because it prevents it from consistently healing with Recover.</p> ",

Double-Edge is Porygon2's strongest STAB attack, and it can 3HKO Raikou and 4HKO Snorlax. While Thunder Wave is the first move of choice, Porygon2 can instead use Thunder to hit Pokemon such as Cloyster, Skarmory, and Forretress. Without Thunder, Porygon2 cannot touch these Pokemon, though paralyzing them isn't bad either. Ice Beam deals with any Ground-type such as Steelix, Marowak, or Rhydon that tries to switch into Thunder Wave. It also 3HKOes Zapdos and can be used to chip or freeze Tyranitar, Miltank, and Umbreon, which all otherwise stomach Double-Edge.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and offensive Cloyster love Porygon2's ability to spread paralysis easily so they can focus on cleaning late-game without worrying about being outsped themselves. Machamp can also take out defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon and Miltank, which all take little damage from Porygon2's moves. Pokemon like Starmie, Cloyster, and Vaporeon appreciate Porygon2's Thunder Wave support and can also help it by threatening Steelix, which takes little damage from Double-Edge but is chipped by Porygon2's Ice Beam.

The combination of boosting its physical stats and Recover's 32 PP allows it to combat and often beat Curse Snorlax and other Curse boosters. Boosted STAB Double-Edge hits like a truck against targets that don't resist it and should be chosen if Porygon2 is on a team that provides it with paralysis or poison support. Return is slightly weaker than Double-Edge, but it has the benefit of a recoil-free STAB attack and more PP, further enhancing Porygon2's potential to win via stalling the foe. Ice Beam rounds out Porygon2's coverage and is often the preferred fourth move, as it can hurt Pokemon that resist or are immune to its Normal-type STAB attacks such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Misdreavus. It also provides a 10% chance to freeze the opposing Pokemon, further solidifying its offensive tools against other Curse users. Thunderbolt is another option for the fourth move to hit Cloyster, Forretress, and Skarmory harder.</p> <p>Ideally, Porygon2 should be used mid- to late-game after its checks have been softened or knocked out in order to avoid taking status or unnecessary damage and increase its chances of sweeping. Porygon2 can also set up if it is the last Pokemon left on the team because it won't be able to be phazed by Roar or Whirlwind users like Steelix and Skarmory and can threaten the freeze if a Normal-resistant Pokemon tries to set up Curse alongside it. Recover's massive PP allows Porygon2 to go toe-to-toe with Raikou and Zapdos as well, a feat that shouldn't be overlooked.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Partners such as Machamp, Marowak, and Rhydon can help weaken or take out the Steel-type Pokemon that are not threatened by any of Porygon2's moves. If Porygon2 is running Thunderbolt, partners that can deal with Marowak and Rhydon such as Starmie, Suicune, and Exeggutor are needed. Umbreon and Miltank also stop Porygon2 dead in its tracks, so teammates like Machamp and Heracross are appreciated. Porygon2 also appreciates Thunder Wave support from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Starmie. Heal Bell support from Blissey and Miltank can also be run to help with status conditions, but then Porygon2's team will require a solid Machamp answer such as Starmie or Alakazam. Snorlax can also make a good teammate, as mixed sets can lure Porygon2's counters and potentially knock them out, or it can remove them with Self-Destruct, giving Porygon2 better opportunities to sweep.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Smeargle learns almost every move, so it is dangerous through its unpredictability. In particular, there is no way to know what a lead Smeargle is going to do for sure. It has access to Spore, a reliable sleeping move that no other viable Pokemon can use, and with access to Baton Pass and Spikes alongside Spore, it can do a solid job of supporting an offensive team. However, the fact that Smeargle is slower than many common leads and can't take many attacks restricts its viability. In addition, its user has to make key predictions around the timing of its use of moves like Spore, and choosing the wrong move or the wrong turn to use a specific move will typically result in Smeargle becoming fodder. Straying from the sets outlined in this analysis may be a wise choice, because while they are effective, people will expect them, and one of Smeargle's most valuable traits is its unpredictability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin, which needs Pursuit support for Ghost-types, can be frustrating for an opposing Spiker to deal with when they can't safely come in because of Spore and the fourth move that could be Present for Cloyster or Sacred Fire for Forretress, but coverage is lost, and it can be hard to switch Smeargle in safely. Perish Song pairs well with Spider Web and Destiny Bond. Thunder Wave cripples Sleep Talk users, especially Zapdos and Raikou. Super Fang does decent damage to every Pokemon bar Ghost-types, but RestTalk users aren't bothered by it much. A TrapPass set with Spider Web and Baton Pass can try to trap basically anything that switches into it, and Smeargle can use the combination of Protect and Disable to block phazing attempts. It should be noted that trapping moves are illegal on the same set as sleep moves, so Smeargle can't use Spore with Spider Web. Thanks to Leftovers, Recover could give Smeargle another shot at pulling off a TrapPass or passing defensive boosts, which is most likely to be found in a Baton Pass chain, but it is too fragile to take attacks except something like Surf from Cloyster or Pursuit from Umbreon. Counter allows Smeargle to threaten physical attackers that target its awful bulk, and lowering Defense EVs to get some Counter OHKO benchmarks is a viable option. For example, limiting Smeargle to 216 Defense EVs ensures that Counter will OHKO Snorlax if it uses Double-Edge. Thief can be used in a spare slot to steal the foe's item, which will typically deprive them of Leftovers's passive recovery for the remainder of a game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Any Attacking Move: Any reasonably powerful attack will deal plenty of damage to Smeargle, but one should be wary of moves such as Mirror Coat and Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phaze</strong>: Baton Pass chains can be stopped by Haze, Whirlwind, Roar, or Perish Song, but Smeargle has Spore to prevent these moves from being used.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion threatens Baton Pass chains, but Smeargle has Spore and Substitute to solve this problem.</p> <p><strong>Fast Thief + Lovely Kiss</strong>: Although Smeargle usually has Miracle Berry, Nidoking and Jynx can use Thief against Smeargle to block Spore and threaten Smeargle teams, especially Baton Pass ones, with Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk: With Sleep Talk, Pokemon can absorb Spore so that they won't be taken advantage of by Smeargle teams. However, if a switch to a Sleep Talk user is anticipated, Smeargle can use a move like Agility, Substitute, or Baton Pass as they switch in to maintain momentum.</p> ",

Smeargle is the only Baton Pass user that can always pass a boost even if an opponent has two phazers, assuming you get it in versus a non-phazer, which makes it a staple Pokemon for basically all teams centered around Baton Pass. For example, if you have it in against an opposing Snorlax, you can use Agility, and if their phazer is switched in, you can use Spore and then Baton Pass on the next turn.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Substitute blocks status from Pokemon such as Exeggutor once Miracle Berry is used, scouts Explosion from opposing Pokemon such as Forretress, exploits the low accuracy of Thunder, and gives a teammate a free turn to set up. Spikes secures many relevant OHKOs, most importantly +6 Snorlax's Mega Kick or Double-Edge versus Cloyster and Suicune. Although it's risky to switch Smeargle into a Pokemon such as Snorlax, Vaporeon, or Quagsire as they set up, if you succeed, you can lock them in with Encore and gain momentum. Encore can also lock Pokemon such as Skarmory into Rest. Destiny Bond has some potential to take something out with Smeargle, especially after Agility is used. Miracle Berry deals with status, especially sleep and paralysis, which can be problematic for Agility + Baton Pass teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slow wallbreakers such as Marowak, Belly Drum Snorlax, Meditate Machamp, and the uncommon Quagsire appreciate boosts from Smeargle's Agility. Marowak can threaten phazers such as Raikou, Tyranitar, and Golem, handle Explosion users such as Gengar with Earthquake, use Rock Slide to score flinches against checks like Skarmory after getting Speed boosts from Smeargle, and take Electric-type attacks from Sleep Talk variants of Zapdos and Raikou that are common switch-ins to Spore from Smeargle. Belly Drum Snorlax can use Lovely Kiss to get a free turn to set up. Machamp is helpful in breaking CurseLax.</p> <p>Scizor can deal with Explosion Exeggutor with Hidden Power Bug. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fighting can be used for pressuring phazers like Tyranitar and Houndoom, doing more to Steel-types than Hidden Power Bug, and threatening the most dominant Pokemon in GSC OU, Snorlax, whose Sleep Talk + Curse set is very threatening for most Baton Pass teams. Furthermore, it can also handle some variants of Forretress, whose Explosion can be annoying for Agility receivers. Jolteon forces phazers such as Skarmory and Suicune out, making it an essential teammate for maintaining Baton Pass chains. Thanks to Confuse Ray, Mean Look, and Baton Pass, Umbreon can be frustrating for phazers. With Sand Attack, it can also be an emergency option for setup attackers. Smeargle can also put Pokemon that Umbreon has trapped to sleep, which leaves the foe helpless unless they have Sleep Talk.</p> "

The threat of Spore limits Pokemon that can safely switch into Smeargle and forces switches, and if landed on the right target, it can swing a game in your favor. Present and Sacred Fire are primarily used for the purpose of preventing spinners from keeping Smeargle's Spikes off the field; the former can do enormous amounts of damage to Cloyster and Starmie, while the latter is a reliable Fire-type attack for Forretress and threatens to burn Golem. Also, phazers might come in and get crippled if they fear the Baton Pass set; Present is for Raikou and Suicune, while Sacred Fire hits Skarmory and Steelix super effectively and can burn Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Golem, and Rhydon. Mirror Coat OHKOes special attackers such as Zapdos, and with Destiny Bond, Smeargle can attempt to score a one-for-two trade, though many people will expect these moves on Spikes Smeargle sets. In addition, a player should remember that Mirror Coat will always fail against Hidden Power and moves used via Sleep Talk. Furthermore, lowering Special Defense EVs to get some Mirror Coat OHKO benchmarks is a viable strategy. For example, limiting Smeargle to 200 Special Defense EVs ensures that Mirror Coat will OHKO Raikou if it uses Thunderbolt. However, lowering your Special Defense would also lower your Special Attack, so despite Smeargle primarily using Sacred Fire for the burn chance, the fact that Sacred Fire's damage output would be reduced means this EV reduction strategy is not without drawbacks.</p> <p>This set competes with Cloyster for the Spiker slot on offensive teams, and generally speaking, Cloyster is a more viable choice. Offensively, its STAB Surf does decent damage to most Pokemon that resist Explosion. Defensively, its considerable physical bulk allows it to switch in on Ground-types such as Steelix and Marowak. Smeargle's advantages over Cloyster mainly come down to Spore and surprise value.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Smeargle is frail, it fits on fast-paced teams. Phazers with offensive presence such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Rhydon can exploit Spikes support from Smeargle. Thief users like Jynx help Spikes wear down an opposing team more quickly. Present can surprise Cloyster, Raikou, and Exeggutor so that attackers such as Vaporeon can shine.

With the prevalence of moves such as Rest, Toxic, and Thunder Wave, it is more than likely that at any given moment, several of Miltank's teammates will be debilitated by a status aliment. However, because of its access to Heal Bell, Miltank can eliminate these status problems in one turn, allowing its teammates to get back into the battle without any hampering status conditions.

Earthquake can be used if you feel like Miltank needs the coverage, and Seismic Toss can be used if you want to have more consistent damage output against Steel-types, but both are generally outclassed by Body Slam and Growl. Curse is a possibility, but Snorlax, Kangaskhan, or Porygon2 will generally serve you much better in that regard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Miltank is a great support Pokemon, but it isn't without its counters. Special attacks are the bane of Miltank's existence. Zapdos doesn't give a rip about paralysis because of RestTalk, and it has Thunder to slam Miltank's weak Special Defense. Vaporeon's access to Growth and Surf make it a major thorn in Miltank's side. It can easily set up and shrug off any paralysis because of its low Speed. After one Growth, Surf is almost always a 2HKO. Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress all resist Normal-type moves and can either phaze Miltank or set up entry hazards. Machamp is also notable because of it is one of the few Curse users that Miltank cannot counter with Growl. Machamp's super effective Cross Chop will do heavy damage, 2HKOing Miltank with no boosts and OHKOing after one boost from Curse.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with sleep moves will pose a threat to Miltank as long as Sleep Clause hasn't been activated; Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Nidoking work in this regard. Exeggutor can also use Explosion to nail Miltank if need be. However, if Sleep Clause has already been activated or Lovely Kiss misses, Nidoking will be unable to check Miltank, and will find itself countered by Miltank instead. Gengar works as a counter because it takes no damage from Body Slam and has a slew of special attacks to fire at Miltank. Misdreavus works much like Gengar, but with Mean Look and Perish Song instead of an all-out assault.</p> <p>Forretress also deserves a special mention as a check because of its ability to set up Spikes while taking a pittance from any of Miltank's attacks. Forretress doesn't mind paralysis, and the reduction in attacking power from Growl is not as important to it as it is to Pokemon such as Snorlax. Cloyster functions in the same way with the additional ability to fire off Surfs at Miltank's lower Special Defense stat. Keep in mind that Miltank's high Defense and access to Milk Drink and Heal Bell will make it difficult to wear down with Toxic. However, while time consuming, it is possible to outstall Heal Bell's PP with Toxic, assuming Miltank stays in. Miltank, however, doesn't enjoy being put to sleep or frozen. It cannot remove these status conditions with Heal Bell, meaning that it will be crippled in its main position as a status remover. That being said, strong special attacks remain the best way to take down Miltank.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Heal Bell is the mother's milk of all Miltank sets; with Heal Bell, Miltank can switch in on a physical attack that does little damage, use Heal Bell to clear its teammates' status, and then switch out to a newly-cured team member. Heal Bell is an amazing support move because it allows Pokemon that lack reliable recovery to use Rest, switch out, and then have their sleep removed so they can jump back into the fray at full health. The usefulness of Rest and Heal Bell as a strategy cannot be understated. The extra moveslot is incredibly useful for many Pokemon and allows instant recovery to be viable for many sweepers. Getting rid of nasty poison and paralysis with Heal Bell is also useful, especially against stall teams. Without Toxic damage, many stall teams will struggle to do anything meaningful against Miltank and its teammates. Miltank also has Milk Drink's recovery, which, combined with Heal Bell, can allow Miltank to plop its large derriere down and stall in its own right.</p> <p>Heal Bell and Milk Drink are great, but Growl and Body Slam are what really set Miltank apart from other Heal Bell users such as Blissey. Compared to Blissey, Miltank has better Speed, Defense, and Attack. Miltank can also use Growl, allowing it to serve as a great Snorlax check by removing the Attack boosts from Curse. Growl Miltank serves as a great check to Curse users in general because it can use Growl's 64 PP to outstall Curse's 16 PP and prevent Curse users from gaining any Attacks boosts with which to sweep. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heracross, and Rhydon will all struggle to get any sort of boosts with Curse, and can be easily crippled by Body Slam's paralysis rate. The paralysis rate from Body Slam is especially concerning for opponents without any way to remove status because they will often find themselves crippled and setup bait for the rest of the match.</p> <p>Miltank also has great Speed, giving it the chance to nullify its opponent's Attack with Growl or use Milk Drink before they land a possibly lethal blow. This combination of bulk and Speed can make Miltank very difficult to take down. Growl has the practical benefit of essentially boosting Miltank's Defense while refraining from lowering its Speed, as is the case with Curse. In order to remove the Attack drops from Growl, the opponent is forced to switch out. Forcing these kinds of switches is great for offensive momentum and stopping Curse sweepers in their tracks. Body Slam's 30% paralysis rate serves well alongside Growl by crippling both the physical attacker's Speed and Attack. Miltank is a great counter to physical attackers, but be wary of users of Curse that also carry Substitute, though they are rare. Snorlax with Belly Drum is also capable of breaking through Miltank's defenses.</p> <p>Miltank is easy to fit on most defensive, and even some offensive, teams. Miltank's ability to remove status easily with Heal Bell is wonderful when paired with bulky sweepers that need recovery but don't want to give up two moveslots to Rest and Sleep Talk. Miltank works well with literally any Pokemon that needs Rest, but also needs to ditch Sleep Talk to help its own coverage. Notable partners include Snorlax with Belly Drum, Raikou, and Suicune. With Heal Bell support, Snorlax can use Belly Drum, attack until its health gets low, Rest, switch out to Miltank, and then switch in to use Belly Drum again once Miltank uses Heal Bell; Marowak is in the same boat, except with Swords Dance over Belly Drum. Skarmory makes a good partner because it can wall the few physical threats that Miltank struggles to take down, such as Marowak and Belly Drum Snorlax. Raikou and Suicune can also work well alongside Miltank because of their ability to take special attacks and to deal out damage with Thunderbolt and Surf, respectively.</p> "

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey is largely overshadowed by Snorlax due to Snorlax's incredible special bulk being complemented by tremendous offensive power. Blissey has even greater special bulk than Snorlax but pales in comparison in terms of the damage it can dish out. Its primary role outside of simply taking hits is to cure its team of status with Heal Bell, and its remaining moveslots tend to be used to deter foes that might otherwise try to take advantage of it. Blissey does have access to interesting options such as Counter and Thunder Wave, but unfortunately they are incompatible with Heal Bell, so Blissey can only make use of them when it has dropped what is arguably its most useful move. Nonetheless, it is possible to play Blissey aggressively by taking advantage of its access to coverage moves, status moves, and Counter. Blissey's biggest flaw overall is that it struggles to deter many dangerous Pokemon like Snorlax and Nidoking, as well as struggling to fit coverage for both Cloyster and Forretress on the same set. As long as Pokemon on the opposing team have Rest, it struggles to make any offensive progress whatsoever, unlike Snorlax and Raikou, with which Blissey competes for the role of special wall. Furthermore, it is susceptible to being OHKOed by Explosion from the special attackers it would ideally be walling like Exeggutor and Gengar. Despite its drawbacks, Blissey still takes special hits better than any other Pokemon by far and is therefore a worthy consideration for defensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reflect can be used to give Blissey's teammates an easier time switching into Snorlax and allow Blissey to potentially take on mixed attackers like Nidoking and Tyranitar and Explosion users like Gengar and Cloyster. However, it is illegal with Heal Bell, and Blissey risks being OHKOed by a critical hit from Snorlax's unboosted Double-Edge at any given time. Growl is attainable alongside Heal Bell and can be used in a similar capacity to Reflect. It can be used to prevent Snorlax from setting up Curse against Blissey and encourage foes to switch out, and it also has a lot of PP, which can be useful for PP stalling in some scenarios. However, Blissey may not be able to punish the switches it encourages effectively, it remains susceptible to critical hits from Snorlax and other Pokemon, and using Growl turns Blissey into an ideal setup opportunity for Belly Drum Snorlax variants. Thunderbolt is an option on Blissey that hits both Skarmory and Cloyster super effectively and has perfect accuracy, although Blissey tends to prefer either Thunder's paralysis chance or Flamethrower's super effective damage against Forretress and Steelix.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax is the primary reason for Blissey not being common, as it can shrug off anything that Blissey can do to it bar Counter and can easily use Blissey as setup fodder or hit it for massive damage with its STAB attacks. Curse Snorlax is a massive threat to offensive teams and Belly Drum Snorlax is a huge threat to defensive teams, and Blissey can do little to prevent either from setting up freely against it.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Machamp is the only Pokemon that can outright OHKO Blissey with an unboosted attack other than Explosion and Self-Destruct, and no matter what Blissey does, Machamp retains the ability to OHKO with a critical hit Cross Chop. However, most Machamp despise being inflicted with status, so they must be wary when switching into Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most strong physical attackers can severely threaten Blissey with their STAB attacks. Marowak and Heracross both 2HKO Blissey, while Golem and Rhydon usually 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Explosion: Pokemon with high Special Attack stats can lure in Blissey and then use Explosion to remove it. Even weaker Explosion users such as Gengar can OHKO Blissey due to its low Defense, and once Blissey is removed, special attackers such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Jynx become much more threatening.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Nidoking, Tentacruel, and Muk can switch into Toxic Blissey with relative impunity, as they will usually take very little damage from Blissey's attacks. They do have to beware of Blissey having the correct coverage move or a less common move such as Sing, Thunder Wave, or Counter, however.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Attackers: Mixed attackers such as Gengar, Dragonite, and Tyranitar can be quite threatening to Blissey. They can run Dynamic Punch to deal massive damage to Blissey and potentially prevent it from recovering with the accompanying confusion. Although uncommon as a mixed attacker, Zapdos can also use Drill Peck to threaten a 4HKO against Blissey, which is enough to put it in danger of being taken out by a critical hit or force it to use up all of its Soft-Boiled PP.</p> <p><strong>Status: While Blissey is commonly seen as one of the best Pokemon to counter status thanks to Heal Bell, it too must be wary of some status afflictions. Blissey is highly susceptible to sleep moves, and once it is put to sleep, it will be unable to cure its teammates of status. Pokemon such as Jynx and Gengar can try to fish for a freeze against Blissey due to its low damage output, and if frozen, Blissey will be unable to cure itself. One should also keep in mind that Toxic has more PP than Heal Bell, which can lead to dangerous late-game situations if Blissey needs to cure particular teammates or itself. If Blissey lacks Heal Bell, it will need to be careful of poison and paralysis too, although its enormous special bulk will often allow it to take on special attackers even when afflicted with these.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers with Rest</strong>: Setup sweepers with Rest can take Blissey's status attacks and take advantage of its passivity to set up boosts before curing themselves and attempting a sweep. Curse Snorlax, Curse Tyranitar, Growth Vaporeon, and Curse Heracross are some of the most common sweepers to use this combination, but others such as Skarmory, Steelix, Jolteon, and Kangaskhan can also pull this off if Blissey lacks the necessary coverage moves to deal with them.</p> <p><strong>Belly Drum Users: Blissey's meager attacking power affords Belly Drum users such as Charizard, Quagsire, Clefable, and the aforementioned Snorlax a great opportunity to set up for a sweep. While Blissey's Toxic can discourage these foes from switching in while its team is healthy, the passive damage alone cannot be depended upon to stop a sweep from these Pokemon, as damage is not taken by the poisoned foe on turns on which a Pokemon is KOed. It's therefore crucial for Blissey to prioritize keeping key checks healthy with its Heal Bell support when facing Belly Drum users.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Blissey's aims with this set are to keep its team healthy and to take strong special hits for its team. Its main form of utility is Heal Bell, which works well with teammates that use Rest, such as Snorlax and Skarmory. Blissey most often uses Flamethrower as its attacking move, which works well in combination with Toxic, since several notable Toxic-immune Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress, are weak to Fire. Forretress in particular can put a lot of pressure on more defensive teams due to its access to Spikes and Rapid Spin and is therefore one of the main reasons for Blissey to choose Flamethrower over Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. However, Ice Beam can be used to make Zapdos less of a safe answer while simultaneously threatening Toxic-immune Nidoking. Additionally, the chance of inflicting a game-changing freeze is available should Ice Beam be chosen. Toxic is a common choice for Blissey to allow it to pose a significant threat to dangerous sweepers like Machamp and Marowak in the long term, and Toxic can also force Pokemon that have Rest—most commonly Snorlax—to use it. This can provide Blissey's teammates with the opportunity they need to set up a sweep.</p> <p>An alternative to Toxic is Light Screen, which Blissey can use to better protect itself against Growth sweepers like Vaporeon and support its team. This can be particularly useful for reducing risk against Zapdos and Raikou when using powerful sweepers like Belly Drum Snorlax and Swords Dance Marowak, two Pokemon that significantly benefit from being able to find opportunities to set up from full health. Light Screen can also be used alongside Toxic by forgoing attacking moves entirely, although this can allow low HP Pokemon and dangerous Toxic-immune Pokemon like Nidoking and Gengar opportunities to recover their health with Leftovers and attack freely and is therefore a choice only suitable to particular teams, such as those that use Spikes with a Ghost-type to improve the matchup against Forretress and prevent free Leftovers recovery. Another option that Blissey can use to punish greedy opponents is Present, a move that is extremely dangerous to any Pokemon with a secondary or singular type that deals special damage, such as Cloyster, Raikou, Tyranitar, and Vaporeon. While it is not threatening at all to Pokemon like Snorlax and Zapdos, which have Normal and Flying as their singular and secondary types, it limits the number of Pokemon that can take Blissey on safely and can severely punish Pokemon that are threatened by it. Sing is useful as a surprise sleep move to catch Pokemon off guard, and its low accuracy is somewhat offset by the fact that Blissey can typically find opportunities to use it many times during any given game. However, it will inevitably miss on the first attempt a lot of the time, which unfortunately ruins the surprise factor entirely and allows the opponent to safely handle it with a Sleep Talk user. Lastly, Blissey uses Soft-Boiled to keep itself healthy, which works well with Heal Bell to ensure Blissey does not become permanently paralyzed or poisoned.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Blissey works best with defensive teams due to their ability to better handle Pokemon that can take advantage of it, such as Snorlax. Pokemon such as Skarmory that can take on powerful physical attackers make very beneficial teammates. For mixed Snorlax variants, Rock-types such as Golem and Tyranitar can prove to be useful, and Blissey can provide them with Heal Bell support in the event that they become poisoned. Blissey can make a wide variety of strategies successful due to its unique support options and the fact that it takes dangerous special attackers on so effectively. Sweepers such as Machamp, Marowak, and Snorlax can take advantage of Blissey's support by running Rest alongside their boosting and attacking moves, allowing them to risk taking hits they might usually not be able to. Belly Drum Snorlax in particular is a great choice alongside Heal Bell Blissey with Flamethrower. Even 999 Attack Snorlax can sometimes struggle to overcome Skarmory, as Skarmory can boost with Curse and then try to heal off Snorlax's damage with Rest, leaving it walled. If its entry is timed correctly, Flamethrower Blissey can force Skarmory out before it can burn any sleep turns, which can lead to Snorlax getting to face an incapacitated Skarmory that can't protect itself with Defense boosts. However, it should be noted that a Skarmory with RestTalk or Heal Bell support can prevent this strategy from working. Pokemon such as Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Tyranitar are all crippled by status, so using Blissey alongside them can allow them to take risks they might normally be severely punished for. Pokemon that use instant recovery moves, such as Umbreon and Belly Drum Clefable, can also take advantage of Heal Bell support so they can be less afraid of status inflictions. However, the fact that these Pokemon share a Fighting weakness with Blissey can introduce a significant Machamp weakness, so this must be considered when building a team with Blissey. Starmie is another very popular choice for a Blissey teammate thanks to its excellent type synergy, instant recovery move, and access to Rapid Spin, which greatly benefits the defensively inclined teams Blissey tends to be a part of. In particular, Starmie's excellent matchup against Machamp is very useful to Blissey teams. Cloyster is also a great option to use alongside Heal Bell Blissey, since many Cloyster will try to trade poison inflictions when setting up Spikes. If Rapid Spin is used on Cloyster or a teammate, this can make it seriously difficult for the opponent to keep Spikes up. Aside from Starmie, Zapdos and Misdreavus are useful teammates to deal with Machamp should Cloyster be chosen. Zapdos is also solid against a variety of other troublesome offensive threats, including Nidoking, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, while Misdreavus can check Snorlax alongside Skarmory, spinblock when used with Spikes, and nullify Explosion that may be used to target Blissey or its teammates. Moreover, both commonly run Rest and can be cured of sleep by Blissey.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Counter",
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Blissey can choose to employ a more aggressive approach by forgoing its role as a cleric and taking advantage of its access to powerful status moves and coverage attacks. Despite its lack of attacking power with which to threaten Snorlax, it can retain efficacy in this role thanks to the threat of Counter, which makes any physical attacker think twice before attempting to take Blissey down. Thunder Wave allows Blissey to cripple any Pokemon that is not a Ground-type, which can be very useful in setting up slow but powerful Pokemon such as Marowak, Machamp, and Snorlax for a sweep. It pairs well with Ice Beam, which hits Thunder Wave-immune Ground-types super effectively and has a chance of inflicting freeze. Alternatively, Sing can be used as Blissey's status move, which can incapacitate threats such as Snorlax, Cloyster, and Forretress for extended periods of time. However, Sing's effectiveness is somewhat contingent on the opponent not expecting it, and it is inconsistent due to its very low accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential effectiveness of the move and the opportunities to use it generated by the prevalence of special attackers makes it a worthwhile consideration. Thunder can also be used as a pseudo-status move if one's aim is to maximize coverage and include multiple of Blissey's high utility moves on the same set all at once. It does massive damage to Pokemon like Cloyster and Skarmory and has a decent chance of inflicting paralysis. An alternative option for an attacking move is Flamethrower, which hits Steelix, Forretress, and Skarmory for heavy damage. If Blissey is only running one attacking move, Ice Beam and Flamethrower are the preferred options due to no Pokemon being immune to them. However, it is worthwhile considering using a Blissey with Thunder as a second attack, as Cloyster, a very important target, will often try to set Spikes against Blissey and will be significantly impaired if Thunder lands.</p> <p>Other than status moves and Heal Bell, by far the highest utility move Blissey can take advantage of is Counter. Counter allows Blissey to threaten the physical attackers that target Blissey's awful Defense. It is most effective when the opponent is not expecting it, although even after it has been revealed, the opponent will be hard-pressed to take Blissey down without resorting to physical attacks, which can make Blissey quite awkward to deal with for more offensive teams. Unfortunately, Counter is incompatible with Heal Bell, which leaves Counter Blissey rather susceptible to status and inhibits its ability to pose a longer term threat against defensive teams whether it runs Soft-Boiled or not. Lastly, while it might seem like an alien idea to drop Soft-Boiled, Blissey's huge special bulk and its Leftovers can allow it to last a surprisingly long time even without its trademark healing move, and if Blissey manages to catch just one Pokemon with Counter, the opponent will often be at a large disadvantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Counter Blissey fits less well on ultra-defensive teams and is instead best placed alongside powerful attackers that can take better advantage of the status inflictions and forced switches it can provide. Some of these include Snorlax, Marowak, and Machamp; however, there are many possible options available. It is important to be able to deal with or threaten Curse Snorlax, as while Counter Blissey can dissuade it from attacking immediately, Blissey can do little to prevent it from setting up. Machamp is one of the only Pokemon that can offensively threaten a Curse-boosted Snorlax and greatly benefits from Counter Blissey's ability to discourage unboosted Snorlax from hitting it as it switches in. Phazers such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Skarmory can also deal with Curse Snorlax with varying degrees of effectiveness depending on Snorlax's coverage attacks. These Pokemon also benefit from Blissey's ability to paralyze Snorlax, since they will outspeed a paralyzed Snorlax after setting up their own Curse boosts. Machamp is another Pokemon that is critical for a Blissey team to be able to handle, as it is one of the only Pokemon that can take out Blissey with a single unboosted attack other than Explosion and Self-Destruct. Some checks that go well alongside offensive Blissey include Exeggutor and Nidoking, although they are fearful of Hidden Power Bug and Earthquake. Starmie can also be used, although using it will typically cause your team to have to take a more defensive approach to Snorlax, which can then result in Counter Blissey being a poor fit due to its inability to cure Starmie and itself of status. Another option is Heracross, which checks most Machamp and Nidoking fairly well but struggles in the long term against Snorlax and often struggles to get past Skarmory and Zapdos. Lastly, it is often a good idea to bring a Spiker such as Cloyster or Forretress to assist Blissey and its team with wearing down the opposition.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent stat distribution, unique typing, and wide movepool, Tyranitar is a key Pokemon in GSC OU. Most notably, a combination of a strong Pursuit, solid all-around bulk, an important Normal resistance, and access to Roar allows Tyranitar to provide very desirable role compression for teams looking for a Pokemon able to check threats such as Snorlax, Gengar, Exeggutor, Misdreavus, and Jynx all at once. These factors make Tyranitar very easy to fit on teams, as the sheer utility of Pursuit and Roar is extremely helpful in the metagame. Furthermore, Tyranitar is a versatile Pokemon that can turn into a Curse sweeper that invalidates typical answers to Curse Snorlax such as phazing and Explosion thanks to Roar and its part-Rock typing. Tyranitar is also capable of acting as a lure due to its numerous coverage options that allow it to dent its usual answers.</p> <p>However, Tyranitar doesn't have access to a powerful STAB attack to fully exploit its tremendous base 134 Attack stat. Therefore, it faces competition as a physical attacker from Rhydon and, to a lesser extent, Golem. Moreover, Tyranitar suffers from several common and exploitable weaknesses, a below-average Speed stat, an unfortunate case of four-moveslot syndrome, and a tendency to be unable to punish switch-ins from dangerous Pokemon such as Nidoking, Marowak, Vaporeon, Rhydon, and especially Machamp. These flaws also hamper its overall reliability against the threats it is supposed to keep in check, seeing that it struggles to pressure Starmie and takes substantial damage from Exeggutor's Giga Drain, Gengar's Dynamic Punch, and most importantly, Snorlax's Earthquake, meaning Umbreon provides serious competition, as it usually performs better against these examples. Finally, Tyranitar usually has to check multiple Pokemon throughout the match and can be worn down fairly quickly when factoring its weaknesses, lack of reliable recovery, and susceptibility to residual damage in the form of Spikes and Toxic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar possesses a large pool of coverage options to lure and dent many of its usual answers. Dynamic Punch is capable of 2HKOing Snorlax, Miltank, and Umbreon after Spikes damage. Ice Beam targets Ground-types that aren't Steelix, Piloswine, and Quagsire while retaining a hard hit against Exeggutor, whereas Surf trades the ability to scare it off for a potential 2HKO on Steelix, a potential OHKO on Golem, and a guaranteed OHKO on Rhydon. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Cloyster and maintains super effective coverage against Pokemon such as Starmie and Skarmory in the absence of Crunch and Fire Blast. With so many possibilities, an all-out attacker set consisting of Rock Slide and three of Fire Blast and the aforementioned moves makes for a viable option. Ancient Power can also be considered on this kind of set and can make Tyranitar very difficult to handle should its secondary effect activate. However, Ancient Power fails to consistently 2HKO Zapdos, which substantially decreases its viability. Unfortunately, Tyranitar cannot break through all of the troublesome Pokemon with a single set, and it will be exploited by Machamp and Suicune regardless of which moves it has.</p> <p>Screech is an alternative to Roar, as it can force out the opposing Pokemon by lowering its Defense, which notably enables Tyranitar to potentially win against non-Earthquake variants of Curse Snorlax in a one-on-one scenario and pairs well with Pursuit, as the opponent is likely to call their Pokemon back in fear of taking a Rock Slide after a Screech. However, it is less reliable than Roar overall and isn't nearly as effective against PerishTrap Misdreavus. Toxic is a good way to deter most switch-ins to Tyranitar, but it is hard to fit onto a set.</p> <p>A more offensive Curse variant with Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Fire Blast is another way to lure and play around Pokemon such as Nidoking, Steelix, and, to a lesser extent, Heracross, but due to the lack of a strong physical STAB attack it is mostly outclassed by Machamp and Rhydon.</p> <p>On the Curse set, dropping Roar in favor of Pursuit is doable. The role compression it offers can be quite appealing for defensive teams looking for a Pokemon capable of handling non-Earthquake Snorlax while offering the ability to trap Ghost-types to support Snorlax and spinners from its team.</p> <h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1> <p><strong>Machamp: Due to its bulk and typing, Machamp can take hits from Tyranitar rather easily and swiftly OHKO it with its STAB Cross Chop or use it as a setup opportunity, but it has to be wary of switching into Tyranitar's assaults with Spikes down too often. Even then, the RestTalk variant is a hard wall to Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Tyranitar is unable to get past Suicune, which does severe damage with Surf in return. Vaporeon is bulky enough to avoid the 3HKO from Rock Slide and can accumulate boosts in front of Tyranitar without much trouble, especially if it's an Acid Armor variant. Cloyster doesn't like switching into Rock Slide, but it still has the upper hand against Tyranitar due to its superior Speed and can lay down Spikes against it. Starmie is another problem if Tyranitar doesn't pack Crunch, and even then it can threaten Tyranitar with a very likely 2HKO. The less common Tentacruel can also scare off Tyranitar with its Water-type STAB and start using Substitute or Swords Dance against it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Most of the time, Tyranitar is unable to prevent the likes of Nidoking, Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Donphan and Sandslash from taking advantage of it unless it has Ice Beam or Surf. Marowak in particular is a very dangerous Pokemon that can switch in on Tyranitar and threaten it with a potential OHKO with its STAB Earthquake, but its lack of passive recovery and poor Speed mean that it should be wary about switching into Fire Blast or Crunch, and it loses if it takes an Ice Beam or Surf on the switch. Steelix shrugs off Tyranitar's assaults as long as it doesn't have Fire Blast, Surf, or, to a lesser extent, Earthquake. Finally, the rather uncommon Quagsire doesn't care about any of Tyranitar's usual attacking moves aside from Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Unless Tyranitar packs the appropriate coverage move, the standard variant has trouble breaking through Snorlax, Raikou, and Porygon2. However, the Curse variant is likely to eventually win against these. On the other hand, Umbreon and Miltank can shut down Tyranitar's offensive capabilities by using Charm or Growl and cripple it with status effects. The only move they have to watch out for is Dynamic Punch after Spikes damage. If Tyranitar doesn't have Fire Blast, Skarmory, Forretress, and the rare Meganium become troublesome, but only Meganium is able to act as an answer to Curse Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Heracross: While Fire Blast does a significant amount of damage, Heracross is still able to scare off Tyranitar with its fast and powerful Megahorn and can heal itself with Rest. If Tyranitar doesn't have Fire Blast, Heracross can start accumulating Curse boosts against it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Tyranitar usually has to keep multiple Pokemon in check throughout the game. Chip damage in the form of Spikes and Toxic hamper its ability to do so, but Rest can make this task easier.</p> ",

It also pressures any Snorlax without a Curse boost, as it has the potential to induce a flinch at very inconvenient times. Pursuit is one of Tyranitar's main draws, as it allows it to punish Dark-weak Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Gengar, Misdreavus, and Jynx if they attempt to switch out, and it can do some chip damage to Pokemon that Tyranitar typically scares out like Zapdos. Roar is a move recommended on every team in GSC OU due to the dominance of Curse Snorlax, and Tyranitar is fit to use it, as it can constantly phaze non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax by virtue of its Normal resistance and huge physical bulk, on top of having a great matchup against Misdreavus, which can be deadly with its PerishTrap set in the absence of phazers. Roar also gives some much-needed insurance against Mean Look + Baton Pass Umbreon, and Tyranitar's typing is suited to phazing some uncommon threats such as Espeon, Porygon2, and Muk.</p> <p>Fire Blast is usually chosen in the last slot for its ability to scorch Steel-types such as Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress, which would otherwise be troublesome for Tyranitar. It can end up being very useful on a Spikes-focused team against Forretress, as Fire Blast Tyranitar can force it out and slowly but surely wear it down with Pursuit throughout the match so it cannot use Rapid Spin to get rid of your Spikes forever. Fire Blast also pressures Exeggutor, another notable Pursuit target that Tyranitar needs to scare off. Alternatively, STAB Crunch retains the ability to threaten Exeggutor while also doing much more damage to Gengar and Misdreavus than Rock Slide. This can turn out to be pretty significant, as these targets tend to cripple Tyranitar with status, Thief, and repeated hits while trying to avoid a full-powered Pursuit. Crunch Tyranitar also has a shot at trying to remove a weakened Starmie from the game. However, Tyranitar takes a lot of damage in the process and may be unable to do anything else afterwards. It is possible to fit both Fire Blast and Crunch onto the set, but the utility of Roar is usually too important to give up. Finally, Earthquake 2HKOes Raikou, Nidoking, and Tentacruel while scoring a 3HKO on Rhydon and Golem. It also has the merit of hitting both Gengar and Steelix hard in one slot, but dropping Fire Blast or Crunch makes Tyranitar unable to pressure Exeggutor as effectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Roar, Pursuit, and the Normal resistance are all important features that let Tyranitar fit onto a wide variety of teams. It is especially useful alongside Spikers such as Cloyster and Forretress, as they struggle against Ghost-types, which can absorb their attempt to use Explosion or Rapid Spin. Tyranitar's ability to get rid of these with Pursuit is beneficial, and Roar allows it to take advantage of Spikes further. Tyranitar's Pursuit also helps Starmie against Misdreavus, which in return can clear the field and check Machamp, arguably Tyranitar's biggest nemesis. Cloyster is also suited to help Tyranitar against Ground-types such as Marowak and Rhydon. Suicune is another good teammate, as it makes a good check to the aforementioned Ground-types but also deals nicely with Nidoking and, to a lesser extent, Vaporeon if it packs Roar. Exeggutor and Zapdos are more offensively inclined partners that can check most Ground- and Water-types as well as Machamp, giving them excellent synergy with Tyranitar. The same applies to Heracross, which is a safer answer to Ground-types and Machamp that appreciates Tyranitar's ability to cripple Gengar and Misdreavus with Pursuit. Overall, any Pokemon that wants to have the opposing Ghost-type or Exeggutor out of the way such as non-Earthquake Snorlax, Machamp, and Vaporeon will benefit from having Tyranitar's Pursuit to back it up.</p> <p>It is important to keep in mind that this Tyranitar set is only a temporary check to Snorlax at best, as it cannot break through Curse Snorlax's Rest loop in a one-on-one scenario where Snorlax is the last member of its team. Furthermore, Tyranitar's usefulness will be short lived if Snorlax is packing Earthquake. As a consequence, it is recommended to pack an answer to said variants. Curse Skarmory is a good example of such a Pokemon, and it also helps against some of Tyranitar's other problems such as Marowak, Heracross, and Machamp. In return, Tyranitar checks Fire Blast Snorlax and Hidden Power Fire Exeggutor. Unfortunately, more offensive teams can't always afford to pack passive Pokemon like Skarmory to deal with Snorlax, and they would rather pick a phazer like Tyranitar to do the job. Therefore, they have to keep constant pressure on Snorlax in order to force it to Rest so Tyranitar can phaze it safely and keep it from sweeping. Powerful Pokemon such as Machamp, Vaporeon, Nidoking, and Zapdos are suited to apply offensive momentum and can benefit from having the opposing Snorlax asleep as well.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>As a Curse user, Tyranitar faces competition from Rhydon due to its access to STAB Earthquake, making it more offensively threatening. Tyranitar, on the other hand, is bulkier overall and isn't plagued with 4x weaknesses to Water and Grass, which makes it harder to force out once it has set up boosts. Rock Slide is Tyranitar's best physical STAB attack and is sufficient as the sole attacking move on this set, since there is no Pokemon immune to Rock-type moves. With Curse, Tyranitar is able to reliably take on non-Earthquake variants of Snorlax one-on-one and can act as a potential wincon. Roar prevents faster phazers such as Skarmory, Raikou, and opposing Tyranitar from forcing Tyranitar out. This also works when Tyranitar is asleep, so forcing it to Rest in order to phaze it afterwards isn't a possibility. It can also be helpful in Curse wars against the likes of Snorlax, Porygon2, and Muk. Rest provides the longevity needed for this set's success. Without it, Tyranitar could be worn down by the Pokemon it is supposed to check and would be ruined by Toxic.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even with Curse, Machamp and Ground-types can still easily break through Tyranitar. Therefore, answers to these such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Suicune, and Heracross are teammates of choice. Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon also prevent any attempt to sweep with Tyranitar, which is another reason why Zapdos and Exeggutor make good partners. Skarmory is one of the best defensive backbones to support Curse Tyranitar due to its good matchup against Curse and Belly Drum Snorlax carrying Earthquake, Heracross, and Marowak. The two of them together form a very formidable obstacle for Snorlax to overcome, no matter what its moveset is. Despite its overall great bulk, Tyranitar is 3HKOed by Zapdos's Thunder and Exeggutor's Giga Drain, which means that it cannot use Rest over and over again against these threats. Thus, specially bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax, Raikou, and Blissey make good backups for Tyranitar. Blissey can also cure Tyranitar from its self-induced sleep with Heal Bell, allowing it to use Rest more freely. Opposing Miltank and Umbreon can be painful to face for Tyranitar, as they can negate its boosts with Growl or Charm, so Pokemon suited to take advantage of these such as Spikers, Ghost-types in the case of Miltank, and Heracross in the case of Umbreon can be beneficial.</p> "
