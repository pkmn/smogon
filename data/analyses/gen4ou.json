  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic has very unique assets that distinguish it as one of the most solid defensive pieces for certain defense-oriented teams. Its Water typing gives it key resistances to Fire, Ice, and Water while only being weak to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. In addition, its 95 / 79 / 125 defenses are impressive. While its Defense is lacking comparatively, it can more than compensate for this with full investment thanks to its amazing Special Defense. These traits allow it to perform nicely against a variety of foes, namely Heatran, Jirachi, Gengar, Swampert, Metagross, Bronzong, Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Milotic also has a few other neat traits that make it even stronger. While status is a huge issue for Milotic on paper, it can compensate for this to an extent thanks to Marvel Scale. In addition, Milotic is one of few Pokemon with access to Haze, a high-PP move that keeps a large number of potent setup sweepers in check, like Calm Mind Clefable, CroCune, Swords Dance Scizor, and even Dragon Dance Gyarados.</p> <p>Milotic's main flaws are its weakness to entry hazards, passiveness due to its lack of power, and low Speed. This means that aggressive play and a decent number of offensive threats can pressure it, and it also has difficulty against opposing defensive teams. Its weakness to status, even with Marvel Scale, is still an issue, and it detests sand because it limits Milotic's walling capabilities, especially against the likes of Swampert and Jirachi. In addition, Clefable can easily force Milotic out, as it takes any of Milotic's attacks and threatens it with Knock Off. Milotic needs to actively stay healthy in order to maintain its defensive utility, so with enough chip damage and offensive pressure, it can crumble.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Milotic can run an offensive set with moves like Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Electric, which is similar to an offensive Calm Mind Suicune set but with an instant healing move in Recover instead of Calm Mind. However, the omnipresence of Clefable and lack of sufficient spinning support for Milotic means this set is quite difficult to make work. Refresh and Protect are all-around great moves on defensive Pokemon, and they could certainly work well on Milotic, but there's almost never room for them due to Haze's incredible utility and Ice Beam's coverage. A RestTalk set can be considered due to Milotic's Marvel Scale, but Recover is more than sufficient for Milotic to do its job. Confuse Ray is gimmicky, but it could be generally disruptive. Dragon Breath can make Milotic a paralysis spreader, which may have some potential on paralysis spam teams, but it's still difficult to ever justify it over Ice Beam. Hypnosis is a potent move, but its lack of accuracy and the aforementioned difficulty in replacing any of Milotic's standard moves holds it back. Lastly, Mirror Coat can catch foes like Latias, Gengar, and Zapdos by surprise, but it has the same issues as many other alternative moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Clefable, Blissey, Latias, and even Jirachi don't mind taking Milotic's attacks too much and have the potential to cripple it with a variety of moves like Toxic, Thunder Wave, Trick, and even Knock Off. That said, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi may need to watch out for the chance of an Ice Beam freeze.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Celebi, Roserade, Shaymin, Abomasnow, and Breloom can threaten Milotic with their powerful STAB Grass-type attacks. Celebi, Roserade, and Shaymin won't be 2HKOed by Ice Beam, and Breloom should be able to survive one, meaning they can always threaten Milotic in some capacity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Magnezone don't mind Milotic's attacks too much, and they threaten it with a naturally powerful STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Starmie, Suicune, Kingdra, and Tentacruel take very little damage from Milotic's attacks and can often force it out. Although Haze can be effective against certain variants of Suicune and Kingdra, Suicune's Pressure and Kingdra's Dragon-type attacks can still threaten Milotic or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers</strong>: Milotic detests status, so any Pokemon with Toxic can significantly neuter it if they can inflict it with the move. Will-O-Wisp users like Gengar and even Heatran can also put Milotic on a timer by burning it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Grass Knot from users like Jirachi, Infernape, and Empoleon has the potential to do significant damage to Milotic thanks to its relatively high weight. Foes like Latias, Jirachi, and even Metagross may use Electric-type attacks, of which Milotic must be wary.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Surf is Milotic’s most consistent STAB move, and its higher PP compared to Hydro Pump makes it better for longer games. Ice Beam hits Breloom, Dragonite, Flygon, Latias, and Celebi for super effective damage and can also threaten to freeze Pokemon like Skarmory and Clefable. Haze is essential to check CroCune, Calm Mind Clefable, Swords Dance Scizor, and many other setup sweepers. Its gargantuan 48 PP gives Milotic increased staying power, which can help force a setup sweeper out. Recover rounds out the set and sets Milotic apart from other bulky Water-types like Suicune and Swampert.</p> <p>Toxic and Hidden Power Electric can be used as alternatives to either Ice Beam or Haze. Toxic can be more effective against offensive Suicune, opposing Milotic, and Latias. Hidden Power Electric is mainly used if it is deemed necessary for Milotic to be a very secure Gyarados check. However, these moves are generally not recommended, as losing the coverage to hit Breloom and Dragon-types or the ability to remove stat changes can backfire tremendously.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing HP and Defense investment is essential for taking on physical attackers like Swampert, Gyarados, Flygon, Metagross, Jirachi, and Dragonite as well as possible. The 8 Special Defense EVs are surprisingly important, crucially reducing damage from mixed Dragonite's Draco Meteor, Starmie's Thunderbolt, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and even Empoleon's Grass Knot. Since Milotic is vulnerable to chip damage from sand and entry hazards, Leftovers grants it crucial passive recovery. Even though Marvel Scale could make one consider an item like Flame Orb to boost its Defense, this is never worthwhile. A Calm nature with some Special Defense investment can be used to better take on Gengar, Grass Knot Infernape, Latias, and mixed Dragon-types, but Milotic will be worse off against foes like Swampert and Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Teams with Milotic often depend on it to check some strong physical attackers, so it can be especially important to keep it healthy with Recover. Try to avoid taking damage-inflicting status if possible even with Marvel Scale, as the Defense bonus generally doesn't compensate for chip damage from the likes of burn and poison largely due to making Milotic more prone to losing to flinches from physical Jirachi variants. If you're playing against a Toxic Spikes team and have no means to remove them, try to switch Milotic into only one layer rather than two. In addition, Milotic will often find itself staying in for longer periods of time against such teams, so taking two layers of Toxic Spikes can render it unable to fulfill its role. Ice Beam can be used against foes like Clefable and bulky Jirachi to fish for a freeze, as they can shrug off Surf. Be mindful of Haze's PP when using the move versus foes like CroCune and Swords Dance Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite Milotic's incredible defensive utility, it does not fit on a wide range of teams. Due to its lack of synergy with popular spinners like Starmie, Forretress, and Tentacruel, it must be built with entry hazards in mind. Magnezone is a solid partner to provide hazard control against Skarmory, preventing it from setting up enough Spikes to give Milotic trouble. Defensive behemoths immune to Spikes like Gliscor, Clefable, your own Skarmory, defensive Latias, and even Rotom-A can create strong cores with Milotic. In particular, while Milotic is excellent at warding off physical onslaughts, specially defensive Clefable can invalidate a large number of special attackers, which makes these two Pokemon incredible together. In addition, Clefable's Knock Off can help compensate for Milotic's lack of offensive presence, assisting it in keeping Suicune in check by allowing the damage from Milotic's Surf to stick. Skarmory's ability to set entry hazards is especially helpful, as Milotic can utilize its impressive staying power to do quite a bit of residual damage to offensive teams.</p>"

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid Speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence make it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A's utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric types in DPP. Rotom-H is an excellent choice for a Rotom-A forme. Overheat is especially helpful with Choice Scarf, as it takes advantage of Rotom-H's Steel-type resistance and easily OHKOes Scizor and Lucario while 2HKOing Metagross and offensive Jirachi. It also is effective for defensive sets, as the ability to threaten with Overheat, even if Rotom-H doesn't have it, makes Breloom trying to put RestTalk Rotom-H to sleep and break through it more cautious. Being able to threaten Steel-types offensively instead of burning them with Will-O-Wisp makes Rotom-H a fantastic choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A's primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn't enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand, while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it, and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn't get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As a result, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A's strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types that can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOes bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents Rotom-A from being Pursuit trapped if Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A's coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice both is more reliable than Rotom-F's Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, or Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded Speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO opposing Rotom-A and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, Scizor, Lucario's boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides other Rotom-A is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or via its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its Choice-locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late-game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A's Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and setup sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A's Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert, while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, or Jirachi, is appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon. As powerful Choice item attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they're locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory is also a good choice, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A's only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A's most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can't hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn foes is one of Rotom-A's core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch-ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticeably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded Speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As a result, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar's Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie's Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom's Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good matchups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% chance to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump, while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on matchup.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A's Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can give Rotom-A an Iron Ball with Trick and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOes with Waterfall and can make Rotom-A flinch—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A's main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch-in to Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind, and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming Dynamic Punch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also removes items with Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch-in to Heatran, which greatly threatens Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes-immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes-based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so that it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias's resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A's defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on a revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as its offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes, and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it removes items with Knock Off, and Rotom-A is immune to or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p>"

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid Speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence make it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A's utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric types in DPP. Rotom-W is one of the premier Rotom-A formes. Hydro Pump hits prominent checks such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Hippowdon more reliably than the other formes. It is additionally effective support for rain teams due to its resistances and ability to cripple Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Skarmory while appreciating the boost to Hydro Pump. Even if Rotom-W doesn’t have Hydro Pump, the ability to threaten it against its biggest offensive checks makes Rotom-W one of the best forme choices.</p> <p>Rotom-A's primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn't enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand, while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it, and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn't get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As a result, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A's strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types that can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOes bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents Rotom-A from being Pursuit trapped if Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A's coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice both is more reliable than Rotom-F's Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, or Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded Speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO opposing Rotom-A and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, Scizor, Lucario's boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides other Rotom-A is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or via its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its Choice-locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late-game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A's Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and setup sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A's Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert, while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, or Jirachi, is appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon. As powerful Choice item attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they're locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory is also a good choice, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A's only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A's most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can't hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn foes is one of Rotom-A's core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch-ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticeably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded Speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As a result, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar's Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie's Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom's Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good matchups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% chance to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump, while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on matchup.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A's Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can give Rotom-A an Iron Ball with Trick and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOes with Waterfall and can make Rotom-A flinch—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A's main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch-in to Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind, and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming Dynamic Punch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also removes items with Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch-in to Heatran, which greatly threatens Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes-immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes-based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so that it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias's resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A's defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on a revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as its offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes, and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it removes items with Knock Off, and Rotom-A is immune to or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p>"

      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-W makes a fantastic weather clearer with Rain Dance, as it lures in Tyranitar and OHKOs bulkless versions after Stealth Rock with a rain boosted Hydro Pump. Rain Dance also helps with Rotom-W's longevity, as it takes sand damage and has no options to heal. With rain, Hydro Pump is quite strong, as it OHKOs bulkless Heatran and physically defensive Hippowdon while also being Rotom-W's strongest attack. Thunderbolt has good coverage with Hydro Pump, as it hits Water-types trying to take advantage of rain hard. Will-O-Wisp completes the set, as Rotom-w is effective at spreading burns to foes that can shrug off a rain boosted Hydro Pump, such as Jirachi and Quagsire. However, since Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump miss out on Grass- and Dragon-types while also struggling to hit Gengar and opposing Rotom-A, Shadow Ball is another great option, as it 2HKOs Latias and completes Rotom-W's coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>These specific EVs outspeed Tyranitar, while having almost maximum HP investment to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch. Rotom-W should run at least 20 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature or 120 Special Attack EVs with a neutral nature, as this is necessary to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar in the rain after Stealth Rock. Rotom-W can run more investment as well: it needs 168 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature to OHKO Tyranitar outright. There are numerous Speed investments it can run, ranging from almost no Speed EVs at all, to fully maximum investment to set up Rain Dance more easily. Beware that Rotom-W struggles to switch into its resistances effectively without HP EVs.</p> <p>Rotom-W can either use a Colbur Berry to better survive Tyranitar's attacks, or Damp Rock to increase the amount of turns rain is active. With Colbur Berry, Rotom-W survives even Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch after Stealth Rock and sand with the spread given. This allows it to use Rain Dance as Tyranitar switches in and dispatch it easily with Hydro Pump. Damp Rock makes Rotom-W a more general rain supporter and has more general utility by keeping rain up longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a rain support Pokemon, Rotom-W should be switching in on its resistances or immunities to set up the other rain sweepers for its team. Rotom-W has a very handy resistance to Electric, allowing it to switch in on Zapdos and Magnezone and prevent them from using Thunderbolt unimpeded. Rotom-W also helps against Skarmory and defensive Jirachi, two huge threats to rain teams. It should be fairly reckless with its health, as if it can set up rain and provide one of its niches such as blocking Rapid Spin or KOing Tyranitar, that makes it much easier for the rain sweepers to do their job. However, if Rotom-W is featured without a full rain team, it should be more cautious with its health. This is because if it can't clear the weather, nothing else can and the sand vulnerable Pokemon will be forced to deal with sand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of the best places for weather clear is alongside sand-vulnerable sweepers such as Suicune and Machamp. Both can use Substitute more aggressively if Rotom-W clears sand and can handle Tyranitar if Rotom-W cannot remove it with Hydro Pump. Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados is another good partner, as it appreciates Steel-types being burnt and enjoys sand cleared to make more Substitutes.</p> <p>Rotom-W is also great support for rain teams due to its resistances and being able to handle Skarmory and defensive Jirachi. Two common rain sweepers are Choice Specs Kingdra and Qwilfish. Kingdra’s extreme power allows it to devastate offensive Pokemon trying to switch into a rain boosted Hydro Pump, while Qwilfish can set up Spikes and hits hard. Other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, Calm Mind Cresselia, defensive Dragon Dance Dragonite, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Empoleon are potentially good partners. Calm Mind Cresselia especially appreciates Rotom-W potentially KOing Tyranitar. Rain supporters such as Azelf, Uxie, Bronzong, and Jirachi can work as well to help ease the burden of clearing the weather.</p>"

  "Rotom-Frost": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid Speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence make it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A's utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric types in DPP. Blizzard gives Rotom-F fantastic coverage alongside Thunderbolt, making it a good choice for a Rotom-A forme. Being able to threaten a strong Ice-type attack makes prominent Pokemon such as Flygon, Dragonite, and Gliscor much more cautious of dealing with Rotom-F, even if it doesn't have Blizzard. While Blizzard has subpar accuracy, Rotom-F's defensive sets are bulky enough to use it repeatedly. Rotom-F is the premier forme choice alongside Abomasnow, as permanent hail makes Blizzard perfectly accurate. Rotom-F additionally helps with Steel-types that heavily threaten Abomasnow. Altogether, access to Blizzard makes Rotom-F a nice choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A's primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn't enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand, while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it, and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn't get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As a result, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A's strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types that can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOes bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents Rotom-A from being Pursuit trapped if Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A's coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice both is more reliable than Rotom-F's Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, or Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded Speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO opposing Rotom-A and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, Scizor, Lucario's boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides other Rotom-A is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or via its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its Choice-locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late-game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A's Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and setup sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A's Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert, while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, or Jirachi, is appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon. As powerful Choice item attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they're locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory is also a good choice, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A's only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A's most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can't hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn foes is one of Rotom-A's core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch-ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticeably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded Speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As a result, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar's Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie's Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom's Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good matchups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% chance to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump, while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on matchup.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A's Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can give Rotom-A an Iron Ball with Trick and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOes with Waterfall and can make Rotom-A flinch—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A's main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch-in to Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind, and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming Dynamic Punch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also removes items with Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch-in to Heatran, which greatly threatens Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes-immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes-based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so that it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias's resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A's defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on a revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as its offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes, and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it removes items with Knock Off, and Rotom-A is immune to or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p>"

  "Rotom-Fan": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid Speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence make it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A's utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric types in DPP. Unfortunately, Rotom-S gets the short end of the stick, as Air Slash simply is not enough of an advantage to use it. Rotom-S's only perk of using Air Slash is hitting Breloom hard and the flinch chance. While Rotom-S functions perfectly fine as a defensive Rotom-A, it does not bluff the good coverage the other formes have. As such, Rotom-S should not be used outside of novelty, as it is outclassed by its other formes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn't enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand, while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it, and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn't get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As such, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A's strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types that can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOes bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents Rotom-A from being Pursuit trapped if Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A's coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice both is more reliable than Rotom-F's Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, or Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded Speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO opposing Rotom-A and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, Scizor, Lucario's boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides other Rotom-A is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or via its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its Choice-locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late-game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A's Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and setup sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A's Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert, while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, or Jirachi, is appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon. As powerful Choice item attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they're locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory is also a good choice, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A's only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A's most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can't hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn foes is one of Rotom-A's core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch-ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticeably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded Speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As such, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar's Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie's Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom's Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good matchups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% chance to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump, while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on matchup.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A's Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can give Rotom-A an Iron Ball with Trick and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOes with Waterfall and can make Rotom-A flinch—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A's main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch-in to Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind, and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming Dynamic Punch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also removes items with Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch-in to Heatran, which greatly threatens Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes-immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes-based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so that it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias's resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A's defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on a revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as its offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes, and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it removes items with Knock Off, and Rotom-A is immune to or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set-up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p>"

  "Rotom-Mow": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-A is a critical member of the DPP OU metagame due to its unique Ghost / Electric typing, offensive utility, and defensive profile. Rotom-A is the most reliable spinblocker in the tier: its wide assortment of resistances, Levitate ability, and well-rounded stats make it the best choice to keep entry hazards up in the long term. These well-rounded stats allow Rotom-A to fulfill a wide variety of roles: an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf, a great defensive piece with RestTalk, and an effective offensive Pokemon with either Substitute or its assortment of coverage and utility moves. Rotom-A's solid Speed tier, resilience to priority, and offensive presence make it one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can stop many setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Lucario, and Dragonite while potentially crippling a wall with Trick. Rotom-A is one of the best Will-O-Wisp users in the tier, as its bulk and resistances allow it to burn prominent attackers such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross. Rotom-A's utility sets are notorious for being difficult to answer, as with its Speed, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and great coverage, it is difficult to stop from fulfilling its role.</p> <p>The unique part of Rotom-A is its five different formes, which are all Ghost / Electric types in DPP. Rotom-C is a fine choice for a Rotom-A forme due to the unique utility of Leaf Storm. Leaf Storm provides an immediate OHKO on Swampert, something no other forme can do, while it also hits Tyranitar and Hippowdon very hard. Rotom-C is also relatively uncommon, meaning opponents are more likely to believe Rotom-C has Leaf Storm and, for example, preemptively switch their Swampert out of offensive Rotom-A even if it does not have Leaf Storm. Being able to threaten both Tyranitar and Ground-types makes Rotom-C a good choice for a Rotom-A forme.</p> <p>Rotom-A's primary flaws are its weakness to Pursuit, unreliable recovery, and lack of power. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as although it doesn't enjoy being burned, Rotom-A struggles to damage Tyranitar much at all due to the Special Defense boost in sand, while it gets potentially OHKOed by Crunch or trapped via Pursuit. This vulnerability dampens its revenge killing prowess, as it can be easily removed by one of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Dark- and Ghost-type coverage in general is dangerous to Rotom-A, as Gengar OHKOes it, and even threats it walls like Machamp and Lucario can hit it hard with Payback and Crunch, respectively. Rotom-A also lacks reliable recovery—RestTalk forces Rotom-A to either be walled easily or lack Will-O-Wisp and forces it to sleep for two turns, while Pain Split is easy to manipulate and struggles to keep Rotom-A healthy. Due to its lack of a generally strong attack, Rotom-A is easily checked by most special walls that can shrug off a burn, such as specially defensive Heatran, Clefable, Blissey, and even Breloom once Toxic Orb activates. Heatran is especially dangerous, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes Rotom-A. While Rotom-A has good coverage due to its formes, it doesn't get STAB on these special moves and often is short on moveslots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-A’s most prominent other set is Choice Specs, as it hits very hard especially with entry hazard support. It has become less common since it can’t 2HKO Clefable and struggles when locked into a bad move, however. As a frail attacker, it also struggles to differentiate itself from Gengar, who is faster, hits harder, and has many utility options to beat walls. Rotom-A can become a more dedicated sweeper with Charge Beam; especially behind a Substitute, it can get the attack boost on foes such as Clefable who struggle to break the Substitute and then use its coverage such as Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball to sweep. Such sets often struggle to fit everything they want onto one set, however. Defensive Rotom-A has many other options in its last few slots, such as Reflect to better wall physical attacks without relying on Will-O-Wisp, Overheat to more immediately handle Scizor and Lucario, and Discharge to better spread paralysis and still handle Starmie and Skarmory. Rotom-A can also use Reflect and Light Screen to use a dedicated Dual Screens support set. Utility Rotom-A has some other interesting options such as Sucker Punch, Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, Hidden Power Grass alongside Overheat, and Thunder Wave, but these often aren’t worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is the biggest threat to Rotom-A as, besides Will-O-Wisp, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm, its attacks do little even to bulkless Tyranitar. Tyranitar can then Pursuit trap Rotom-A or set up on it with Dragon Dance and KO it. other Dark-types such as Weavile and Spiritomb cannot switch in as easily but threaten it the same.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-A cannot hope to power through specially defensive Heatran, Blissey, and Clefable without multiple critical hits. Heatran is especially devastating, as it absorbs Will-O-Wisp and easily OHKOes back. Clefable’s Knock Off disables Trick and it can freely heal on almost any Rotom-A. All of these must be careful of Trick, while Heatran will eventually fall to Thunderbolt. Clefable and Blissey struggle to damage Substitute + Pain Split Rotom-A. While Latias is hit super effectively by Shadow Ball, it is bulky enough to withstand it and it easily survives Thunderbolt and other coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Camerupt, Flygon, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Swampert disable the main way Rotom-A does damage: Thunderbolt. Especially if they have cleric support, Ground-types can mostly switch in repeatedly to Rotom-A and either attack, phase, or Taunt it. Camerupt is notably immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt and is bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball. However, all should be careful of Hydro Pump, Blizzard, or Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in, Gengar and opposing Rotom-A can hit Rotom-A hard with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: While Rotom-A is bulky, it is let down by its poor HP stat. As a result, it is quite vulnerable to extremely powerful attackers OHKOing or heavily damaging it, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, +1 Gyarados Waterfall, Dragonite’s boosted Outrage, and Heatran’s Fire-type attacks. Choice Specs Starmie is especially devastating if it OHKOes Rotom-A trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-A is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is still sand vulnerable and often strives to switch in using its resistances and immunities. If it takes a weak attack such as Starmie’s Surf or Forretress’s Payback, it can be forced to use Rest or unable to switch-in again. Choice Scarf and utility sets are even more vulnerable, as it cannot heal easily.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's Speed tier and good coverage make it an excellent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Thunderbolt is Rotom-A's strongest attack, revenge killing Water-types such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Empoleon. Rotom-A has many different coverage options it can use. Overheat is a prominent one, as despite doing almost nothing to Pursuit Tyranitar, it is fantastic at revenge killing Steel-types that can shrug off a Thunderbolt such as Lucario without a Special Defense drop, Metagross, and especially Scizor. It also nails Grass-types such as Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin. Another choice is Hydro Pump, which crucially 2HKOes bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and prevents Rotom-A from being Pursuit trapped if Rotom-A hits it on the switch. It also hits Heatran trying to absorb Will-O-Wisp and Ground-types immune to Thunderbolt such as Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Camerupt. Leaf Storm OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon while also dissuading Tyranitar from switching in.</p> <p>Shadow Ball completes Rotom-A's coverage, as it prominently hits Latias, Gengar, and other Rotom-A while providing good neutral coverage should Rotom-A not use one of its forme moves. Hidden Power Ice is another excellent option, as it KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Flygon, and threatens Gliscor. Hidden Power Ice both is more reliable than Rotom-F's Blizzard and does enough damage to its targets. Rounding out the set is Trick, as it is a fantastic way of crippling a special wall such as Clefable, Latias, or Blissey. Trick can also stop a boosted sweeper by locking them into one attack, although doing this often leads to sacrificing Rotom-A. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, which burns Tyranitar on the switch in to survive a potential Pursuit trap attempt. As the only move Choice Scarf Rotom-A needs is Thunderbolt, it is free to mix and match as needed for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally should be running maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, as it has 447 Speed after the Choice Scarf boost and sits at a crowded Speed tier. Maximum Special Attack EVs notably give it the best chance to KO opposing Rotom-A and 2HKO Latias with Shadow Ball, KO Wacan Berry Gyarados without Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump, and KO Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. However, Rotom-A can spare some HP EVs to better survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, Scizor, Lucario's boosted Bullet Punch, and Gyarados's +1 Waterfall. The fastest threat it needs to revenge kill besides other Rotom-A is Modest Agility Empoleon, which requires 236 Speed EVs. Another choice is to drop down to 188 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran without the Choice Scarf. Rotom-A can also use less Special Attack EVs: it achieves the bulkless Dragonite KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice with 160 Special Attack EVs. A common choice for bulkier Rotom-A spreads is to minimize sand damage with the desired Speed and put the rest in Special Attack: some example EV spreads would be 56 HP / 216 SpA / 236 Spe, which minimizes sand damage while maximizing the other stats, and 108 HP / 164 SpA / 236 Spe, which KOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock through Wacan Berry, survives +1 Waterfall after Stealth Rock, and still outspeeds +2 Modest Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A should switch in sparingly or via its immunities, as it is not very bulky, its Choice-locked moves are easy to set up on, and it is vulnerable to Pursuit. It enjoys switching in either when a foe such as Gyarados, Lucario, or Scizor sets up or after a KO to appropriately deal with the threat. This can be dangerous, however, as all of them can hit Rotom-A hard on the switch. Keeping Rotom-A hidden also can allow it to sweep late-game against weakened threats should its checks be removed. This is especially prevalent against frail hyper offensive teams or those without a Ground-type. Rotom-A's Trick is an excellent weapon to cripple walls and setup sweepers alike, but make sure Rotom-A's Speed is no longer needed. Beware of opponents switching in another Choice Scarf Pokemon to nullify it or, worse, a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Pursuit trapping Rotom-A. Another complication is with Knock Off: in DPP, if either the user or foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Be careful with using Trick around Clefable and defensive Empoleon for this reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a premier revenge killer in DPP OU and features on many team styles. Most midpaced offensive teams carry a Choice Scarf revenge killer to backstop them against set-up sweepers—Rotom-A is one of the best at it with its Speed, coverage, and Trick. As Rotom-A is easily covered by the special walls in the tier, it appreciates teammates that can break though them. Breloom and Heatran are fantastic choices, as Breloom takes advantage of Tyranitar, Blissey, Clefable, and Swampert, while Heatran can trap them with Magma Storm and then burn Tyranitar, use Explosion on Blissey and Clefable, or OHKO Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Breloom can also use Mach Punch or a bulky EV spread to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another Tyranitar check, such as Machamp, bulky Metagross, or Jirachi, is appreciated. Rotom-A also enjoys other strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Latias, Zapdos, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi to weaken Tyranitar to the point it cannot switch into Rotom-A. Rotom-A appreciates threats that can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit: Lucario is an excellent choice, as is Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another excellent option is Torment Heatran, as it appreciates Rotom-A's Trick to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon. As powerful Choice item attackers such as Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Choice Specs Zapdos can get set up on if they're locked into the wrong move, Rotom-A can be a good stopgap.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-A is also fantastic on more frail hyper offenses as speed control and potentially a spinblocker for Spikes. Some prominent offensive partners include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance or mixed Tyranitar, Dragon Dance or mixed Dragonite, Swords Dance or Agility Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Swords Dance Scizor. These Pokemon can set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit as well. Azelf is also an excellent choice to weaken Tyranitar with either paralysis or Explosion. Offensive Spikes Skarmory is also a good choice, as Choice Scarf Rotom-A can provide spinblocking and appreciates entry hazards wearing down its grounded answers.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A's typing, ability, and bulk make it the best defensive spinblocker in the metagame. Rest and Sleep Talk are Rotom-A's only form of recovery outside of Pain Split and prevent it from succumbing to status and residual damage. It also makes Rotom-A a reliable sleep absorber; however, without Shadow Ball, Rotom-A struggles to damage Breloom while getting 3HKOed by Seed Bomb. Rest also gives Rotom-A a massive stock of PP, making it useful for PP staling.</p> <p>Rotom-A's most prominent attacking move is Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Gyarados. Thunderbolt also hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor and at least 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. However, as Thunderbolt is useless against Ground-types and can't hit Breloom well, another option is to use Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball prevents RestTalk Rotom-A from being completely unable to damage Taunt Gliscor while also hitting Ghost-weak targets such as Gengar, opposing Rotom-A, and Starmie hard. For the last slot, Rotom-A can either spread burns effectively with Will-O-Wisp or maintain better coverage with both Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp is preferred, as being able to burn foes is one of Rotom-A's core niches. It notably is the best response to Tyranitar, as it will not enjoy a burn unless it has a Lum Berry. Will-O-Wisp also limits switch-ins to foes immune to burn damage such as Clefable, Heatran, Camerupt, and Breloom after Toxic Orb activates. Additionally, Natural Cure Pokemon such as Celebi and Blissey can pivot in on Will-O-Wisp. Another option for an Electric-type attack is Discharge, but it suffers from being noticeably weaker than Thunderbolt and potentially giving unwanted paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-A generally needs all of the physical bulk it can get to stave off Tyranitar, Metagross, Machamp, and Lucario. Take care that absolute maximum HP investment Rotom-A makes its HP stat divisible by 16, increasing the damage it takes from sand and heals from Leftovers. Rotom-A also is at a crowded Speed tier—many Pokemon such as Empoleon, Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Breloom aim to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A. As a result, it can invest 56 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert. Additionally, Rotom-A can add some Special Defense EVs to better handle special coverage from Swampert, survive Gengar's Shadow Ball, and help prevent Starmie's Rapid Spin; however, going with a fully specially defensive RestTalk Rotom-A is not advised due to its huge Pursuit weakness. A few Special Attack EVs, such as 20 EVs, also help Thunderbolt break maximum HP Breloom's Substitute guaranteed and give better chances to OHKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should generally be used early to spread burns and block Rapid Spin, preferably before Breloom has activated its Toxic Orb. Rotom-A can lead, as it has good matchups against all common physical leads with the exception of Tyranitar and is immune to Explosion. Mastering the timing of when to use Rest with Rotom-A is critical, as it only has a 24.8% chance to burn physical attackers such as Tyranitar while asleep. Rotom-A should generally be careful about trying to block Rapid Spin too much, as offensive Starmie sets can OHKO Rotom-A with Hydro Pump, while defensive Starmie and Forretress can 3HKO it in sand with Surf and Payback, respectively. Other than these, there are nuances with its usage depending on matchup.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-A is difficult to handle, as foes typically absorb burns with either Heatran, Refresh Swampert, Lum Berry Tyranitar, or Breloom. These teams also typically lack reliable Rapid Spin users, meaning Rotom-A can lean fully into its defensive roll and more recklessly wall opposing physical attackers and spread burns. As Heatran cannot absorb Rotom-A's Thunderbolts forever, aggressively predicting it as it comes in can wear it down easily. Be careful against Metagross and Bronzong, as they can give Rotom-A an Iron Ball with Trick and ruin its ability to handle physical attackers with Earthquake. Despite being able to handle Gyarados, Rotom-A should not be the primary answer, as boosted Gyarados 2HKOes with Waterfall and can make Rotom-A flinch—in addition, Gyarados survives Thunderbolt with a Wacan Berry even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can break through Rotom-A coming in on Dragon Dance. Rotom-A should be kept away from foes that can set up or otherwise take advantage of it, including sweepers with Lum Berry such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Tyranitar; mixed attackers such as Dragonite, Flygon, and Swampert; Taunt users such as Gliscor; and faster Substitute users such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and Breloom.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Rotom-A's main value are its ability to block Rapid Spin, huge pool of PP, and handling problem Pokemon such as Skarmory, Breloom, physical Jirachi, and Starmie. Since Clefable is commonly the first switch-in to Rotom-A due to being immune to burn damage, absorbing its Knock Off with Rotom-A is one of the better ways to PP stall it, as Clefable cannot threaten it outside of Calm Mind, and Rotom-A will always be able to use Rest if sand is active. Once Rotom-A goes to sleep, not using Sleep Talk greatly increases how much PP Rotom-A has, to 108 if Rotom-A has Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>RestTalk Rotom-A provides valuable defensive niches and spinblocking. On more defensive teams, it keeps entry hazards up and spreads burns. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Forretress appreciate this, as neither can prevent Starmie, Donphan, or opposing Forretress from using Rapid Spin. Rotom-A prevents Machamp from spamming Dynamic Punch, meaning prominent Fighting-weak walls such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey appreciate its presence. Clefable also removes items with Knock Off for adding onto residual damage. Tyranitar provides sand and traps prominent Pokemon that threaten Rotom-A such as Gengar and offensive Starmie. Both Clefable and Blissey can provide cleric support for Rotom-A. All three provide a switch-in to Heatran, which greatly threatens Rotom-A with Flash Fire. Rotom-A is a possible choice on big 5 defensive archetypes over the typical Ground-type alongside Skarmory, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, defensive Latias, and Jirachi. Both offensive and defensive Jirachi sets work: offensive sets appreciate the Spikes and residual damage Rotom-A helps to wrack up, while defensive Jirachi helps shore the team against Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar that Rotom-A struggles with. Defensive Jirachi also enjoys foes worn down due to Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Rotom-A hitting Skarmory hard. Other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong are great choices, especially for fully Spikes-immune teams. Additionally, Hippowdon, Celebi, and defensive Gyarados can also make solid partners, as they further answer powerful sweepers and are effective with Spikes.</p> <p>Rotom-A's defensive prowess make it a strong partner for more offensive Spikes-based partners as well, as it has more resilience than more frail spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Alongside Swampert and Skarmory, Rotom-A does not have to worry about Tyranitar as much, as entry hazards wear Tyranitar down, while Swampert at least 2HKOes it. Both offensive and defensive Latias sets are fantastic partners for Rotom-A: Choice Specs Latias hammers Tyranitar and weakens it heavily so that it can’t handle Rotom-A effectively, while defensive Latias's resistances and bulk ease some of Rotom-A's defensive responsibilities against attackers such as Gyarados and Breloom. Choice Scarf Lucario takes on a revenge killing duty against attackers that can set up and OHKO Rotom-A, such as Lum Berry Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Mixed Flygon is an excellent partner, as its offensive prowess is greatly enhanced by Spikes, and it enjoys Rotom-A switching into Steel-types such as Bronzong and offensive Jirachi and burning them. Empoleon is another excellent partner, as it removes items with Knock Off, and Rotom-A is immune to or resists all of its weaknesses. It also helps against specially offensive Water-types such as Kingdra that Rotom-A cannot deal with. Tyranitar can take on a more offensive role, such as Choice Band to remove special walls or Starmie guaranteed or Dragon Dance to take advantage of Spikes wearing down its answers.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-A can maximize its utility options by using Pain Split as its primary recovery option. Despite being unreliable, Rotom-A can easily heal on special walls like Clefable and Blissey due to its immunity to Seismic Toss. Substitute maximizes Pain Split and gives it more reliability. Substitute blocks status, making Clefable without Encore and Blissey complete set up bait. It also gives Rotom-A a free chance to burn Tyranitar and other Pursuit users such as Scizor.</p> <p>As Substitute limits Rotom-A’s offensive options, it can instead use a coverage move such as Shadow Ball, Hydro Pump, and Blizzard. Shadow Ball notably allows Rotom-A to damage opposing Rotom-A and Gengar, while Hydro Pump and Blizzard provide additional coverage. Hydro Pump hammers Heatran and Ground-types such as Hippowdon trying to phase out Substitute Rotom-A while Blizzard OHKOes Taunt Gliscor, Flygon, Breloom, and Dragonite trying to take advantage of it. Will-O-Wisp is perfect alongside Substitute or the coverage moves, as it burns Steel-types that otherwise wall Rotom-A and gives it an option to threaten Tyranitar. Thunderbolt allows it to KO Water-types and is it’s main offensive option with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This specific EV spread aims to outspeed as much as possible so it can get a Substitute up, burn Gliscor before it can use Taunt, and then maximize its bulk. Rotom-A can minimize its HP and instead invest in Special Attack EVs to get as much health back as possible from Pain Split and power up it’s coverage moves, but since Rotom-A’s HP stat is low, it should otherwise aim to maximize HP to be as bulky as possible. Rotom-A generally tries to have a specific Speed stat and then invest the rest into bulk or Special Attack. Some common examples include 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Swampert; 164 Speed EVs to outspeed positive nature Tyranitar; 220 Speed EVs to outspeed Gyarados, Dragonite, and Breloom; and 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and defensive Latias. As these are crowded speed tiers, it can be beneficial to invest a few more Speed EVs to outspeed the benchmark. When using not as much Speed EVs, it is recommended to use a Modest nature to maximize Rotom-A’s coverage options.</p> <p>Especially if it does not have Substitute, Rotom-A can use a few different items. Leftovers is the most prominent, as it allows Rotom-A to neutralize sand damage and make more Substitute. A more offensive option is to use Life Orb, as Rotom-A can heal with Pain Split and do a lot of damage, but watch out for foes trying to take advantage of Substitute. Without Substitute, some other options such as Colbur Berry to survive Pursuit Tyranitar and other Dark-type attacks, Custap Berry to get one last attack or Pain Split off, and Expert Belt to take advantage of its type coverage are all options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-A should be cautious when it comes in and either lead or come in on resistance or immunities, as while it can mitigate residual damage with Pain Split, it isn’t bulky enough to stave off heavy damage. With Substitute, it should try to set up as soon as possible on something it forces out such as Skarmory or Gyarados. Take the opportunity to either heal up or spread Will-O-Wisp. Despite its prowess against special walls, it still can perform defensive roles such as block Rapid Spin from defensive Starmie and burn Steel-types. In the lead position, Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp and its coverage to take advantage of physical leads, but watch out for Tyranitar. More offensive versions of utility Rotom-A, especially without recovery or Leftovers, get worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-A fits on a wide variety of teams due to its unique typing and ability to block Rapid Spin. Utility Rotom-A is commonly featured alongside entry hazards and Pokemon that give it a free switch in on its immunities. A prominent example is Heatran, as Heatran’s Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses give Rotom-A plenty of opportunities to switch in. Common Spikers alongside utility Rotom-A include Roserade and Skarmory. With Roserade and Heatran, Swampert forms a Fire-Water-Grass core while offensively checking Tyranitar. Another common Water-type with Heatran and Roserade is offensive Suicune, which appreciates Rotom-A taking advantage of special walls and spreading burns. Other checks to Tyranitar, such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross or defensive Jirachi are appreciated. As these Fire-Water-Grass cores can struggle with multiple Dragon Dance sweepers, Choice Scarf Flygon or Hippowdon can be excellent partners. Alongside Skarmory, Pain Split gives Rotom-A more offensive coverage and Speed than with the defensive set. It spreads burns, staves off Clefable with Pain Split, and gives a switch into Fighting-types. Prominent partners include offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Heatran. Choice Scarf Lucario can absorb Rotom-A’s revenge killing responsibilities.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, it may seem unwise to use Venusaur over Roserade, who has higher speed, better Special Attack, and the ability to set up Toxic Spikes. However, Venusaur has a few unique tricks up its sleeves which allow it to function well in OU. Venusaur is much bulkier than Roserade, allowing it to take hits which Roserade isn't able to. Venusaur also has access to Swords Dance and Power Whip, turning it into a frightening sweeper. Other Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi don't outclass Venusaur either, because Venusaur's Poison typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes, allowing teammates to switch in without being crippled by poison. Venusaur has its own niche, which allows it to function well in OU, but don't go slapping it on every team and expecting it to be wonderful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur does not have many viable options in OU. Growth can be used to boost Venusaur's Special Attack, and with a set of Grass Knot, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground, Venusaur should not be taken lightly. Hidden Power Ice is another option, hitting Zapdos, Dragonite, and Grass-types hard. Light Screen can be used to lower the damage output of special attacks that are directed at your team. Roar isn't a bad option either, allowing Venusaur to phaze threats that try to set up on it. Finally, Toxic can be used to cripple a bulky wall, preventing them from doing their job.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Though Venusaur has quite a few counters that can dispose of it, all checks and counters must beware of a potential Sleep Powder, which could severely cripple them. For that reason, it would be wise to switch in a status absorber to take the Sleep Powder before switching to your counter. Once sleep clause has been activated, Venusaur becomes much easier to counter, as there are a number of Pokemon who resists Venusaur typical attacking options. Skarmory is without a doubt the best counter to physical sets. Even boosted Power Whips don't bother it thanks to its typing, which 4x resists Grass-type attacks. It is also immune to Earthquake, meaning that there is nothing Venusaur can do to hurt Skarmory. In return, Skarmory can easily set up Spikes on Venusaur, smash it with Brave Bird, or phaze it with Whirlwind. Zapdos can switch into Venusaur and either set up a Substitute or fire off a powerful Heat Wave. Dragonite is also not weak to any of Venusaur's attacks, and can blast Venusaur away with Outrage. Note that Venusaur may carry Hidden Power Ice on some special sets, but it's never strong enough to OHKO Dragonite. Choice Scarf Heatran can switch in on anything but a Ground-type attack and threaten Fire Blast, much the same way as Infernape. Celebi is a solid response to all Venusaur as well, since it's immune to Leech Seed, resists Grass- and Ground-type attacks, and can hurt Venusaur with STAB super effective Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Leech Seed": {
        "description": "<p>Venusaur can perform excellently as a Leech Seed abuser, thanks to its great bulk coupled with the ability to incapacitate a counter or check with Sleep Powder. Leech Seed provides Venusaur with some form of recovery, while weakening the opposing Pokemon at the same time. Leaf Storm offers a powerful STAB move that hits many Pokemon hard, but lowers its Special Attack after every use. Grass Knot is a great alternative, still hitting quite hard thanks to many top Pokemon that reside in the tier being very heavy. Hidden Power Fire allows Venusaur to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set, such as Scizor. Since Scizor is one of the most common switch-ins to Venusaur, and can also not get harmed by Leech Seed thanks to U-turn, it can easily switch in and hit Venusaur hard or allow the opposing team to gain momentum. Sludge Bomb can be used instead of Hidden Power Fire for a secondary STAB move, but Venusaur loses out on the ability to hit Steel-types.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot to hit Heatran. If it is used, Timid along with 252 Speed EVs should be used to outspeed Heatran, and be able to nail it with Hidden Power Ground. Note that a lot of bulk will be sacrificed if Venusaur is to run maximum Speed. Synthesis can be used over Leech Seed, as it offers more recovery. Unfortunately, sandstorm is a common effect in the metagame, and very often, Venusaur will only be healing a meager 25% health. The EVs are tailored to give Venusaur a lot of special bulk, while still being able to outspeed 0 Speed Rotom-A. The 24 Special Attack EVs allow Venusaur to break Gengar's Substitute with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Unless Hidden Power Ground is used, Heatran is a great counter to Venusaur that can switch in on anything but Sleep Powder and force it out with a STAB Fire-type attack. Infernape functions similarly, and is able to outspeed all Venusaur and take it out with Fire Blast. Bulky Gyarados is a solid teammate to counter the aforementioned threats since he can take Fire Blast easily and take the typical coverage moves well. Gyarados can force both of them out, and use Dragon Dance on the switch.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Venusaur can effectively run a Swords Dance set that is not outclassed by other Grass-types due to solid attacking options and access to Sleep Powder. Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to incapacitate a check or counter that switches in, while having an awesome STAB attack like Power Whip and good coverage in Earthquake practically makes this set worth running. Once set up against the omnipresent Swampert, Suicune, Vaporeon, or sleeping check, Venusaur can fire off powerful attacks backed by 526 Attack and Life Orb.</p> <p>The below calculations show how powerful Venusaur is after a single Swords Dance.</p> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Blissey: 94.7% - 111.5%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Hippowdon: 114.3% - 134.8%</li> <li>+1 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/252+ Gyarados: 59.5% - 70.2%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/252+ Rotom-A: 84.2% - 99.7%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 252/4 Gliscor: 86.4% - 102%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 12/0 Breloom: 85.2% - 100%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 0/0 Gengar: 107.3% - 126.4%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 240/0 Machamp: 118.1% - 138.8%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 4/0 Celebi / Shaymin: 54.4% - 64%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/228+ Zapdos: 39.9% - 47%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Power Whip vs 248/0 Zapdos: 55.6% - 65.8%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 248/0 Scizor: 60.6% - 71.1%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 252/224+ Jirachi: 75.7% - 89.1%</li> <li>+2 Life Orb Earthquake vs 0/0 Jirachi: 122% - 143.7%</li> </ul> <p>Occa Berry is an option over Life Orb so that Venusaur can take a Fire-type move from the likes of Choice Scarf Heatran and OHKO back. Venusaur outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Heatran and Adamant Lucario, allowing Venusaur to nail them both with Earthquake before either of them can attack. Sludge Bomb can be used over Sleep Powder to 2HKO Shaymin and Celebi and OHKO Breloom even with a Jolly nature. Return can be used to hit Dragonite, Zapdos, and other Grass-types for more damage. The EV spread is a standard offensive spread, maximizing Attack and Speed so Venusaur can hit harder and outspeed as many foes as possible. The remaining 4 EVs are put into HP because you might as well to boost Venusaur's bulk slightly.</p> <p>Most Pokemon will take a lot of damage from a boosted Power Whip, even if resisted. Celebi is probably the best check to this Venusaur, since it resists both Power Whip and Earthquake and can remove sleep if necessary thanks to Natural Cure. Celebi can also pack STAB Psychic and Recover to deal with Venusaur and keep itself healthy. Since Celebi and Skarmory are both problematic Pokemon for this set, Choice Scarf Scizor and Magnezone are nice choices to bring along. With a Choice Scarf, Scizor can easily switch into Psychic without fear of Hidden Power Fire on the next turn and U-turn to destroy Celebi or keep up momentum. A Magnezone of your own can also be used to take out opposing Skarmory so that Venusaur can more easily attempt its sweep.</p>"

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen has found a home in OU as a surprisingly versatile Pokemon. It's a great fit on stall builds with access to both Stealth Rock and, notably, Toxic Spikes. With key resistances to Rock- and Fighting-type attacks through its Poison / Ground typing, Nidoqueen is a great defensive check to Pokemon like Breloom, Lucario, Tyranitar, and sometimes even Infernape. Over time, Nidoqueen has proven to fit very well on balanced builds and even offense, clearing Toxic Spikes on entry and setting up its own entry hazards to support its offensive teammates. Defensive Pokemon can sometimes find themselves irritated by Nidoqueen, as its typing grants it an immunity to both Thunder Wave and Toxic. On top of that, its movepool is quite vast, so it can be molded to suit a team's needs very often.</p> <p>However, Nidoqueen's biggest weakness is its lack of reliable healing, meaning it gets chipped down really easily by a myriad of offensive threats and even defensive ones as well. Its base stats are underwhelming for OU, with decent defenses at best and subpar Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. While it is a great fit on stall builds, it can also be a detriment by being setup fodder for Spikes users like Skarmory and Roserade as well as setup sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Clefable, and Dragon Dance Gyarados if it doesn't have the right moveset.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoqueen's movepool is shockingly diverse, so it can employ some interesting strategies. Pursuit can be used to trap Choice Scarf Rotom-A that's locked into Thunderbolt for a decent amount of damage. Crunch can be used as a surprise move versus a Rotom-A that is locked into Shadow Ball and even to devastate Gengar, but this move is not recommended over other options, and Nidoqueen still has to beware of Will-O-Wisp. Taunt can be used if Nidoqueen is faster than Skarmory to prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Super Fang is an option for consistent damage output versus bulkier Pokemon. Because Nidoqueen has decent HP and good physical bulk, it could potentially use Counter to surprise Pokemon like Choice Band Tyranitar and Gliscor, but this is a very gimmicky strategy. Icy Wind could be used in place of Ice Beam to slow down threats like mixed Dragonite, but the loss of power and chance to freeze is discouraging. Nidoqueen also has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day and could potentially be a good hazard stacking weather supporter, but those types of teams generally do not need Toxic Spikes, and other Pokemon do it better. Whirlpool is an option to trap something that greedily stays in, like Clefable or Blissey that want to heal, which could allow Nidoqueen to stack entry hazards, but this is likely a waste of a moveslot. Nidoqueen can use Passho Berry on the Thunderbolt set, which makes it more effective versus Gyarados, a common target of the set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types are Nidoqueen's worst enemy. Kingdra, Starmie, Swampert, and Suicune work best, as these Pokemon shrug off Nidoqueen's attacks with ease. Kingdra has decent defenses, so it won't mind an Earthquake too much and can set up Dragon Dance or Rain Dance as well as threaten Nidoqueen with its STAB Water-type attacks. If Kingdra uses Rest or even has Lum Berry, it can enter on Toxic Spikes. Starmie can spin away Nidoqueen's entry hazards and likely OHKO the physically defensive variant. Suicune can set up Substitute or Calm Mind on Nidoqueen and takes little damage from Earthquake. Swampert can threaten Nidoqueen with its STAB moves and set up Stealth Rock. Empoleon and Gyarados also do quite well versus Nidoqueen, but Empoleon needs to beware of Earthquake, and Gyarados will usually do amazingly versus Nidoqueen but needs to watch out for the very rare Thunderbolt variant.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mamoswine will typically do well versus Nidoqueen and threaten it with STAB Earthquake. Flygon and Gliscor do excellently versus Nidoqueen without Ice Beam, especially with their Ground immunity, which allows them to be immune to Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Celebi and Shaymin resist Earthquake, do not take much from Ice Beam, are able to cure poison via Natural Cure, and threaten Nidoqueen with strong special attacks like Seed Flare, Earth Power, Psychic, and even Hidden Power Ice. Roserade and Venusaur can threaten Nidoqueen with Sleep Powder and strong special attacks, and both can remove Toxic Spikes on entry. Venusaur has more natural bulk than Roserade, so it likely won't mind an Earthquake, but Roserade has to be careful, as it is not likely to survive more than two Earthquakes unless it has significant defensive investment. Still, Nidoqueen has to be careful when matched up versus Roserade, which can sometimes use it to set up its Spikes and even Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Since physically defensive Nidoqueen is the most common variant, special attackers like Gengar, Rotom-A, Heatran, Jirachi, and Dragonite can deal a tremendous amount of damage to Nidoqueen, although the latter three must watch out for super effective attacks like Earthquake and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Nidoqueen's STAB Earthquake will typically do very well versus it, provided that Nidoqueen's fourth move does not hit them super effectively. Even though Zapdos can be walled by Nidoqueen, Hidden Power Ice will still chip it reasonably well, likely 2HKOing it if the Zapdos is offensive, but the specially defensive Nidoqueen can still use the less powerful variants of Zapdos to set up entry hazards. Without Ice Beam, Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor do exceptionally well versus Nidoqueen. Without Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, Skarmory does amazingly versus Nidoqueen and can set up its entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Scizor and Gyarados can use Nidoqueen to set up Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, but they must beware of Flamethrower and the rarer Thunderbolt variants.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Users</strong>: Will-O-Wisp users like Gengar, Rotom-A, and Heatran can cripple Nidoqueen with a burn, which prevents it from recovering with Black Sludge and reduces the power of its Earthquake by half.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users like Aerodactyl, Azelf, Gengar, and Skarmory can stop Nidoqueen from setting up its entry hazards and support other teammates in taking advantage of Nidoqueen's lack of power. In particular, Azelf takes negligible damage from anything Nidoqueen uses, can set up Stealth Rock or even Nasty Plot, and can take Nidoqueen out with Explosion if it doesn't have a Psychic-type attack with which to OHKO Nidoqueen.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive Toxic Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes is Nidoqueen's niche, as it is one of the most consistent and bulky users of the move in OU, so it's a mandatory moveslot. Although it can use Stealth Rock instead of Protect, Nidoqueen prefers the latter to take advantage of potential sand, receive additional Black Sludge recovery to make up for its lack of a recovery move of its own outside of Rest, and scout Choice item users like Flygon and Jirachi. Protect can also be used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes to wear down opposing Pokemon with residual poison damage. However, often teams that use Nidoqueen will want it to use both entry hazards, so using Stealth Rock over Protect will be mandatory if nothing else on the team can better use Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Earthquake is Nidoqueen's strongest STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, and even Jirachi quite hard. Earth Power is an option over Earthquake to hit Metagross harder that also allows Nidoqueen to use a Bold nature instead, but if using Earth Power, Nidoqueen should use Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to take advantage of being faster than most Skarmory. Nidoqueen can also use Roar over a Ground-type move on a set that has Toxic Spikes, Ice Beam, and Protect, but this is only recommended on full stall builds.</p> <p>The fourth move is quite flexible, but Ice Beam is the most recommended to give Nidoqueen leverage against Pokemon like Gliscor, Dragonite, Flygon, and Breloom all at once. Flamethrower is a solid option for Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor, particularly the Swords Dance variant of the latter. Fire Blast could be used for its increased power, but this will likely be more unreliable versus Skarmory and Scizor because of its low PP and chance to miss; the extra damage output is typically not worth it because Fire Blast can likely still be stalled out with Roost from specially defensive Skarmory. Furthermore, since Flamethrower has more PP, Nidoqueen overall will have a higher chance to inflict a burn or get a critical hit. Thunderbolt can be used if a team has trouble with Gyarados and does not want to give it any initiative, but this move will not OHKO it unless it takes damage from Stealth Rock and two turns of sand or one turn of Life Orb damage; Thunderbolt hits Skarmory as well. The issue with Thunderbolt, however, is that ultimately it is inferior to Ice Beam or Flamethrower because it makes Nidoqueen unable to check Breloom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>HP and Defense are maximized so Nidoqueen can take physical attacks from the likes of Dragonite, Tyranitar, Infernape, and Lucario as well as possible. Black Sludge is used to give Nidoqueen passive recovery and can be nice for punishing Trick users like Jirachi, Latias, and Rotom-A. A Relaxed nature is recommended because Nidoqueen is typically a mixed attacker.</p> <p>Nidoqueen can opt for a Bold nature if using Earth Power, which allows it to outspeed most Skarmory. However, this is only recommended if opting for Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to damage Skarmory. While Nidoqueen is not a good Skarmory check even with these moves, as they likely will do less than 50% to it, they do prevent it from being able to freely set up on Nidoqueen with little to no consequence, which is the case if opting for Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You need to be somewhat careful when using Nidoqueen because one of its biggest weaknesses is that it can be chipped down easily, so try to use its Poison / Ground typing to your advantage by pivoting it into attacks or status moves it's immune to. Also, identifying Pokemon with Choice items will make it easier to get Nidoqueen on the battlefield, as its many resistances can help it take advantage of bad locks. When considering which entry hazard to use first, usually Stealth Rock is the most important one, as no matter what comes in, something will take damage. Identify the type of team you are facing before laying down two layers of Toxic Spikes, as more offensive teams will actually be crippled more by only one layer. This is because they need to stay in for a few turns to take more damage from two layers of Toxic Spikes than just one. If you know that your opponent is using Starmie, you can try to bait it out and double switch to a counter; this is especially effective if you use a Pursuit trapper like Tyranitar or Weavile. Try to take advantage of Nidoqueen's Poison Point by sending it in on Pokemon that spam U-turn and other physical attacks, provided that it will take minimal damage in the process. For example, because Nidoqueen can threaten Breloom with Ice Beam, you can force Breloom to use Spore, which ideally Breloom wants to delay for as long as possible. Even while Nidoqueen is asleep, you can still pivot it into U-turn users to threaten Pokemon with Poison Point, switch it into Trick and give away a Black Sludge, and also clear Toxic Spikes from your side of the field. If you opt for a rarer move like Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, try your best to keep it concealed until necessary to reveal it so you may surprise your opponent. If you are using a Pokemon with Wish support alongside Nidoqueen or you opt for Protect over Stealth Rock, you can afford to be a bit more lenient with conserving its health, which can be incredibly rewarding because it can result in more pressure with entry hazards and certain offenses having a harder time breaking it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nidoqueen appreciates teammates that can handle Water-types, Skarmory, and strong special attackers well. Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A are naturally a great fit with Nidoqueen, as they function as secondary Fighting-type checks and spinblockers for all of Nidoqueen's entry hazards. Rotom-A is better versus Starmie than Gengar, but the Choice Scarf variants of each can outspeed Starmie and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a great countermeasure to Dragon Dance Gyarados, which also benefits Nidoqueen. Tyranitar can do well versus Water-types and strong special attackers with its incredible special bulk and Passho Berry, and it can consistently trap Starmie, which assists with Nidoqueen's entry hazards. Tyranitar's Sand Stream also assists Nidoqueen with wearing down its foes and restoring its passive recovery in case it faces a hail-inducing Pokemon like Abomasnow. Weavile is also a wonderful partner for Nidoqueen on more offensive builds, as the two have good type synergy. Nidoqueen also removes opposing Toxic Spikes from the field on entry, and Weavile can trap Starmie with Pursuit, forcing it into a mind game by also packing Night Slash. Magnezone can trap Skarmory and other troubling Steel-types like Bronzong and Choice Scarf Jirachi while doing decently versus Water-types, but this compounds a a Ground-type weakness, and a backup plan should be in store for Shed Shell Skarmory.</p> <p>Since Nidoqueen does amazingly versus Breloom, which can often be the bane of a stall build's existence, Skarmory and Latias fit well to stop Breloom after Nidoqueen forces it to use Spore. Skarmory itself has great type synergy with Nidoqueen and can assist in setting up entry hazards as well as soft check threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Flygon. Bulkier variants of Latias can soft check Gyarados. Nidoqueen and Latias form a strong core of Fighting-resistant Pokemon. Latias can also switch into Ground-, Water-, and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Nidoqueen. A Calm Mind + Roar set can be used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes to spread poison.</p> <p>Blissey and Clefable are great special walls that have good type synergy with Nidoqueen and can also handle all the special attacking Water-types. Milotic can also handle most Water-types, has great special bulk, and does particularly well versus Gyarados, which Nidoqueen detests. On top of that, Nidoqueen clears Toxic Spikes for Milotic, which can be a nuisance. Many other bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, some Kingdra, and Swampert pair well with Nidoqueen because they appreciate the removal of Toxic Spikes. In fact, the CroCune variant of Suicune both appreciates Nidoqueen removing Toxic Spikes and setting up its own against the opposing team. Blissey, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi with Wish can also support Nidoqueen well. Specially defensive Empoleon makes for a good teammate that can use Stealth Rock and allow Nidoqueen to use Protect, but you should beware of the compounded Ground-type weakness.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes support are also great teammates for Nidoqueen. Protect users like Torment Heatran, Calm Mind Raikou, and Leech Seed Shaymin can take advantage of Toxic Spikes. Heatran can do well versus Steel-types that give Nidoqueen some trouble, and Shaymin can do well versus Water-types. Celebi is another Grass-type that defensively synergizes well with Nidoqueen and can do decently versus Choice Band Gyarados and other Water-types; however, while Celebi brushes off Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Nidoqueen, and Nidoqueen takes Bug-type attacks like U-turn aimed at Celebi, they are both weak to Ice, so this should be considered when pairing the two together. Zapdos can add to a stall build and use a set like Substitute + Roost or even a Protect set to take advantage of Nidoqueen's Toxic Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive Toxic Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set uses Special Defense investment to do better against certain threats like mixed Dragonite, Heatran, Infernape, Gengar, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Toxic Spikes is a staple to Nidoqueen's niche in OU. While Protect is preferred, Stealth Rock will be mandatory for many teams that use Nidoqueen if nothing else can better fit the move.</p> <p>Earthquake is Nidoqueen's preferred STAB attack for doing solid damage against Tyranitar and Heatran. Nidoqueen can also use Earth Power for more damage against Metagross and for a bit more Speed, but this is less recommended because Flamethrower and Thunderbolt aren't nearly as effective without Defense investment, and you'd also sacrifice Nidoqueen's damage output versus Infernape. This means that Nidoqueen has no move to pressure Skarmory, so the increased Speed isn't worth replacing Earthquake.</p> <p>Ice Beam is the best option for the last moveslot because it takes advantage of Nidoqueen's heightened Special Defense by threatening mixed Dragonite and pressuring Zapdos into using Roost, allowing Nidoqueen to hit it harder with Earthquake. It also allows Nidoqueen to still do decently versus Breloom, hitting it super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>HP and Special Defense are maximized to make Nidoqueen as specially bulky as possible, which allows it to stand a chance versus mixed Dragonite and Gengar. On top of that, it allows Nidoqueen to reliably set up entry hazards on bulkier variants of Zapdos and Rotom-A that don't carry Will-O-Wisp as well. Interestingly, specially defensive Nidoqueen can more reliably cripple Trick Rotom-A with Black Sludge because it has an easier time entering in on Shadow Ball or even Hidden Power Ice from Choice Scarf variants, but it must beware of Choice Specs sets. Also, the passive recovery from Black Sludge can be taken advantage of even further by opting for Protect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though this Nidoqueen does decently versus mixed Dragonite, Gengar, Heatran, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, it must be careful when trying to match up versus all of those Pokemon. Nidoqueen only deals with mixed Dragonite reliably when it is at full health, and it needs to be at a reasonably high amount of health to come in on Gengar and at least guarantee that SubSplit variants don't maintain their Substitute. In terms of its health, the same can apply with the other aforementioned special attackers. Coming in on moves it's immune to will be very beneficial to this Nidoqueen. Be sure to evaluate whether one or two layers of Toxic Spikes should be used, and try to prioritize Stealth Rock. If needed, this Nidoqueen can sometimes stay in once versus Leftovers Starmie to hit it with an Earthquake and pressure it a bit more, but this usually isn't recommended. Even though Nidoqueen lacks investment in Defense, it can still take advantage of Poison Point, as it still takes Infernape's Close Combat decently and resists U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Beyond the fact that Nidoqueen appreciates teammates that do well versus Water-types and Skarmory, Pokemon with more Defense investment will pair slightly better with specially defensive Nidoqueen, as it loses a large portion of its physically defensive value. Physically defensive Skarmory has great synergy with specially defensive Nidoqueen, and this core can be difficult to break. Because specially defensive Nidoqueen tends to check its foes much more effectively at higher health, Wish support is extremely helpful. Blissey, Clefable, Jirachi, and Vaporeon can effectively pass Wish to Nidoqueen, and the physically bulky Wish + Calm Mind variant of Jirachi has particularly nice synergy with specially defensive Nidoqueen.</p> <p>Suicune and other bulky Water-types like Milotic, Kingdra, and Swampert appreciate Nidoqueen's support. Physically defensive Zapdos can sometimes dislike mixed Dragonite, so this combined with the natural synergy this Nidoqueen has with physically defensive Zapdos makes these two a fantastic pair. Bulkier Starmie, especially with Reflect, can pair well with this Nidoqueen, spinning away Spikes and setting up Reflect for Nidoqueen while Zapdos is handled naturally by Nidoqueen. Celebi appreciates the Toxic Spikes removal that Nidoqueen provides, and physically defensive variants have even better synergy with this Nidoqueen, taking Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at it while it takes Bug-type attacks like U-turn; however, an Ice-type weakness will be compounded when pairing these two together.</p> <p>Tyranitar combined with this Nidoqueen can give many special attackers a hard time, but there should be reassurance versus Water-types, whether it be through a Passho Berry Tyranitar variant or with a Grass-type like Leech Seed Shaymin or Celebi. This Nidoqueen is still countered by Starmie, most variants of which Tyranitar will consistently trap. Tyranitar's Sand Stream also helps wear down opposing Pokemon. Weavile can also work effectively with specially defensive Nidoqueen, which effectively combats Heatran; in return, Weavile's Pursuit will be greatly beneficial to Nidoqueen, and the removal of Toxic Spikes will increase its longevity. Magnezone can pair well to trap Skarmory, but it must beware of Shed Shell and a compounded Ground-type weakness. Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A function as secondary Fighting-type answers and spinblockers for all of Nidoqueen's entry hazards; physically defensive Rotom-A synergizes especially well with specially defensive Nidoqueen. Anything that appreciates Toxic Spikes support, such as Protect users like Leech Seed Shaymin, Calm Mind Raikou, and Heatran, will pair well with Nidoqueen.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable’s powerful ability, Magic Guard, makes it an incredibly attractive option, rendering it immune to entry hazards, any residual damage, and even paralysis. Although Blissey, a similar Pokemon, has greater bulk, Clefable still has very good Special Defense, which is high enough to check almost all special attackers in the tier like Empoleon, Heatran, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. In addition, compared to Blissey, Clefable has some additional support moves like Knock Off and Encore.</p> <p>That said, Clefable still has a few weaknesses that can be exploited; namely, it is a passive Pokemon. Offensive momentum can overwhelm Clefable, and while its physical bulk is not awful by any means, many physical attackers are more than capable of getting rid of Clefable in one to two hits. Clefable is also vulnerable to setup sweepers with Lum Berry as well as Taunt users. Regardless of these flaws, Clefable fits onto a wide variety of teams, boasting a larger versatility than meets the eye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Like many other Normal-type Pokemon, Clefable has an astronomical movepool. Because of this versatility, it can perform many different unique roles. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be used to punish a physical attacker that comes in. Sing can be used to put opposing setup sweepers or entry hazard stackers to sleep. Clefable also makes for an effective cleric with Heal Bell. Another solid option on the support set is Reflect, which can combat Choice Band Tyranitar and other physical attackers simultaneously. Finally, Clefable can opt for Mail over Leftovers on certain sets like the Calm Mind set if there is a significant desire to be immune to Trick, but this is not generally recommended over the vast utility that Leftovers provides.</p> <p>On the more gimmicky side, Cosmic Power can be used on a set with Toxic, Seismic Toss, and Soft-Boiled to whittle down opposing Pokemon while becoming an absolute tank, but this needs the support of a Pursuit user that can reliably trap Gengar. Also, Cosmic Power can be used alongside Charge Beam, Ice Beam, and Soft-Boiled as an alternative to the Calm Mind set. Facade can be used with Toxic Orb, since Magic Guard will nullify the residual damage Toxic Orb usually causes. Clefable also can use Double-Edge with zero recoil, which is a decently powerful STAB move, and its immunity to Life Orb recoil allows it to potentially use a wallbreaking set with Trick Room support from teammates like Bronzong. A Focus Sash set could potentially be used with Endeavor, as Magic Guard will prevent it from taking hazard or residual damage that would otherwise mess with a mid-game Endeavor user. Healing Wish could be a decent option to support a wide variety of Pokemon. Finally, Belly Drum in theory could be used with Double Edge, Soft-Boiled, and Thunder Wave to threaten slower or stall-oriented builds, but this set would be extremely unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: All Fighting-types like Breloom, Gallade, Heracross, Infernape, Machamp, and Lucario can OHKO Clefable with their powerful Close Combat while finding opportunities to pivot in due to Clefable's passive movesets. While these Pokemon must watch out in particular for Thunder Wave, they often will be paired with Thunder Wave-immune choices like Flygon and other Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Any strong physical attacker will be a major threat to Clefable. Choice Band users like Dragonite, Gyarados, Flygon, Scizor, Swampert, and Tyranitar can OHKO or come very close to OHKOing all variants of Clefable. Beyond Choice Band users, Life Orb users and naturally strong physical attackers like Metagross, any variant of Tyranitar, Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite and Gyarados, and even physical Kingdra can all force Clefable out and do a ton of damage. Choice Band Scizor and Choice Band Tyranitar have the potential to hit Clefable with Pursuit as it switches out, which does a respectable amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Iron Head Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi can induce two or three Iron Head flinches on Clefable and get it down to very low health. Even the Calm Mind set with heavy defensive investment must be very careful when dealing with Jirachi. While it is tempting to try to get a Thunder Wave off, Clefable is unfavored in this matchup.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick Users</strong>: Aerodactyl, Azelf, Gengar, Gliscor, and Heatran are some of the more prominent Taunt users that can shut down Clefable's support moves, restricting it only to Seismic Toss usually and preventing Calm Mind Clefable from setting up. By using Taunt and preventing Clefable from healing, it can be chipped down and pressured very easily. Additionally, Clefable is quite susceptible to Trick from Choice item users like Jirachi, Latias, and Rotom-A. If you determine in battle that one of these Pokemon is holding a Choice item, be very cautious. Trick users themselves also have to be aware of losing their item to Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Seismic Toss and, if given the initiative, can use Substitute to prevent status. Gengar and Rotom-A are the most capable of these feats. Substitute + Pain Split Gengar can threaten Clefable with a very powerful Focus Blast and put it in a bad position. Rotom-A with Substitute or Rest can effectively stall out Clefable and force it to switch out, but the Substitute version must beware of Encore variants, as they will force Rotom-A out even from behind its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Choice Specs Users</strong>: The strongest of special attackers like Heatran, Kingdra, Vaporeon, and even Swampert can convincingly 2HKO Clefable if they use Choice Specs. While none of these Pokemon are capable of OHKOing the bulkiest of Clefable, Modest Heatran for example does 73.8 - 87% with a Choice Specs-boosted Overheat to fully specially defensive Clefable. Choice Specs Heatran is most typically seen in the lead position, so tread lightly with Clefable when facing a lead Heatran until you have confirmed it is not using Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Any Substitute user that is a Ghost-type or can make 101 HP Substitutes or greater can put a hard stop to Clefable and set up on it. Calm Mind users like Jirachi and Suicune can boost up to +6 if they are gaining health from Leftovers. Other variants of Substitute Jirachi like ones with Iron Head will similarly force Clefable out and can take it down through flinches if it decides to stay in. Special attackers, aside from Gengar, will be stopped by Encore, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This support set takes advantage of Clefable's unique traits and is extremely flexible when considering utility move choices in the first two slots. For the first slot, Thunder Wave is recommended because it can both support your own Pokemon as well as cripple your opponent's offensive threats. Alternatively, Clefable makes for a reliable Stealth Rock user because it can pressure Starmie and does a good job at maintaining Stealth Rock. Protect is a great way to scout out powerful Choice item Pokemon, making it easier to pivot reliably; namely, Clefable can make it extremely difficult for Choice Band Tyranitar—one of its best counters—to reliably trap it, eliminating the mind games between Pursuit and Superpower.</p> <p>In the second slot, Knock Off is highly recommended to compensate for Clefable's passiveness by pressuring the opposing team and making it much more difficult to switch into, as no Pokemon appreciates their item being removed. It's worth noting that besides Gliscor, Clefable is the main Knock Off user in the metagame. It can get rid of Choice Band or Life Orb users' items as they switch into Clefable, which will increase its effectiveness in game. Removing items also will assist in team prediction because you can often figure out the roles Pokemon take through their items.</p> <p>Another alternative option is Encore, which is an extremely versatile move that will thwart any attempts to set up with Dragon Dance sweepers and Calm Mind users. Encore pairs especially nicely with Thunder Wave, as Clefable is usually slower than the opposing Pokemon, so it can paralyze them and then move first the second turn, which makes Encore more reliable.</p> <p>Seismic Toss and Soft-Boiled are used to maximize Clefable's consistency. Seismic Toss will effectively damage a myriad of specially attacking threats that Clefable seeks to check, like Empoleon, Heatran, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled is a great instant recovery option to ensure that Clefable stays healthy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing HP and Special Defense with a Special Defense-boosting nature is essential for Clefable to make sure it can take special hits as well as possible. However, an alternative spread with a minimum of 32 Defense EVs can be used to ensure that Clefable always survives a neutral-natured Tyranitar's Superpower. Leftovers lets Clefable gain passive recovery even in sand and hail due to its unique ability and notably usually prevents it from being 2HKOed by the more powerful special attackers. If you'd like to crank up Clefable's physical bulk even further, 72 Defense EVs will allow it to never be 2HKOed by Adamant Flygon's Earthquake, making it more effective at dealing with the very common Choice Scarf Flygon. If using Knock Off, consider a Careful nature to have more damage output versus Gengar and Rotom-A, which is useful if either of these Pokemon opts for Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Clefable will often make a nice switch-in to Pokemon like lead Empoleon, Starmie, and Zapdos. If you see a lead Zapdos, be careful when sending in Clefable, however, because Modest Choice Specs Zapdos has a 47.7% chance to 2HKO non-Protect Clefable after Leftovers recovery. Also, it is likely Zapdos pivots out with U-turn early when it can potentially force a switch. If a Starmie comes in to spin Clefable's Stealth Rock away, try to remove its item if you have Knock Off; if not, paralyze it, and pressure it with Seismic Toss. You can introduce variation in your Stealth Rock timing to make it more difficult for your opponent to keep entry hazards off the field if Clefable does not have Thunder Wave to pressure Starmie. On teams without Tyranitar, Clefable will want to use Seismic Toss to burn Starmie's recovery. If you opt for Protect on Clefable, be careful not to use it excessively. Clefable is already quite a passive Pokemon, and your opponent can take advantage of it. If you see a Pokemon that is very likely to have a Choice item, be sure to use Protect to scout it out. If you use Encore, try your best to conserve its limited PP; be especially careful when using Encore on Pokemon with Pressure like Suicune and Zapdos, the former of which is one of the main targets of Encore. Hiding the fact that you have the move will often work effectively to surprise your opponent down the line. Try to observe the opponent's team and notice if they don't have anything that can effectively deal with Clefable. Oftentimes, Clefable can effectively wall out a large portion of teams. If you notice that their team looks a bit susceptible to Clefable, try your best to keep it healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When you're using Thunder Wave, slower offensive Pokemon like Breloom, Gyarados, Machamp, Metagross, Swampert, and Tyranitar pair very nicely with Clefable. In particular, Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf or Chople Berry variants, can use Pursuit to trap pesky Ghost-types like Rotom-A and Gengar that could take advantage of Clefable if it opts for Protect or Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Tyranitar's Sand Stream is very useful for Clefable to help whittle the opposing team down. Pokemon that use Substitute can take advantage of paralysis, like Jirachi, Gengar, and Breloom. Magnezone could be a great fit to take advantage of Skarmory, which may try to set up entry hazards on Clefable; Knock Off can even be used to remove a Shed Shell. Be careful, however, because by using Pokemon like Tyranitar and Magnezone, you compound a Fighting-type weakness. Latias is a great offensive teammate because it has amazing type synergy with Clefable, resisting both Breloom and Infernape's STAB attacks. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Latias can use Sleep Talk to absorb a Spore. The same is true of Dragonite's Sleep Talk Choice Band set; however, Infernape packs Hidden Power Ice on occasion, which will OHKO Dragonite without Yache Berry.</p> <p>Defensively, Pokemon like Celebi, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Zapdos all synergize well with Clefable. Celebi is a nice Fighting-type answer and physical wall that can also contribute to spreading paralysis. Gliscor will do well versus many physical attacks aimed at Clefable and provides a key Fighting-type switch-in, while Clefable can pivot into many special attacks aimed at Gliscor. Zapdos can pair with Clefable to also take Fighting-type attacks very well, and Pressure can assist in slowly wearing down the opposing team. The Substitute + Toxic Zapdos set gets a special mention because Toxic helps Clefable wear opposing Pokemon down via Soft-Boiled. Skarmory can set up entry hazards for Clefable and allow Seismic Toss to more effectively pressure the opposing team. If you opt for Encore, Clefable can act as a pseudo-phazer, forcing switches and increasing the effectiveness of Skarmory's Spikes. Nidoqueen gets a special mention, as physically defensive variants can do quite well versus physical Infernape, and specially defensive variants can deal better with the mixed attacking sets. Poison Point makes it harder for Infernape to use Close Combat and U-turn repeatedly. Nidoqueen can also lay Toxic Spikes to support Clefable. Beyond that, Nidoqueen is a great answer to Fighting-type Pokemon in general. The core of Tyranitar, Nidoqueen, and Clefable gets a special mention; Tyranitar sets up sand and can trap threats like Starmie and Ghost-types, Nidoqueen resists Fighting-type attacks and can set up entry hazards, and Clefable is a special tank. You can also pair Rotom-A, which is immune to Fighting, with this core to prevent Rapid Spin. While Latias makes a solid offensive teammate, it also pairs wonderfully with Clefable as a defensive teammate. A bulky variant with Thunder Wave and/or Reflect will make it even better at walling Fighting-types, and paralysis support will help Clefable, as it is slower than most Pokemon. A bulkier Calm Mind + Roar set will provide solid backup against other Calm Mind sweepers like Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, and CroCune, which tend to break through Clefable.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind, combined with Clefable's Magic Guard, turns it into a potent stallbreaker. Because Clefable is immune to residual damage from entry hazards and status—notably Toxic—stall-oriented teams usually have very little to combat it. With Soft-Boiled, Clefable can effectively alternate between increasing its Special Attack and Special Defense and instantly recovering its health. On top of that, Clefable has access to a plethora of special attacks that you can choose from based on the rest of the team. However, in particular, Thunderbolt combined with Ice Beam gives Clefable almost perfect coverage and a healthy number of PP to dismantle an entire opposing team.</p> <p>Beyond BoltBeam coverage being naturally effective in DPP, Ice Beam fits like a glove on Calm Mind Clefable, allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite. Also, Ice Beam can be used to chip Breloom with super effective damage. Thunderbolt fits amazingly on Calm Mind Clefable as well to threaten most Water-types; with multiple boosts, even the bulkiest of Water-types like non-Haze Milotic can be threatened with an OHKO. With Calm Mind Clefable's defensive investment, it can use Thunderbolt to soft check Gyarados, which cannot OHKO Clefable without a critical hit when unboosted.</p> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Thunderbolt to more effectively deal with Steel-types, especially Swords Dance Scizor, which can threaten Calm Mind Clefable by taking Thunderbolt well and reaching +2 Attack. However, this will make Clefable weaker to Water-types like Gyarados, Suicune, and Starmie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing HP and Defense works effectively because Clefable already has naturally good Special Defense, which it can boost even further with just one Calm Mind. In addition, this Clefable wants to take physical hits as well as possible. With maximum investment in Defense and its Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, Clefable can even serve as a soft check to Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Similarly, of course, with Flamethrower it would serve as a check to Swords Dance Scizor that lack Superpower. Alternatively, you can opt for an EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD with a Calm nature so an unboosted Clefable always takes less than 50% from a maximum Special Attack, neutral-natured Heatran's Fire Blast. This secondary EV spread also stays more true to Clefable's role as a special wall, if you wish to go that route. The set is rounded out with Leftovers to increase Clefable's longevity and help it better serve its purpose.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Clefable is unique in that unlike other Calm Mind sweepers, it isn't usually stashed as a last Pokemon. In fact, it usually enters the game quite early and uses one or two Calm Minds to put early pressure on the opponent. The set's longevity allows it to utilize the pressure-inducing asset of Calm Mind, combined with the fact that the move also has a generous number of PP. Ice Beam can add to the pressure by threatening to freeze certain checks like Haze Milotic and Pokemon with Roar or Whirlwind. Try to initially bait in a Pokemon like Skarmory before revealing Thunderbolt or Ice Beam if you've scouted it out prior, as oftentimes Skarmory will use Clefable to get entry hazards up. Although it's been mentioned that you can use Calm Mind early to put pressure on your opponent, keeping the set unrevealed can also be effective in surprising Gyarados or Dragonite with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam. If Clefable is at full, it can pivot reliably into Gyarados before it uses Dragon Dance. Sometimes, the Gyarados will even attempt to use Taunt to set up more Dragon Dances, and you can shut it down with Thunderbolt. Calm Mind Clefable has enough physical and special bulk to pivot into many different Pokemon; some examples are Celebi, Starmie, Suicune, and weaker physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Clefable dislikes facing most Steel-type Pokemon like Bronzong, Metagross, Jirachi, Scizor, and some variants of Skarmory, so a Fire-type Pokemon like Heatran could be a good pairing. Hippowdon generates sand through its Sand Stream, which Clefable appreciates to help wear opposing Pokemon down, and also matches up well versus Metagross and Jirachi. Tyranitar is another option, but beware of compounding a Fighting-type weakness. Skarmory can be used to handle most Steel-types and gets a special mention because Clefable matches up well versus Heatran, one of the only Steel-type Pokemon Skarmory always detests. Calm Mind Clefable is good at forcing switches, so the Spikes support also will be particularly effective. Similarly, Toxic Spikes also works wonderfully with Calm Mind Clefable, as its instant recovery move in Soft-Boiled and overall bulk will allow Clefable to stall out a large number of poisoned Pokemon. Nidoqueen and Roserade both fit the bill, and both Pokemon resist Fighting, which can be helpful for Clefable; however, Roserade needs significant Defense investment to properly take physical Fighting-type attacks. While Clefable can handle most Heatran effectively, some variants with Magma Storm and Taunt can be troubling, so having backup for Heatran is important. Magnezone can trap most of the Steel-types that give Calm Mind Clefable trouble. Defensively, Celebi, Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos will pair well with Calm Mind Clefable. Latias doesn't need to use Roar as much on other Calm Mind sweepers, since Calm Mind Clefable will handle most of them well, but it is still useful for Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi and will pair well with the entry hazards that Clefable appreciates. A more offensive Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Latias with Sleep Talk is very good at handling Breloom, which Calm Mind Clefable dislikes if it cannot punish its entry with an Ice Beam.</p>"
      },
      "Wish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magic Guard sets Clefable apart as a Wish user. Clefable can enter into entry hazards without taking damage, and barring direct attacks it can switch in an indefinite number of times while getting a turn of Leftovers recovery each time, which can be especially effective for Wish passing versus stall-oriented builds. The consistent damage from Seismic Toss means that Clefable has more than enough room to run both Wish and Protect as well as a more flexible option for the last slot.</p> <p>Protect is a mandatory move with Wish Clefable because it cannot sustain itself without an instant recovery move. On top of that, Protect's general utility for stalling out opponents and properly scouting Choice item users is very powerful when using a more passive Pokemon.</p> <p>Knock Off is highly recommended to make it more difficult to switch into Clefable, allowing it to more freely use Wish. In addition, it helps tremendously to compensate for Clefable's passivity. Encore can be used as an alternative to force opposing Pokemon out, create more opportunities to use Wish, and prevent Clefable from being overly passive by stopping setup sweepers in their tracks. Reliably answering Pokemon like CroCune, Calm Mind Jirachi, and opposing Calm Mind Clefable is a really unique trait.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximize HP and Special Defense investment lets Clefable function as a sturdy special wall. An alternative would be to use 32 EVs in Defense to always survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Superpower. With Protect, is it less important to hit a benchmark like Adamant Flygon's Earthquake, since Clefable can gain more Leftovers recovery and consistently stall out the Earthquakes. Leftovers is used in conjunction with Protect to maximize Clefable's potential as a Wish user.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Assuming that you are using this Clefable on a more defensive build, you have the freedom to play more aggressively with your other Pokemon. As always with Encore, try to save the PP for as long as possible and only use it in case of an emergency unless you are feeling comfortable in your position and want to gain momentum. Since Wish Clefable has maximum HP and Special Defense, it can come into almost all special attackers with ease. Early-game, if Clefable is healthy, try to use Seismic Toss initially and reveal Wish for when you need it. If your opponent catches on to the fact that you're using Wish, they can turn up the aggression and try to take advantage of Clefable likely not carrying Thunder Wave. Revealing Protect is completely fine and does not necessarily indicate that Clefable has Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Wish Clefable usually finds itself on more defensive builds, it is recommended to pair it with defensive Pokemon that appreciate Wish support; Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards such as Nidoqueen, Milotic, Swampert, and Tentacruel will benefit tremendously from the consistent Wishes that Clefable passes. Additionally, these Pokemon all synergize well defensively with Clefable. Milotic, Swampert, and Tentacruel can all deal with Infernape, while the former two can also check Metagross. Nidoqueen and Tentacruel both provide a Fighting resistance, which brings type synergy into play as well. Skarmory and Toxic Spikes users are of course fantastic fits with Wish Clefable, as stalling out the opposing team with Toxic Spikes support is something that Wish Clefable specializes in. Beyond Pokemon that specifically appreciate the Wish support, the usual defensive synergies apply to Wish Clefable as well. Pokemon like Celebi, Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos pair excellently with Clefable. Celebi and Zapdos will also appreciate the Wish support, since Celebi is considered vulnerable to hazards, and Zapdos is weak to Stealth Rock, increasing the ease of pivoting these Pokemon in. An offensive variant of Latias that can't heal itself will be able to take advantage of Clefable's Wish support as well with its wonderful typing and near-perfect synergy with Clefable. Sleep Talk Latias can help to counter Breloom, which would be painful for Wish Clefable to face unless it is Substitute + Focus Punch and has already put something to sleep.</p> <p>In general, Pokemon that have good Defense but weaker Special Defense can create opportunities for Clefable to pivot in and provide Wish support. Metagross is a good example that also appreciates Wish support. If you use Iron Ball Metagross, you can bait Rotom-A in and cripple it by grounding it.</p> <p>Wish Clefable, like all other variants, appreciates Sand Stream support. Tyranitar and Hippowdon provide exactly that for Clefable, but make sure when using Clefable and Tyranitar together to account for the Fighting-type weakness. Wish Clefable is also weak to Pokemon that can exploit its passivity. Ghost-types like Gengar and Rotom-A are not threatened much by the Encore version; Gengar can use Taunt and completely shut this Clefable down. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a great choice for trapping these pesky Ghost-types with Pursuit. Wish Clefable can in turn provide Tyranitar with healing.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Four generations have passed since Alakazam's glory days in RBY, and each one has brought something new to spite it, while giving it almost nothing back in return. GSC's special split not only ruined Alakazam's special bulk, but also made Snorlax a more potent foe, and also added Blissey and Tyranitar to the fray. ADV added abilities, which improved just about every Pokemon in the game except Alakazam, and also introduced Choice Band, which increased the strength of the physical attackers that Alakazam hates. It was DPP, however, that gave Alakazam the final push into obscurity, with the introduction of Choice Scarf to undermine Alakazam's godlike Speed, the physical / special split to make both Pursuit and the elemental punches physical, and of course the rise of the ubiquitous Technician Scizor, in which Alakazam has at last met its match. Additionally, for the first time since its introduction, Alakazam became close-to-outclassed by a non-Uber Pokemon, Azelf, who has slightly lower Speed and Special Attack, but an arguably better movepool that most notably includes Nasty Plot. While its old rivals Gengar and Starmie still get by on their slightly larger movepools and better typings, Alakazam lacks the necessary traits to be a special sweeper in this metagame. Primarily, it lacks notable resistances, priority moves, and usable setup moves. Furthermore, it is as frail as a glass thimble and its STAB is resisted by half the OU metagame, all of which combine to make it less than half the threat it used to be.</p> <p>However, do not be so hasty as to condemn it to disuse. While the metagame seems to have passed it by, Alakazam still has all the traits that made it so good back in the day: its titanic base 135 Special Attack stat, the highest of any non-Uber Pokemon, as well as its equally impressive base 120 Speed stat, which allows it to outrun nearly the entirety of the unboosted OU metagame. Aside from raw power, however, Alakazam is also known for its plethora of annoying tricks in Encore, Trick, and Taunt. All in all, when played correctly, Alakazam can become as threatening as any other offensive Pokemon. It might have fallen from grace, but popularity is by no means a definition of power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam is nothing if not versatile, and it has a massive number of appealing tricks up its sleeve. Taunt and Encore have already been mentioned, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Alakazam is the fastest user of dual screens in OU, and can easily set up with the help of Taunt. Trick is an excellent move and is useful on Choice sets, but this is no longer Alakazam's trademark as Rotom-A does this more effectively; furthermore, it leaves Alakazam as Pursuit bait for Tyranitar and Scizor. Thunder Wave is another useful move to support the team with, but because of Alakazam's blistering Speed, it can rarely take advantage of paralyzed opponents. Knock Off is much the same; as fun as it might be to deprive Scizor and Tyranitar of their Choice items, it is generally not worth the moveslot. Of all the field effects Alakazam gets, Gravity is perhaps the most notable, as it improves the accuracy of Focus Blast and also supports the team.</p> <p>On the offensive side, Calm Mind is an interesting setup move that can be used on Alakazam's sweeper set in place of--or even in addition to--Substitute, but a setup sweeper Alakazam is stopped too easily by phazers and Blissey to be effective. Lum Berry lets Alakazam absorb otherwise crippling status, but the loss in power from Life Orb is considerable. Lastly, Recover can offset lost health from Substitute, Life Orb, sandstorm, and other residual damage, but this compromises Alakazam's type coverage and it has many better options to run in that moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Alakazam's fall hinged on the metagame packing everything Alakazam hates--strong special walls and a multitude of physical attackers. Of all potential counters to Alakazam, Blissey is by far the most solid, as it can take a Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast with ease and recover health with Soft-Boiled or Wish. However, Alakazam can employ Trick, Taunt, Recover, and Encore to beat Blissey, so be on your guard. Snorlax can also take most special attacks and has access to Pursuit and Return, but can be 2HKOed by Life Orb Focus Blast with a little residual damage.</p> <p>Scizor walks all over Alakazam if the latter lacks Substitute. If Scizor switches in and Alakazam does not have a Substitute up, Scizor essentially traps it entirely--if Alakazam stays in, it risks getting KOed by Bullet Punch, but if it switches out, it can be KOed by Pursuit. Furthermore, Scizor can also use U-turn to annihilate Alakazam and escape from its counter all in one stroke. Similarly, Choice Scarf Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Heatran, can switch in to revenge kill, but they risk a super effective attack on the switch. In fact, all of the Steel-types that typically switch into Alakazam--especially Scizor--should be mindful of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>If Alakazam lacks Shadow Ball or Signal Beam, Starmie beats it soundly between Recover and its attacking options. Weavile is another nasty threat despite its rarity, as it is immune to Psychic and is one of the few Pokemon naturally faster than Alakazam; it can then OHKO Alakazam with Pursuit regardless of whether it stays in or switches out. Tyranitar also deserves a mention in this regard as it can act as a last-minute check if Focus Blast misses. Alakazam will generally faint to any attack, so just about any faster Pokemon can revenge kill it; however, outside of Choice Scarf users, Pokemon that naturally outspeed Alakazam are few and far between.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>While Alakazam has fallen out of favor as an offensive Pokemon, it is still one of the strongest special attackers in the game. Unlike its fellow Psychic-types Starmie and Azelf, Alakazam can outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which enables it to not only bypass an otherwise rock-solid check to Psychic-types, but also act as an excellent lure by removing these problematic Pokemon with a combination of Substitute and one of its coverage moves.</p> <p>Substitute enables Alakazam to scout its opponent, hit the switch-in with the appropriate attack, block status moves from the likes of Blissey, and escape from Pursuit traps set by opponents such as Weavile and Scizor. Alakazam's tendency to force switches makes it relatively easy to get a Substitute up; however, remember that Alakazam will be losing a great deal of health to passive damage, so Substitute should generally be used sparingly. Psychic is good reliable STAB that has the power to 2HKO just about everything that does not resist it outside of Blissey and Snorlax. Focus Blast gets rid of the Dark-types that are immune to Alakazam's STAB attacks, as well as the Steel-types that can cause problems. It easily OHKOes Tyranitar and Heatran, and does a fair amount to Blissey and Snorlax. However, many of OU's common Steel-types, such as Scizor, Metagross, and Skarmory, take only neutral damage from Focus Blast, and given how dangerous these Pokemon are to Alakazam, it is necessary to have a way to take them out quickly. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Scizor and, with Life Orb, cleanly 2HKOes Jirachi, Celebi, and Metagross. On the other hand, Signal Beam enables Alakazam to hit Psychic-types, such as Starmie, Azelf, and Celebi, and also grants it a more reliable hit on Dark-types. Unfortunately, the loss of Hidden Power Fire is a crippling blow to Alakazam's effectiveness against Steel-types.</p> <p>Alakazam should look to maximizing its Speed and Special Attack, as these are the only two stats it will be using. A Timid nature is recommended as Alakazam simply cannot afford to take a hit from anything. However, note that the IV drop from Hidden Power Fire prevents Alakazam from Speed tying with other base 120s. Therefore, you might wish to lower your sights to hit the next-lowest Speed benchmark, and dump the rest in HP. A Timid nature and 228 Speed EVs is advised as a minimum to beat out Jolly Choice Scarf Tyranitar, who is the biggest threat Alakazam will face in this area. Life Orb is the recommended item despite Alakazam's vulnerability to passive damage, as it gives Alakazam the power necessary to OHKO dangerous threats such as Tyranitar and Heatran. On the other hand, Leftovers is useful to offset Substitute and residual damage, but the loss in power is quite crippling.</p> <p>If you dislike Substitute's residual damage, there are a number of other options that are worth mentioning in that slot. Encore and Taunt are both useful stallbreaking moves, while Protect can let Alakazam scout Choice-locked Scizor's move. Alakazam can run Shadow Ball in the third slot, not only for coverage on Psychic-types, but also to smack Ghost-types super effectively. Specifically, it enables Alakazam to OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-A with Stealth Rock support. Remember that without Substitute or Protect, Alakazam is much more susceptible to being revenge killed. If you do not mind losing out on a bit of type coverage, Alakazam can even forgo an attack to run both Substitute and Encore to more easily take advantage of Encore, as the protection of Substitute lets Alakazam Encore attacking moves with less risk.</p> <p>Substitute Alakazam makes an excellent lure for many problematic Pokemon, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Heatran, as well as non-Choice Scarf Jirachi and Celebi, because it can OHKO all of them with one of its coverage attacks. With this in mind, it pairs well with setup sweepers that will benefit from the weakening or removal of these Pokemon. One such example is Swords Dance Breloom, who can also support Alakazam through Spore and the ability to frighten away Blissey. Other good teammates are Pokemon with good offensive synergy with Alakazam. Steel-types are generally the biggest obstacles to Alakazam; Magnezone can easily trap and destroy Scizor and Jirachi Choice-locked into their STAB moves. However, be wary of Steel-types that have super effective STAB moves, namely Lucario and Heatran. Swampert is a good partner as it can take on both Tyranitar and Metagross, and also check Scizor to an extent. Heatran works in much the same way, but forfeits the ability to beat Tyranitar in exchange for the ability to maul just about every Steel-type that exists.</p> <p>You will also want a physical attacker or two on your team to overcome Blissey, as well as a way to beat down Pursuit users; good picks for this role include Fighting-types such as Machamp. Dragon Dance Gyarados is another good option as a late-game sweeper as it can set up on Choice-locked Steel-type moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Jirachi's Iron Head. Similarly, Tyranitar and Lucario can set up very easily on Choice-locked Pursuit. Lastly, Tyranitar and Scizor can be helpful allies to Encore variants of Alakazam; should it manage to Encore a non-offensive move, such as Blissey's Soft-Boiled, the aforementioned Pokemon can take the opportunity to trap it with Pursuit. Tyranitar and Scizor are also helpful in beating Psychic-types such as Starmie, who might cause Alakazam trouble.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos has an excellent typing, both offensively and defensively, which boasts resistances and immunities to the most common attacks of top-tier OU threats such as Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, and Flygon. Electric-type is phenomenal offensively, as it hits the majority of the metagame with neutral damage. Although Zapdos's Stealth Rock weakness limits its walling capabilities, Roost and Rapid Spin support help combat that problem. Zapdos is capable of taking on many of the OU tier's top physical and special threats thanks to its all-around great stats and typing. Its high Special Attack and good Speed allow it to perform wonderfully in an offensive role, and it has great coverage options in Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ice, and Hidden Power Grass. It can also use U-turn to function as a fantastic pivot, taking advantage of its defensive capabilities to open up safe switches for its teammates. Unfortunately, Zapdos struggles with the ever-popular Tyranitar, Nidoqueen, Latias, and Clefable, four of the strongest defensive options in the tier, although this can be remedied with proper team support. Zapdos is one of the most difficult Pokemon to counter in OU overall, as its generous movepool and great assets are near unparalleled on paper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zapdos can utilize a Choice Scarf set to serve as a decent revenge killer; however, its Stealth Rock weakness significantly hinders it, and it faces competiton with bulkier sets, which still provide decent insurance versus Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite, as well as Swords Dance Lucario. Zapdos is also a sturdy user of Rain Dance, and can take advantage of it with a 100% accurate STAB Thunder off one of the highest Special Attack stats in OU. Thunder Wave is a good choice to support a slower team, especially one with a slow sweeper like Machamp. Protect is a great move that combines with Pressure to whittle down its foe's PP and also wear them down with residual damage from sand and poison. Charge Beam can be used to boost Zapdos's Special Attack, but it has a hard time replacing moves like Roost, Agility, and U-turn. Zapdos is also capable of utilizing a Metal Sound set, but it requires entry hazards to maximize its effectiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Tyranitar, Clefable, and Blissey check Zapdos very well. Tyranitar must watch out for Toxic, and less bulky variants must watch out for Choice Specs or Life Orb Zapdos. However, Tyranitar usually forces Zapdos out with the threat of a powerful Stone Edge or Crunch. Clefable and Blissey don't care as much about Toxic because of their Magic Guard and Natural Cure. Latias is also a fantastic offensive and defensive check to Zapdos, as its monstrous natural Special Defense enables it to shrug off most of Zapdos' attacks with ease. Specially defensive Heatran can take Zapdos's Electric-type attacks quite well and fire back with moves like Lava Plume and Toxic, but doesn't want to be paralyzed by Discharge. Although very niche, Snorlax has monstrous HP and Special Defense, and it can threaten to paralyze Zapdos with Body Slam or remove it with Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert and Hippowdon don't mind most of Zapdos's attacks, but both must watch out for Toxic; Swampert also has to be cautious of Hidden Power Grass. Otherwise, these Pokemon can take advantage of Zapdos and set up Stealth Rock, use Roar to phaze other foes, or fire an Ice-type attack to wear Zapdos down. Nidoqueen is immune to Thunder Wave and Toxic, but without investment in Special Defense, Hidden Power Ice can wear it down. Still, it can take advantage of Zapdos and set up Toxic Spikes or use Ice Beam to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou resists Thunderbolt and doesn't mind any of Zapdos's other attacking moves; however, it must watch out for Toxic or the rarer Thunder Wave. It outspeeds Zapdos, it can set up Calm Mind, and it can use its strong Thunderbolt to deal significant damage. Jolteon's Volt Absorb enables it to switch into Zapdos quite easily and threaten it with Choice Specs-boosted attacks. RestTalk Rotom-A completely walls Zapdos and can threaten it with Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With only two weaknesses, good stats overall, Roost for recovery, and Pressure to waste opponents' PP, this Zapdos makes a great tank. Its Electric-type STAB move is its go-to attacking option, which will hurt even with no EV investment thanks to Zapdos's base 125 Special Attack. Use Thunderbolt for a bit more power, or use Discharge to have a higher chance of inflicting paralysis on foes like Latias, Tyranitar, and Jirachi.</p> <p>Zapdos can run Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice, losing super effective coverage on Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite, but gaining the ability to beat one of its biggest counters, Swampert. If you decide to use U-turn or Toxic, use Hidden Power Ice for better type coverage.</p> <p>Heat Wave OHKOes Scizor, who might otherwise Roost off the damage dealt by a neutral Thunderbolt, as well as other Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Magnezone. The 32 Speed EVs let Zapdos outrun max Speed non-Scarf Tyranitar. U-turn is a fantastic option for pivoting against foes like Tyranitar, Latias, and Clefable. Toxic hits Swampert without having to use Hidden Power Grass, and also works effectively against Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Rotom-A.</p> <p>Zapdos has some other interesting options like Roar and Protect. Roar is useful when combined with entry hazards and also as a backup for phazing setup sweepers. Protect can be used in tandem with Toxic Spikes and Pressure to make Zapdos even more effective at wearing down its foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to enable Zapdos to enter into Stealth Rock one extra time, in case it cannot heal its health and sand is up. 32 Speed EVs are used to outpace maximum Speed Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs are poured into Defense to make Zapdos as physically bulky as possible. Leftovers is important for preserving Zapdos's health as well as possible given its fragility due to Stealth Rock. Zapdos can also run a Relaxed nature with U-turn to more effectively pivot; an example EV spread would be 248 HP / 252 Spe / 8 SpD. Note that it should not run negative Speed IVs with Relaxed, as then it gets outsped by Machamp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zapdos is an effective early-game scouter because it has so few counters, so it can force many switches. Take advantage of Stealth Rock not being up and send Zapdos in when you can. Given its amazing defensive typing and stats, Zapdos can come in with relative safety against various OU tanks, walls, and sweepers. From there, it can stall out its opponents with Roost, or deal some damage with its variety of attacking options. Be careful when using Roost, as Zapdos becomes vulnerable to Ground-type attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even though this Zapdos makes a great defensive addition to any team, it's fairly easy to wall. As with most special attackers, it is effectively countered by Clefable, Blissey, and specially defensive Tyranitar. A Pursuit user can help to deal chip damage to Clefable and Blissey; Tyranitar is a perfect candidate for this thanks to its sky-high Attack and access to Superpower. Zapdos also has issues with Stealth Rock, making a Rapid Spinner, such as Starmie, very beneficial.</p> <p>Other counters to Zapdos vary depending on which moves you choose. Swampert can easily stop any Zapdos that lacks Hidden Power Grass, while Celebi does not fear Zapdos that lack Heat Wave. A Celebi of your own can take almost all of Swampert's attacks with ease and force it out with the threat of a Grass-type move. Nidoqueen, especially specially defensive variants, can be extremely difficult for Zapdos to overcome, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Ice.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Zapdos's best way of annoying the opponent is stalling their Pokemon out with Substitute and Roost while wearing them down with Thunderbolt, and it does quite a good job at it. This set can be used effectively in conjunction with Toxic Spikes, accumulating poison damage on some of Zapdos's usual switch-ins while taking advantage of Pressure to waste your opponent's PP. Common victims of this strategy include Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Rotom-A. Substitute and Roost, when used wisely, will block status and keep Zapdos at high health.</p> <p>Almost all Flying-type Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes will fall to Zapdos's STAB-boosted Thunderbolt, or in Gliscor, Dragonite, and Flygon's case, Hidden Power Ice. Using Hidden Power Ice forms BoltBeam coverage that Zapdos can abuse heavily, especially from behind a Substitute. Toxic is also a viable option in the last slot if you decide to not run this set alongside Toxic Spikes, though it is recommended that you do. Toxic has additional usefulness in poisoning Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes, namely Pokemon with Levitate, such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. However, losing out on Hidden Power Ice makes Zapdos completely unable to touch Nidoqueen, and Taunt Gliscor may be a bit more difficult to deal with. Thankfully, other than Heatran, Magnezone, and bulky variants of Jirachi, very few Steel-type Pokemon can reliably switch in against this Zapdos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The above EVs maximize Zapdos's Speed while enabling it to survive a +2 Life Orb-boosted Extreme Speed from Lucario after Stealth Rock. Optionally, Zapdos can reduce its speed to as low as 300 in favor of more HP and additional physical bulk. 192 HP enables Zapdos to use Substitute one extra time from full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Zapdos can be used either in the lead slot or midgame. As a lead, it can use Substitute against Pokemon like Metagross, Hippowdon, Roserade, and even Azelf. If it has Toxic, use it on the first turn to catch Hippowdon off guard as it sets up Stealth Rock. Use Substitute to block status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave; Jirachi's Body Slam has an extremely low chance to break Zapdos's Substitute, so it can also prevent paralysis in that regard. Zapdos can also get a free Substitute if it comes in on a Choice-locked Ground-type move, such as Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since the aim of this set is to stall, this Zapdos works best when paired with Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes and matches up well against Tyranitar, but it also compounds an Ice-type weakness. Tentacruel resists Ice-type attacks aimed at Zapdos, can set up Toxic Spikes, and can use Rapid Spin to assist Zapdos further. Zapdos also appreciates Spikes support from Skarmory, as Zapdos can force many switches and the extra chip damage from Spikes can make a huge difference in its ability to KO a foe. Starmie is the most consistent spinner in OU, and has strong synergy with Zapdos. Bronzong can assist Zapdos in spreading Toxic to foes like Hippowdon and Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Specs Zapdos is a huge threat that boasts the most powerful Thunderbolt in OU. Hidden Power Flying is Zapdos's best Flying-type STAB attack, which maims Fighting- and Grass-types like Machamp, Heracross, Celebi, Shaymin, and Breloom. Hidden Power Ice is a solid alternative for increased damage on Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Gliscor as well as Dragon-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Flygon. However, Hidden Power Flying still deals solid damage to all of these Pokemon. Heat Wave covers Steel-types like Magnezone, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong. Sleep Talk is an alternative to Heat Wave that enables Zapdos to function as a sleep absorber, which is effective because all the moves Sleep Talk can call will be threatening; furthermore, it can switch into Roserade and Breloom with relative ease when healthy, and it can stay in more confidently versus lead Roserade. Although U-turn is a physical attack, it's a great move to round out the set. Zapdos will often force switches, and it can use U-turn to pivot out and send teammates in safely. This can work well against foes like Tyranitar and specially defensive Jirachi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is recommended because it maximizes Zapdos's Special Attack while still letting Zapdos outspeed foes like Rotom-A, Suicune, and even Gallade. A Timid nature is a decent alternative to get the jump on Gliscor, Jirachi, Roserade, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, but the reduced power usually isn't worth it. If you're using Hidden Power Ice, move the 4 HP EVs into Defense, as Hidden Power Ice's lack of an HP IV drop means they are no longer needed to minimize Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Zapdos can make for an extremely effective lead, OHKOing foes like most Colbur Berry Azelf, Lum Berry Machamp, Skarmory, Gyarados, and Lum Berry Metagross. In addition, it deals significant damage to many common leads like Heatran, Jirachi, and even Swampert. Be mindful that Zapdos will also force out leads like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Gyarados, and lead Flygon will most certainly use U-turn. Take advantage of this and consider using U-turn to scout out the opponent's switch-ins to Zapdos while also gaining momentum. If their switch is not a Ground-type, you can likely determine that Thunderbolt will be an effective move to use once Zapdos is sent in again. Zapdos, especially without Leftovers and defensive investment, is incredibly fragile, so it's especially important to pick your spots. Try sending it in on bad Choice-locked moves like Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake and Choice Scarf Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos is incredibly good at ripping holes in the opposing team fairly early, so offensive threats that appreciate Zapdos's ability to do that are recommended. Agility Metagross pairs very well with Zapdos, as Zapdos can make quick work of bulky Water-types like Milotic, Starmie, and Suicune and chip away at Swampert with Hidden Power Flying, which Metagross desperately wants gone or worn down significantly before it can clean. An offensive variant of Starmie can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and threaten irritating Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert. Breloom is a potent offensive partner that can severely punish Hippowdon, Swampert, Blissey, and Clefable. Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Flygon can be used together or separately in tandem with Zapdos to form a U-turn chain, which can put constant pressure on the opposing team. Scizor's Bullet Punch is incredibly useful to hit faster threats like Choice Scarf Flygon, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. It can also use Pursuit to hit Clefable on the switch, which can put it in range for Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Tyranitar, much like Scizor, can use Pursuit to chip Blissey and Clefable, set up Stealth Rock, and check Starmie. In turn, Zapdos can switch into Breloom, resist both its STAB attacks, and even absorb Spore if it uses Sleep Talk. If you're using Starmie and Breloom, Heatran can complete a Fire / Water / Grass core and provide utility through its Steel typing and Flash Fire. Magma Storm Heatran can trap and remove Hippowdon, Clefable, Blissey, and Swampert with Explosion—or, in Swampert's case, Hidden Power Grass—paving the way for Zapdos to clean.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Zapdos can run a specially defensive set thanks to its fantastic defensive typing, allowing it to take special attacks that would usually force it out. Therefore, Zapdos is able to put pressure on the opposing team with its special bulk that allows it to survive the most powerful special attacks of the tier including Draco Meteor from Dragonite, Kingdra, Latias, and Flygon, Overheat from Choice Specs Heatran, and other strong special attacks from Starmie, Gengar, Empoleon, and Infernape. Then, Zapdos is able to retaliate quite hard, since most special attackers are frail or can heal off the damage depending on the situation. On the other hand, if Zapdos is healthy enough, its natural physical bulk with HP investment is sufficient to let it act as a decent switch-in to Fighting- and Steel-type Pokemon, giving it the ability to reasonably check a great portion of the metagame including foes like Jirachi, Scizor, Metagross, Lucario, and Breloom.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is the standard option for a primary attack, especially if Zapdos is coupled with status inducers, mainly those with access to Toxic Spikes, and the move's higher power compared to Discharge can be valuable if you are scared to fail to finish off a weakened Kingdra or Machamp. However, Discharge remains a very nice option thanks to its 30% paralysis rate, which can potentially cripple threats that can check bulky Zapdos such as Tyranitar, Latias, and Heatran. Hidden Power Ice and an Electric-type coverage move create a pseudo-BoltBeam combo that hits almost every Pokemon in the metagame for neutral damage. Hidden Power Ice also allows Zapdos to better handle Gliscor and Dragon-types, which would otherwise benefit from its lack of coverage. Also, specially defensive Zapdos does extremely well versus mixed Dragon-types, which is why it makes such great use of the move. Heat Wave is useful to hit Steel- and Grass-type foes such as Metagross, Jirachi, Lucario, Celebi, and Breloom for a more consequential portion of damage than Hidden Power Ice or neutral Thunderbolt would. Roost allows Zapdos to restore 50% of its health in one turn, which helps on such a defensive Pokemon. Alternatively, Roar deals with Calm Mind users, such as Suicune and Jirachi, which can easily handle Zapdos's uninvested Thunderbolts.</p> <p>Status-inducing moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave are also great options to consider. Toxic is viable if you decide not to run this set alongside Toxic Spikes, as it can cripple Tyranitar and common Ground-types switch-ins like Swampert or Hippowdon, while Thunder Wave works decently well on paralysis centric archetypes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Zapdos's HP and Special Defense, helping Zapdos switch into weak special moves like non-STAB Ice Beam, uninvested Thunderbolt, or and Surf after Stealth Rock damage with much more ease. On top of that, it allows Zapdos to decently check threats like Gengar, Starmie, and mixed Infernape. Also, Zapdos can survive the most powerful special attacks of the tier such as Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat, Latias's Draco Meteor, and Torrent, rain, or Calm Mind-boosted Hydro Pump or Ice Beam from Empoleon, Kingdra, and Suicune. It is important to remember that using 248 HP EVs is more beneficial than fully maximizing HP, since that allows Zapdos to switch into Stealth Rock five times instead of four. 32 Speed EVs let Zapdos outrun maximum Speed non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Leftovers is the item of choice for a defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, making it match up significantly better versus Iron Head Jirachi, which may otherwise have an easier time chipping down Zapdos and causing it to flinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Zapdos onto the field against a foe it can threaten, heal off the damage with Roost until it's at full HP, and repeat. Because of Discharge's nice paralysis chance, it's often a good idea to spam the move; Pokemon that can otherwise absorb Zapdos's uninvested special attacks like Latias, Heatran, and Tyranitar have a harder time when paralyzed. Remember to take advantage of Pressure when possible. Zapdos's ability to just use Roost over and over in the face of attacks makes it much easier to PP stall foes that use moves like Focus Blast, Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Specially defensive Zapdos can be played as a lead thanks to its dual typing, which provides it with a good matchup against special attacking leads such as Empoleon, Heatran, Dragonite, and even opposing Zapdos while doing a great job against leads that have type disadvantages like Metagross and Jirachi, even if the EV spread is not meant to beat them. If Zapdos is played as a lead, consider running U-turn, as it can potentially keep momentum against leads that Zapdos naturally scares out such as Gyarados, Gliscor, and Starmie and frail Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Flygon. Also, you should probably run Heat Wave instead of Hidden Power Ice, as it is able to land a clean 2HKO on lead non-Occa Berry Metagross, which is important in preventing it from getting off a free Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock. Also, Discharge has a small chance of not damaging Empoleon enough to where it would be boosted by Torrent. Keep in mind that specially defensive Zapdos can have trouble switching into popular, primarily physical types like Fighting, Bug, and Steel, whereas it hardly has any resistances to the common special types such as Dragon, Water, Fire, and Electric.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Zapdos fits well on both balanced and stall teams alike, coveted for its fairly useful set of targets that it can shut down. In terms of teammates, Starmie can provide useful Rapid Spin support. It can also act as a secondary switch-in to Fighting-types and absorb status aimed at Zapdos thanks to Natural Cure. Clefable and Tyranitar wall this set; therefore, Machamp, Scizor, Tyranitar, and Jirachi are very good partners to help cover Zapdos's weakness to those Pokemon. Breloom is helpful to break through stall reliant archetypes, which give this set trouble. Toxic Spikes support is a great complement to this set, since Zapdos's counters are usually grounded. Roserade and Nidoqueen are great partners for this reason. Roserade can also handle status ailments aimed at Zapdos, while Nidoqueen can decently check Tyranitar. It is also important to note that this set will have difficulty checking powerful physical threats due to Zapdos's lower Defense stat, so make sure to back it up appropriately with additional Fighting-resistant and physically bulky Pokemon as teammates. Gliscor and Latias are both great Fighting-resistant Pokemon that can help Zapdos in the long term. Latias does well at supporting teams that have trouble against Breloom while Gliscor can stallbreak archetypes that contain Skarmory and Clefable and check Tyranitar. Physically defensive Swampert can set up Stealth Rock and do very well versus Tyranitar, while Zapdos can switch into most Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert. Physically defensive Skarmory also has great defensive synergy with specially defensive Zapdos and Spikes to compensate for Zapdos's minimal investment in Special Attack.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility gives Zapdos a 2x Speed boost, which makes it devastating against offensive builds and can allow it to be a good late-game cleaner once its checks have been sufficiently weakened or eliminated. Hidden Power Ice gives Zapdos pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, enabling it to hit most Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types super effectively. This nearly perfect coverage helps Zapdos sweep easily late-game. Hidden Power Flying, on the other hand, can be utilized as a secondary form of STAB that hits Grass- and Fighting-types like Shaymin, Celebi, Breloom, Roserade, Machamp, and Infernape harder while also giving Zapdos a safe move to use against cores that include Electric-type switch-ins and lack Flying-type ones. However, its coverage is slightly worse overall. Roost allows Zapdos to better check Pokemon like Breloom, Scizor, and Gliscor. Heat Wave can be used over Roost to hit Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong as well as Mamoswine harder. However, dropping Roost makes Zapdos lose overall longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outrun neutral-natured Kingdra in rain as well as base 115 Speed Choice Scarf users after an Agility boost. Maximum Special Attack investment in tandem with a Modest nature allows Zapdos to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are put into HP for general bulk while minimizing residual damage. However, max Speed can be run to outspeed Timid Suicune, Heracross, Timid Kingdra, and Timid Rotom, although this cuts into Zapdos's bulk quite a bit. Pressure is Zapdos's only ability and is pretty situational on this set due to its generally less defensive approach, but it can potentially allow Zapdos to PP stall moves like Seed Flare from Shaymin and Leaf Storm from a multitude of Grass-types much faster. Leftovers make it so the omnipresent sandstorm doesn't wear it down and helps in bluffing a more defensive variant which leads to potential surprise value. It even allows Zapdos to recover health should sand not be up. Life Orb can be used over Leftovers if hitting harder when trying to sweep is more appealing, but this lowers the set's ability to bluff a defensive one and leaves Zapdos worn down very easily, especially if sand is up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field so Zapdos is easier to bring in and less forced to use Roost and give up momentum. Attempt to wear down and remove Zapdos's countermeasures with entry hazards, other teammates, and even Zapdos itself so it can set up and sweep more easily mid- or late-game. Only set up Agility on forced switches, on Pokemon Zapdos naturally checks, and on Choice item users locked into an ineffective move. Also, don't reveal Agility until Zapdos is ready to pull off a sweep or if it needs to get off as much damage as possible on faster Pokemon for a partner. Should Zapdos have it, use Roost frequently to keep Zapdos's HP high throughout the game so it can check the threats it should be able to. Even after setup, using Roost is helpful to keep Zapdos healthy and uninhibited by most priority moves. While this set has a great matchup against offensive teams, it has a tougher time against more defensive teams that are less liable to being swept due to having more countermeasures for this set in general. In these situations, rely more on Zapdos's natural defensive utility and attack more frequently as opposed to setting up. Avoid letting Zapdos take heavy hits, and check for coverage on Pokemon Zapdos normally checks. as being worn down leaves it prone to being revenge killed despite its access to Roost and good bulk. If Zapdos is running Life Orb and sand is up, try to keep it on the field only for as long as necessary to avoid residual damage accumulating.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapid Spin users are very helpful partners to remove Stealth Rock for Zapdos, which makes coming in, checking what it needs to, and setting up much easier, and its lessened reliance on Roost helps not give the opposing team free turns. Starmie in particular is an amazing partner due to its great offensive and defensive synergy with Zapdos; notably the two make for a good double Fighting-resistant core. Jirachi can handle Ice- and Rock-types for Zapdos while also setting up Stealth Rock to aid in sweeping. It can even get Zapdos in safely with a potential U-turn, while Zapdos can pivot into and handle Ground-types like Gliscor should it have the appropriate coverage move to hit them. Entry hazard setters can help this Zapdos a lot in wearing down its switch-ins, which is a big part in setting up a sweep. Stallbreakers like Taunt Gliscor, Taunt Gengar, Breloom, and mixed Dragonite all help break down bulkier teams this Zapdos has a tougher time dealing with and can even help give Zapdos an opening to clean up late-game. Grass-types like Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin all handle Ground-types this set can't do much to without the proper coverage, like Swampert and Mamoswine and they also provide other support options in Spore in the case of Breloom and Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Roserade. Meanwhile, Zapdos handles Flying-types like Skarmory for them. Swampert, especially a mixed variant, has good offensive synergy with Zapdos and can pressure other Electric-types, Jirachi, and defensive Heatran for Zapdos while Zapdos can beat or set up on most of Swamperts checks, namely Grass-types. Water-types like Starmie, Kingdra, and Suicune all take advantage of the Ground- and Rock-types that can handle Zapdos as well as Heatran while Zapdos handles Grass-types for them. Most of these Water-types also resist Ice for Zapdos while Zapdos resists Grass for them. Physical attackers like Metagross, Infernape, Lucario, and Flygon love the fact that Zapdos can break bulkier Water-types for them while they can pressure special walls like Clefable and Blissey for it. U-turn pivots like Flygon, Jirachi, and Scizor can get Zapdos in safely. Zapdos works well on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its blend of offensive and defensive utility. Good partners on balance include Breloom, Roserade, Jirachi, and Swampert, and viable partners for bulky offense include Latias and Heatran. Explosion users like Heatran, Azelf, and Metagross can all weaken Zapdos's checks and get it in safely. Zapdos fits well on dual screen hyper offense teams thanks to its typing and bulk making it hard to defeat, so screens setters like Uxie and Azelf make for good partners. Other Electric-types like Rotom-A and Raikou can form a good Electric spam core with Zapdos to wear down checks like Latias and Tyranitar. Tyranitar itself is also a good partner for Zapdos lacking Hidden Power Ice to trap Latias, which would otherwise be a nuisance, and it can also set Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres is a niche Pokemon in the OU environment. On one hand, it is possibly the best Scizor counter outside Ubers. On the other, it loses half its health whenever it switches into Stealth Rock, a common battle condition. Rapid Spin support is a must when using Moltres, as the damage is just too devastating to its survivability without it. Moltres fills a stalling role few others can but is all too often held back by Stealth Rock, so tread with caution.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moltres can use Air Slash alongside Hidden Power Grass in an offensive set decently, but is outclassed by Heatran, who takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock and possesses a slightly higher Special Attack score.</p> <p>A lead Moltres with a Choice Scarf is viable, as many of the common OU leads are weak to Fire-type attacks, but they will likely switch out anyway, leaving you in against your counter. Aerodactyl, Tyranitar, and Swampert are fairly common leads who will probably beat such a Moltres as well.</p> <p>248 HP is preferred to simply maxing HP as it means Moltres can switch into Stealth Rock three times rather than two, which can be crucial in certain situations. Investing in Special Defense is viable as it helps you stall against weaker Surfs and Thunderbolts. 60 Speed EVs allow Moltres to outspeed 88 Speed Rotom-A, most Breloom, Adamant Scizor, and Adamant Tyranitar. 112 Speed EVs are enough to beat Jolly Tyranitar, while 160 Speed EVs with a boosting nature are enough to beat Adamant Lucario.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, as well as Blissey, do a decent job at countering Moltres, but will often get crippled in the process. Tentacruel is immune to Toxic, and thus can Surf Moltres without much fear of retaliation. The best counters to Moltres use Rest to eliminate poison damage and repeated Flamethrowers. Heatran makes a wonderful counter to Moltres <em>if</em> he has Taunt. A Taunted Moltres will always be forced to switch against Heatran or just end up activating Flash Fire. RestTalk Suicune and Gyarados can recover off Toxic damage, and also use Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, respectively, to sweep. Snorlax with Thick Fat takes next to no damage from Moltres and can use Curse to set up on it. When poison has taken its toll, he can then use Rest to recover his health. Tyranitar makes a decent switch-in to Moltres as he does not fear Flamethrower and can use Stone Edge to easily OHKO Moltres. Be wary of Pressure stalling, however. Curse Tyranitar is a wonderful counter to Moltres. The sandstorm that Tyranitar brings also greatly limits Moltres's ability to continuously stall Pokemon. Dragonite can come in on a Flamethrower, but usually fears Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unique typing coupled with good defenses allows Moltres to stall out many defensive Pokemon with Toxic, even in the OU metagame. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move which hits nearly every Pokemon immune to Toxic super effectively. Roost recovers your HP in a pinch, and removes Moltres's Electric-type weakness and grants Moltres a resistance to Ice-type attacks. Substitute helps Moltres stall out attacks such as Stone Edge and also guards against status. If your team uses Toxic Spikes, Roar can replace Toxic so that you can rid yourself of annoying RestTalkers such as Gyarados and Suicune. However, you may still want to keep the status move so Moltres can better harm Pokemon not affected by Toxic Spikes, such as Gliscor.</p> <p>A combination of Toxic, Roost, and Substitute allows Moltres to defeat walls such as Vaporeon, Blissey, and Gliscor with a little prediction. Since it resists Fighting-, Steel-, Bug-, and Fire-type attacks, Moltres is able to counter Scizor, Jirachi, Infernape (if he lacks Stone Edge), and numerous other physical attackers without many drawbacks. Scizor cannot break Moltres's Substitute with Bullet Punch, meaning Moltres can switch in (even on Stealth Rock), set up a Substitute on the likely switch, and Roost off the damage. An Adamant Lucario's Swords Danced Life Orb Close Combat will only 2HKO, so if the foe doesn't have Stone Edge, Moltres makes a good counter to Lucario as well.</p> <p>Moltres's biggest problem (other than Stealth Rock) is the competition it faces for a team slot. Heatran and Zapdos are two other common Toxic stall Pokemon, both possessing a Fire-type attack as well. Heatran, however, lacks reliable recovery, which Moltres has in the form of Roost. Zapdos lacks Fire-type STAB, which enables Moltres to beat the standard RestTalk Rotom-A. Zapdos can only hurt it with an unSTABed Fire-type attack or a resisted Electric-type attack. Fire-type STAB also allows Moltres to defeat Celebi and OHKO Lucario. Gliscor is immune to Thunderbolt and can Roost off Zapdos' Heat Wave without a problem, but will have some trouble stalling out Moltres, even with Taunt blocking Toxic. This is due to STAB Flamethrower having a chance to 2HKO Gliscor.</p> <p>A Heatran locked into a move by a Choice item is walled by Moltres, not the other way around. A Specs Fire Blast does less than 50%, and Pressure burns up Fire Blast's PP faster than napalm on top of a flame. Even if Heatran comes in on a Flamethrower, Moltres can still Roost or Substitute while he attacks and Pressure the Fire Blasts away. Moltres's time will be largely focused on putting up another Substitute or Roosting, and in the lulls between these turns, it can Toxic Heatran to waste time. Moltres also beats RestTalk versions of Heatran, as they need to be damaged to Rest in the first place. Without being able to Rest, Heatran is forced to attack--almost as if he were Taunted--as Pressure slowly chokes his attacks. Since Choice Specs Heatran can't even beat Moltres, this strain of Heatran is going to do even less.</p> <p>If Moltres is ever facing a Blissey, Moltres usually stalls Blissey out of her Seismic Toss PP with Pressure, Substitute, and Roost. Ice Beams usually don't break a Substitute, and Flamethrowers can't even in two hits. Even if Blissey has Thunderbolt, Moltres can still win, as Roost removes its Electric-type weakness while healing itself. Blissey's only chance to win is to either predict a Roost and status Moltres with Toxic, or use Calm Mind and Thunderbolt. Landing a Thunder Wave will also help, but paralysis doesn't quite stop Moltres (although getting fully paralyzed at a vital point quickly gets annoying). Vaporeon is also a great partner to Moltres as he counters Suicune and Gyarados well. Vaporeon can also pass Wish to Moltres, healing off Stealth Rock damage the very turn you switch in.</p>"

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>For years, Feraligatr has been unable to distinguish itself in a metagame where Gyarados dominated. In the 4th generation, Feraligatr still struggles to make it onto a competitive team due to its lack of any outstanding stats. Feraligatr does manage to differentiate itself from Gyarados, however, with its neutrality to Stealth Rock and access to Swords Dance. While it lacks the raw power that Gyarados wields, it makes up for it with the capacity to boost its Attack twice as fast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feraligatr has a few additional moves that haven't been mentioned yet. Earthquake can be useful for hitting Metagross and Jirachi super effectively but otherwise has inferior coverage compared to Waterfall and Return. Feraligatr learns Dragon Dance, but that is better left to Gyarados, which, despite having a weakness to Stealth Rock, is faster, hits harder, and has Intimidate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most of the Pokemon that counter Dragon Dance Gyarados check Feraligatr as well. If Rotom-A is faster than Feraligatr, it can survive an Aqua Jet and KO with Thunderbolt. Slower Rotom-A variants need to be wary, however, as a +2 Aqua Tail may OHKO after Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is a great revenge killer to take down Feraligatr after it has set up. Zapdos is in a similar boat as Rotom-A; if it outspeeds Feraligatr then it will surely win, but if not, it risks being OHKOed. Vaporeon can counter Feraligatr if it has Toxic or Roar, but takes a lot of damage from Return. RestTalk Gyarados is a great counter thanks to Intimidate and Roar to phaze Feraligatr. Shaymin and Celebi also counter Feraligatr well, but shouldn't risk using Leech Seed or Thunder Wave as Feraligatr can 2HKO with Return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Feraligatr has always been in Gyarados's shadow in the OU environment. Feraligatr has Swords Dance to boost its Attack twice as fast as Gyarados, though, and priority Aqua Jet to hit faster foes. Feraligatr easily OHKOes defensive Rotom-A, who has next to no chance of OHKOing back with Thunderbolt, even after Stealth Rock damage. Even if Rotom-A tries to burn Feraligatr with Will-O-Wisp, Lum Berry is there to remedy the status. Return complements Feraligatr's Water-type STAB, hitting every Pokemon in the OU metagame for neutral damage, with the exception of Empoleon. Furthermore, Vaporeon and Suicune cannot do enough damage to Feraligatr before being forced to recover; Vaporeon is likely to be 2HKOed by Return, while defensive Suicune is 3HKOed. An unboosted Hidden Power Electric from either of them is only a 3HKO, allowing Feraligatr to get another Swords Dance under its belt. Aqua Jet is Feraligatr's weapon against faster Pokemon such as Heatran, Gengar, Jolteon, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar; however, you will need residual damage to guarantee the OHKOs on said Pokemon.</p> <p>Because of Feraligatr's pure Water typing, Electric-type attacks do not completely mutilate it like they do Gyarados. For instance, common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and even Life Orb Starmie cannot reliably OHKO Feraligatr. Another big selling point for Feraligatr is its ability, Torrent. Because of its natural bulk, many attacks can't do enough damage to Feraligatr to OHKO it, usually leaving Feraligatr with just enough HP to activate Torrent.</p> <p>Aqua Tail is a viable alternative to Waterfall; with it, Feraligatr can OHKO Rotom-A after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Skarmory. However, if you use Aqua Tail for its added power, you will have to forgo Waterfall's perfect accuracy and the possibility of a flinch. Lum Berry is a good item, but it won't always help your sweep. Mystic Water is a useful alternative if you'd like a slightly smaller power boost to Feraligatr's STAB moves without the recoil of Life Orb. Life Orb gives you a lot of extra power, but sacrifices Feraligatr's natural bulk. A Jolly nature allows Feraligatr to outpace Naive Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and Adamant Gyarados. An Adamant nature is perfectly viable, however, as Feraligatr could use the slight boost in power against bulky Water-types. There is no need to max Speed with an Adamant nature, as Feraligatr is usually naturally faster or slower than the Pokemon in its speed tier. Pokemon such as Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom rarely maximize their Speed, so Feraligatr only needs enough to beat defensive Rotom-A.</p> <p>Entry hazards are extremely helpful for Feraligatr, as they guarantee some vital KOs, especially those with Aqua Jet. With a layer or two of Spikes, Aqua Jet will have no problem OHKOing Heatran and Mamoswine after a Swords Dance. Skarmory and Forretress are recommended as partners for Feraligatr as they are reliable at setting up Spikes, but beware Skarmory's shared weakness to Electric-type attacks. Forretress can also set up Toxic Spikes to deter Celebi and Vaporeon, who can cause problems for Feraligatr. A Pursuit user will be extremely helpful, as Starmie is a big threat to Feraligatr; it is faster, can survive a +2 Aqua Jet, and can KO with Thunderbolt after some residual damage. Tyranitar brings in an unwanted Sandstorm, but if you don't mind that, it is a great choice since it can also counter the troublesome Zapdos and Rotom-A. Scizor is a decent check to Gengar and Starmie and can weaken enemy walls with U-turn. Gliscor can set up Stealth Rock, counter Lucario, and even lure in Pokemon whom Feraligatr can set up on, such as Gyarados, Suicune, and Vaporeon. If Gliscor uses U-turn as they switch in, you can get Feraligatr in completely unharmed and proceed to set up.</p> <p>Feraligatr can work well as a lure for defensive Pokemon so other sweepers will have an easier time sweeping. Gyarados often has trouble with Rotom-A, Suicune, and Vaporeon, but if you can weaken them with Feraligatr, Gyarados can then finish off the enemy team. A Pursuit user such as Tyranitar will be all to prevent both sweepers from succumbing to revenge killers. Choice Scarf Flygon would be most helpful as a revenge killer, absorbing Thunderbolts and checking Dragon Dance Dragonite. Heatran can be used as an additional lure, further weakening Water-type switch-ins with Hidden Power Grass while handily checking most Jirachi.</p>"

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop is a Pokemon with two very usable abilities, both of which suit his capabilities very well. With Intimidate, Hitmontop can be a great Rapid Spin user, capable of spinning past Ghost-types to remove entry hazards. However, with Technician, he can deal large amounts of damage before the opponent can even move thanks to his priority moves. Hitmontop is also a great check to any form of Tyranitar, capable of either Intimidating to reduce the impact of physical blows, or outright KOing with Mach Punch. Unfortunately, he cannot do both effectively, as he fails to deal heavy damage with a defensive spread, and doesn't have as much bulk with an offensive spread. Hitmontop also fails to do anything significant outside of Rapid Spinning, whereas fellow Rapid Spinners Starmie and Forretress can. Nevertheless, Hitmontop does a great job at doing what he has to do: supporting your team both defensively and offensively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There's not much that Hitmontop can do besides what has already been listed. Sucker Punch is an interesting choice, but Gengar will just set up a Substitute, defensive Rotom-A will just use Will-O-Wisp, and Choice-locked Rotom-A will just switch out. Toxic can be useful because of its ability to cripple Swampert and Hippowdon, but Hitmontop often has difficulty finding a spare moveslot for it.</p> <p>A Bulk Up set with Low Kick, Stone Edge, and a coverage move can be used, but with little immediate power, a lack of a recovery move, and his low Speed, Hitmontop won't be sweeping many teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spikes-stacking teams don't really have anything to \"counter\" Hitmontop with since he is so reliable at spinning away entry hazards. However, they can switch in a faster and powerful Pokemon to force Hitmontop to take heavy damage if he wants to Rapid Spin. Alternatively, Rotom-A or Gengar can Trick a Choice item onto Hitmontop, preventing him from using Foresight and effectively crippling him for the rest of the battle.</p> <p>Physical walls can also check Hitmontop because of his inability to bypass them effectively. Metagross can Meteor Mash, while Skarmory can Brave Bird or Whirlwind him away. Hippowdon also does a good job at walling Hitmontop due to his access to Slack Off to heal off any Close Combats he might take.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop is a great Rapid Spinner because of his ability to use Foresight to bypass the Ghost-type's immunity to Normal-type moves. With this move in his arsenal, he can hit Ghost-type Pokemon with Rapid Spin and also damage them with Close Combat. Rapid Spin helps the team by removing annoying entry hazards, while Close Combat helps Hitmontop deal respectable amounts of damage; the drops in defenses don't matter much because Hitmontop will probably be moving second due to his low Speed. Stone Edge is there to deal with Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragonite, while also hitting Gengar so he can't set up a Substitute. Rest is also another viable option for use on more stall-based teams, due to Hitmontop's great physical bulk allowing him to come in many times to absorb attacks. It can also be used to remove any status inflictions such as poison or burn, but must be partnered with a cleric.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Hitmontop to obtain maximum physical bulk. This, coupled with Intimidate, makes him a great Tyranitar counter. However, a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD with a Careful nature may also be used if you want Hitmontop to come in on Rotom-A's attacks more easily. It allows him to avoid a 3HKO from Choice Scarf Rotom-A's attacks and also gives more buffer room against defensive Rotom-A.</p> <p>Low Kick can be used over Close Combat if you don't appreciate the drops in defenses from Close Combat. However, it does leave Hitmontop more vulnerable against lighter physical walls like Swampert and Vaporeon, along with other light Pokemon, like Shaymin and Jirachi. Sucker Punch can be used in the fourth moveslot in order to revenge kill weakened Pokemon, but is generally too unreliable to take care of Ghost-types. Mach Punch may be used to KO weakened Empoleon, Lucario, and Tyranitar; however, it only 2HKOes max HP Lucario and Tyranitar, and is fairly weak otherwise.</p> <p>Many Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos, appreciate Hitmontop as a partner due to his ability to remove Stealth Rock. Mixed Dragonite can switch in more easily and launch more attacks, while both defensive and offensive Gyarados can more effectively Intimidate opponents. Hitmontop and Gyarados together can run a double Intimidate strategy, meaning that physically-based Pokemon will have a hard time dealing damage. Zapdos can also wall more Pokemon as it no longer loses a large chunk of health every time it switches in. Hitmontop also has good defensive synergy with all of the above Pokemon because he resists Rock-type moves aimed at them. Scizor's constant U-turning means that he tends to take a lot of entry hazard damage, so he also appreciates having Hitmontop as a partner. If Hitmontop has Rest, then Pokemon that use Heal Bell and Aromatherapy are helpful partners. Some examples include Celebi, Blissey, and Togekiss. Hitmontop resists Celebi's Dark-type weakness, Togekiss's Rock-type weakness, and also has Intimidate to weaken physical attacks that target Blissey.</p>"
      },
      "TechniTop (Technician)": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop's secondary ability, Technician, allows him to deal large amounts of damage to the opposing Pokemon. The idea of this set is to use weak priority moves that get boosted by Technician to deal damage before the opposing Pokemon can attack. Technician boosts both Fake Out and Mach Punch, and together the two of them deal effectively a 150 Base Power attack boosted by Life Orb. Mach Punch also helps out in checking Empoleon, Tyranitar, Lucario, and other weakened Pokemon. Close Combat is there to hit bulkier Pokemon such as Machamp and Bronzong, while Low Kick is an alternative if you dislike the drops in defenses from Close Combat. It does, however, miss out on a few notable 2HKOes on Pokemon such as Forretress, Jirachi, Shaymin, and Vaporeon. The last moveslot is used to cover Pokemon who shrug off Hitmontop's first three attacks. Stone Edge deals a large amount of damage to Dragonite and Gyarados, and can even 2HKO bulky Gyarados after Intimidate. Pursuit can be used to trap and KO Gengar along with Choice Scarf Rotom-A.</p> <p>Ironically, this moveset has difficulties against Spikers because Hitmontop can't Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. Therefore, Rapid Spin can be used in the last slot in case Forretress and Skarmory decide to get greedy with their Spikes. Bullet Punch can also be used in the last moveslot, but it would only do around 50% to Gengar and thus is outclassed by Pursuit.</p> <p>Hitmontop has difficulty getting past physically defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Swampert. If he's not using Rapid Spin, then he also has difficulty against Spikers. Both Heatran and Starmie are good partners; Heatran can scare away Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross, while Starmie can scare away Hippowdon and Skarmory, as well as Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. If Hitmontop is using Stone Edge, then a Pokemon that can trap and KO Ghost-type Pokemon is a useful partner. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a great choice as it can lock in and KO Gengar and Rotom-A. If Pursuit is chosen instead, then Pokemon that can check Gyarados and Dragonite are good teammates. Suicune and Vaporeon can check the two Flying-types, while Choice Scarf Jirachi and Flygon can revenge kill both of them.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert is one of DPP OU's most emblematic Pokemon. Its unique Water / Ground typing gives it many desirable traits. It resists popular Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-type moves, it's immune to sand and Electric-type moves, and it's resistant to Stealth Rock. In addition, it can hit a wide variety of foes thanks to its access to Ground- and Water-type STAB moves with Ice-type coverage. However, Swampert is 4x weak to Grass-type moves, which several Pokemon carry specifically to target it. Despite this, it makes for an awesome offensive pivot that is able to check many prominent threats like Jirachi, Heatran, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Zapdos.</p> <p>However, Swampert does not have access to a reliable form of recovery, so it tends to struggle long term against strong attackers like Machamp and Infernape. Some Pokemon that Swampert checks decently, like Zapdos, Heatran, Jirachi, and Rotom-A, can also run status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, which considerably hamper its durability. Swampert's low Speed and harsh Grass weakness can also be exploited by Breloom if it does not have adequate support or enough Speed investment, the latter of which comes at the cost of its bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swampert's movepool isn't particularly vast, so it doesn't have many other decent options to work with. Interestingly, Swampert learns both Counter and Mirror Coat. While these could potentially be used to nab a surprise KO on unsuspecting attackers, they will be a waste of a moveslot if you fail to predict correctly, and they lose their effectiveness after Swampert uses them once. Thus, you're often better off sticking to more reliable moves. Swampert can utilize a combination of Substitute + Focus Punch, as it creates 101 HP Substitutes, making it a fantastic Clefable counter; however, Substitute must replace valuable coverage. It's also possible to run Focus Punch instead of Stealth Rock on offensive sets, making Swampert better at wallbreaking at the expense of losing utility. Swampert can use Blizzard when paired with Abomasnow, but Tyranitar is so popular that it's unreliable. Refresh is a decent option because there are some teams that highly depend on status to deal with Swampert. For that same reason, Rest is another option, but this is generally undesirable because Swampert becomes setup fodder while asleep. Toxic is a great option on both offensive and defensive Swampert sets. It can be used over Stealth Rock on offensive sets to make it even more potent as a stallbreaker, hitting a huge target in Milotic; on defensive sets, it can hit Hippowdon and Zapdos. Finally, Swampert can provide good support on a Rain Dance team, as many Rain Dance teams struggle with Tyranitar, which Swampert checks well. However, Swampert almost always has more worthwhile options to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Swampert's best counters are Grass-type Pokemon. Celebi and Shaymin both can switch into most of Swampert's attacks and OHKO it back with Grass Knot, Seed Flare, and Leaf Storm. Breloom also beats Swampert, as it can either use Seed Bomb against Swampert for the OHKO or opt to use Spore and then set up a Substitute. Roserade can force Swampert out and set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. All of these Pokemon must be wary of Swampert's Ice-type coverage, however. Abomasnow is not weak to Ice-type attacks and can maim Swampert with a STAB-boosted Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types cause problems for Swampert, as they resist Waterfall and generally don't take that much damage from Earthquake. Suicune is able to set up Calm Mind on Swampert and deal heavy damage with Hydro Pump or Surf. Defensive Starmie is able to spin Swampert's Stealth Rock away and can wear it down with Surf while restoring its health. However, some defensive investment is needed to do this reliably, as Swampert's Earthquake is strong, and a critical hit can quickly swing the exchange in Swampert's favor. Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados sets up on Swampert, prevents it from using Roar, and shrugs off Swampert's Ice-type attacks. Milotic can use Recover and tank Swampert's attacks relatively well while retaliating nicely with Surf. Vaporeon with Toxic is a major thorn in Swampert's side, as it is able to outstall Swampert with Wish and use Protect once it statuses it. Vaporeon's Water Absorb can enable it to answer Choice item sets well, and offensive Vaporeon sets can massacre the opposing team with powerful Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type moves</strong>: Unexpected Grass-type moves destroy Swampert, as its 4x Grass weakness means that any Grass-type move is going to hurt. Zapdos and Heatran can deal major damage to Swampert with Hidden Power Grass. Infernape, Latias, Starmie, and Jirachi make good use of Grass Knot, but they must also watch out for Earthquake and, in Latias's case, Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Because Swampert has no form of reliable recovery, it detests status. As such, Rotom-A is a good check to Swampert because it is immune to Earthquake and is able to burn Swampert with Will-O-Wisp. Gengar can also burn Swampert; however, Gengar cannot take a Waterfall. Toxic users such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Zapdos can put Swampert on a timer and even use Protect to rack up poison damage. Toxic Spikes horribly cripples Swampert's longevity overall.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Unless running Hydro Pump, Swampert is vulnerable to Skarmory. Skarmory sets up Spikes on Swampert, as it is not able to hit Skarmory hard enough to deny the Spikes. Choice Band Swampert can induce flinches with Waterfall if it gets a little of luck, but most of the time, the armored bird can take advantage of Swampert and set up Spikes. Skarmory with Taunt is an even better counter, as it prevents Swampert from setting up its own Stealth Rock or phazing it before it can set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers can overwhelm Swampert really quickly, since it doesn't have access to any form of reliable recovery. Pokemon like Machamp, Choice Band Infernape, mixed attacking Flygon, Lucario, and offensive Dragonite can hit Swampert considerably hard.</p>",

      "Physically Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to its good typing, decent attacking stats, high natural bulk, and access to Stealth Rock, Swampert makes for a great lead and an exceptional mid-game threat. It's capable of taking on many popular threats with ease, such as Tyranitar and Zapdos, and it can serve as a great offensive pivot.</p> <p>Due to these traits, Swampert can find plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Earthquake is used in the second moveslot, as it is Swampert's best STAB move, hitting any foe that doesn't resist it for a decent chunk of damage. Waterfall combines excellently with Earthquake, allowing Swampert to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Rotom-A. Ice Punch enables Swampert to hit Pokemon such as Flygon, Dragonite, Latias, and Breloom super effectively; however, Swampert must switch out on the next turn versus Breloom if it does not have enough Speed investment.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP EVs grant Swampert decent overall bulk, enabling it to take most resisted and neutral attacks reasonably well. An Adamant nature with maximum Attack investment allows Swampert to hit as hard as possible. 16 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed foes like Clefable and uninvested Tyranitar, but feel free to invest more Speed to outspeed Pokemon like Tyranitar, Scizor, Skarmory, Nidoqueen, and even Breloom. However, although Swampert's Waterfall can potentially cause Skarmory to flinch with greater Speed investment, it loses the opportunity to land Earthquake as Skarmory uses Roost. Leftovers grants Swampert passive recovery, which allows it to check Jirachi more effectively, since Leftovers largely offsets Iron Head's damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into resisted moves like Iron Head, Stone Edge, and Thunderbolt to more safely set up Stealth Rock. Keep in mind that Pokemon like Tyranitar, Flygon, and Mamoswine can deal a significant amount of damage with their powerful STAB attacks, so don't overestimate Swampert's general bulk. This Swampert also works as a great early-game wallbreaker because it forces a lot of switches, and its coverage makes it pretty difficult for foes to switch in safely. However, Swampert requires prediction to wallbreak effectively because it's slow, and sweepers that carry Grass-type moves or strong STAB attacks such as Hydro Pump, Draco Meteor, and Close Combat can force it out, making you lose momentum. Waterfall is generally the preferred option to use if you expect your opponent to switch to something that covers Earthquake, such as Gengar or Rotom-A. However, depending on the matchup, Ice Punch is definitely worth considering, as it hits Grass- and Dragon-type switch-ins.</p> <p>On top of that, offensive Swampert is a good asset to break through a Skarmory / Clefable core because it hits other Pokemon paired with them super effectively, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Jirachi, and Gliscor. If Swampert is paired with paralysis support, you should try to keep it healthy, as it can potentially break through defensive cores late-game on crippled targets that cannot safely heal. If Swampert is in Torrent range, it becomes an immense threat; Skarmory struggles even more against it, especially when Swampert is paired with paralysis support and can employ a paraflinch strategy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Swampert is more effective on offensive teams that need a reliable pivot that conserves momentum. It has many viable teammates. Pokemon such as Latias and Heatran can be used to compensate for Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type moves and take on Celebi and Breloom, two of the biggest threats to it, though they must watch out for Thunder Wave and Spore. Also, Heatran needs to watch out for Fighting-type attacks from Breloom and even the rare Earth Power from Celebi. This is the reason why sleep absorbers such as Choice Specs Latias and Roserade make exceptional teammates. Moreover, Roserade can switch into most bulky Water-types with ease and set up Toxic Spikes on them, which further supports Swampert. An effective way to take advantage of Swampert's typing is to utilize a Fire / Water / Grass defensive core. Since Skarmory can check Swampert and find opportunities to set up Spikes, Magnezone also makes for a good partner, particularly if Swampert runs a lot of Speed, as it can easily switch into Skarmory, attempt to trap it with Magnet Pull, and proceed to KO it with a powerful Thunderbolt. Skarmory and Bronzong have perfect type synergy with Swampert. Skarmory can set up Spikes and switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert, while Swampert can switch into Electric- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Skarmory. Bronzong can set up Trick Room for Swampert, which allows it to get the jump on faster foes. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Swampert pair nicely because Swampert usually does well versus Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which is the one setup sweeper Rotom-A cannot reliably cover; in return, Rotom-A can prevent Starmie from spinning, which Skarmory also appreciates. Swampert benefits a lot from paralysis support from teammates like Jirachi, Latias, and Zapdos, as it synergizes with Waterfall's 20% chance to flinch, and it helps to compensate for its lower Speed tier. Celebi also has access to Thunder Wave and can contribute to a Fire / Water / Grass core.</p>"

It is excellent at forcing switches, which gives it many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Hydro Pump is the primary attacking move, as it punishes standard Skarmory extremely hard for a solid 2HKO, which stops Skarmory from setting up on Swampert while simultaneously allowing Swampert to threaten with Earth Power on a predicted Roost. It also deals solid damage to defensive Rotom-A, Bronzong, Bold Zapdos, and Bold Starmie. Surf is not worth considering due to its lower Base Power, missing crucial damage benchmarks against Gengar and Skarmory. Earth Power is a strong STAB move that threatens Metagross and Jirachi and provides great neutral coverage against Kingdra. Ice Beam provides excellent coverage and, in conjunction with Earth Power and Hydro Pump, enables Swampert to hit everything in DPP OU for neutral damage. Ice Beam can catch Celebi on the switch and force it to use Recover, which gives a teammate a free turn to switch in without fear of Thunder Wave. Also, Dragonite and Flygon are OHKOed by it, and offensive Latias is hit for a decent amount of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature are needed because Swampert's Special Attack is a bit lacking compared to other specially attacking Pokemon in DPP OU. 16 Speed EVs enable Swampert to outspeed uninvested Clefable and Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are placed into Swampert's HP to maximize its general bulk. Leftovers grants Swampert passive recovery, which allows it to check Jirachi more effectively, since Leftovers largely offsets Iron Head's damage. Feel free to Speed creep at the expense of HP, because it could be extremely useful to outspeed Skarmory, Scizor, Nidoqueen, and Breloom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot into resisted Rock-, Fire-, and Electric-type attacks to find a good opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Try to switch Swampert in as soon as possible. General bulk alone is not enough to eat powerful STAB moves like Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and +1 Dragonite's Outrage. This is why you should try to bring Swampert in on resisted attacks such as Stone Edge and Iron Head, or you will end up sacrificing it quickly. Swampert is incredibly effective at breaking through stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to lure most physical walls that expect a standard physical set. However, once you've revealed that Swampert is purely specially oriented, Clefable can wall it unless it is in Torrent's range. Typical Swampert checks like Rotom-A and Skarmory should be the main target to lure in with this set.</p> <p>Specially offensive Swampert is excellent at forcing a lot of switches, which gives it many opportunities to fire off Hydro Pump. Do not try to overpredict with this Swampert. Hydro Pump is generally the safest option because many teams tend to lack solid Water-resistant Pokemon. The only reason you should consider to use Ice Beam on a predicted switch is if you are running a slower Swampert and you suspect that your opponent has a Breloom, Celebi, or Latias. Otherwise, it's better to scout with Hydro Pump early-game most of the time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Swampert works excellently alongside Grass- and Fire-types as part of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and status, which severely cripple Swampert, and set up its own entry hazards / Toxic Spikes, which Swampert supports by forcing switches. Similarly, other entry hazard supporters like Skarmory and Forretress also work well with Swampert; both Spikes users are 4x resistant to Grass and support Swampert's offensive pressure, while in return Swampert resists Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Physical sweepers, such as Swords Dance Lucario, Choice Band Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and offensive Trick Room Bronzong, benefit from Swampert's ability to heavily damage physical walls. Bronzong gets a special mention, as it can set up Trick Room for Swampert and has perfect typing synergy with it. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Swampert are a great pair because Swampert checks Dragon Dance Tyranitar reasonably well, which is the one setup sweeper Choice Scarf Rotom-A cannot reliably revenge kill. If you are running less Speed, Sleep Talk + Choice Specs Latias is a decent answer to most Grass-type Pokemon, and it can absorb Breloom's Spore. Gyarados also gets a special mention, as it benefits from physical walls being worn down, while Swampert covers Gyarados's Electric- and Rock-type weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band Swampert epitomizes the idea of bulky offense, retaining natural bulk while cranking its Attack up to astronomical levels. Waterfall and Earthquake are used on this set to form a solid STAB-boosted duo that allows Swampert to hit many common DPP OU Pokemon for large amounts of damage. However, although Aqua Tail comes with more power than Waterfall and the ability to 2HKO specially defensive Skarmory, this option is not worth considering due to its lack of a flinch rate. Stone Edge is used in the third moveslot so that Swampert has a way to heavily damage Gyarados, which will otherwise shrug off Swampert's attacks thanks to its typing and Intimidate; Stone Edge also hits Zapdos harder than Ice Punch, which is used in the final slot, enabling Swampert to OHKO Dragonite and Flygon. Ice Punch can also hit Celebi and Breloom on the switch, though Swampert must immediately switch out the next turn unless you determine that it will outspeed Breloom. Superpower can be used over Stone Edge, which gives Swampert good neutral coverage in tandem with its other moves. However, the Attack and Defense drops that come after using it will often force Swampert to switch out the next turn, which is an unattractive aspect. Also, Gyarados would become a perfect counter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs let Swampert outspeed Clefable, Tyranitar, Scizor, bulky Empoleon, and uninvested Skarmory, but you may want to invest a bit more to account for faster Skarmory. If you are willing to run a very fast Swampert, 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe is a great alternative spread to outspeed most Breloom and Rotom-A, hitting the latter with Waterfall before it uses Will-O-Wisp on Swampert. Attack is maximized with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band to give Swampert the maximum power it could possibly attain. The remaining EVs significantly boost Swampert's general bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite this set's massive power, you must have good prediction skills in order to use it effectively, as being locked into an undesirable move can shift the momentum in your opponent's favor. HP EVs alone are not enough for Swampert to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, there is no Leftovers to boost Swampert's durability, so it is even more fragile. Also, without Leftovers, Swampert will be especially more susceptible to Iron Head Jirachi. This Swampert set is an excellent early-game hard-hitter, since very few Pokemon can defend against its onslaught of powerful physical attacks. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Swampert makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon. Do not hesitate to spam Waterfall to break bulky stall teams, since Pokemon like Skarmory and Rotom-A or any paralyzed Pokemon will struggle to restore their health against repeated Waterfall usage. Against more offensive teams, it can be useful to predict Ice-type weak Pokemon that tend to switch in Swampert, such as Breloom and Latias, and weaken them with a powerful Ice Punch. On the other hand, hitting predicted Gyarados, Abomasnow, or Dragonite switch-ins with Stone Edge is devastating if you manage to land it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this Swampert will force a lot of switches, it is useful to provide it with entry hazard support. Swampert will also definitely need some defensive backbone, since its Choice lock means it will likely KO something and then be forced to switch. The two most common attacking types that are used on Swampert are Water and Grass. This makes any sort of Grass-type Pokemon an excellent teammate. Roserade makes for a decent option, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes while defending well against most Grass- and Water-type moves. Also, Roserade's Natural Cure supports Swampert by allowing it to absorb status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Sleep Powder. It can even absorb Toxic Spikes thanks to its Poison typing. Heatran is also a great choice, as it is able to consistently set up Stealth Rock and packs a 4x resistance to Grass-type moves that will otherwise OHKO Swampert. Skarmory can also provide Spikes support, while offensive Bronzong can set up Trick Room, and both have perfect type synergy with Swampert. Magnezone can also help Swampert break through defensive archetypes by trapping and removing Skarmory. Paralysis support helps Swampert sweep late-game, since otherwise, something faster can force it out more easily. Pokemon like Zapdos and Jirachi work quite well with Swampert because they both have access to Thunder Wave and resist Grass. Celebi spreads paralysis while tanking most Water- and Grass-type moves, resisting Breloom's dual STAB move combination, and forming a solid Fire / Water / Grass core with Heatran and Swampert. As far as offensive partners for this set go, Choice Scarf Flygon and Rotom-A make great teammates, as they are capable of revenge killing many dangerous Pokemon that will attempt to set up on Swampert, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set aims to act as a solid utility counter and defensive pivot, taking advantage of Swampert's excellent typing and bulk. It is capable of taking on powerful Choice Band users like Tyranitar, Infernape, and Dragonite. In addition, it does very well versus Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross. Sadly, its lack of a reliable recovery move significantly hampers its tanking abilities.</p> <p>Swampert can set up Stealth Rock well due to its bulk and powerful Earthquake to keep spinners like Starmie in check. With high Defense and resistance to popular attacking types like Rock and Fire, it can set up entry hazards under many circumstances. Earthquake is Swampert's best STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it for a great portion of damage. Ice Beam is used in the third move slot to enable Swampert to OHKO Flygon, Gliscor, and Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage. It also allows it to hit Grass-type switch-ins, such as Breloom, for super effective damage, though Swampert must switch out on the next turn. Roar is the primary option in the final moveslot, as it can be used to scout the opposing team and rack up residual damage from Stealth Rock. Protect can be used as a scouting move and can also aid Swampert in blocking Explosion from Metagross and Azelf leads and giving Swampert an extra turn to restore its health with Leftovers.</p> <p>As far as other options go, Swampert has a few choices. Stone Edge can be used in place of Ice Beam to dish out respectable damage to Gyarados and Dragonite. Hydro Pump and Surf can be used if you'd like a secondary STAB option for Swampert to use, which can be useful for wearing down foes like Skarmory and Bronzong, though you'd have worse coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs maximize Swampert's Leftovers recovery and minimize damage from entry hazards and status. Also, the HP investment with Leftovers allows Swampert to always survive Seismic Toss from Clefable and Blissey five times at full health and gives it more all-around bulk. 216 Defense EVs grant Swampert exceptional physical bulk, letting it take most resisted and neutral physical attacks with ease. The remaining Special Defense EVs are used to allow Swampert to take neutral and resisted special attacks, such as Dragonite's Draco Meteor and Heatran's Fire Blast, more easily. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA can be used to maximize Swampert's physical bulk, but the extra Defense EVs don't accomplish anything specific, and the Special Defense investment is generally more useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swampert should be used as a defensive wall and entry hazard shuffler early-game. Swampert acts as a decent lead, as it can put Stealth Rock up reasonably well against popular leads such as Zapdos, Metagross, Heatran, and Hippowdon and frail Choice Scarf leads such as Infernape and Flygon, and it can usually dominate most offensive Pokemon when it has the type advantage. Since Swampert does not have a reliable recovery move, it's important to bring it into Rock-, Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-type attacks that it resists. Swampert finds plenty of opportunities to come in thanks to its Stealth Rock resistance and sand immunity, which is great for balance teams. Also, Swampert's Attack is high enough naturally to use Earthquake as a way to pressure opposing Starmie, which helps maintain Stealth Rock and forces it to use Recover, which can give Tyranitar or Rotom-A an opportunity to switch in without having to sustain damage from a Water-type attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert should be used on semi-stall and balance cores, as these are where its defensive abilities shine the most. Since Swampert can be successfully used on multiple types of teams, it has many viable teammates.</p> <p>On balance cores, Pokemon such as Scizor and Heatran can be used to compensate for its 4x weakness to Grass-type moves. Both can take on Celebi and Shaymin, two of the biggest threats to Swampert, though they must watch out for Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power. Mixed Dragonite and Infernape can take advantage of the Stealth Rock that Swampert sets up by forcing the opponent to switch through offensive pressure, which hurts the opposing team and gives your team offensive momentum. Another solid way to play Swampert is to utilize a Fire / Water / Grass core with Pokemon such as Heatran and Roserade. This will force the opponent to switch multiple times due to defensive synergy, racking up more damage from entry hazards. On the other hand, Sleep Talk users such as Choice item Latias and Choice Band Dragonite also pair well with Swampert, as they are able to switch into Grass-type moves with ease and absorb Breloom's Spore and Roserade's Sleep Powder.</p> <p>On more defensive teams, specially defensive Jirachi and Clefable make wonderful teammates for Swampert, because they can sponge special attacks that could otherwise spell doom for the mudfish Pokemon. They can also pass Wish to Swampert to keep it healthy, which can be a tremendous blessing because Swampert has no instant recovery move. Tyranitar is an excellent choice to consider thanks to its ability to shut down popular threats that appreciate taking advantage of this Swampert such as defensive Rotom-A, Starmie, Choice Specs Latias, and Celebi and punish them with its powerful STAB-boosted Dark-type attacks. In addition, it can summon sand with its Sand Stream, which helps rack up residual damage. On the other hand, since Swampert appreciates entry hazard stacking, a core with Skarmory and Rotom-A with Tyranitar in the back to trap Starmie makes for a solid defensive balance.</p> <p>Physically defensive Swampert tends to struggle against stall teams because it does not hit hard enough to actually threaten Pokemon like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Clefable. The aforementioned Pokemon can take advantage of its passivity to set up Spikes, status it, or remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Therefore, playing Swampert alongside stallbreakers can help mitigate this weakness. Breloom makes for a great partner, as it can form a solid Fire / Water / Grass core, if also paired with Heatran, and it can take advantage of slow bulky Pokemon like Clefable and defensive Rotom-A. As mentioned, Heatran also makes a decent partner, due to its appropriate typing synergy, but also for the fact that it can break through defensive Pokemon with Choice Specs and Magma Storm sets. Substitute + Pain Split Gengar also works well with Swampert. In addition to its ability to switch into Breloom's Grass and Fighting combination and into Close Combat from Infernape and Lucario, it can take advantage of Clefable by setting up a Substitute on a move like Knock Off, which can put the opposing team in a very bad position.</p> <p>Swampert also appreciates Rapid Spin support from Starmie, Tentacruel, and Forretress. Starmie is probably the best option because it is the most reliable spinner in DPP OU; it can check foes like Breloom, Taunt Gyarados, and Suicune, and wear down physical walls like Skarmory and Rotom-A. Swampert appreciates the support of other bulky Water- and Ground-types as well because they can act as emergency checks to Pokemon such as Flygon, Tyranitar, and Metagross, should Swampert go down to a powerful Choice Band-boosted Crunch from Tyranitar or a sneaky Grass-type attack.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Many people underestimate Swampert's Special Attack. Because of this, many would expect Swampert to be a bulky or Choice Band variant so it can catch foes like Skarmory, Clefable, Rotom-A, Latias, Metagross, and Breloom off guard with unexpected and powerful special attacks.</p> <p>Hydro Pump, Swampert's primary attacking option, is a powerful STAB move that, when boosted by Choice Specs, becomes enormously dangerous. Surf is not worth considering as an alternative to Hydro Pump because it makes Swampert considerably weaker and potentially causes it to lose many crucial KOs like on physically defensive Skarmory. Earth Power is a solid secondary STAB attack, hitting Water- and Steel-types for a great chunk of damage. Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric provide additional type coverage, dispatching most Grass- and Water-types that resist both STAB moves, such as Breloom and Gyarados. Hidden Power Grass can be used if you wish to catch opposing Swampert for an OHKO. Alternatively, Swampert can be a decent sleep absorber with Sleep Talk. However, be careful about that option, because most sleep inducers are Grass-types, so it's extremely risky for Swampert to switch into them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature raise Swampert's Special Attack to the highest possible level. The 84 Speed EVs allow Swampert to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory, but feel free to invest as much Speed as you want, since most Skarmory tend to run a bit more Speed. The rest of the EVs are placed into Swampert's HP, thus retaining some bulk to take a few hits from foes like Jirachi and Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main selling points are its surprise value and ability to OHKO physically defensive Skarmory. Swampert makes for a decent wallbreaker, even as a lead. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Swampert makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon that would use Swampert to set up entry hazards. Furthermore, Hydro Pump has a good chance to 2HKO Clefable, while Earth Power deals great damage to Water-type foes like Starmie and Kingdra.</p> <p>This Swampert is an excellent early-game hard-hitter, since very few Pokemon can come into its combination of special STAB attacks, but you must have good prediction skills in order to use it successfully. A single incorrect prediction could be catastrophic when using this Swampert, so tread carefully. Identify the type of team you are facing before choosing which move you want to use. Against defensive teams, do not hesitate to spam Hydro Pump early-game, as this is the move that will usually hit the most common Swampert switch-ins like Skarmory and Rotom-A the hardest. Once you have revealed that Swampert is running Choice Specs, you should try to predict which resistance —Water, Ground, or Ice— your opponent will bring in and use the best move accordingly. For example, using Ice Beam against an incoming Latias or Celebi can quickly swing a match in your favor. Against more offensive teams, you do not need to predict as much, because Hydro Pump should deal a ton of damage most of the time. Still, be careful about which move Swampert locks itself into.</p> <p>Swampert's bulk is not sufficient enough to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, Swampert is not running Leftovers to help it survive longer, so try to manage its health nicely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Swampert's main purpose is to break through bulky threats, Pokemon that appreciate their removal make decent partners. Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Gyarados are excellent options to consider because of Swampert's ability to lure and remove Skarmory, Rotom-A, and bulky Water-types. A Celebi of your own has strong typing synergy with Heatran and Swampert. Toxic Spikes also deserves a mention for working excellently with the balance nature of the core. Roserade is a particularly good user of Toxic Spikes, especially as a partner to Swampert due to its resistance to Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks. Paralysis support works well to compensate for Swampert's lower Speed. Jirachi, Zapdos, and Latias make great options, as they resist Grass-type moves and can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis. Offensive Trick Room Bronzong has great type synergy with Swampert, and the mudfish can use Trick Room to fire off powerful assaults while Bronzong weakens checks like Rotom-A and Gyarados.</p> <p>Physical attackers that resist Hydro Pump or Earth Power, such as Dragonite and Gyarados, can set up on this Swampert with ease. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can come in while Dragonite and Gyarados attempt to set up and scare them away with Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt. The same goes for Flygon, which benefits from Swampert's ability to wear down bulkier foes. Flygon is able to revenge kill most of the sweepers that will try to set up on Choice-locked Swampert.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Suicune, and Milotic can give this set trouble. Celebi can switch into bulky Water-types, force them to switch out, and use Thunder Wave or U-turn against the switch. Breloom is a great stallbreaker that can counter bulky Water-types by threatening to put them to sleep or hitting them with a powerful Grass-type move. Zapdos can also scare away bulky Water-types. However, both Breloom and Zapdos need to be careful when switching in, as bulky Water-types almost always carry Ice-type coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>It seems surprising to think that Swampert could pull off a mixed wallbreaker set when there are offensive behemoths available like Dragonite and Infernape. However, with its Ground typing negating the damage from sand and giving it an Electric-type immunity and a resistance to Stealth Rock, as well as its combined Water-, Ground-, and Ice-type coverage, Swampert can pose a major threat to typical defensive and balances cores. Earthquake is Swampert's best Ground-type STAB attack, as it benefits more from its high base Attack stat and it hits foes like Starmie, Tyranitar, and Clefable for high damage. Focus Punch guarantees OHKOs against Clefable, Blissey after Earthquake damage, and specially defensive Skarmory as it sets up Spikes or attempts to phaze Swampert with Whirlwind. Hydro Pump does a huge chunk of damage against Ground-immune Pokemon like Skarmory, Bronzong, and Rotom-A, while Ice Beam hits Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Brave nature increases Swampert's Attack and preserves its good natural bulk. 216 Attack EVs make Swampert's Earthquake extremely powerful and also allow it to OHKO Clefable with Focus Punch. 100 Special Attack EVs give Swampert enough power to 2HKO defensive Rotom-A and Skarmory with Hydro Pump. 80 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Clefable. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to maximize Swampert's general bulk. Leftovers allows Swampert to check Jirachi significantly more effectively, since it largely offsets Iron Head's damage. An alternative spread with a lot more Speed EVs and a Naughty nature can be used to try to outpace foes such as Skarmory and Breloom, although the lack of bulk considerably hampers Swampert's survivability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mixed attacking Swampert is meant to break through defensive cores, namely the common Nidoqueen / Skarmory / Clefable and Hippowdon / Skarmory / Clefable archetypes. They often pack Rotom-A or Tyranitar for entry hazard control and additional Fighting-type switch-ins such as Gliscor, Zapdos, and Starmie, which all have a really hard time defending against this Swampert. You need to pressure defensive teams as much as possible early-game before Spikes and Toxic Spikes are on the field, or your opponent will have an easier time dealing with Swampert. Swampert finds plenty of opportunities to pivot, so maintaining Stealth Rock will especially benefit it. Try to force as many switches as possible and punish them with good prediction. If Swampert is facing Clefable or Blissey, weaken them with Earthquake, and then use Focus Punch on the predicted Soft-Boiled.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Swampert works nicely alongside Fire- and Grass-types as part of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to remove Toxic Spikes on entry, which severely cripples Swampert, and set up its own Spikes, which works well thanks to Swampert's ability to force switches. Other entry hazard supporters, such as Skarmory and Forretress, also work well with Swampert. Since Swampert is quite slow, paralysis support helps to find more opportunities to come in and land a free hit on crippled targets. Therefore, running teammates like Jirachi and Zapdos is effective, as they can both induce paralysis; in return, Swampert resists Fire- and Rock-type moves. Latias, especially a Choice Specs variant with Sleep Talk, is a great choice because it can switch into Breloom and absorb Spore while resisting Grass- and Fighting-type moves. Tyranitar and Swampert pair amazingly together, as Tyranitar benefits tremendously from Swampert's ability to lure in and wear down physical walls; in return, Tyranitar can KO Latias, Starmie, Celebi, and Rotom-A, which all otherwise give Swampert trouble. In addition, Tyranitar sets up sand, which helps wear down bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Calm Mind Suicune, Kingdra, Gyarados, Empoleon, and Starmie can all pair nicely to form a Water-based offensive core, which works well because stall teams often do not pack a Water-resistant Pokemon. In particular, Swampert taking out defensive Rotom-A and weakening Skarmory can heavily benefit a Gyarados in the back. Water-types also synergize well together because they can weaken each other's counters; Swampert can even mitigate an Electric-type weakness and provides a crucial Rock-resistant Pokemon itself. However, beware of a potential compounded Grass-type weakness. Since this Swampert tends to break walls, sweepers such as Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, and Dragon Dance Dragonite are great teammates, as they have an easier time sweeping with bulky foes worn down. Bronzong also makes a decent partner to run alongside Swampert, since they both benefit from having Trick Room up; both Pokemon also have perfect type synergy.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With access to Curse and a good physical movepool, Swampert can be a dangerous setup sweeper when used correctly. With only one type weakness, solid defensive stats, and a handful of resistances, Swampert can always find opportunities to set up.</p> <p>Curse allows Swampert to boost both its Attack and Defense in one turn, and the Speed drop is usually inconsequential, as Swampert isn't exactly fast to begin with. Rest is used in the second moveslot to restore HP and cure status, significantly increasing Swampert's longevity. Earthquake is the primary option in the third moveslot, as it is a consistent STAB move that deals heavy damage to any foe that doesn't resist it. Waterfall is an alternative to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Rotom-A. When running Earthquake, Ice Punch is a great choice in the last moveslot, enabling Swampert to dish out tremendous damage to threats such as Dragonite and Latias after just one Curse. A mono-attacking Curse set can be used with a move set of Curse, Waterfall, Rest, and Sleep Talk, which allows Swampert to retain its usefulness while asleep, but this gives it significantly worse coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs enable Swampert to survive Seismic Toss five times with the help of Leftovers. 252 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature allow Swampert to take neutral and resisted special attacks very well. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, which helps Swampert to take a lot of powerful physical attacks after a few Curse boosts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is generally better not to reveal Curse too early in the game. First, scout Swampert's counters, which generally are Grass-type Pokemon, Skarmory, foes with Grass-type attacks, Trick users, and Haze Milotic. Then, weaken them to the point where they can no longer switch into Swampert. Swampert should be able to find plenty of opportunities to set up on foes such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Zapdos. Bulky Water-types tend to struggle way more against this Swampert; even Dragon Dance Gyarados can lose to it if it does not have Taunt, and the same goes for Dragon Dance Kingdra, Starmie, and Suicune.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Good teammates for this set include Pokemon that can switch into powerful special attacks such as Roserade's Leaf Storm, which would otherwise KO Swampert. Steel-type Pokemon, such as Heatran and Scizor, are great teammates for this Swampert, as they pack resistances to the special attacks Swampert doesn't want to take, such as Shaymin's Seed Flare and Dragonite's Draco Meteor. A Sleep Talk user such as Choice Band Dragonite or Choice Specs Latias can make for a decent partner, as they can absorb Breloom's Spore and retaliate with a powerful Choice item-boosted attack, but they must be careful of Substitute on the switch. In particular, Choice Specs Latias does not want to take Breloom's Focus Punch.</p> <p>Jirachi gets a special mention thanks to its type synergy with Swampert and ability to spread paralysis, which supports Swampert's late-game sweep. Since Trick users will try to shut Swampert down, having something that can absorb it will support Swampert's sweep. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a decent choice, since it is able to switch into Trick Rotom-A or Latias and trap them with Pursuit.</p> <p>A Rapid Spin user, namely Starmie or Forretress, can get rid of Spikes that hamper Swampert's ability to set up. Starmie can wear down Breloom, Celebi, and Latias with Ice Beam, while Thunderbolt lets it beat Gyarados and wear down Suicune. Roserade makes a good partner for this set, as it can switch into bulky Water-types and Grass-type attacks, which may otherwise cause this set problems. In addition, it can set up Toxic Spikes, which allows Swampert to outstall potential counters while setting up. Other Water-types such as Gyarados and Suicune work well with this Swampert, since they double down on weakening their mutual checks.</p>"

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>While Regirock appears to be an inferior Pokemon in OU due to its poor typing, which gives it weaknesses to common Grass-, Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, it actually has a niche as an extremely bulky Curse user. Regirock has the greatest physical bulk in OU and very respectable Special Defense, especially with the boost from sandstorm. Regirock's massive bulk can help negate its bad typing and enables it to set up several Curses, Rest off any damage, and bulldoze through the opponent's team. Regirock also has decent Attack and near-perfect coverage with just Earthquake and STAB Rock Slide. To top it off, Regirock has a very handy ability in Clear Body, which stops Intimidate from reducing its Attack.</p> <p>Despite these useful assets, Regirock requires serious team support to function. A Sand Stream Pokemon is necessary and a way to deal with your opponent's Water- and Grass-types is absolutely critical. Regirock also has pretty stiff competition with Tyranitar for a team slot, as it has better Attack and Special Defense and even provides its own sandstorm. Despite these somewhat disappointing setbacks, Regirock is still very destructive if properly supported and played.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In OU, Regirock doesn't have too many useful other options. Regirock could run a somewhat effective tank set due to its impressive physical bulk; however, its poor defensive typing and lack of reliable recovery really hurt its usefulness in that regard. It could also attempt to run a Rock Polish set similar to Agility Metagross, but it lacks the raw power and Speed that enable Metagross to wreak havoc and hit important Speed benchmarks, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass- and Water-types, such as Suicune, Celebi, and Breloom, are a real pain for Regirock. Suicune and Celebi can set up on Regirock, while Breloom not only resists Earthquake and Rock Slide, but can freely set up a Substitute, put Regirock to sleep, and beat it down with its STAB attacks. Skarmory and Hippowdon can phaze Regirock without too much trouble, but can do nothing else; in a one-on-one situation, Regirock will almost always emerge victorious. Gliscor with Taunt and Toxic can counter Regirock as long as it doesn't have too many Curses under its belt when Gliscor comes in.</p>",

      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>The idea of this set is to come in on a Pokemon who doesn't threaten Regirock, such as Heatran, Zapdos, or Weavile, and start setting up. After a Curse or two, Regirock will be able to take even super effective physical attacks with over half of its HP remaining. Should your opponent's special attackers be gone, Regirock will become hard to stop. When Regirock is running low on health, it can just Rest off the damage, wake up instantly thanks to Chesto Berry, and attempt a sweep.</p> <p>When using Regirock, it's inevitable that it will be compared to Tyranitar. Regirock has its advantages, however; it has superior Defense, lacks the 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, and doesn't have a weakness to Bug-type attacks. This enables it to come out on top against Gyarados, Dragonite, Lucario, and Scizor, all of whom Tyranitar loses to.</p> <p>Stone Edge is an option over Rock Slide, as the extra power is sometimes helpful at the cost of less PP. In the last slot, Sleep Talk is an option, as it allows Regirock to use Rest more than once without becoming set up bait, and lets it use Leftovers instead of Chesto Berry. Running Stone Edge becomes more viable due to Sleep Talk consuming PP for Stone Edge; however, running Sleep Talk over Earthquake gives Regirock a much harder time against Steel-types. The EVs can also be tweaked by investing in either more Defense or Attack should you want more physical bulk or attacking power, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Registeel is a fantastic Pokemon with base 150 defenses and a solid base 80 HP. With its Steel-type, it can resist many of the Dragon-type attacks flung around in OU, while simultaneously acting a general support Pokemon to the rest of the team. Registeel also provides a solid switch-in to many set up sweepers such as Jirachi and Celebi.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is a useful option for paralyzing many Pokemon that may try and stay in vs Registeel such as Skarmory and Gengar. Iron Head can be used in conjunction with Thunder Wave to take out a few Pokemon before they can even land a hit. Iron Head also provides Registeel a somewhat serviceable STAB attack that can be used to deal higher damage to Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Registeel is plagued by a pitifully low Attack stat which makes gaining KOes a hard task. Despite being able to check a fairly large portion of the metagame, Registeel is somewhat useless against Swords Dance Scizor, Spikes Skarmory and Forretress, and many bulky Water-types. Registeel is also weak to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, three of the most common attacking types in the metagame. Because Registeel can be such an important check to so many different kind of Pokemon, whittling it down with these super effective attacks will bring it down.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>In a metagame in which teams are constantly threatened by Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Kingdra, Choice Scarf Flygon, Life Orb Gengar, Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf and Calm Mind Jirachi, and SubRoost Zapdos, finding a comfortable check that simultaneously meshes with a wide variety of teams is difficult. This set serves to effectively check various threats without sacrificing general utility.</p> <p>This works either as lead or as a switch-in to check a threat. If utilized as a lead, be careful with common lead Taunters and lead Heatran, which tend to run Shuca Berry. Registeel will have no problem switching into Zapdos, after which it can Ice Punch / Earthquake (on a predicted Roost) to knock it out. Should Flygon or Zapdos carry high Defense or a Fire move, Registeel can easily deal with the threat by using Explosion. This can also surprise the common Choice Scarf Heatran by never getting OHKOed by Fire Blast and OHKOing back with Earthquake (with Expert Belt) very close to 100% of the time on a 4 HP / 0 Defense Heatran. Aside from checking these threats, it also supports its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock and Exploding on dangerous threats.</p> <p>The last moveslot is a matter of dealing with Heatran, Metagross, Jirachi, and Tyranitar switch-ins (all of which are common) with Earthquake, or the general usefulness of Toxic. Note that Toxic will help you deal with Zapdos, Togekiss, and non-Taunt Gyarados more effectively. As for the item, that is an issue of personal preference. If specific spreads don't suit your style, use Leftovers, and then shift the Attack EVs into the defenses. Since Registeel's Steel-typing is optimal for switching into Choice Specs powered Draco Meteors and the powerful attacks of Gengar and Magnezone, putting a significant amount into Special Defense is also a plausible option.</p> <p>Fighting-types appreciate the presence of Registeel, because of its ability to take care of Zapdos and Gengar, which is a major setback for sweepers such as Heracross. Registeel can even lure and KO Heatran, which is a great benefit for Pokemon such as Scizor and basically any Pokemon with a Fire-type attack.</p> <p>Registeel needs help with opposing Fire and Fighting-types, namely Infernape. Pokemon such as Starmie can effectively deal with Infernape, as well as any other Fighting or Fire-types that may cause Registeel trouble.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, one may perceive Torterra to be unsuited for OU play due to its exploitable weaknesses, such as those to common offensive types like Fire and Ice. In fact, one may question Torterra's merits over Metagross, who boasts much higher Attack and Speed stats, resists common priority attacks, and has a sizable movepool to work with, including a powerful Explosion as a last resort option. However, Torterra's Grass / Ground typing grants it a resistance to common moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, along with Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in and out safely on most OU teams. Torterra's typing also grants it an immunity to Thunderbolt, and more importantly, Thunder Wave, something that many Pokemon would kill to have. Offensively, Grass and Ground complement each other very well. Torterra's STAB Earthquake can plow though some of the most common Pokemon in OU, such as Jirachi and Heatran, while its STAB Wood Hammer removes bulkier Pokemon from play, at the cost of some recoil.</p> <p>Despite its perks, Torterra still has trouble muscling though Skarmory, Forretress, Celebi, and Breloom, all of which are common in the OU metagame. If one plans to use Torterra, be prepared to pack a method of weakening the aforementioned Pokemon, or removing them from play entirely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>With Rock Polish, Torterra becomes a potent late-game threat due to its dual STAB moves and good Attack stat. After a boost, Torterra's abysmal Speed doubles from 232 to 464, allowing it to outpace and OHKO Choice Scarf Heatran and Rotom-A with the appropriate STAB attack. While Grass and Ground may seem like an odd combination of offensive types, they work very well together. Its Grass STAB move KOes bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Vaporeon, while its Ground STAB move takes down most of OU's more offensively oriented Pokemon, such as Infernape and Lucario, before they get the chance to OHKO Torterra or nail it for massive damage. That being said, you may find running Leftovers to be a viable choice as well, as it gives Torterra a bit of longevity and heals off the recoil from Wood Hammer, albeit slowly. However, it should be noted that without Life Orb, Torterra loses out on quite a few notable KOs, such as the OHKO on Vaporeon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A after Stealth Rock, as well as the 2HKO on Gliscor.</p> <p>Max Speed with a Jolly nature places Torterra at 232 Speed, outpacing everything up to and including Adamant Scizor before a Rock Polish, and Pokemon with base 90 Speed holding a Choice Scarf after. Those numbers are important, as many Pokemon in OU try to take advantage of Torterra's low Speed; however, if Speed is of little concern, then an Adamant nature can work as well. With an Adamant nature, Torterra gains the ability to reliably OHKO and 2HKO more Pokemon, such as Suicune, Kingdra, and Blissey, while still maintaining enough Speed to outpace all forms of Heatran. Unfortunately, the boost in power doesn't make much of a difference since Torterra typically cleans up late-game, when the aforementioned Pokemon are normally weakened enough to be KOed regardless of Torterra's nature. With that in mind, Seed Bomb is an alternative option over Wood Hammer if the recoil is unappealing, as it can clean up late-game very nicely once the opposing team is weakened. However, keep in mind that because Grass is mediocre offensively, it's very unlikely that Torterra will need to use Wood Hammer very often. Moreover, Wood Hammer is Torterra's only method of OHKOing Flygon after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The final slot's purpose is to hit either Grass- or Flying-types for more damage. Return is highly recommended as most Flying-types in OU are neutered by Stealth Rock, while opposing Grass-types usually have a reliable method of healing themselves (i.e, Leech Seed, Rest, and Recover). Stone Edge, on the other hand, prevents the likes of Togekiss, Zapdos, and Gyarados from forcing Torterra out. Without it, Zapdos and Togekiss would otherwise stall Torterra out with Roost, or OHKO it with Heat Wave and Air Slash, respectively, while Gyarados can use Torterra as setup fodder thanks to its handy bulk and Intimidate.</p> <p>Torterra has quite a few other options for the final slot. Crunch is Torterra's best move for hitting Celebi, 3HKOing defensive variants and 2HKOing more offensive variants. Double-Edge may add to the amount of recoil damage that Torterra will take, but it should definitely be considered for the chance of KOing 4 HP / 0 Def Zapdos after two switch-ins to Stealth Rock, as well as OHKOing the standard Breloom after it has taken damage from two layers of Spikes. You also have the option of taking 80 EVs from Speed and delegating them to Torterra's HP for a bit of added bulk while still outpacing Choice Scarf Heatran, though despite the investment, there won't be any significant change to the amount of damage that Torterra takes.</p> <p>This set greatly benefits from residual damage so Torterra can KO Pokemon such as Suicune and Kingdra more reliably. Infernape and Metagross can provide Stealth Rock support from the start while almost always preventing the use of Toxic Spikes from Roserade. Heatran can provide Stealth Rock support outside of the lead position very well, especially when running Shuca Berry, effectively bluffing Choice Scarf. If you plan to use Torterra to clean up for a more defensively oriented team, then Forretress is a great partner. Forretress can spin away entry hazards that constantly plague Torterra, and can potentially open up holes in the opposing team with Explosion. Torterra also appreciates having Skarmory, Forretress, Bronzong, Gyarados, and Celebi out of play or weakened, making checks and lures for the aforementioned Pokemon fantastic partners. Choice Specs Kingdra is an excellent choice due to its STAB Hydro Pump OHKOing Skarmory and Forretress as they switch in attempting to sponge its STAB Waterfall and Outrage. Kingdra's STAB Draco Meteor also dents Grass-types to the point where Torterra can finish them off. Tyranitar is another useful partner for Torterra, as it's tremendously powerful and can feign multiple sets. BaitTar and Choice Band Tyranitar, with Fire Blast and Stone Edge, respectively, are very effective for luring Skarmory, Breloom, and Forretress while providing a bit of extra damage with permanent sandstorm.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is the key to this set's success; without it, Torterra will miss out on quite a few KOs, and won't be able to combat Flying-types very well. Heatran is very capable of setting up Stealth Rock, and it resists all of Torterra's weaknesses. Heatran is also able to handle Skarmory, Forretress, Scizor, Celebi, and defensive Rotom-A very well, while Torterra can take on the bulky Waters Heatran commonly lures in. Azelf can set up Stealth Rock as well and has the added benefit of preventing Toxic Spikes from being set up with Taunt, a powerful Explosion to punch holes in your opponent's team, and possibly dual screens to buffer Torterra's already usable bulk. If one's team has a more offensive pace, then one may want to look into Froslass or Smeargle for setting up Spikes. Both Pokemon can set up Spikes reliably and support Torterra with Destiny Bond and Spore, respectively; Froslass can even block Rapid Spin if it comes down to it.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Torterra has a wide array of offensive options to choose from, but only a handful actually work. Body Slam allows Torterra to potentially paralyze Choice Scarf Flygon at the cost of a moveslot. Swords Dance can double Torterra's already decent Attack, allowing it to fire off incredibly powerful Earthquakes and Wood Hammers, but Torterra's Speed is incredibly low, so it will be revenge killed very quickly. Superpower is an option to hit Blissey harder and is Torterra's strongest physical attack against Bronzong, but the stat drops make it a much less appealing option.</p> <p>On the more defensive side, Torterra has access to quite a few support and defensive moves that could potentially work. Leech Seed lets Torterra to heal off damage and abuse entry hazards, but other than boasting an immunity to sandstorm and access to Roar, it's outclassed by other Grass-types in this regard. However, Leech Seed does allow Torterra to heal off residual damage while maintaining its great damage output, so it deserves a mention. Synthesis can work, but the prevalence of sandstorm reduces its usefulness. Since Torterra can force switches somewhat well, Stealth Rock is a viable option if one lacks a reliable user of it. Stockpile is an interesting option, since after a boost, Torterra is capable of surviving even Life Orb Suicune's Ice Beam (assuming 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def with a Careful nature) and can strike back with Wood Hammer. However, it needs a lot of support, such as a Pokemon who can get rid of Toxic Spikes, Wish support, and a cleric. Tickle is another move that Torterra can use in order to force switches, since none of Torterra's common switch-ins enjoy having their Attack and Defense stats dropped a stage. Torterra also has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, giving it quite a bit of added bulk while supporting its team very well.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Skarmory can take any attack from Torterra and either hit it hard with STAB Brave Bird or proceed to set up Spikes and phaze Torterra out with Whirlwind. Bronzong walls Torterra outright, and can hit it very hard with Gyro Ball or Explosion. Grass-types in general cause Torterra problems as they resist both of its main STAB attacks. Breloom in particular can set up a Substitute on Torterra if Return isn't present and fire off its incredibly powerful STAB Focus Punch, or put another Pokemon to sleep with Spore. Forretress can take a few hits from Torterra and either spin away its entry hazards, set up its own, hit Torterra hard with its STAB Gyro Ball, or Explode.</p> <p>After a boost, Torterra can still be revenge killed by Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon and Jirachi, though the former can't hit Torterra hard without locking itself into Outrage or running Fire Blast. Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Togekiss must be wary of Stone Edge, but they otherwise check Torterra well with their respective super effective attacks. Gyarados can safely switch into Earthquake or Rock Polish and threaten Torterra with Ice Fang or Bounce, or set up on Torterra thanks to Intimidate. While defensive Rotom-H can't switch into Wood Hammer or Stone Edge without risking the chance of being 2HKOed, it can switch into Rock Polish or Earthquake safely and either burn Torterra or deliver a fatal blow with Overheat. Scizor can't switch into Earthquake or Stone Edge, but it can deal massive damage with a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or U-turn.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape is an effective attacker in DPP OU due to its combination of good offensive stats, great base 108 Speed, extensive movepool, and excellent offensive typing. These flexible stats allow it to focus on whatever attacking style is needed for the team: it can be mixed, purely physical, or purely special. This flexibility is made possible by its excellent Speed, as it outspeeds Flygon, Jirachi, and Zapdos and forces Gengar and offensive Latias to run maximum Speed to outspeed it. Its Fire / Fighting typing lets it combat many prominent defensive Pokemon in the tier such as Clefable, Tyranitar, Empoleon, Heatran, Bronzong, Skarmory, and Jirachi. Additionally, with its access to U-turn and neutrality to Stealth Rock, Infernape is an effective pivot; it can use U-turn on foes such as Latias and Starmie to maintain momentum. Infernape's movepool is vast; its excellent coverage options such as Grass Knot, Stone Edge, Thunder Punch, and Hidden Power Ice can hit almost every Pokemon in DPP OU super effectively, while it also has both offensive setup moves like Nasty Plot and Swords Dance and strong utility moves such as Taunt and Slack Off. Infernape even has strong priority in Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, allowing it to revenge kill weakened Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Swords Dance Lucario before it can use Extreme Speed. Infernape's ability, Blaze, also gives its Fire-type moves a 50% boost in power when Infernape is at 33% health or lower.</p> <p>Infernape's issues stem from its subpar longevity, the existence of Latias, four-moveslot syndrome, and its defensive stats. Although it is neutral to Stealth Rock, Infernape is otherwise vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well as sand. Infernape's poor defensive typing, in conjunction with its low defensive stats, causes it to struggle to switch in safely, and it is easily worn down when it does get on the field. Although Infernape's attacking stats are solid, oftentimes they are not exceptional enough to OHKO bulkier targets without a boosting item such as Expert Belt, Life Orb, or Choice Band. A notable example is that maximum HP Jirachi is not OHKOed by maximum Special Attack Infernape's Fire Blast without a boosting item. Life Orb and Choice Band either make it faint exceptionally quickly or lock it into an attack, respectively, meaning it needs to take even more residual damage to switch back in if it is walled. Infernape's defensive stats mean that it already is at least 2HKOed by much of the metagame even before residual damage (e.g. sandstorm damage), making it easy prey for various revenge killers such as Gengar, Starmie, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Choice Scarf Lucario. As such, Infernape often relies on either Leftovers or Expert Belt to minimize this residual damage. However, the power output of these items, mainly Leftovers, can be disappointing, and this is made worse by Latias, which outruns and effortlessly walls most Infernape sets without U-turn or a boosted Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, with U-turn alongside an obligatory Fire-type move and Fighting-type move, Infernape frequently cannot fit all of the moves it wants, whether it be Grass Knot for Hippowdon, Swampert and Quagsire, Hidden Power Ice for Dragonite and Gliscor, Slack Off to offset residual damage, or Mach Punch to hit Lucario, Agility Empoleon and Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is one of the most prominent other options, as it can be used with an entirely physical moveset to break through bulkier Pokemon. Such a set struggles to set up and still can be walled fairly easily by Latias, however. Another option is to use Choice Scarf, as Infernape is quite fast and can revenge kill boosted sweepers with its coverage. Infernape has many other coverage moves it can use: Stone Edge can be used on mixed and all fully physical sets, Thunder Punch can hit Gyarados better than anything else, Shadow Claw can be used to hit Latias on Swords Dance sets, and Focus Blast can be used on fully special sets. Beware that it already has trouble fitting its given options, however. Infernape has a fantastic utility movepool, and thus has many options such as Stealth Rock, Encore, Will-O-Wisp, and even Role Play, but it does not have the bulk to really use these effectively. Infernape can use a dedicated lead set with a Focus Sash focused on setting up Stealth Rock, with options such as Fake Out to remove other Focus Sash, Endeavor to bring foes down to low HP, Taunt to prevent setup, U-turn to scout, and many potential offensive moves. Such a set struggles to provide much mid-game utility while struggling to fit everything it wants into its moveset. Infernape has the versatility to use many different items, such as Fist Plate or Flame Plate to always power up its attacks, Passho Berry to survive Water-type attacks, Shuca Berry to survive revenge killing from Earthquake users like Choice Scarf Metagross and Flygon, Lum Berry to mitigate status, and Salac Berry to outspeed everything with a Substitute. However, many of these do not help it against Latias.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Latias</strong>: Latias is the best counter to Infernape in the tier, as it resists both its Fire- and Fighting-type moves, outspeeds it, and can either status or OHKO it. Latias does not appreciate U-turn or a boosted Hidden Power Ice, but Infernape otherwise cannot handle it effectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Infernape is vulnerable to all of sand, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes and neutral to Stealth Rock, which further expose its poor bulk. Status is particularly devastating, as it faints very quickly when inflicted with paralysis or poison from Pokemon such as Jirachi, Latias, Clefable, or Blissey. Often keeping sand and entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, is enough to hamper Infernape, especially if it has a Life Orb or is using Flare Blitz. However, Leftovers and Slack Off do help to mitigate the residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Gyarados, and defensive Starmie are able to take any unboosted attack and OHKO back with Water-type attacks. Starmie is especially threatening due to outspeeding Infernape. Gyarados also is a fantastic answer to Infernape, as its Intimidate weakens Infernape's attacks and can potentially set up on it or just OHKO it with Waterfall. Other Water-types such as Milotic, Swampert, and Kingdra can switch into Fire-type attacks and KO in return. However, all of these need to watch out for the Nasty Plot set, which can survive Water-type attacks with the Passho Berry and KO in return with Grass Knot. While uncommon, Tentacruel and Vaporeon are perhaps some of the best Nasty Plot Infernape answers, as they take little damage from Grass Knot due to their weight.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Bulky Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gliscor can survive Infernape's Close Combat easily and OHKO it in return. Dragonite also resists Fire-type moves and can set up on Infernape, while specially defensive Zapdos and Gliscor survive its attacks. Dragonite and Gliscor should watch out for Hidden Power Ice, and neither Zapdos nor Dragonite enjoys switching in with Stealth Rock up or takes Stone Edge well, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Both Gengar and Rotom-A are immune to Close Combat and hit Infernape hard. Gengar outspeeds Infernape, and a Life Orb Shadow Ball OHKOes Infernape after Stealth Rock, while Choice Scarf Rotom-A can OHKO with Hydro Pump or 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Both should watch out, as they do not take Infernape's Fire-type moves well at all.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Infernape can generally survive one strong neutral hit from full HP, it does not like dealing with faster Pokemon such as Latias, Starmie, Gengar, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Choice Scarf Lucario, as they can easily dispatch it with super effective attacks or after it takes residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: If Infernape lacks Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice, bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon can check Infernape well. However, Nidoqueen is 2HKOed by Fire Blast, while the rest do not enjoy Grass Knot at all.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Infernape's offensive typing and movepool allow it to be an effective mixed attacker. Fire Blast hits physically bulky Steel-types super effectively, OHKOing Skarmory, Metagross, and Jirachi without bulk investment. Overheat is another option, especially with a physically-oriented set to maintain those OHKOs on Metagross and Jirachi. It also is a good option when using Leftovers, as it will guarantee a KO on maximum HP Jirachi after Stealth Rock unlike Fire Blast. Close Combat lets Infernape hammer more specially defensive Steel-types such as Empoleon and Heatran while OHKOing Clefable and Tyranitar, as well as Blissey after Stealth Rock. It is also a strong, perfectly accurate attack that hits neutral targets such as Flygon, Swampert, and Suicune effectively if Infernape lacks the correct coverage move.</p> <p>U-turn lets Infernape pivot effectively, as common checks such as Latias and Starmie are weak to it, and it racks up entry hazard damage on targets such as Gyarados, Gengar, and Dragonite, so their ability to answer Infernape diminishes. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Flygon outright and OHKOes Dragonite and offensive Gliscor after Stealth Rock, and it also hits Latias super effectively. Grass Knot covers Water- and Ground-types, for example OHKOing Swampert and Quagsire with a boosting item and 2HKOing Milotic, Hippowdon, Starmie, and Suicune. Mach Punch gives Infernape priority and helps KO weakened Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Lucario, and Agility Empoleon. Slack Off mitigates residual damage and takes advantage of the many switches that Infernape forces. Using Slack Off gives up the utility of U-turn or the additional coverage of Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Naive or Hasty nature, 192 Speed EVs allow Infernape to outrun positive-nature base 100s, such as Jirachi and Flygon. From there, its Special Attack and Attack EVs can be split up depending on its moveset, its coverage options, and what it needs to deal with. This specific EV spread is for specially based Infernape to maximize its utility from its coverage moves while still handling Clefable, Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Heatran with Close Combat. Without a boosting item, it should run at least 144 Attack EVs to OHKO specially defensive Clefable with Close Combat. From there, the remaining EVs can be dumped into Special Attack. Alternatively, if running mostly physical moves, Infernape should use primarily Attack EVs. A good benchmark for physically based sets is 92 Special Attack EVs, as this allows Infernape to OHKO Jirachi lacking bulk EVs with Overheat. A Speed-boosting nature is usually best to outspeed crucial targets such as offensive Jirachi, mixed Flygon, offensive Zapdos, and Gliscor. However, an Attack- or Special Attack-boosting nature can compensate for its lesser power, especially without Expert Belt or Life Orb. Infernape's nature should lower either of its defenses, but lowering Special Defense is preferred, as it can take physical attacks such as Jirachi's Body Slam and Choice Scarf Lucario's Close Combat with its Defense intact. A Defense-hindering nature helps against Life Orb Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, but surviving physical attacks is preferred.</p> <p>For Infernape's item, Expert Belt offers the best mix between power and survivability. It gives the necessary power boost for targets such as maximum HP Jirachi, Swampert, and Dragonite, and Gliscor without Stealth Rock while not costing 10% of its health every turn. However, it does not boost neutral hits, leaving something to be desired against defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. Life Orb further boosts its power and makes Infernape quite difficult to switch into. Life Orb only gives it a few turns to make an impact, however. Leftovers also is quite helpful, especially with an Attack- or Special Attack-boosting nature. It allows Infernape to mitigate residual damage and stick around to use its coverage moves on more Pokemon. Slack Off can mitigate the residual damage issue with Life Orb, but Infernape can struggle to find times to use it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Infernape's frailty and susceptibility to residual damage mean it should avoid switching in directly, and instead, it should try to get in on a forced switch or U-turn, or after a teammate is KOed. With U-turn, Infernape is quite effective at wearing down its answers in conjunction with Stealth Rock, so even if it can hit the foe super effectively, using U-turn can be good to help wear down the opposing team. Avoid bringing Infernape in too many times early on, as it will get worn down quickly. How Infernape is played depends on its item; with Leftovers, it commonly lures in Dark-weak foes vulnerable to Pursuit trapping such as Gengar, Latias, and Starmie. Take advantage of this to switch in Pursuit Tyranitar to get rid of them. This threat of Pursuit can force the opponent to answer Infernape with Pokemon that do not handle it as well, such as Hippowdon or Choice Scarf Tyranitar. With more offensive items, Infernape should aim to hit as hard as possible for as long as possible; do not be afraid to predict switches, as hitting something super effectively with an Expert Belt or Life Orb boost can be devastating.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Infernape set fits well on more offensive teams, as its coverage and U-turn can help break open defensive cores. One of Infernape's best partners is Tyranitar, as it can Pursuit trap the Dark-weak foes that commonly check Infernape. Alternatively, it can run a Dragon Dance set and set up on these Pursuit-weak Pokemon after they try to switch into Infernape. However, watch out for sand exacerbating Infernape's residual damage. Scizor is another Pursuit trapper that can fit well with Infernape and does not set up sand, and it appreciates Infernape's coverage moves wearing down bulkier Pokemon such as Water-types. It can also form a U-turn core with Infernape or potentially set up with Swords Dance. It also provides a strong check to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, helping Infernape to drop Mach Punch more easily. Infernape enjoys entry hazards to help wear down bulkier Pokemon and make up for its lack of power at times. Skarmory is the premier setter, as it can switch into Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Choice Scarf Flygon and set up Spikes. Roserade is another good choice, as it can switch into Water-types and clears Toxic Spikes, but this pairing struggles to function defensively. Other Spikes attackers, such as offensive Latias, Swampert, mixed Flygon, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, are nice partners too. Choice Specs Latias has good type synergy with Infernape, coming in on Water- and Ground-type attacks and firing off strong attacks, and it can potentially even use Healing Wish to heal Infernape back up. Gengar and Rotom-A can similarly come in immunities and soften up foes for Infernape as well as blocking Rapid Spin from Starmie. Other more offensive partners such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Agility Metagross, and offensive Empoleon appreciate Infernape breaking open common defensive cores. Dragon Dance Gyarados especially likes Infernape potentially putting defensive Latias in KO range of +1 Ice Fang. Other Fighting-type partners such as Breloom, Lucario, and Machamp can work with Infernape to break through Fighting-type checks together.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Infernape can focus fully on physical moves and maximize its utility options. With Flare Blitz, Infernape has a perfectly accurate option to take on Grass- and Steel-types such as Breloom, Shaymin, and Bronzong. Blaze Kick is another option to not suffer from recoil, but beware of the huge power loss and imperfect accuracy. With full Attack investment, Close Combat hits neutral targets hard, negating the need for coverage moves. It also avoids Flare Blitz's recoil, and the two of them cover every Steel-type in the tier besides Heatproof Bronzong. The key to this set is having both Taunt and U-turn, as when defensive Latias switches in on Infernape, it can use Taunt to prevent Latias from healing or statusing Infernape and then pivot out with U-turn, keeping Latias at low health. It also helps against setup threats such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Suicune, stopping them from taking advantage of Infernape. Alternatively, Slack Off gives Infernape additional recovery and helps it survive longer, especially given Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The increased power from 252 Attack EVs lets Infernape more reliably run Leftovers, which lets Infernape offset residual damage effectively. With maximum Speed, it crucially outruns almost all defensive Latias, and dropping Speed by investing more in bulk or using an Adamant nature is generally not recommended.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is meant to be used aggressively to keep offensive momentum, often early in the game. Against defensive Latias, Infernape should use Taunt and then use U-turn to force damage on Latias. Infernape also can lure in and do the same thing to other checks, like Gyarados and Dragonite, as they will typically try to set up on Infernape as it switches. A common option after U-turn is to switch in Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as it can set up on Latias that, thanks to Taunt, are unable to status or phaze it. Taunt can often be quite unexpected on Infernape; try to leverage this to further weaken the foe with U-turn or strong attacks. Even with Leftovers and potentially Slack Off, Infernape cannot directly switch in on much due to its poor bulk and longevity, so it should be brought through revenge kills or predicted switches. However, because it doesn’t need to lower its defenses, it generally survives one strong neutral hit, allowing it to trade KOs effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Infernape set fits best on hyper offense teams due to the aggressive nature of it, though it also can fit on more generic offenses. Infernape appreciates coming in after pivoting without entry hazards set up, meaning fast Taunt leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl are appreciated. Other offensive leads such as Choice Scarf or Focus Sash Breloom and Choice Scarf Roserade can also accomplish this and provide utility. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Gyarados all pair well with Infernape. Tyranitar and Gyarados particularly appreciate defensive Latias being unable to paralyze them or heal with Recover, and Dragonite enjoys Infernape softening defensive walls such as Milotic and Hippowdon. Metagross also makes for a great partner to Infernape, as it can switch into Infernape's most common check, Latias, and either set up on it with Agility or destroy it with Explosion. It also can switch into Gengar once and KO it with Meteor Mash. All of these partners also appreciate Infernape's ability to seriously weaken or KO Steel-types.</p> <p>Bronzong can pair nicely with this Infernape as well, since it can switch in on Dragon-type attacks from Latias and Dragonite and force them out. It also generally survives even boosted physical attacks from attackers such as Gyarados, and it KOes them in return with Explosion. Scizor is another excellent partner, as both its Choice item sets and Swords Dance + Pursuit sets can take great advantage of Latias suffering from Taunt and low health, as they can continually use Pursuit to remove it. Pursuit Tyranitar performs similarly.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Band, Infernape's physical attacks no longer have power issues and generally at least 2HKO foes that don't resist them. Flare Blitz is its most powerful Fire-type move, OHKOing even physically defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock. It also manipulates Infernape into Blaze range earlier, letting it get off an even stronger attack before fainting. It can even potentially 2HKO bulky Fire-resistant Pokemon, such as defensive Latias in Blaze range after Stealth Rock. As Infernape faints very quickly with Flare Blitz, Blaze Kick is another option that still hits hard, but beware of its imperfect accuracy. Close Combat hits especially hard with a Choice Band, 2HKOing walls such as specially defensive Hippowdon, Milotic, Suicune after Stealth Rock, and Swampert. U-turn 2HKOes even physically defensive Latias and Starmie, and it can even OHKO offensive versions of the latter after Stealth Rock. The increased damage from U-turn allows Infernape to 2HKO defensive Flying-types such as Gyarados and Zapdos once they come in again through Stealth Rock. Mach Punch OHKOes Dragon Dance Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and deals a lot of damage to Lucario, Agility Empoleon, and Choice Scarf Heatran. Stone Edge is a useful alternative that allows Infernape to hit Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos hard, potentially KOing them with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Infernape should use 252 Attack EVs and Speed EVs, as it has very little survivability for running defensive EVs. Infernape can use an Adamant nature, as it prominently 2HKOes offensive Gyarados with Close Combat after Intimidate and Stealth Rock, as well as potentially OHKOing offensive Latias after Stealth Rock with U-turn. However, it sorely misses outspeeding Flygon, offensive Jirachi, slower Latias, and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Infernape should generally get in early-game before lots of entry hazards are up and use U-turn on something it forces out, such as Tyranitar, Skarmory, or Clefable. This will generally put most of its checks in 2HKO range of its powerful attacks after Stealth Rock when it comes in again. Infernape often only has a few turns to maximize its impact, so do not be afraid to predict switches or stay in on Pokemon that heavily damage Infernape, as it can generally survive at least one neutral attack at full health. Make sure to manage Infernape's health properly; Blaze-boosted Flare Blitz has immense power and will generally OHKO or come close on anything that doesn't resist it after Stealth Rock, including physically defensive Zapdos, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes is a natural fit with Choice Band Infernape, as it helps to wear down potential checks to Infernape, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Starmie; Infernape can pivot out with U-turn against these Pokemon before bringing in an answer to them, forcing them back out again. Spikes wearing down the opposing team also makes it easier for Infernape to break through it and pick up KOs. Roserade and Skarmory both are great partners for Infernape in this regard. The former can clear Toxic Spikes and resists Water-type attacks, while the latter can switch in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Infernape, and it can thwart setup sweepers with Counter and Whirlwind. Scizor and Tyranitar also make for great partners to Pursuit trap Dark-weak Pokemon such as Latias, Starmie, and Gengar that threaten Infernape, though be mindful that sand from the latter will leave Infernape worn down more quickly. Infernape having U-turn makes this combination especially effective, as it can lure in these checks before switching out and bringing in its Pursuit-using partner. Scizor additionally can form a U-turn-chaining core with Infernape, with them luring in checks for each other, forcing said checks to take entry hazard damage, and then getting themselves out with U-turn.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Latias also makes for a great partner to this Infernape set, as it can revenge kill some of Infernape's main checks in Dragonite and Gyarados, though it has to be wary of a boosted Extreme Speed from the former. Infernape can potentially lure in Dragonite and Gyarados and force them to take Stealth Rock damage before pivoting out into Latias, too. It also greatly appreciates Healing Wish support from Latias, as it will get worn down quickly. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Rotom could be used for its immunity to Extreme Speed from Dragonite and ability to KO even Wacan Berry Gyarados with Stealth Rock up, and it additionally can block attempts to spin away hazards. Swampert and Bronzong also pair well with Infernape for setting up Stealth Rock, and they provide additional measures against Dragon Dance Tyranitar so that Infernape isn't over-relied on. The latter also provides a nice Ground immunity and Dragon resistance for it, while the former can pair well with Infernape to break through common defensive cores while offensively taking advantage of Ground-types. Other offensive Water-types that appreciate pairing with Infernape are Empoleon, Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance Gyarados. Empoleon can set up Stealth Rock and resist Dragon- and Water-type moves for it, and it appreciates Infernape breaking through defensive teams. Suicune and Gyarados similarly appreciate Infernape's wallbreaking capabilities alongside it potentially putting Latias in KO range of +1 Ice-type moves. They also take great advantage of Ground-type Pokemon that scare Infernape, especially Gyarados thanks to its Ground immunity.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Infernape is perhaps the best Nasty Plot user in OU, as it has excellent coverage, and Nasty Plot boosts its Special Attack stat sky high. Fire Blast OHKOes some Infernape checks such as physically defensive Zapdos, Nidoqueen, and physically defensive Hippowdon at +2. With Blaze, it has terrifying power, OHKOing frailer Fire-resistant foes and very bulky Pokemon such as defensive Starmie after Stealth Rock, Flygon, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Clefable most of the time. With Nasty Plot, Grass Knot OHKOes most Water-types and Ground-types after Stealth Rock such as offensive Gyarados, offensive Suicune, Starmie, and Swampert. However, another choice is Hidden Power Ice, as it is Infernape's best option against Latias and Dragonite, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter through Yache Berry after Stealth Rock. Despite being weak, Vacuum Wave provides a priority attack, OHKOing Lucario, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Magneton after Stealth Rock. Infernape could instead opt for Close Combat to OHKO Clefable, Blissey, and Tyranitar without boosting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>If Infernape doesn't have Close Combat, the simple listed EV spread works best. With Close Combat, an EV spread of 144 Atk / 172 SpA / 192 Spe with a Naive nature is recommended, as Infernape will OHKO specially defensive Clefable and outspeed Flygon, Zapdos, and Jirachi. A Passho Berry maximizes Infernape's offensive potential, as it can survive weaker Water-type moves and either set up if its faster or OHKO faster Water-types like Starmie in return with Grass Knot. Lum Berry is another option, as Infernape despises paralysis and poison while also letting it switch into Breloom's Spore. It also lets it set up on walls such as Clefable, Blissey, and Jirachi trying to paralyze it. Alternatively, Life Orb can make Infernape's Nasty Plot-boosted attacks even more powerful. Running Life Orb also alleviates the need to invest in Attack to KO Clefable if running Close Combat. Infernape finds it quite hard to set up Nasty Plot without Passho Berry or Lum Berry, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Infernape's frailty means that it must time Nasty Plot carefully, as it will only get one or two opportunities to use it. Infernape's ability to consistently force switches gives it good opportunities to use Nasty Plot. Without Hidden Power Ice, it cannot beat Latias, meaning it should be dealt with before Infernape comes out. Both Nasty Plot and Passho Berry are often unexpected from Infernape, so leverage this to break through teams once Latias is sufficiently weakened or KOed. Manage Infernape's health carefully, as +2 Fire Blast in Blaze range is ridiculously strong and can even 2HKO defensive Latias.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Infernape best fits on hyper offensive teams, as common sweepers can consistently weaken Latias and enjoy how Infernape can break through Water-types. Dragon Dance Gyarados, especially with Outrage, is a fantastic choice to lure in and OHKO defensive Latias; with a Wacan Berry, it can heavily damage Choice Scarf users such as Latias, Flygon, and Lucario that can revenge kill Infernape. Alternatively, Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit can trap and KO Latias, and it can handle Gengar with Bullet Punch. Other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Dragonite are also good partners, as they appreciate Infernape potentially luring in and KOing Choice Scarf Lucario and Water-types. In return, Tyranitar can answer Latias, and Dragonite can potentially KO Choice Scarf revenge killers with a boosted Extreme Speed. Other Tyranitar sets such as Choice Scarf can Pursuit trap Latias, Starmie, Gengar, and Rotom-A for Infernape. Infernape also enjoys entry hazards not being up, so it enjoys Taunt leads such as Aerodactyl and Azelf or other leads that incapacitate Stealth Rock users such as Choice Scarf or Focus Sash Breloom and Choice Scarf Roserade. Other offensive Pokemon common on hyper offensive teams such as Metagross, offensive Empoleon, mixed Jirachi, and Lucario can help Infernape sweep. All of these are Steel-types that can deal with Latias and enjoy Infernape potentially luring in and KOing Water-types: Metagross can either KO Latias with Explosion or Meteor Mash or set up Agility to attempt a sweep, while Empoleon and Lucario form potent offensive cores with Infernape. Mixed Jirachi sets appreciate Infernape breaking through walls so it can sweep.</p>"

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Empoleon's excellent Water / Steel typing, well-rounded stats, and decent movepool make it a great Pokemon in the DPP landscape. Its unique typing provides it with key resistances such as Dragon and Water, which makes Empoleon the only Pokemon in the metagame that resists both of Kingdra's STAB moves in addition to Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor + Surf combination. Its Dark and Rock resistances also enable it to take on both of Tyranitar's STAB moves while also providing it with a Stealth Rock resistance. Empoleon also has the distinction of being a fantastic answer to Jirachi, as it resists both Iron Head and Body Slam and is not weak to Fire Punch. Empoleon has access to the most powerful Hydro Pump of all OU Pokemon; when it's boosted by its ability Torrent, Empoleon can deliver unrivaled power on the field, making it even more threatening in a metagame where usual teams are suffering from a lack of a real Water-type resistance. Empoleon is usually seen as an offensive powerhouse thanks to its access to Agility, which, paired with its high Special Attack and good coverage, turns it into a fearsome sweeper. However, outside of its ability Torrent, Empoleon has no means to boost its Special Attack, which can prevent it from hitting some Pokemon hard enough. Finally, Empoleon also has access to utility moves like Stealth Rock, Roar, and even Knock Off, which is a big tool against defensive teams. Its low Speed stat is one of its main cons; Empoleon has to run a Timid nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon, which is not always ideal because it usually wants all the power it can have. While it can take special hits effectively thanks to its good bulk, Empoleon is vulnerable to common coverage types in the metagame, such as Ground, Fighting, and Electric.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chople Berry is an alternative on the Agility set; however, it remains very team dependent, inferior, and not as useful as other Berries like Shuca and Wacan, because even with Chople Berry, Empoleon is not taking Fighting-type moves from the likes of Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario that well. Alternatively, a mid-game Chople Berry set with Stealth Rock can stand against the likes of Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario and still keeps up against Jirachi and Latias. Yawn can be used as a filler move over Stealth Rock on a mid-game set, forcing switches and enabling Empoleon to try catching some KOs. RestTalk and Aqua Ring are options on the specially defensive set to improve Empoleon's longevity in providing it some sort of extra recovery; however, you will need to drop moves like Protect and Stealth Rock to make room for them. Icy Wind and Feather Dance find their use against setup sweepers like Gyarados that would like to set up on Empoleon for free. Feather Dance is also great in conjunction with entry hazards on the specially defensive set to force out physical attackers. The Choice Specs set can make room for Sleep Talk; however, it really wants all the four moves it has already.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Rotom-A and Flygon can revenge kill Empoleon even after one Agility with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Latias can use Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, or even Trick to lock Empoleon into Ice Beam, which completely invalidates it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Clefable and Blissey are both extremely annoying for Empoleon; the former can stall out Hydro Pump's PP with a combination of Soft-Boiled and potentially Protect, while the latter can cripple Empoleon with Thunder Wave and will never faint to Hydro Pump. Specially defensive Jirachi is at best 3HKOed by Empoleon's Hydro Pump, and it can chain Wishes and Protects and stall out Hydro Pump while crippling Empoleon with Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Waters</strong>: Among all the Pokemon resisting Water-type moves, Abomasnow is one of the most irritating. In addition to its good bulk and lack of a weakness to Ice Beam, its hail means Empoleon is consistently chipped down. Abomasnow can also use Leech Seed and Protect to easily stay healthy and make Empoleon completely worthless. Funnily enough, specially defensive Empoleon is a good check to its own Agility set, as it takes very little damage from Grass Knot and can eventually phaze it with Roar. Calm Mind Latias potentially walls Empoleon if it boosts up too much, meaning Empoleon has to rely on an Ice Beam freeze if Latias gets out of control. It is worth mentioning that Milotic, Suicune, and Starmie all wall SubPetaya Empoleon because it lacks Grass Knot. Lastly, despite the fact that Vaporeon is rarely seen, it remains obnoxious for Empoleon to deal with, as it takes almost nothing from Grass Knot due to its low weight.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Magnezone is a situational check to Empoleon. Against the Agility set, it can come in at full health, tank a Hydro Pump, and revenge kill it with Thunderbolt, while it outspeeds the specially defensive set and does not take enough damage from Surf.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Empoleon's Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type weaknesses allow the most popular and strongest powerhouses of the tier to take advantage of it. Zapdos threatens all Empoleon sets with Thunderbolt and can check it pretty nicely if it's heavily invested in Special Defense. Thunder Jirachi 2HKOes most Empoleon sets without bulk investment and can significantly reduce its effectiveness with paralysis. Fighting-types like Infernape, Lucario, and Breloom can force Empoleon out with their STAB attacks, especially if they are running Mach Punch and Empoleon is at low health. Gengar nails Empoleon with Focus Blast, while offensive Starmie does enough damage with Thunderbolt to scare Empoleon out. Tyranitar is usually bulky enough to take one hit from Empoleon and damage it back with either Superpower or Earthquake. Finally, Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and even offensive Bronzong can deal tremendous damage to Empoleon with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Empoleon is one of the best leads in the DPP OU metagame. Its ability to quickly put pressure against both offensive and defensive teams while being able to set up Stealth Rock makes it a tremendous lead.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is Empoleon's primary STAB move, which deals significant damage to almost everything in the metagame, even some Pokemon that resist it like Breloom and Starmie. Thanks to its high Special Attack, Empoleon is able to 2HKO common leads like Metagross, Machamp, Jirachi, and Azelf or weaken a Pokemon that switches in. Grass Knot is a near-mandatory coverage move for Empoleon, as it enables it to hit Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie super effectively, which means Empoleon will consistently maintain Stealth Rock against the best spinner of OU. Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, Gyarados, and Kingdra are other targets Empoleon much appreciates being able to hit. Empoleon is a fantastic Stealth Rock setter; its favorable matchup against a lot of leads helps it get Stealth Rock up easily most of the time, and its coverage moves paired with its powerful Hydro Pump can be difficult to switch into for both offensive teams and defensive teams. None of the leads like Jirachi, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar want to take a Hydro Pump, so they're usually forced to switch out, leaving themselves subject to the opposing offensive pressure and giving up the chance to set up their own Stealth Rock early. On top of that, thanks to its Focus Sash, Empoleon will always avoid any KO while also getting in Torrent range, even against Clefable's Seismic Toss, which is a 4HKO. Aqua Jet serves as an all-purpose priority STAB move that is used to finish off Focus Sash leads like Azelf and Metagross or just getting overall chip damage that might come in handy later on, such as against Heatran and Gengar. Ice Beam is an additional coverage move mainly used to hit Dragonite, Latias, and Grass-types such as Breloom, Shaymin, and Celebi super effectively, which resist Empoleon's Water / Grass coverage. Lastly, Knock Off is another option that helps cripple potential early-game switch-ins like defensive Jirachi, Clefable, Blissey, Latias, and Grass-types like Celebi and Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature enable Empoleon to hit as hard as possible, while the remaining 252 EVs go in Speed so Empoleon can outspeed major threats such as Machamp and Speed tie with fast Swampert. While Modest looks like the best nature, Rash is another option that doesn't compromise Aqua Jet's power, which can help get nice chip damage on Pokemon like Heatran and Gengar. Keep in mind that generally it's not worth minimizing Empoleon's Special Defense, though, since it is likely to take one or two hits from the likes of Latias and Suicune. Timid is not an option because Empoleon wants to deal as much damage as possible to Pokemon like Jirachi and Clefable, which wouldn't be nearly as pressured without a Special Attack-boosting nature. Focus Sash fits Empoleon perfectly, as it allows it to tank any hit from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A and Flygon and strike back with a Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If you're facing a lead that is very threatening to your whole team like Machamp or Zapdos that can be pain to deal with for offense, you might want to throw a Hydro Pump immediately to weaken or even KO them. However, know that this implies that you won't be able to set up Stealth Rock. In easier matchups, usually set up Stealth Rock turn 1 and throw out the appropriate attack to weaken the opposing lead. Keep in mind the synergy between Focus Sash and Torrent; once Empoleon activates its Focus Sash, it gets in Torrent range, which means it is able to fire off a powerful Hydro Pump that almost nothing can stand. Against offensive teams, if you manage to keep your Empoleon alive against the opposing lead, try to preserve it as fodder, which may turn out pretty useful to regain momentum. Empoleon's resistances also allow it to come into the field multiple times, and it may find opportunities to throw out attacks or set Stealth Rock back up if needed. Against more defensive teams, Empoleon tends to be chipped down much more slowly, so try to manage its health as much as you can in order to use Torrent to your advantage and put pressure on foes like Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi that should typically check Empoleon. If Empoleon is in Torrent range, try to bring it on the field on a predicted switch or once the enemy is forced to use a recovery move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to Empoleon's versatility, it pairs well with many different Pokemon. Teammates that benefit from the early offensive pressure and momentum set up by Empoleon are much appreciated. Dragon Dance sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite help in keeping up the offensive pressure, especially if Empoleon has weakened the opponent's Latias or Water-types. Jirachi is very useful to those typical offensive teams, since it can run various sets and support its team at its convenience. It's one of the few Pokemon on offense that keeps in check all of Lucario, Scizor, Starmie, and Tyranitar and also takes on Dragon-types and opposing Jirachi well. Tyranitar is very desirable because it traps both Latias and Rotom-A and supplies defensive utility in keeping up against Pokemon like Zapdos and Starmie, which otherwise would be too much to deal with. Latias provides wonderful support on offense, keeping up against Pokemon like Breloom and Infernape defensively without compromising offensive pressure with its Choice sets. Bronzong not only provides a great defensive backbone thanks to its typing and defensive stats but also can act as late-game cleaner with Trick Room, which goes well with Choice Band Tyranitar. Gengar brings immunities to Fighting and Ground to the table and is able to disrupt both offensive and defensive teams with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, or even Explosion. Kingdra, Swampert, and Suicune are other great teammates more focused on stacking Water-types and overloading the opposing Water-type checks. Finally, because sometimes Empoleon may not be able to set up its Stealth Rock against very specific leads like Machamp and Zapdos, you may want a second Stealth Rock setter in your team like Jirachi or Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set allows Empoleon to compensate for its low Speed and become a terrifying sweeper.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is the best STAB option due to its high Base Power; Surf is a possibility if you prefer a 100% accurate move, but it might miss out on damage on key targets like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Rotom, Metagross, and Bronzong. Ice Beam covers Dragon- and Grass-types like Latias, Dragonite, Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin, while Grass Knot deals with Water-types such as Swampert, Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic. Paired with Empoleon's Water-type STAB attack, this move combination provides unresisted coverage in the metagame. Finally, Substitute can be used over Grass Knot, but it should always be used with Petaya Berry. With this move, the idea is to set up Agility and keep using Substitute until both Petaya Berry and Torrent activate, which makes Empoleon more threatening than ever. However, keep in mind that this option is less reliable and will be less consistent overall, since it gives up Grass-type coverage, and if Empoleon is in Petaya Berry range, this means it's also in range of priority attacks. Hidden Power Electric is another option that should be used only if you're really weak to Gyarados and can't afford to let it set up; it's overall worse than Grass Knot, because Empoleon now can't hit Swampert as hard anymore and becomes weaker against Pokemon like Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack maximize Empoleon's damage output, and 252 EVs in Speed make it as fast as possible after one Agility. A Modest nature is the way to go most of the time because of the higher power it gives to Empoleon, ensuring it can 3HKO Pokemon like Clefable and Bronzong and do significant more damage to bulky Jirachi. That said, Timid is also a pretty decent choice because it allows Empoleon to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon after one Agility, which can end up sealing a game. Overall, a Modest nature looks better if you have Tyranitar's Pursuit support, while Timid doesn't necessarily require it. Shuca Berry is incredibly useful because it enables Empoleon to take an Earthquake from the likes of Choice Scarf Flygon, Dragonite, Gyarados, Swampert, Tyranitar, and Metagross. On the other hand, Wacan Berry ensures that Empoleon survives a Thunderbolt from Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Magnezone.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, because it rarely sweeps teams on its own, you want to scout and weaken the opposing team a bit if you're aiming for an Empoleon late-game sweep. Weakening Steel-types such as Jirachi, Magnezone, Bronzong, and Metagross and Pokemon like Clefable, Tyranitar, and Latias helps in that regard. Try to keep your Empoleon hidden and healthy for the most part of the game, and wait for the ideal moment to bring it out. The best way to take advantage of Empoleon is to bring it on a Choice-locked Pokemon like Outrage-locked Flygon, Crunch- or Pursuit-locked Tyranitar, or Choice-locked Latias. Since Empoleon has good bulk and good resistances, it can also afford to take a hit from anything, which is even more doable if it has a Berry that halves damage from a super effective move. Due to its low Speed, using Agility once will not make Empoleon faster than Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Rotom-A, Latias, and Jirachi, so sometimes it will have to find opportunities to set up a second Agility to outrun those.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that help in making Empoleon's sweep easier are more than valued. Tyranitar is a big one, as it is able to Pursuit trap both Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Latias, which are thorns in Empoleon's side. Heatran and Gengar are both amazing at pressuring Pokemon like Jirachi, Clefable, and Blissey; the former can use Magma Storm and Taunt or Explosion to get rid of Clefable and Blissey, while the latter can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple specially defensive Jirachi or effectively lure Clefable and Blissey and take them out with Explosion. Gengar also can force Pokemon like Flygon to use Outrage, which opens the gates for Empoleon. Breloom, in the same vein, is excellent at taking advantage of special walls like Clefable and Blissey, especially if paired with Tyranitar, which has great synergy with it. Because Empoleon is usually susceptible to priority moves like Mach Punch from the likes of Breloom and Infernape, Chople Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar does a good job luring in and removing those for Empoleon. Pokemon like Kingdra and Suicune help as well in forcing Jirachi and Clefable to take serious damage. Lastly, Choice Specs Latias can drop powerful Draco Meteors on opposing special walls while also threatening to shut down a defensive Pokemon with Trick. In case Empoleon gets weakened early or gets afflicted with status, Healing Wish Latias can be used and bring Empoleon back to full health.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Despite being a powerful offensive Pokemon, Empoleon is also a fantastic special wall thanks to its great typing, very good Special Defense, and ability to check Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latias, Jirachi, Heatran, Suicune, and most notably Kingdra.</p> <p>Surf is Empoleon's best move for offensive pressure on this set. Protect enables Empoleon to gain additional Leftovers recovery, which is valuable as its only form of recovery, as well as scouting Choiced Pokemon like Tyranitar, Latias, Flygon, and Rotom. Roar is very useful to phaze Pokemon like Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance Kingdra and overall allow Empoleon to be less passive. Knock Off is an alternative and like Roar gives Empoleon a less passive presence on the field. Knock Off is excellent in long and slow-paced games; Empoleon can cripple Jirachi, Suicune, Starmie, Clefable, and pretty much anything with Leftovers, preventing passive recovery and allowing its team to start making progress. Empoleon's ability to be a great Stealth Rock setter is improved here thanks to Leftovers recovery and bulk investment. Toxic can be used to chip Pokemon like Starmie, Milotic, Kingdra, and Suicune more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investing 252 EVs in HP and Special Defense as well as providing Empoleon with a Calm nature ensures that it can perform its defensive role perfectly, as it wants to combat Starmie, Heatran, Latias, and Kingdra as well as possible. You could put in some Defense EVs to take on Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bronzong better or even some Special Attack EVs to do more damage to the likes of Jirachi, Skarmory, and Tyranitar. Leftovers is the mandatory item here, being the best and only form of recovery for Empoleon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You can lead with this Empoleon, since it performs well for the most part against the common leads; just make sure that you have backup options for Metagross, Machamp, and Zapdos leads. Set up Stealth Rock turn 1 most of the time, since almost nothing really prevents Empoleon from doing that, and Pokemon like Azelf may be reluctant to use Taunt in fear of a Hydro Pump. Switch Empoleon into powerful special attackers like Choice Specs Latias, Kingdra, and Suicune, and use the opportunity to use Roar or Knock Off to cripple the opposing team. Protect should be used relatively often, as it's important to keep Empoleon as healthy as possible. However, try to not use it too much and become too predictable in this aspect, as Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Dragonite may come in on a telegraphed Protect and scare Empoleon out. You can use Empoleon to pivot against Gengar's Shadow Ball and throw out a Surf if it's in its KO range; it's also worth knowing that this Empoleon is one of the best defensive answers to Jirachi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Empoleon does require some support, since it's too passive against setup sweepers and defensive teams. Empoleon's teammates should try to lessen the impact of its numerous weaknesses and the potential setup it would allow while also providing solid countermeasures against defensive cores to compensate for its mediocre matchup against Clefable and the free momentum it can give. That said, for a great defensive synergy, teammates should mainly try covering Fighting-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves, as Empoleon's slowness makes it prone to being exploited by the strongest powerhouses of the tiers, such as Dragonite and Gyarados. Skarmory, which is one of the greatest physical walls, is an excellent option, and setting up Spikes is big for compensating for Empoleon's passiveness. Nidoqueen brings an Electric immunity as well as a Fighting resistance and sets up Toxic Spikes, while bulky Latias provides a ton of resistances and can synergize well with Spikes support and Roar. Choice Scarf Rotom-A gets the jump on dangerous foes like Infernape and Dragon Dance sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite that Empoleon fears. It also blocks Rapid Spin, while RestTalk variants can absorb Breloom's Spore and Superpower to compensate for Empoleon's slowness. On the other hand, Gengar brings similar defensive utility and threatens defensive teams especially with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes support. Wish users such as Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable are valuable, as they give Empoleon way more longevity. You also need some sort of pressure outside of entry hazards, or Clefable will just sit on your team all day. Gliscor is an amazing stallbreaker that also provides great defensive utility against Pokemon like Lucario, Dragonite, and Tyranitar. Gengar, as mentioned previously, gives defensive teams a hard time while providing a countermeasure to Infernape and Breloom. Breloom takes advantage of Clefable wonderfully, while Calm Mind Latias and Calm Mind Clefable are both great wincons against defensive teams. Furthermore, Clefable and Breloom can also absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-A, which Empoleon should try to avoid. Lastly, Tyranitar is big because its sand synergizes really well with Empoleon's typing and helps making good progress in the game, while it also helps in the hazard game by trapping opposing Starmie.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Empoleon's taking another approach with this set, maximizing its raw power with Choice Specs.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is simply devastating; with Choice Specs, Empoleon has a chance of OHKOing maximum HP Metagross, always takes out Azelf leads, and turns the tables against bulky Jirachi and bulky Bronzong by turning a low chance of a 2HKO into a very guaranteed one. One of the main assets that Choice Specs Empoleon brings compared to regular sets shows against Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi; the former faces a guaranteed 2HKO, while the latter gets heavily damaged, which is huge because it can't come in freely on Hydro Pump anymore. Anything that does not resist Water will get swallowed up by a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, and even Pokemon that do resist it like Breloom, Starmie, uninvested Suicune, and Latias are still taking a ton of damage. Surf is the second best STAB option, which is less destructive but still very good in terms of power thanks to Choice Specs. It's also safer to spam than Hydro Pump thanks to its perfect accuracy and higher PP. Ice Beam covers Latias and Grass-types like Celebi and Shaymin, which resist Empoleon's Water-type STAB attacks, while Grass Knot destroys the Water-types that resist Ice- and Water-type coverage such as Milotic and Suicune. The extra power on Ice Beam and Grass Knot is key in securing the 2HKO on Pokemon like Kingdra and Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximize Empoleon's power with 252 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature in order to hit as hard as possible; it's absolutely crucial to maintain its benchmarks against Jirachi and Clefable and deal as much damage as possible against them. The remaining EVs go into its Speed in order to outrun as many Pokemon as possible. Note that a few EVs in HP may be useful to improve the odds of taking a Thunderbolt from Rotom-A or just to help against the likes of Jirachi and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Every time you have Empoleon on the field, fire off powerful attacks depending on what you are facing. Since this set should be used as a lead, you can use it to throw powered-up Water-type STAB attacks early-game and chip Empoleon's typical checks. If you're facing an offensive team, the first safe switch-in to a Choice Specs Hydro Pump is usually Latias. If you're facing a defensive team, odds are the first switch-in will be Clefable, which gets destroyed by Hydro Pump thanks to the surprise factor that Choice Specs Empoleon provides; the remaining possible best switch-ins are going to be Milotic, bulky Latias, and bulky Suicune. Depending on what foes have been revealed and the state of the game, you might want to click other moves and predict a bit, such as to take out Latias with Ice Beam or Suicune with Grass Knot. Use Empoleon's great typing to switch around resisted moves and find opportunities to throw as many attacks as you can in the middle of the game. Try to manage its health as much as possible to possibly enter Torrent range, which will make it devastating, especially against slow teams that might have a hard time forcing it out immediately.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar has very good synergy with Choice Specs Empoleon because it can trap both Latias and Blissey, two of the few Pokemon that are able to switch into a Choice Specs Hydro Pump, and its sand is huge for negating Leftovers from the likes of Milotic and Suicune. Jirachi can spread paralysis with Body Slam very nicely to support Empoleon and compensate for its low Speed, which prevents it from being fully threatening against fast teams. Since this Empoleon should lead, make sure that you have a good backup against Electric-types like Rotom-A and Zapdos; Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Swampert, and bulky Tyranitar are all great for that purpose. Empoleon appreciates having a teammate that can pivot at least once against Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves like Latias, Rotom-A, and Gengar, since this Empoleon has to lock itself into a move and will be easily forced out. Pokemon like Choice Specs Kingdra and Suicune help keep up Empoleon's offensive pressure with more strong Water-type attacks. Finally, Healing Wish Latias can give Empoleon a second life if it gets weakened badly.</p>"

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting good Attack and Speed coupled with great type coverage, Staraptor is a viable physical attacker in OU play. Intimidate is a great ability on Staraptor, as it helps it switch in on physical hits much easier to compensate for its rather miserable defenses. Staraptor really shines out of all the Normal- / Flying-type hybrids because of Intimidate and a Fighting-type move in Close Combat to beat opposing Steel- and Rock-types. Dodrio and Swellow lack a strong Fighting-type move to budge these Steel- and Rock-types and this is probably the main reason why Staraptor is on a different level. You might find the results to be a bit mediocre due to its Stealth Rock weakness; however, Staraptor can still be a potent threat when used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used in conjunction with Agility but it has no room on the other sets. If Life Orb is used with the SubRoost set, Staraptor's HP would run down far too quickly. Feather Dance is an interesting option but Staraptor shouldn't go near that move because it is far better at sweeping than running a defensive set.</p> <p>In theory, Foresight can help Staraptor use its Normal-type STAB moves against Ghost-type Pokemon. An Adamant Staraptor with Life Orb under its belt can deal 60.20% - 71.05% on a max HP / max Defense Rotom with Double-Edge. Rotom-A is a trouble to deal with, and this is one way to actually penetrate through them with a STAB move. Though not recommended, you don't have to maximize your Speed, but a minimum of 296 Speed is required to outspeed Jolly Heracross, or 319 Speed for Jolly Electivire. Any remaining EVs should go into HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross and Bronzong resist both STAB moves, have high Defense, and are neutral to Close Combat, making all four of them excellent choices against Staraptor. Rhyperior's massive HP and Defense, coupled with his Solid Rock ability, which reduces his Fighting weakness, also makes him a good counter.</p> <p>Although they get hit hard by Brave Bird, Ghosts are often good switch-ins thanks to their immunity to both Close Combat and Return/Double-Edge. They can cripple Staraptor with Will-O-Wisp or simply attack him with super effective attacks like Thunderbolt (Gengar, Rotom-A, Mismagius), Thunder Punch, or Ice Punch (Dusknoir). Rotom-A makes an excellent counter, resisting Brave Bird and taking nothing from Return and Close Combat, whilst also being able to shrug off Staraptor's U-turn. Rotom can then hit back with Thunderbolt. Zapdos resists both Brave Bird and Close Combat, and easily kills Staraptor with Thunderbolt, but it must watch out from a Choice Band Double-Edge which can OHKO Zapdos with Stealth Rock in play.</p> <p>Otherwise, just try to outpredict him as he'll usually be restricted by Choice Band/Scarf.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Staraptor's good Speed and Attack stats make it a good candidate for a Choice Band set. Intimidate makes him a good choice as a lead and helps when sending him out later, just don't get too over zealous when switching into physical attacks; his defenses are still poor. Brave Bird and Return / Double-Edge provides raw power, while Close Combat rounds off the coverage. U-turn allows Staraptor to scout.</p> <p>Brave Bird and Return / Double-Edge are his main weapons and both hit incredibly hard, while Close Combat hits for at least neutral damage on every Rock- and Steel-type. The STAB Normal attacks are mostly for Electric-types, especially Zapdos, who also resists Fighting. Double-Edge guarantees an OHKO on Zapdos, but Return is usually preferable as two recoil moves is rather excessive, let alone when paired with a Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p>The fourth slot is the sort of \"utility\" move. U-turn allows you to scout your counter and get in a hit, while Pursuit is always a great move on Choice Banders and Staraptor makes good use of it. It's especially good against the likes of Celebi and Blissey, who will run, fearing a Brave Bird. Quick Attack is for protection against Reversal/Flail users and to take down other weakened but faster foes. It does upwards of 45% to the likes of Azelf, Raikou, and Weavile (just be careful of Weavile using Ice Shard).</p> <p>Like most Choice Banders, Staraptor will benefit from Wish support, but it's even more essential with Staraptor due to the recoil of Brave Bird and Double-Edge. To varying degrees, Jirachi, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Umbreon can work. Rapid Spin support--Starmie and Forretress are excellent choices for this--to remove Stealth Rock will also aid his survivability.</p> <p>Not many physical walls can switch in because if Staraptor wields a Choice Band, its Attack skyrockets to 558 or 508, depending on the nature you select. In addition to this, Staraptor has fantastic coverage which means that not many physical walls can switch in to its dangerous STAB moves. Rotom-A is your safest switch in to this set; resisting both of Staraptor's STAB moves while shrugging off Pursuit or U-turn. Acknowledge the sets and begin to counter Rotom-A. If they are the special attacking versions, Snorlax and Blissey is your best bet to stop these guys because they have fantastic bulk to weather the attacks from Rotom-A. Choiced Rotom will usually have Trick under their sleeves to screw up Blissey and Snorlax; therefore, Heatran can be great to absorb Trick and Will-O-Wisp, while Jolteon can partner well to take Thunderbolt and cushion Shadow Ball due its decent Special Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous set, Choice Scarf trades the extra power of a Choice Band for extra Speed to make Staraptor faster than many would-be revenge-killers. Sporting an impressive 427 Speed and 372 Attack, this Staraptor forces you to think twice before switching in due to its solid Attack and great type coverage. On top of all this, Intimidate really puts the icing on the cake because it allows Staraptor to switch in on physical attacks much easier. Don't get too cocky switching in on physical attackers though, especially those of the highest caliber, because Staraptor still has a poor Defense stat even with Intimidate factored in. Like the previous set, this one provides optimal coverage, which is only resisted by Rotom-A. Pursuit allows Staraptor to deal with weakened Rotom-A.</p> <p>Staraptor is a great offensive threat because of its high powered dual STAB attacks. Brave Bird, Return, and Double-Edge all wield more than 100 Base Power and can harm anything in Staraptor's way. The choices for your Normal-type STAB move is totally your choice. Return provides good damage without attaining any recoil damage, while Double-Edge gives the additional damage in exchange for some HP. Rock- and Steel-types can be quite upsetting because they resist Staraptor's precious STAB attacks, but thankfully, Staraptor has Close Combat under its belt which covers both types, and gives Staraptor some good overall type coverage. Your selection for your final move depends on what you decide to do with Staraptor. U-turn allows Staraptor to scout out for incoming counters while you exit and bring in an appropriate Pokemon to plow through your opponent's counter to Staraptor. Pursuit, on the other hand, plays a different role than U-turn. Pursuit traps those pesky Ghost-types and catches fleeing special walls like Blissey.</p> <p>Staraptor can often find good opportunities to switch in, but Stealth Rock hinders this bird from repeatedly switching in and out. Staraptor will greatly appreciate Rapid Spin users to remove the offending Rocks, thus providing extra survivability for Staraptor. Speaking of living longer, like many Choice users, Staraptor needs Wish support to help it stay alive. Double-Edge and Brave Bird's recoil, as well as Stealth Rock damage, can chip off Staraptor's HP more quickly than is comfortable, and therefore Wish users like Hypno, Chansey, and Blissey can help Staraptor. Staraptor doesn't mind Stealth Rock on the field to help it sweep late game.</p> <p>With the swap for Speed in exchange for power, Staraptor is going to lack the raw power to muscle through some bulky Pokemon. Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong are great counters for Staraptor because these individuals resist both of its beloved STAB moves and they are neutral to Close Combat. With all these Steel-types being listed, packing Magnezone can really be a good service alongside Staraptor. Magnezone can trap Skarmory without Shed Shell and strike back with Thunderbolt or use Magnet Rise to dodge Ground-type moves.</p> <p>Rotom-A is arguably the greatest counter to Staraptor. It can take all of Staraptor's attacks and strike back with Will-O-Wisp or Thunderbolt. Heatran is probably the best partner for Staraptor to handle these annoying ghouls. Heatran can take Will-O-Wisp, survive a Thunderbolt, and dispose them with a STAB Fire-type attack, but Scarf variants should watch out for a rare but possible Thunder Wave.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With Life Orb, Staraptor trades survivability and raw power for the freedom to switch between attacks. With this freedom, Staraptor can abuse its high Base Power attacks and attempt a sweep with its excellent type coverage. When Staraptor is at low health, simply use Roost to alleviate damage and continue your rampage.</p> <p>Like on any of its other sets, Brave Bird and Close Combat are mandatory due to their great coverage in just two moves and immense power. Return is the main option for the third slot as it provides consistent, reliable damage and is boosted by STAB, making it a strong option for picking off frail and weakened enemies. Roost is also given a slot to compensate for residual damage Staraptor may suffer, such as Stealth Rock damage and recoil from Life Orb and Brave Bird.</p> <p>Essentially, the choice between an Adamant and Jolly nature is up to the user's preference. Whereas a Jolly Nature enables Staraptor to tie with and possibly come out on top against positive-natured base 100's such as Zapdos and Jirachi, an Adamant nature can be used for the added power. A Jolly nature is almost always the better option for being able to attack faster Pokemon before Staraptor's weak defenses suffer a hit. To illustrate the effectiveness of Life Orb Staraptor, some calculations assuming a Jolly nature are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 252 HP / 220 Def Bold Celebi: 88.1% - 104%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 240 HP / 216 Def Relaxed Swampert: 48.1% - 56.9%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Suicune: 62.6% - 74%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 188 HP / 252 Def Bold Vaporeon: 52.9% - 62.5%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Brave Bird vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Neutral Gliscor: 56.2% - 66.4%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Blissey: 81.5% - 96.1%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Heatran: 94.7% - 111.5%</li> <li>Jolly Life Orb Close Combat vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Neutral Jirachi: 46.8% - 55.3%</li> </ul> <p>As with the Choice Band set, not a lot of Pokemon can safely switch into Staraptor due to the pure power of Staraptor's moves. Even bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Swampert and Vaporeon, are not safe from Brave Bird's chance to 2HKO. Only Rotom-A resists or is immune to all of Staraptor's moves and can cripple Staraptor with Thunderbolt, Discharge, or Will-O-Wisp. Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross can survive Close Combat and can use their choice of move to remove Staraptor. This Staraptor set also has issues with being revenge killed by Pokemon that carry a Choice Scarf, such as Jirachi and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Life Orb Starmie is the number one teammate for Life Orb Staraptor. In addition to having a great offensive and defensive partnership with it, Starmie can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and eliminate most of Staraptor's counters with a powerful Hydro Pump. Forretress is another Rapid Spinner who, while it doesn't counter anything significant, can set up entry hazards in the face of physically defensive Pokemon who might cause Staraptor some trouble. Speaking of entry hazards, the above calculations may lead to OHKOs and 2HKOs with Stealth Rock or a single layer of Spikes, so having a team member who can lay down these hazards further enables Staraptor's sweep.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<p>This set is on a different field as the other sets because it aims to stick around longer than the other sets. You are limited to two attacking moves in exchange for two support moves. The core idea of this set is to remain in the match as long as possible, with Roost to heal off Stealth Rock damage and Brave Bird recoil. Staraptor can utilize Substitute to dodge status that would otherwise render it useless.</p> <p>With Staraptor's massive Attack, opponents are usually forced to switch out, and for this reason Substitute is a great move to scout for switch-ins. Behind a Substitute, you can heal off damage or hurt the opponent with Brave Bird or Close Combat. This set may have lost some gleam on the offensive side but Flying + Fighting is good coverage that is only resisted by Rotom-A and Zapdos, which is surprisingly only a small group of Pokemon who wall this set.</p> <p>The choice for Staraptor's item is a tough selection, but Sharp Beak is usually the best option. Sharp Beak boosts Brave Bird's power and can trick opponents into thinking you hold a choice item. Leftovers is another option but you will lose some power which this set really needs to perform effectively.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Rotom-A and Zapdos can easily come on this set and strike back with Thunderbolt. Rotom-A is the toughest to counter since it can provide a shock with Trick in their arsenal, which can ruin your counter for Rotom. Heatran can take Thunderbolt and Trick and can carve a chunk of HP with a STAB Fire-type move. Jolteon has Volt Absorb to take Thunderbolt from Rotom and a Choice Specs Shadow Ball should 2HKO them. Blissey stops Zapdos cold and can spam Seismic Toss or cripple the bird with Toxic.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade is one of the best Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters in the metagame and the only one with a significant offensive presence. With access to Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, and a high base 125 Special Attack stat, Roserade can set Toxic Spikes on the many Water- and Ground-types of the tier such as Swampert, Suicune, Hippowdon, Starmie, and Quagsire. Toxic Spikes are useful in dealing with grounded threats such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, Suicune, Infernape, and Blissey. Roserade is also the most common grounded Poison-type, allowing it to remove opposing Toxic Spikes for these Pokemon upon entry. Despite its offensive leaning stats, with investment, Roserade is also a solid defensive Spikes setter and can answer Breloom by virtue of resisting its most common attacks. Crucially, Roserade is the only common Spikes setter that isn’t trapped by Magnezone. These qualities and its resistances make it unique as a Spiker compared to Skarmory, the other most common Spiker in the metagame. As a lead, Roserade is a decent disabler with a Choice Scarf, as it outspeeds all common unboosted leads and either puts them to sleep should they lack a Lum Berry or offensively threatens them with powerful coverage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Roserade has critical movepool issues, faces heavy competition from Skarmory, and is really easy to wear down. Sadly, Roserade has to choose between using Spikes or the combination of Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm, as they are illegal all together. This forces offensive Roserade sets to either forgo its best offensive tools for Stun Spore and Grass Knot or set Toxic Spikes instead. While Toxic Spikes are very effective against certain Pokemon such as Tyranitar, common team structures are built to mitigate their impact. Due to the rise of Clefable, some stall teams are entirely immune to Toxic Spikes, while many offensive teams stack Steel-types, Lum Berry, and non-grounded Pokemon. As a Grass-type, Roserade doesn’t have many options to hit Steel- and Dragon-types; often, it is forced to pick between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Fire, both of which leave it walled by Heatran unless it uses Hidden Power Ground. As a Spiker, Skarmory is often more effective than Roserade due to its defensive typing, much better Defense stat, and access to recovery in Roost. Roserade’s own defensive typing, low Defense, lack of reliable recovery, and vulnerability to Spikes and sand make it really easy to wear down. It often cannot fulfill defensive roles long-term, even with full investment. Because of this, balanced teams built around Roserade can have significant defensive holes that are difficult to cover with the options available.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Like many Grass-types, Roserade has a few options not especially effective in the modern DPP OU metagame, such as Leech Seed, Life Orb, and Choice Specs. Leech Seed sets are invalidated by Clefable and the general pace of the offensive teams that would OHKO Roserade before it could take advantage of it. Life Orb exacerbates Roserade’s weakness to residual damage, and Choice Specs often locks Roserade into an attack with heavy drawbacks or poor coverage. Roserade has a wealth of coverage moves to hit specific targets such as Shadow Ball for Rotom-A, Extrasensory for Breloom, Machamp, and Gengar, and Weather Ball for Zapdos and Dragonite in sand, but these often don't provide enough value for the moveslot. Roserade can always use Rest and switch with Natural Cure to heal itself to help against residual damage but struggles to fit it and loses a lot of momentum. Roserade also gets Worry Seed to remove Clefable’s Magic Guard, Aromatherapy to heal teammates' status conditions, Sunny Day or Rain Dance to clear the weather, and Growth to potentially sweep, but Roserade is often too frail to take advantage of these, and they use up a valuable moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon with Lum Berry</strong>: If Roserade can't sleep or OHKO the foe, it is probably going to threaten Roserade. While Machamp, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Metagross can take a lot of damage from Roserade's coverage options, they heavily damage offensive variants back and punish Roserade hard if it uses Sleep Powder on them. More defensive Roserade variants often can't hurt these Pokemon very hard outside of status. Lum Berry Stealth Rock users such as Azelf and Heatran are unimpeded by Roserade trying to disable them. Lum Berry Pokemon are especially dangerous if they are faster than Roserade's average Speed, as it is has a very low Defense stat and is really frail without investment.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If it lacks Hidden Power Fire or Ground, Roserade can't touch most Steel-types. Scizor OHKOes offensive Roserade with Bullet Punch, Skarmory and Forretress set up unimpeded, Heatran roasts it with Fire-types moves, Jirachi 2HKOes with Iron Head, and Metagross 2HKOes it at worst with Meteor Mash. However, they do not enjoy being statused.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: On the other hand, if Roserade lacks Hidden Power Ice or Sludge Bomb, Dragon-types completely wall Roserade. Dragonite is especially dangerous, as its +1 Extreme Speed OHKOes it after Stealth Rock. Latias doesn't take a lot of damage from either of those options and OHKOes with Choice Specs Draco Meteor. Flygon and Kingdra threaten it similarly. Again, none of these Pokemon enjoy being statused.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Roserade struggles to hit other Poison-types such as Gengar and Tentacruel very hard without Extrasensory. Gengar easily 2HKOes most Roserade while grounded Poison-types such as Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and other Roserade critically absorb Toxic Spikes, rendering the offensive variant's sacrifice in vain should it faint before they are revealed.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Roserade doesn't have very good coverage options to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Skarmory. Should it lack the correct Hidden Power, Roserade often cannot do anything to them but status them, especially because they're immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage</strong>: Roserade is grounded, weak to sand, frail, and commonly can't heal itself. Roserade often wants to switch into attacks such as Breloom's Superpower and Swampert's Waterfall, but residual damage often makes this impossible to do more than once. Roserade often gets worn down very easily from even weaker attacks such as Rotom-A's Shadow Ball and defensive's Latias's Ice Beam, meaning it often has only a few turns to make an impact.</p> <p>*<em>Special Walls</em>: Clefable, Blissey, Latias, and Heatran are often unbeatable foes for Roserade unless it has the exact move it needs such as Hidden Power Ground for Heatran or Sleep Powder. Clefable especially invalidates options such as Leech Seed or Toxic Spikes. However, other than Heatran, these options are quite passive and let Roserade set up entry hazards before it faints.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Roserade is extremely physically frail and doesn't resist most priority. Dragonite, Lucario, Scizor, Mamoswine, and Weavile all hit Roserade very hard, potentially OHKOing offensive variants.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute attackers such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Dragonite, and Gengar are especially devastating to Roserade, as they easily can KO or set up on it and if Roserade lacks the correct coverage move, it might fail to break the Substitute.</p>",

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roserade’s offensive profile and decent defensive prowess make it a good Spikes user. Grass Knot is Roserade’s best offensive move, OHKOing Swampert and 2HKOing Suicune, most Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Hippowdon. As Grass Knot hits lighter Pokemon such as Clefable and especially Rotom-A for negligible damage, Energy Ball is a reliable alternative. Unfortunately, Energy Ball is not as effective at powering through Tyranitar and offensive Suicune, especially if Suicune has a Calm Mind boost and outspeeds Roserade. Another option to maximize Roserade’s effectiveness against Breloom and Dragon-types such as Latias and Dragonite is Sludge Bomb. However, Poison is not a good offensive typing and leaves Roserade walled by Ground-types.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire helps Roserade hit Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, Forretress, Metagross, and Jirachi, generally at worst 3HKOing them. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon- and Flying-types instead, OHKOing Flygon, Dragonite after Stealth Rock, and Gliscor while doing acceptable damage to Latias. Both Hidden Power Fire and Ice hit Breloom hard. Roserade can also use Hidden Power Ground to hit Heatran or forgo Hidden Power entirely and use a support option such as Aromatherapy or Rest; however, it sorely misses coverage. The last slot is most commonly Stun Spore, as it helps prevent foes from setting up on Roserade unimpeded if it can’t hit them hard. However, Roserade can also use both Spikes and Toxic Spikes to get multiple entry hazards up. Another option is to maximize Roserade’s matchup with Breloom and use Sleep Talk. This is often most effective with either Energy Ball or Sludge Bomb, as both options always break Breloom’s Substitute, or it sets up Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Roserade needs heavy Defense investment to survive against foes it checks such as Breloom and Swampert. Maximum HP EVs, near maximum Defense, and a Bold nature emphasize this. The Speed EVs outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar, Swampert, and Empoleon. Roserade has a naturally high Special Defense stat and is a decent mixed wall with full investment. Roserade can also focus on its Special Defense to better answer Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-A, as well as offensive Water-types such as Suicune and Starmie, with an EV spread such as 252 HP / 44 Def / 188 SpD / 24 Spe with a Calm nature. Defensive Roserade should always invest at least 44 Defense EVs to avoid being OHKOed by offensive Swampert’s Earthquake, but can also run around 124 Defense EVs to survive Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch. While Roserade does enjoy Natural Cure healing status effects on switch out, Poison Point is the most common ability to better absorb Breloom’s Spore.</p> <p>Roserade can also use a fully offensive EV spread with Spikes, Grass Knot, one of Hidden Power Fire or Ice, and Sludge Bomb to act as an offensive Spikes user and hit very hard. However, such a set is extraordinarily frail, still doesn’t have amazing coverage, and doesn’t have Sleep Powder to ease setup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its frailty, Roserade should switch into foes sparingly, preferably coming in on predicted switches or resisted attacks. Even attacks it is meant to take such as Breloom’s Focus Punch and Swampert’s Earthquake can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock. From here, Roserade should try to set up entry hazards immediately, as it often only gets a few turns to make an impact due to residual damage. Roserade, even with Stun Spore, is setup fodder for a lot of dangerous threats in the tier, such as Dragonite and Metagross, so it should be used carefully against very aggressive teams and use its bulk to help weaken or status sweepers rather than setting up in these cases. Should Roserade have both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, getting one layer of both should be prioritized, as the second layer is not nearly as useful. Once it has fulfilled its role of getting up entry hazards, freely sacrificing itself for momentum is often best, as it is slow and often cannot heal effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roserade is a staple of the Fire-Water-Grass playstyle, as it very effectively lays entry hazards while assisting its Fire- and Water-type teammates such as Heatran, Swampert, and Suicune. Heatran is one its best partners, as both Toxic Spikes and Spikes are highly effective alongside it. Heatran’s Substitute + Protect sets can easily stall out foes such as Swampert and Tyranitar with Toxic Spikes, while Roserade either resists them or hits them super effectively. Roserade is effective with Water-type partners as well, as it can switch into their weaknesses as well as crucially absorb Toxic Spikes. Swampert can help handle aggressive sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite that Roserade struggles with and very much appreciates entry hazards. Offensive and Substitute Suicune does similarly and can help against Gyarados too. Roserade also loves Steel-types such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross, Jirachi, and Empoleon to help it deal with Dragon-types such as mixed Flygon, Dragonite, and Latias. To keep entry hazards on the field, Ghost-types such as Rotom-A and Gengar both are very helpful. Both appreciate Roserade’s entry hazards wearing down Tyranitar. As Roserade can let dangerous threats set up, a Choice Scarf revenge killer such as Flygon, Lucario, or Rotom-A is also very helpful. Choice Scarf Tyranitar helps Roserade to keep its entry hazards up by removing Starmie, the most common spinner. However, having multiple weaknessed to Gyarados is unadvised. Offensive sets of good defensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind + Hidden Power Fire Latias, offensive Zapdos, and Hippowdon really appreciate the entry hazard damage and help the archetype deal with threats.</p> <p>Roserade can also be used as an Spikes setter for hyper offensive teams looking to deal with Swampert without using Gyarados. Some example partners include Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Choice Specs Latias, offensive Starmie, Swords Dance or Choice Band Scizor, and Agility Empoleon.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roserade’s Speed, access to Sleep Powder, and power make it the prime contender to lay down Toxic Spikes for both offensive and balance teams early-game. Without Spikes, Roserade gains access to its two best offensive tools: Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm. Sleep Powder heavily pressures slower foes lacking a Lum Berry, such as some Metagross, slower Jirachi sets, Skarmory, defensive Latias, and Clefable, and gives Roserade opportunities to attack or set up Toxic Spikes. Leaf Storm is Roserade’s most powerful option and does a lot of damage to foes that don’t resist it, such as having a chance to OHKO bulky Azelf and OHKOing Suicune, Gyarados, and Tyranitar without any defensive EVs after Stealth Rock. Even frailer Grass resistances such as Breloom and Infernape can take a lot of damage, and its raw power is enough to dissuade grounded Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Tentacruel, and Qwilfish from switching in to absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is the most common option in the final moveslot, 2HKOing Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom while OHKOing Scizor and Forretress. However, the lower Speed IV may be disadvantageous against opposing Roserade and Lucario. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ground nails Heatran, OHKOing versions without defensive EVs after Stealth Rock while still hitting Metagross and Jirachi. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragonite, Gliscor, offensive Latias, and Flygon more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Roserade needs maximum Speed and Special Attack to most effectively use its offensive prowess to put foes to sleep and set up Toxic Spikes. While the power of a Modest nature is very nice for OHKOing most Azelf leads trying to Taunt Roserade, Roserade sits in a very crowded Speed tier with neutral nature Flygon, Jirachi, and Zapdos, as well as Rotom-A and Suicune, and appreciates a Timid nature. If Roserade has Hidden Power Fire, it can invest some of the extra Speed into Defense to better survive attacks, although the effect is negligible.</p> <p>Both Focus Sash and Black Sludge are effective items; however, Focus Sash should only be used if Roserade leads, as it is very frail, and Focus Sash gives it another chance to either set up Toxic Spikes, use Sleep Powder, or attack should the latter two miss or if the foe is faster. Black Sludge is the item of choice if Roserade doesn’t lead and is instead an early-game attacker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roserade should come into the game early or lead and either use Sleep Powder, attack, or lay Toxic Spikes. Against faster Taunt leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl, Roserade should just attack as they Taunt it, as Leaf Storm can OHKO them should they lack a Focus Sash. Against leads that might carry a Lum Berry such as Gyarados, Metagross, and some Machamp, just attacking or getting Toxic Spikes up is a good idea. Otherwise, it’s often best to Sleep Powder, especially if the foe is slower. Any lead can carry a Lum Berry or survive Roserade’s options, so metagame trends and what the rest of the team needs can dictate what to do, such as using Sleep Powder into leads like Machamp or just attacking into something like Skarmory.</p> <p>If Roserade doesn’t lead, the fact that Sleep Powder is uncommon outside of the lead slot can be leveraged, especially with Black Sludge. This can lead to sleeping Steel-types or Dragon-types or other important Pokemon. While Roserade is not particularly bulky, it can afford to take weaker special attacks such as defensive Swampert's Ice Beam or Rotom-A's Thunderbolt, giving it a chance to exert pressure.</p> <p>Roserade will usually only set one layer of Toxic Spikes, as most pokemon don't stay long enough on the field to make the second turn of setup worthwhile. However, when facing bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Blissey, Milotic, and Celebi, inflicting Toxic poison can be valuable. In this situation, Roserade should aim to set the second layer of Toxic Spikes as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roserade is the best offensive Toxic Spikes user in the metagame, so it has many viable partners. Gengar is a fantastic teammate for Roserade, as Toxic Spikes wear down Choice Scarf Tyranitar very effectively. As Tyranitar is perhaps the only check for Taunt or Substitute Gengar on defensive teams, wearing it down or potentially KOing it is extremely helpful. Roserade’s Sleep Powder also often targets Steel-types or bulkier Pokemon, which can survive Gengar’s attacks. Other potential partners include Choice Scarf Rotom-A, offensive Latias, Zapdos, and Starmie. Substitute attackers such as Heatran and Substitute Zapdos are also great choices, as Toxic Spikes can help wear down their checks. Other offensive Heatran sets such as Choice Scarf also enjoy Toxic Spikes wearing down Fire resistances. Offensive Roserade is unique in that it’s a sacrificial lead that needs bulkier teammates to effectively use Toxic Spikes. As such, it often needs a good defensive core to backstop it should the foe set up on it. Some good choices include using Roserade alongside bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Swampert to better handle Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite and Tyranitar, bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross for Latias and Flygon, and using it on a Fire-Water-Grass core alongside options like Heatran and Suicune.</p> <p>Good Roserade partners are Pokemon that already handle Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes like Clefable, Steel-types, and Flying-types well. Some other examples include Swords Dance Gliscor, Agility Empoleon, and Kingdra. Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Flygon and Latias are also helpful to take down worn down foes and backstop Roserade.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>As sleep moves have limited distribution in DPP OU, Roserade is a prominent disabler in the lead slot with a Choice Scarf. Unlike Breloom, the other prominent Choice Scarf sleep user, Roserade outspeeds Aerodactyl and hits much harder with Leaf Storm. With a Modest nature, Roserade OHKOes physically bulky Azelf with Leaf Storm before it can Taunt or set up Stealth Rock, outspeeds and OHKOes +1 Tyranitar and Gyarados after Stealth Rock, and OHKOes Suicune after it uses Calm Mind.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice is effective against Dragonite and other Dragon-types, but +1 Extreme Speed is dangerous. While Hidden Power Fire forces a lower Speed IV, it at least 2HKOes many Steel-types such as Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross, and Scizor. Hidden Power Ground is another option to hit Heatran. However, Roserade is then locked into a weak Hidden Power. Sludge Bomb rounds out the set, as it provides good neutral coverage and OHKOes Breloom. Toxic Spikes is another option to use on forced switches, but foes may take advantage while Roserade is Choice locked into Toxic Spikes. With a Choice Scarf, Roserade is often guaranteed to set up a layer, which can be valuable against foes such as Tyranitar, Swampert, and Suicune.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Roserade sits at a valuable speed tier and wants close to maximum Speed EVs. Roserade enjoys having as many Special Attack EVs as possible to make it easier to OHKO Azelf and generally hit harder. However, it only needs a minimum of 192 Speed EVs with a neutral nature to outspeed Aerodactyl after the Choice Scarf boost, meaning the rest can be put into bulk. While Roserade can use a Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Heatran, Rotom-A, and neutral nature Flygon, its incredible vulnerability to priority makes it a comparably poor revenge killer. As such, it’s often better to use an EV spread such as the one given or 64 Def / 252 SpA / 192 Spe.</p> <p>Roserade can use either of its abilities, but Natural Cure is often preferred to maintain its Speed should it get paralyzed. However, Poison Point makes it for a nice absorber of Breloom’s Spore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roserade typically leads and uses Sleep Powder on the first turn. It should only deviate from this against common Lum Berry leads such as Azelf, Gyarados, and Machamp or against leads it can KO such as Swampert and Tyranitar. This is critical to prevent Stealth Rock or other entry hazards from going up, as Roserade generally can KO or incapacitate most users provided Sleep Powder hits. Once it either attacks or uses Sleep Powder, it should switch to avoid being taken advantage of, as all of its attacks have heavy drawbacks when locked into. Once it has slept something, Roserade should be fairly cavalier with its health, as it has performed its job, although it is a serviceable revenge killer against Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar with its Speed and power. As Choice Scarf Roserade is uncommon, these sweepers might be unexpectedly taken out by Leaf Storm. However, switching it directly into resisted attacks should be avoided, as it is very frail, especially on the physical side.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a disabler, Choice Scarf Roserade is generally used alongside aggressive teams that appreciate Roserade's higher Speed and power over Breloom's reliability, better bulk, and typing. Stealth Rock weak teammates such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, mixed or Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Zapdos are good partners, as Roserade typically can KO or use Sleep Powder on Stealth Rock users. Zapdos is an especially good partner, as Roserade can potentially get up Toxic Spikes unimpeded, crucial for supporting SubRoost sets against Ground-types and Tyranitar. Roserade needs backup should it get taken advantage of, so bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, Scizor, and Skarmory are good partners to stop Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Latias from taking advantage of bad Choice locks. As Roserade can't be relied on to check Speed boosting or priority sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Agility Empoleon, Swords Dance Scizor, and Swords Dance Lucario, other backup is needed against these Pokemon. Some options include Choice Scarf Magnezone, Ice Shard Abomasnow, and bulky Ground-types such as Swampert. Other aggressive teammates such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Empoleon, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, and Camerupt also make for good teammates. Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar is an especially good teammate, as Roserade is not as effective against defensive teams, but it can can be a good short-term Breloom switch, and it commonly targets Dragon Dance Tyranitar checks with Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>If there was any Pokemon created to take advantage of Serene Grace it would be Togekiss. Armed with a fantastic movepool including STAB Air Slash and its 60% chance to flinch and excellent overall stats, Togekiss can serve as a good utility Pokemon and an overall annoyance. Togekiss’s access to Nasty Plot gives it a unique role as a boosting tank in DPP OU, as it can leverage its bulk to set up and cleave through bulkier, slower foes with Air Slash while healing off the damage with Roost. Additionally, since Air Slash already has decent coverage by itself and can be made almost perfect with Aura Sphere, it can fit many other support options, such as Thunder Wave, Substitute, and Heal Bell to facilitate itself. Togekiss’s great offensive movepool also lets it serve as an effective all-out-attacker, as it is excellent at trading with Steel-types and Tyranitar with Fire Blast. Togekiss’s typing and bulk helps it check some challenging Pokemon—it notably is a solid offensive check to Gengar as it isn’t 2HKOed by Focus Blast and 2HKOes back, it OHKOes Breloom with ease, and it can take on Pokemon that typically can’t hit it super effectively in a pinch, such as Heatran, Flygon, and Infernape.</p> <p>Togekiss unfortunately is very uncommon in DPP OU due to the severe flaws from its typing and its mediocre Speed stat. Being Normal-type is a huge issue for Togekiss, as it only gives Togekiss an immunity to Ghost-types in exchange for cursing it with a neutrality to Fighting. Along with its weakness to Stealth Rock, Togekiss needs an extensive support structure to function on more defensive teams, as it can’t switch into Breloom’s Focus Punch or Superpower—typical responsibilities of defensive Flying-types. This often leads to it being outclassed by Zapdos and Gliscor, who have significantly more resistances, including Fighting. Additionally, Togekiss struggles to fit on more offensive teams, as it is simply too slow to sweep without extensive paralysis support in addition to its debilitating Stealth Rock weakness. Offensive Nasty Plot sets are outsped by the majority of the metagame even with maximum Speed and Togekiss has no reliable way to boost its Speed. While Togekiss can be difficult to KO, it struggles to switch in on many Pokemon and threaten them out due to its lack of resistances and how weak Air Slash is if it doesn’t flinch the foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togekiss has a humongous movepool, but struggles to make the most of it due to its lackluster typing and mediocre Speed. Togekiss can use effective Choiced sets with its coverage and access to Trick: Togekiss hits extraordinarily hard with Choice Specs, while Choice Scarf both is effective at revenge killing and Tricking away the Choice Scarf away and then paralyzing it to incapacitate the foe. Togekiss can also use more offensive Nasty Plot sets too, maximizing its coverage to power through more offensive teams and even potentially use a Life Orb. The issue with these ideas is that Air Slash is just too weak of an offensive tool if Togekiss doesn’t outspeed the foe. Even backed by Choice Specs or Life Orb and Nasty Plot, it has to rely on Fire Blast and Aura Sphere’s coverage to get through very common Pokemon that outspeed it such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, Jirachi, Gyarados, and Azelf. These sets also exacerbate Togekiss’s huge weakness to residual damage and it provides almost no valuable resistances as an offensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Tri Attack is Togekiss’s strongest special STAB move and has a high likelihood of statusing the foe, but the coverage is terrible. Togekiss can pass Wish or run more dedicated defensive sets with its excellent utility movepool, but it just doesn’t have the resistances and is too weak to residual damage for it to be worth it. Togekiss can also use Hustle instead of Serene Grace, as it has a fantastic physical movepool including STAB Extreme Speed and all the coverage moves it could dream of, but its abysmal base 50 Attack makes this difficult to take advantage of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Togekiss really doesn’t enjoy taking on Zapdos and Rotom-A, who resist both of Air Slash and Aura Sphere, outspeed Togekiss, and at least 2HKO it. While neither of them enjoy paralysis and get nailed by Fire Blast, Togekiss is typically forced out against them. Other Electric-types such as Jolteon, Raikou, and Choice Scarf Magnezone and Magneton are excellent choices if they can get in without getting paralyzed. Jolteon is even immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Togekiss merely has mediocre Speed and has no way to reliably boost it. While other sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite have similar Speed stats, they can outspeed the unboosted metagame with Dragon Dance. Most offensive Pokemon outspeed Togekiss and can either incapacitate it or remove it. Latias, Azelf, Flygon, offensive Suicune, Jirachi, Choice Scarf Metagross, and Starmie all outspeed even maximum Speed Togekiss and can remove it. If Togekiss invests in its bulk, then the entire offensive metagame can come in and hit it hard.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is a huge problem for Togekiss. It ruins its prowess as a defensive Pokemon. Residual damage combined with its Speed woes make Togekiss outclassed by other offensive Stealth Rock weak Pokemon such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, Bronzong, Heatran, Empoleon, are effective against bulkier Togekiss sets, as it often has to use many Air Slashes to break through. Additionally, they force more offensive Togekiss sets to trade, as they typically hit it very hard.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Togekiss is vulnerable to all status and sand. It rarely carries Heal Bell, so it at best has the one time Lum Berry to help it. Paralysis ruins its ability to flinch foes, while burn and poison wear it down very quickly. Togekiss often exposes itself to these both as a utility check and because it takes a while to set up</p> <p><strong>Super-effective attacks</strong>: Most Pokemon have Ice-, Rock-, or Electric-type coverage and can hit Togekiss hard. Gyarados, Tyranitar, Mamoswine, and Swampert all can hit Togekiss hard. Roost makes Togekiss vulnerable to Fighting-type moves, allowing Breloom, Machamp, and Scizor to have an opportunity to OHKO Togekiss on a predicted attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Togekiss is uniquely adept at using Nasty Plot in DPP OU, as compared to Celebi and Infernape, it has both better coverage than Celebi and way more longevity than Infernape. Air Slash pairs perfectly with Nasty Plot: Togekiss can leverage its bulk to set up and help mitigate Air Slash’s main issue—its lack of immediate power. Air Slash also unquestionably OHKOes Breloom, 2HKOes Machamp and Gengar, and can generally 4HKO most bulkier Pokemon neutral to it such as Swampert and Scizor. Air Slash is excellent at breaking through slower walls such as Clefable and even Blissey, as its flinch rate and high PP prevent them from stalling it out and Togekiss can heal off weaker attacks.</p> <p>The choice between Roost and Soft-Boiled is a matter of what Togekiss needs to check. Roost removes Togekiss’s weakness to Electric-, Rock-, and Ice-type moves, but takes away its immunity to Ground-type moves, gives it a weakness to Fighting, and removes its resistances to Grass- and Bug-type moves for one turn. Soft-boiled maintains its Fighting neutrality, which puts it in line with other defensive Flying-types who become neutral to Fighting when they heal. This is important against foes like Breloom and Machamp, which take advantage of Skarmory, Zapdos, and Gliscor to hit them hard when they use Roost.</p> <p>As Togekiss only needs Nasty Plot, Air Slash, and either Roost or Soft-Boiled to be effective, it has many other options in the last slot. The most prominent of these is Thunder Wave, as it can be highly effective in spreading the paralysis Togekiss needs with Togekiss’s huge bulk. Most Ground-types struggle to break through its defenses, are slower, and don’t resist Air Slash. If teammates can spread paralysis effectively, another option is Substitute. Substitute, Roost, and paralysis make Togekiss extremely annoying to KO, as foes need to hit through paralysis and flinching just to break the Substitute.</p> <p>Aura Sphere improves Togekiss’s coverage greatly, OHKOing Tyranitar at +2 and is immensely threatening to Steel-types such as Heatran and Empoleon who can survive multiple boosted Air Slash with ease. Only Zapdos and Rotom-A resist both. Finally, Heal Bell maximizes Togekiss’s team support and allows it to dominate bulky walls such as Blissey and Jirachi whose only counter play to Togekiss is to status it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Togekiss enjoys nearly maximizing its physical defense to take on threats such as Breloom, Gyarados, Machamp, and Scizor. While Togekiss lacks the resistances to switch into these Pokemon consistently, nearly maximizing its physical bulk makes Togekiss remarkably bulky in a one-on-one scenario—it has more physical bulk than defensive Zapdos and Latias and has naturally high Special Defense. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A and maximum Speed neutral-natured Machamp.</p> <p>Togekiss can also run more Speed to outspeed positive-natured Tyranitar or a Modest nature to power it up, but really appreciates as much bulk as possible to make up for its lack of resistances and Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togekiss, especially without Stealth Rock up, is quite difficult to KO. Its annoyingly high Special Defense forces foes such as Heatran, Latias, and Gengar into difficult situations, as it is almost impossible OHKO and can spread paralysis effectively. If Togekiss gets in cleanly, slower physical attackers that can’t hit it very hard such as Swampert and Tyranitar lacking Stone Edge can get flinched out.</p> <p>While Togekiss can set up and try to win, it often acts first like a utility check that can sweep if given a chance. Togekiss is quite effective at just spreading paralysis and wearing down Steel-types with Air Slash. Togekiss operates best before Stealth Rock is up to paralyze its checks or if teammates can paralyze them for it. From here, Togekiss can get in again and pressure them with Air Slash. This can be a highly effective strategy due to Serene Grace and Togekiss’s bulk. While Togekiss has a lot of Air Slash PP, be careful with it, as many prominent Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Zapdos resist Air Slash and take quite a few boosted hits to faint.</p> <p>If possible, try to avoid switching in on powerful attacks. While Togekiss can switch into Breloom’s Focus Punch or Superpower with Stealth Rock up once, it opens itself up to Fighting-types attacks if it uses Roost and can struggle to get healthy again.</p> <p>While Togekiss can flinch almost anything slower down, it really should only do this in desperate times, as potentially missing Air Slash or not getting the flinch can have devastating consequences.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Togekiss is most common alongside heavy paralysis support that want a bulky wincon and appreciate help against Gengar. Togekiss's best parnter is often Starmie, as Rapid Spin support is critical to getting the most out of it. As Togekiss can't handle many of the physical attackers in the tier on its own, other defensive Flying-types such as Zapdos and Gliscor are effective alongside it. They can both shoulder the load to help against physical attackers due to their remarkable bulk and typing, allowing Togekiss to shine as a sweeper. Other solid answers to Fighting-types such as Reflect Latias are also helpful. Jirachi also helps spread paralysis and similarly takes advantage of Serene Grace. It can wear down Steel-types and Tyranitar Togekiss needs weakened for it to sweep. Clefable and Blissey are also helpful, as they are strong special walls that share Togekiss's Normal-typing and can answer foes such as Heatran and Latias that Togekiss can take on but doesn't enjoy to. Clefable's Knock Off in particular is excellent for Togekiss to slowly wear down Flying-resistances, while Blissey can easily answer Gengar so Togekiss doesn't have to. Both can potentially use Heal Bell to free up a moveslot on Togekiss.</p> <p>Togekiss can also fit alongside other Rapid Spin users and defensive teammates. Donphan, when paired with Starmie or Forretress, is fantastic at preventing Stealth Rock from staying up. Alongside these spinners, Abomasnow’s hail is excellent in wearing down Steel-types often tasked with taking Togekiss on. Other paralysis spreaders such as Celebi, Gyarados, and even Registeel are helpful to set Togekiss up to sweep. Jirachi and Latias are great for paralyzing foes, but even more offensive teammates like Metagross, Machamp, and Breloom can help neutralize Steel-types, Rotom-A, and Zapdos for Togekiss.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Togekiss's high Special Attack stat and excellent coverage let it be an adept all-out attacker. With maximum Special Attack investment, Air Slash typically 3HKOes foes that don't resist it, such as Gliscor, defensive Starmie, and Swampert. Aura Sphere and Fire Blast let Togekiss hit every Steel-type in the tier super effectively except Heatproof Bronzong. Aura Sphere gives Togekiss fantastic coverage, pressuring Clefable and Tyranitar. Fire Blast can often be surprising from Togekiss, allowing it to unexpectedly 2HKO Zapdos and Rotom-A after Stealth Rock and have a chance to OHKO Skarmory, Jirachi without bulk investment, and Metagross. Flamethrower doesn’t hit these damage thresholds, but it's more reliable against foes like Scizor that Togekiss OHKOes anyway.</p> <p>The last spot is usually taken up by Thunder Wave or Body Slam. Even with maximum Speed investment, Togekiss still struggles to outspeed much of the metagame, and it can leverage its coverage to spread paralysis. Thunder Wave and Body Slam are Togekiss's best options against foes faster than Togekiss and not weak to its coverage, such as Latias, Azelf, and Gyarados. Thunder Wave is typically preferred, as Togekiss is naturally threatening to Ground-types and crucially paralyzes Ghost-types, but Body Slam is unaffected by Taunt.</p> <p>Togekiss has a number of other moves it can use in the last slot. Togekiss is perhaps the best offensive user of Ominous Wind in the metagame, as with Serene Grace, it has a 20% chance to get the omniboost and is extremely effective if it does. Ominous Wind also provides good coverage against Azelf and Latias. Another prominent option is Grass Knot, which unquestionably OHKOes Swampert and is the best choice against bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Gyarados.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Togekiss needs as much Special Attack and especially Speed as it can get, and its natural bulk is quite high. The choice between Modest and Timid is typically Timid, as outspeeding Breloom, Lucario, Heatran, and defensive Latias is critical. However, Modest is very helpful for damage rolls on Fire Blast versus Steel-types.</p> <p>Lum Berry is a fantastic choice on Togekiss, as it can switch into Breloom's Spore and Gengar's Will-O-Wisp and immediately threaten them out, while also being able to trade status against almost any foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togekiss typically leads or otherwise gets in the game early and attacks whatever is in front of it until it faints. Togekiss is bulky enough that it can be effective later in the game, but its below-average Speed and weakness to Stealth Rock make this difficult. Togekiss unfortunately is an anti-lead that often loses to common Focus Sash leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl, as they outspeed it, sometimes aren’t even 2HKOed in return, and threaten Togekiss. Togekiss's best course of action against these is to go for paralysis or an Ominous Wind boost.</p> <p>Togekiss can get a lot out of predicting switches, as it typically doesn't OHKO foes without a boost. Some common leads such as Breloom and Machamp are heavily threatened by Togekiss, allowing it to in turn threaten common switch-ins such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Heatran with paralysis or super effective coverage. As Togekiss typically doesn't OHKO foes with its coverage, sneaking in an Air Slash on slower foes can put them in range. However, do not rely on Air Slash to continually flinch down slower Pokemon, as this often leaves Togekiss using a weak attack against powerful foes if it doesn't get the flinch or misses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Togekiss fits best on offensive teams built around paralysis. One of Togekiss's best partners is Jirachi, as Jirachi loves Togekiss weakening Steel-types, Zapdos, and Rotom-A and can take advantage of the paralysis both of them can spread. Many other offensive can take advantage of paralysis and trading with Steel-types: Machamp, Gyarados, Tyranitar, Substitute Gengar, Latias, and Breloom all fit reasonably well with Togekiss. Gyarados sets that drop Earthquake in favor of Thunder Wave particularly like Togekiss's ability to break through Steel-types. Togekiss also wants backup against Pokemon such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias, as they can overpower Togekiss. Bulkier Heatran sets do a decent job against these Pokemon, as does Tyranitar. If Togekiss is used outside of the lead, it works very well alongside Azelf or Breloom, as they can prevent entry hazards either through Taunt or Spore.</p> <p>Togekiss can also be used alongside more traditional hyper offense teams, especially if it uses Ominous Wind. These teams often want multiple Lum Berry offensive checks to Breloom, and if it gets the 20% omniboost, Togekiss is a highly threatening sweeper. Good partners include Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Gengar, Swords Dance + Pursuit Scizor, Latias, Metagross, and offensive Empoleon.</p>"

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>With its pure Ghost typing blocking Rapid Spin, high base 135 defenses, and decent Attack stat, Dusknoir has potential to be a great defensive Pokemon. However, it is completely outclassed by Rotom-A as a defensive Pokemon and spinblocker. Although it has superior defensive stats, Dusknoir suffers from a lack of useful resistances. Above all, Dusknoir has a crippling vulnerability to all entry hazards, which is worsened by its lack of reliable recovery. Rotom-A and more offensive spinblocker Gengar lack reliable recovery too, but they critically are immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. This hazards vulnerability means Dusknoir will be quickly worn down and unable to do its job consistently. Dusknoir is also plagued by an awful Speed stat, forcing it to take a hit first before retaliating. These attributes leave it much more vulnerable to offensive pressure than both Rotom-A and Gengar, particularly when facing Tyranitar and Jirachi, premier Pokemon in DPP OU. Dusknoir could try to scrounge up a niche with its good physical coverage and priority, which allow it to damage Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Forretress super effectively without relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast or status with Will-O-Wisp. Such traits, however, generally are not enough to make it worth using in DPP OU.</p>",

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a potent threat in DPP OU due to its unique mix of utility and offensive firepower. Gengar's typing, Speed, and ability make it an offensive spinblocker and allows it to check several threats through its immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, such as Breloom, Lucario, and Gliscor. Unlike the other prominent Ghost-type, Rotom-A, Gengar has Focus Blast to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar and 2HKO Clefable. Focus Blast also provides Gengar perfect coverage in two moves alongside Shadow Ball, giving it many opportunities to take advantage of its large movepool to diversify its options. With Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, Gengar shuts down defensive counterplay from Hippowdon, Blissey, and Clefable while spreading burns to Bronzong, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Substitute sets can take advantage of the switches it forces to either heal itself with Pain Split or power through checks such as Scizor and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Gengar's access to Explosion and coverage options such as Thunderbolt make it a powerful force, as it hits Pokemon such as Latias, Blissey, and Gyarados very hard.</p> <p>Gengar's primary flaws lie in its weakness to Dark-types, frailty, and prominent low accuracy moves. Tyranitar is the bane of Gengar's existence, as despite being able to OHKO it with Focus Blast and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, Choice Scarf Tyranitar outspeeds Gengar and traps it with Pursuit, removing it from the game with certainty after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Scizor fares similarly; although it fears the rare Hidden Power Fire and doesn't appreciate being burned, it checkmates Gengar with Bullet Punch and Pursuit. While Gengar is very strong, it doesn't OHKO everything, is frail, and despises status—faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Flygon, Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Latias can outspeed and OHKO it, while bulkier threats such as Swampert, Dragonite, Zapdos, Heatran, and Suicune can survive a hit and KO it back. Gengar also can be very frustrating to use, as both Focus Blast and Will-O-Wisp have subpar accuracy and the inevitable miss can be catastrophic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On its utility set, Gengar has many other options it can use alongside or instead of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, such as Destiny Bond, Knock Off, Sleep Talk, Protect, Sucker Punch, Mean Look, and Perish Song. Finding the best option often depends on the rest of the team and what Gengar needs to do. Destiny Bond is one of the more prominent options, as Gengar's frailty often means it can faint the opponent, such as slower Tyranitar using Crunch, along with it. On more defensive teams, especially without Choice Scarf Tyranitar, one of the primary first checks to Gengar is Clefable. Knock Off removes items and make Clefable much more vulnerable to both itself and attackers such as mixed Flygon. Sleep Talk makes Gengar a premier sleep absorber, as both Breloom and Roserade are hit hard by any move Gengar pulls while asleep. Protect alongside Hidden Power Fire is an antiquated option to avoid being Pursuit trapped by Choiced locked attackers such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Sucker Punch provides offensive Gengar with an unexpected priority attack to finish off weakened threats potentially faster than it, such as Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Starmie. Mean Look and Perish Song are excellent ways to defeat Clefable and other walls, as they typically cannot damage Gengar enough to avoid fainting to Perish Song. With Substitute, Gengar can also try Hypnosis. Being behind a Substitute gives Gengar more chances to use Hypnosis, as the payoff if it hits is excellent. On more offensive sets, Gengar can also use Hidden Power Ice, Sludge Bomb, and Energy Ball to hit specific targets, but often is not worth the moveslot.</p> <p>Gengar has a great deal of item diversity as well. The most prominent of these is a Choice Scarf set, as Gengar is fast and can revenge kill various sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Agility Empoleon with its coverage and Explosion. Such a set is quite vulnerable to Tyranitar and Scizor using Pursuit. Offensive sets enjoy a wide variety of items, such as Custap Berry to KO Starmie after switching into Hydro Pump to block Rapid Spin, Colbur Berry to avoid being KOed by Pursuit, Wide Lens to better facilitate its low accuracy attacks, and Expert Belt to power up its attacks without recoil. Gengar does miss the passive healing of Black Sludge or the power of Life Orb, however.</p> <p>Gengar almost always uses maximum Speed to tie with Latias and itself while also outspeeding Infernape, Jirachi, Flygon, and Zapdos. However, Gengar is free to invest heavily in its bulk instead of Special Attack. Gengar needs 72 Defense EVs to survive Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, and can run more bulk to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit at lower health. Beware that Choice Scarf Tyranitar will OHKO even Bold maximum HP / maximum Defense Gengar after Stealth Rock and sand with Crunch and attempts to survive that without a Colbur Berry are futile. Gengar also loses OHKOs on Heatran and Tyranitar from Focus Blast without maximum Special Attack EVs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While Gengar can hit most Dark-types hard with Focus Blast and they don't appreciate getting burned, Dark-types especially with Pursuit can ruin Gengar. The most common one is Tyranitar, as Choice Scarf sets outspeed Gengar and can remove it whether it switches or not, while bulkier sets can survive Focus Blast and remove it with Pursuit. Weavile and Spiritomb are much rarer than Tyranitar, but have their own advantages: Weavile naturally outspeeds Gengar and its Pursuit boosted by Life Orb, Expert Belt, or Choice Band OHKOes Gengar from full. Spiritomb is immune to Focus Blast while being neutral to Shadow Ball and can checkmate Gengar with Sucker Punch and Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, especially if they are neutral to  Focus Blast, are effective checks to Gengar. Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross can take two Focus Blast or Shadow Ball and at least 2HKO Gengar in return. Scizor is the best of these, as its Bullet Punch hits Gengar hard before it can attack and Pursuit removes Gengar should it switch. None of these like being burned, however. Even Steel-types that don't resist Focus Blast can answer Gengar if they are bulky enough, such as Heatran and Empoleon. Choice Scarf Magnezone outspeeds Gengar and OHKOes it with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable</strong>: Both of the prominent defensive Normal-types can check Gengar. Blissey is especially prevalent, as if Gengar lacks Taunt or Substitute, it easily survives even Life Orb Focus Blast and paralyzes Gengar with Thunder Wave. Blissey can also use special moves such as Ice Beam and Thunder to damage Gengar. Clefable does not have the raw bulk Blissey has and is 2HKOed by Focus Blast, but does have Knock Off to remove Black Sludge and Life Orb while potentially using Encore on Substitute. Both do not appreciate Explosion, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gengar is severely crippled by paralysis and burn, as paralysis slows it down and exposes its weak bulk while burn exacerbates residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While Gengar is fast and strong, it is also incredibly fragile and most neutral attacks will at least score a 2HKO. Swampert, Dragonite, Suicune, and Zapdos can survive at least one attack and KO Gengar back. Chople Berry also helps Pokemon weak to Focus Blast, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Magnezone, survive the attack and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar, Flygon, Latias, and Rotom-A can all revenge kill Gengar. Naturally faster Pokemon such as Starmie can pressure Gengar once it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Especially if Gengar has a Life Orb, it is worn down quickly from sand and Stealth Rock. This can make it difficult to continually pressure defensive teams. Bulky phazers such as Hippowdon and Skarmory can survive even its Life Orb boosted attacks and phaze it out. Having to come in again can put it range of weaker or resisted attacks, such as defensive Empoleon Surf, Skarmory's Brave Bird, and Breloom's Seed Bomb.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball in tandem with Focus Blast provides Gengar with perfect coverage, enabling it to offensively threaten a large portion of the metagame. This coverage gives Gengar flexibility to function as a solid utility Pokemon and stallbreaker. It compensates for its awful base defensive stats with a solid defensive typing and access to Will-O-Wisp. This variant takes advantage of the fact that many common switch-ins to Gengar, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Jirachi, are severely crippled by the burn. Alongside Will-O-Wisp, Gengar has two prominent options in Taunt and Explosion. Taunt enables Gengar to prevent defensive threats like Clefable, Blissey, Skarmory, Jirachi, Zapdos, and Suicune from healing themselves up or statusing it and stops offensive threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados and Calm Mind Suicune and Jirachi from setting up. Explosion is a more offensive option than Taunt, as it immediately removes a prominent wall such as Clefable or a sweeper such as Dragonite and Gyarados. Will-O-Wisp and Focus Blast helps to dissuade Steel-types and other resists from switching in to absorb Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature help Gengar Speed tie with non-Choice Scarf variants of Gengar and Latias while letting it outspeed non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, Flygon, and Infernape. 84 HP EVs guarantee Gengar survives non-Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump from full after Stealth Rock damage, which lets Gengar spinblock against it. They also allow it to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit from full after Stealth Rock damage and give a comfortable damage roll against Breloom's Seed Bomb as well as burned Swampert's Waterfall and Jirachi's Iron Head. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack to pump up Gengar's damage output. Gengar can run a Naive nature to help power up Explosion, as a Hasty nature would allow Tyranitar to Pursuit it more easily.</p> <p>Gengar has many viable item choices, but Black Sludge is the best to help stave off sand damage and keep Gengar out of range of Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit. Especially against defensive teams, Gengar often wants to stay on the field as long as it can to continue harassing them with Taunt and its coverage. However, Lum Berry is also a great option especially alongside more offensive teammates, as it allows Gengar to absorb Breloom's Spore and prevent paralysis from defensive Latias and Starmie from ruining it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Gengar is not exactly bulky to begin with, the best way to bring it on the field is by switching it into the very popular Fighting-, Normal-, and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Infernape and Jirachi as well as Choice-locked Pokemon like Flygon and Heracross. Then, Gengar's coverage and natural offensive presence make it excellent at forcing switches, which gives it more opportunities to spread burns. Once foes like Jirachi, Scizor, and Tyranitar are crippled, Gengar has a much easier time dealing with them, since they mostly rely on physical hits. On top of that, Gengar's Ghost typing is useful to prevent Starmie from spinning, and it can be sacrificed to Starmie's Hydro Pump to allow a teammate like Pursuit Choice Scarf Tyranitar to revenge kill it, which helps keep entry hazards up. Also, keep in mind the drop in damage against certain important targets due to the lack of Special Attack investment; specifically, Focus Blast no longer guarantees an OHKO against bulkless Heatran and Tyranitar, which obviously makes things even dicier against bulkier sets.</p> <p>When facing more defensive archetypes, this Gengar can be a pain to beat because status absorbers like Clefable and RestTalk Rotom-A lose to it one-on-one. It basically forces a foe like Jirachi, Skarmory, Hippowdon, or Bronzong to be burned, which considerably hampers its durability. Taunt is an absolute nightmare for foes that generally sponge Gengar's attacks, as it prevents them from healing. However, using Taunt against Bold Zapdos when you expect it to use Roost is risky, since even uninvested Thunderbolt will significantly damage Gengar. These defensive foes also often don't expect Explosion, meaning Gengar can take out a wall trying to stomach its attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar works well alongside entry hazards, as it forces a lot of switches and can remove some threats with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and either Taunt or Explosion. Additionally, Gengar's Ghost typing is useful to keep them up because it prevents Starmie from spinning. Skarmory is the premier choice, as it can set up multiple layers of Spikes, which supports Gengar in the long run to help deal with threats like Jirachi and Heatran. Skarmory can also take advantage of having Jirachi and Metagross burned, as it will take a pittance of damage from Fire Punch and Explosion. Roserade also appreciates Gengar's ability to help with more defensive teams and isn't vulnerable to being trapped by Magnezone. Other prominent Spikes partners work great: Swampert can set up Stealth Rock and can switch into Steel-type moves, while Gengar's typing helps it deal with Grass-types, especially Breloom, as it is also immune to Fighting-type moves. Choice Specs Latias can help wear down Choice Scarf Tyranitar so that Gengar can more easily ravage defensive teams relying on Tyranitar to remove Gengar, while Gengar can burn Steel-types trying to absorb Latias's Draco Meteor. Lucario particularly appreciates having Jirachi burned and the residual damage from entry hazards wearing down foes and has great typing synergy with Gengar. Life Orb Flygon helps wear down opposing Steel-types and walls for Gengar, while Gengar can potentially Knock Off Clefable's Leftovers and helps block Rapid Spin. Tyranitar is a very interesting option, especially Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as it almost ensures with Gengar that Starmie will not remove hazards. Gengar also helps switch into attacks Tyranitar is weak to.</p> <p>Steel-types in general are awesome to pair with Gengar, as they provide key resistances, and Gengar helps with switching into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. Heatran can take advantage of the burns Gengar spreads with moves like Magma Storm and Protect and appreciates Toxic Spikes that Roserade could set. Magnezone can take advantage of having Jirachi burned to have an easier time trapping it, while it helps Gengar at dealing with Steel-types. Empoleon really appreciates having foes like Clefable, Blissey, and specially defensive Jirachi being worn down by the combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, or even removed with Explosion. Gliscor is also a great option, as it forms a nice Fighting-resistant core and uses Taunt or even Swords Dance, compounding with Gengar to pressure defensive teams. Gengar additionally is excellent on more hyper offensive Spikes teams as an aggressive spinblocker. Teammates such as Trick + Iron Ball Metagross, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi appreciate how Gengar can burn Steel-types and its ability to keep walls low with Taunt or remove them with Explosion.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gengar's frailty and ability to force switches with its offensive pressure make it a perfect candidate for Substitute. Substitute blocks prominent ways of neutralizing Gengar, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and offensive Scizor, status, bulkier foes surviving a hit and KOing back, and Clefable's Knock Off, which doesn't break the Substitute. Substitute also facilitates Pain Split, as with Life Orb recoil, it lowers Gengar's health further to increase healing on high HP walls such as Blissey, Hippowdon, and Clefable. However, since Gengar is highly susceptible to phazing because it lacks Taunt and can be worn down quickly, another option is Trick alongside Black Sludge. In conjunction with Black Sludge, Gengar can easily wear down walls reliant on Leftovers recovery. It is especially useful against defensive Jirachi, as with Substitute to take its attacks and Black Sludge wearing it down, it struggles to continually heal with Wish and Protect. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast become even more powerful behind a Substitute, as few Pokemon avoid a 2HKO from Gengar's potentially Life Orb boosted attacks. The Substitute also helps if Gengar misses Focus Blast, as it will have another chance to use it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple maximum Speed and Special Attack EV spread with a Timid nature help Gengar be as strong and fast as possible. Life Orb is the item of choice with Pain Split, as Pain Split helps to offset the damage and makes Gengar's attacks hit hard. However, Gengar is worn down extremely quickly with Life Orb recoil and HP needed to make a Substitute. Black Sludge helps to minimize this residual damage and allows it to continually make Substitute. Black Sludge is critical with Trick to wear down walls besides Clefable and Poison-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Especially with Life Orb, Gengar should only come in on moves it is immune to or through free switches, as even with Pain Split, it can be worn down quite quickly and despises being statused. Once it has set up a Substitute, Gengar is free to attack and heal itself as it needs to. Pain Split is not reliable recovery, however, and it prone to being taking advantage of. Multiple low health foes, Gengar not being behind a Substitute, and phazing it before it can heal could keep it at low health. Try to vary the timing of Pain Split to avoid being too predictable.</p> <p>While Gengar can be very effective against more defensive teams that struggle to pressure it behind a Substitute, Gengar should be careful to not trade with a threat if it gets too low on health. With Black Sludge, Gengar should scout what it wants to use Trick on, as hitting Clefable trying to stall out Focus Blast is unproductive. Gengar also should beware of Knock Off, as if either itself or the foe is hit with Knock Off, Trick will fail. Beware of using Trick around Clefable for this purpose.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar appreciates free switches into its immunities above all else, so partners that can do this are excellent. U-turn users such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Scizor are effective, as they can U-turn Gengar into walls that cannot really hurt it. Another option is Steel-types with Substitute such as Heatran and Empoleon, as if they invite in Ground- and Fighting-types attacks that Gengar can switch in. Walls such as Blissey and Clefable almost certainly will not try to use status moves or Knock Off on a Substitute. Gengar also appreciates entry hazards to further facilitate it wearing down the opponent. While Substitute sets are not as effective at keeping up entry hazards due to its frailty, they do allow it to power through bulkier foes with Life Orb. Skarmory and Roserade are effective at setting up Spikes and appreciate the extra power Gengar has against more defensive opponents. Other Spikes offense partners such as Latias, Swampert, mixed Flygon, and offensive Jirachi are effective. Latias especially appreciates Gengar, as with Substitute, Gengar can potentially turn the table on Tyranitar and remove it. Latias provides crucial defensive utility that bulkless Gengar struggles to provide, such as against Breloom and other Fighting-types. Latias and Choice Scarf Flygon enjoy Gengar using Trick on Steel-types such as Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross, while Tyranitar and offensive Trick Room Bronzong appreciate defensive Jirachi being worn down with Black Sludge.</p> <p>Substitute Gengar especially appreciates Magnezone, as it can trap opposing Skarmory trying to survive Focus Blast and phaze out Gengar. It also can trap Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Metagross, who can survive two Shadow Ball and remove Gengar, while Scizor's Bullet Punch and Pursuit combo devastate frailer Gengar. Other prominent Magnezone offensive partners such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Breloom, Metagross, and Gyarados appreciate the Magnezone and Gengar pairing.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>An offensive Gengar with full access to its coverage moves and support movepool can be scary to deal with. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast give Gengar complete type coverage and hit some of the metagame's top threats for super effective damage. Focus Blast always OHKOes maximum HP Tyranitar in sandstorm, easily 2HKOes Clefable even after Knock Off, and always OHKOes minimum HP Heatran. Explosion is the most prominent other attacking option, as it OHKOes most offensive Pokemon that do not resist it such as Gyarados and Dragonite while also OHKOing Blissey and offensive Suicune after Stealth Rock and sand. Thunderbolt is another option, as it offers a quick OHKO against Gyarados, even OHKOing it through Wacan Berry after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes maximum HP Suicune. The most prominent last option is Taunt. Taunt shuts down defensive foes such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, Blissey, Skarmory, and Latias from surviving the hit and healing or crippling Gengar in return. Especially since some of these Pokemon cannot damage Gengar, it forces a switch for Gengar to take advantage of another Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire can be used for its additional power against most Steel-types, most notably Scizor and Forretress, but running Hidden Power Fire forces Gengar to have an imperfect Speed IV. This IV means that Gengar will almost always lose the speed tie against Latias and other Gengar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple maximum Speed and Special Attack EV spread with either a Naive nature should Gengar use Explosion or a Timid nature helps Gengar be as strong and fast as possible. Life Orb is the most common item to make Gengar's attacks hit hard, since it is not aiming to take many hits anyway. Gengar can use a few more Attack EVs to guarantee KOing Blissey with Explosion after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar, especially without recovery, is quite frail and generally should only come in on its immunities or on free switches. From here, it should take advantage of its additional moveslots, as having both Taunt and Explosion or increased coverage such as Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire is often unexpected from Gengar. Gengar should be very careful against potential Pursuit users such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Scizor, as this set has no protection against it and Gengar will frequently be in range of Pursuit even if it stays in.</p> <p>Gengar should generally stay away from what it cannot heavily damage effectively, as without Will-O-Wisp, Steel-types that are neutral to Focus Blast, such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Scizor can survive the hit and status or KO Gengar. Faster Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Heatran and Choice Scarf Lucario can switch into Shadow Ball and revenge kill Gengar. Even with Hidden Power Fire, Gengar often can't OHKO bulkier Steel-types. As such, Gengar is typically a hit and run attacker until it sacrifices itself for a teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Gengar typically features on more fast paced Spikes teams that appreciate the additional power and chances to block Starmie's Rapid Spin. Offensive Skarmory with Stealth Rock and Spikes is an excellent partner, as opposing Rapid Spin is often catastrophic and Gengar enjoys entry hazards wearing down the foe. Skarmory fainting while setting up entry hazards also gives Gengar a free switch. Other offensive partners such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Trick + Iron Ball Metagross, offensive Calm Mind Latias, and Lucario are excellent teammates. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar appreciate Gengar wearing down defensive answers such as Jirachi and Skarmory, while they also appreciate Spikes and Stealth Rock wearing down grounded walls. Gengar also can KO or keep specially defensive Skarmory low on health with Taunt and Thunderbolt. Trick + Iron Ball Metagross can also help against Skarmory and can switch in on resisted attacks aimed at Gengar. Offensive Calm Mind Latias appreciates Gengar potentially KOing special walls and luring in Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lucario can set up on a Choice locked Pursuit and threaten to sweep with Swords Dance or Agility.</p> <p>Magnezone is also a helpful partner, as most of Gengar's answers are Steel-types. Not only can it trap and take down Scizor, it can also utilize a set with Magnet Rise to deal with both Metagross and Bronzong. Gengar is also immune to the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that are commonly directed at Magnezone. Other more offensive Magnezone partners such as Mamoswine, Swampert, and Dragonite are strong partners.</p>"

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish in OU is no joke. Its Attack stat may not be stellar, nor its Speed, but Rain Dance lets it overcome its mediocre Speed stat to become faster than anything commonly used in OU, and the rain helps make Waterfall a truly fearsome attack. Kabutops may have the higher Attack stat, but Qwilfish has many invaluable qualities such as the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and explode. You may laugh at first sight, but you won't be laughing when it proceeds to rip apart your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Qwilfish can set up Rain Dance itself, but this is better left to faster or bulkier Pokemon; Qwilfish should stick to Swords Dance. It can also utilize both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but Forretress does this better in OU. Qwilfish can use Destiny Bond to make an opponent faint if they take out Qwilfish, but you're better off Exploding in OU. Qwilfish has access to Taunt to stop opponents from using status or setting up, but Qwilfish will find very few opportunities to use it. There's Endure/Sub and Flail, but the strong presence of Tyranitar and Hippowdon in OU, as well as priority makes this not worth it. Counter is rather gimmicky, and should only be used with a Focus Sash, but it could surprise some Pokemon. Anything else of note requires Qwilfish to take a hit or be slow (Revenge, Payback, Gyro Ball), which is definitely not acceptable. Aqua Jet could be used as it gives Qwilfish come priority, but that makes it generally outclassed by Kabutops who has a higher Attack stat. Also, Aqua Jet and Swords Dance is an illegal combination, and so this limits Qwilfish's ability to use it effectively in OU.</p> <p>Just max Attack and Speed. You could drop its Speed down to 264 to just outrun Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain, but you're better off just Speed tying with Kingdra, as the HP EVs would be insignificant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types are its number one counters. Without a boost, Swampert easily disposes of it with Earthquake, and can even survive if Qwilfish is at +2, although the odds are against it if Stealth Rock is up. Suicune and Vaporeon can take it on if they have Hidden Power Electric or if Qwilfish is weakened, as a +2 Poison Jab only musters a 2HKO. Gyarados is a great counter as it has Intimidate to weaken the attacks of Qwilfish, while being able to take it out with Earthquake, and all Qwilfish can really do is explode.</p> <p>While they are UU and so aren't too common in OU, Quagsire and Toxicroak still make great counters as they are immune to Water-type moves because of Water Absorb and Dry Skin respectively, and both resist Poison-type moves. Milotic can do well if it has Hidden Power Electric since it has the bulk to take a +2 Poison Jab. Walrein can do very well against it thanks to its high HP and good Defense, but will need Earthquake to hit back or hail needs to be active; Walrein can then slowly weaken down Qwilfish through Substitute and Protect.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Qwilfish makes a great Swords Dance sweeper in the rain; a +2 STAB Waterfall boosted by the rain leaves a massive dent even in Skarmory, doing 76.3% - 90.1% to maximum HP and Defense variants, meaning it can sometimes OHKO with Stealth Rock support. Poison Jab pairs well with Waterfall, hitting most Pokemon who resist Waterfall. It always OHKOes even the most defensive of Celebi at +2, who can otherwise be a pain for Rain Dance teams. Explosion finishes off the set by allowing Qwilfish to go out with a bang and do some major damage.</p> <p>While many would opt to use Kabutops for the higher Attack stat and a STAB Stone Edge, Qwilfish does have some advantages over the prehistoric arthropod. Possibly its biggest advantage over Kabutops is that it can absorb the Toxic Spikes which cripple most Rain Dance teams. It also has a much easier time against Celebi since Kabutops has to use X-Scissor if it wants to OHKO Celebi at +2, meaning it will lose Aqua Jet and have a harder time against Scizor; on the other hand, Poison Jab is a staple move for Qwilfish. Lastly, Qwilfish has access to Explosion, which OHKOs every non Ghost-type in OU after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Adamant is the recommended nature as it gives Qwilfish as much power as possible while still being insanely fast in the rain. Running 252 Speed EVs ensures that Qwilfish speed ties with Kingdra, who can easily sweep unprepared Rain Dance teams. There's no point dropping Speed as 264 Speed would be the minimum to outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain and those extra HP EVs aren't worth missing the Speed tie with Kingdra. Jolly can be used, although it is discouraged. It doesn't let you outrun any notable threats, but could prove useful outside of the rain, allowing Qwilfish to outspeed Adamant Lucario, Jolly Gyarados, and Jolly Mamoswine. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since it doubles Qwilfish's Speed in the rain. Life Orb is used as Qwilfish needs all the power it can get, while still retaining the freedom of switching between attacks.</p> <p>When using Qwilfish, your teammates should be one of two things: Rain Dance sweepers or Rain Dance supporters. The best Rain Dance sweeper to support Qwilfish is Ludicolo because Qwilfish has a lot of trouble getting past bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, whereas Ludicolo's STAB Grass-type moves can deal with them. Kingdra is a staple on any OU Rain Dance team, and partners up effectively with Qwilfish. The mixed sweeper can clear the way for a Qwilfish sweep by dealing with Gyarados, while the special sweeper will appreciate Blissey taken care of and bulky Water-types exploded on.</p> <p>The best Rain Dance supporters to Qwilfish are those who can take its weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, and Psychic-type moves, but also those who can deal with Abomasnow, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar, whose abilities clear the rain. Swampert can switch in on Electric-type moves with impunity, and also deals with Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Scizor is another good partner as its Bullet Punch can take out both Tyranitar and Abomasnow. Electric-types, such as Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-W, and Zapdos are other great partners to take on the bulky Water-types which trouble Qwilfish, with a 100% accurate STAB Thunder in the rain. Jolteon, Magnezone, and Rotom-W can also take the Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at Qwilfish, while Rotom-W and Zapdos are immune to the Ground-type attacks Qwilfish hates.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is one of two viable mono-Electric-type Pokemon in OU, alongside Jolteon, which gives it a unique niche. Its Speed tier is incredibly desirable, getting the jump on Pokemon like Infernape, Latias, and Gengar with a Speed-boosting nature and Speed tying with Starmie; even with a neutral nature, it just barely outspeeds all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Jirachi, Flygon, Zapdos, and Shaymin. Its very good special bulk makes it a fantastic offensive answer to Pokemon like Zapdos, Gengar, and even Starmie. In particular, Raikou shrugs off all of Zapdos's attacking moves thanks to its good typing and Special Defense. Raikou also has access to Aura Sphere, which can go as far as OHKOing many variants of Tyranitar; this is something that very few special attackers can do.</p> <p>Despite its positive traits, Raikou has quite a few shortcomings that prevent it from dominating the OU landscape. If it runs Aura Sphere, it must run a Rash nature, which not only prevents it from outspeeding Infernape, Latias, and Gengar but also reduces its Special Defense considerably. Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert can completely shut down Raikou, and if it uses Hidden Power Grass to catch Swampert, it will be much worse versus other Ground-types like Flygon and Gliscor. Raikou doesn't have a reliable healing move and has subpar Defense, so it's vulnerable to physical attacks, detests status, and often sees its use limited by sand.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Raikou has a decent Substitute + Calm Mind set, which can take tremendous advantage of foes like bulky Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Jirachi. However, this set requires a tremendous amount of support to work effectively. In addition, unlike other Substitute + Calm Mind users like Jirachi and Suicune, Raikou cannot make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that it should lose to Blissey and Clefable. A RestTalk set can be used with Thunderbolt and Roar for fast phazing while asleep and more longevity, but this set is quite passive even with the phazing, and the defensive utility is hampered by a Ground weakness and lack of natural resistances. Raikou can use a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set, but neither of these sets is particularly great. Choice Scarf Raikou is generally outclassed by other revenge killers like Rotom-A, and it's most often preferable to take advantage of Raikou's unique coverage with a Shuca Berry or Life Orb rather than a Choice Specs set. Roar can also be used on a Calm Mind + 2 Attacks set as an aggressive phazer, but it can be difficult to justify this over moves like Protect, Aura Sphere, and even Shadow Ball. Weather Ball is an interesting choice that can be used with Hidden Power Grass to compensate for the loss in Ice-type coverage. In hail, Weather Ball gives Raikou the best of both worlds with Grass- and Ice-type coverage together, while in sand, Rock-type coverage is quite decent to still hit Dragonite and Zapdos super effectively while keeping Hidden Power Grass for Swampert. Rest is an option to try to turn the tables on Seismic Toss Blissey and Clefable and can even be used more offensively with Chesto Berry, but Raikou often cannot afford to be sleeping for two turns. Signal Beam mauls Celebi while still hitting Latias, but Shadow Ball hits Rotom-A as well and is more powerful. Charge Beam enables Raikou to boost its Special Attack, which compresses Thunderbolt and Calm Mind; however, Calm Mind is way more consistent. Magnet Rise can give Raikou an edge versus Metagross and Bronzong by granting it a temporary Earthquake immunity in addition to its resistance to Meteor Mash and Gyro Ball, which may force these Pokemon to use Explosion to take out Raikou.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert and Hippowdon shrug off Raikou's attacks with ease and can fire back a devastating Earthquake to OHKO it. Swampert must be careful of a surprise Hidden Power Grass, but Hippowdon is generally quite a safe bet, especially if it is specially defensive. Choice Scarf Flygon outspeeds Raikou and maims it with Earthquake. Mamoswine is not weak to Hidden Power Ice, so it is a decent check to Calm Mind + 2 Attacks sets; however, it must be careful of Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Electric</strong>: Pokemon like Celebi, Shaymin, Abomasnow, and Rotom-A can take Raikou on decently, but sometimes prior scouting must be done to ensure the safety of Abomasnow and Rotom-A. From full, however, Celebi and Shaymin can switch in, and Hidden Power Ice is very unlikely to 2HKO them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Clefable, bulky Latias, and even specially defensive Heatran can all check Raikou quite well and cripple it via Thunder Wave, Knock Off, Toxic, or even a burn from Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp. Without Aura Sphere, Tyranitar is a fantastic Raikou check with its immense special bulk and natural physical power.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Raikou's Defense is not stellar, so strong priority from the likes of Lucario, Dragonite, Breloom, and Infernape can be effective versus Raikou. In addition, faster physical attackers like Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can often force Raikou out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Raikou's already impressive Special Attack and Special Defense even higher, turning it into a potent setup sweeper. Protect is a great option to scout annoying Choice item Pokemon like Flygon, Trick Rotom-A, and Jirachi, as well as wear down foes with sand damage. In combination with status like burn and poison, Protect can be incredibly potent as a utility move to get enough chip damage for Raikou to KO a foe with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's go-to attacking option; Hidden Power Ice alongside it forms immaculate BoltBeam coverage that only Magnezone resists and hits Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragonite for massive damage, as well as Pokemon like Latias, Nidoqueen, Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Raikou needs to be as fast as possible to outpace Infernape, Latias, and Gengar as well as Speed tie at minimum with Starmie, and it also needs to deal as much damage as possible, so Special Attack and Speed are maximized. Leftovers is necessary to compensate for sand damage and take additional advantage of Protect, improving Raikou's subpar longevity. You have the option to reduce Raikou's Speed investment to 216 EVs in exchange for arbitrary bulk, but losing out on Speed tying with Starmie and even Azelf is usually not worth it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If possible, try to avoid sending Raikou into Toxic Spikes, as status will severely cripple it. Keep Raikou hidden for as long as possible. Because its longevity is poor, your opponent may have a much easier time playing around Raikou if it's revealed haphazardly. Take advantage of its great typing and special bulk and use Calm Mind when Raikou is healthy. Try not to overpredict, as Thunderbolt will usually do a significant amount of damage even to Pokemon that resist it like Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Abomasnow. When there is no sand or hail, use Protect as much as possible to passively heal with Leftovers, which can enable Raikou to use Calm Mind against foes like Zapdos and Rotom-A even at lower health. Protect can also be used to scout Toxic from Zapdos, Heatran, and even Jirachi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite its strengths, Raikou requires a lot of support. Weather clearers, while not mandatory, will heavily improve Raikou's longevity. Latias is Ground immune, can use Thunder Wave to cripple Jirachi and Metagross, and can set up rain with Rain Dance to support Raikou. Latias can also use moves like Surf and Grass Knot to KO Hippowdon and Swampert, which both check Raikou quite well. Uxie is another Ground-immune Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock and use Rain Dance. Wish support from the likes of Jirachi, Latias, and Clefable can serve to keep Raikou healthy over a longer game, enabling it to come in with less worry. Breloom can use its Grass- and Fighting-type moves against Swampert, Hippowdon, Blissey, Clefable, and Magnezone, as well as cripple a foe with Spore to assist Raikou in setting up Calm Mind more freely. Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes and also absorb them for Raikou, and it can also threaten Swampert, Hippowdon, and Magnezone with moves like Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, and Hidden Power Ground. Since Raikou has issues with special walls like Blissey and Clefable, Magma Storm Heatran can lure them in, trap them, and remove them.</p>"
      },
      "Shuca Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shuca Berry Raikou is able to function as a surprise soft check to Dragon Dance sweepers that use Earthquake and also has an easier time dealing with Ground-types in a one-on-one matchup. In addition, an all-out attacking set can be beneficial over a Calm Mind set because Raikou sometimes does not have a good opportunity to use Calm Mind. Thunderbolt is Raikou's most consistent Electric-type attack. Aura Sphere enables Raikou to effectively dispatch foes like Tyranitar, Magnezone, and even Heatran to some extent. Shadow Ball is recommended to hit Rotom-A and Latias super effectively. However, Calm Mind is still a solid alternative if you're not as worried about Rotom-A. Hidden Power Ice is preferred in the final slot, as it lets Raikou lure in and remove Pokemon like Flygon and Gliscor with the help of Shuca Berry. Hidden Power Grass is a decent alternative if Swampert is problematic for your team; however, losing out on OHKOing Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor is hard to justify.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Rash nature is mandatory with Aura Sphere, unfortunately, so Raikou will have slightly lower Special Defense than desired. That said, its special bulk is still decent enough to check Zapdos and even Gengar relatively well. Shuca Berry enables Raikou to act as a soft check to some Dragon Dance sweepers, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. It is especially important to maximize Speed, as with 329 Speed, Raikou can outspeed all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Jirachi and Flygon. In addition, not all Starmie will reach 361 Speed, like Bold Starmie in particular, so Raikou can use Speed investment to get the jump on those bulkier Starmie variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless you determine that Raikou is extremely effective at breaking your opponent's team, try to conceal it and keep it healthy for as long as possible so it can soft check setup sweepers as effectively as possible. It may be difficult to switch Raikou in safely, so it's usually best to sacrifice something in order to send Raikou in and maintain momentum or lure a foe in. That said, Raikou can switch into the likes of Zapdos, Choice Scarf Rotom-A locked into Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice, and Skarmory. While Shuca Berry can ensure that Raikou survives a powerful Ground-type attack, it will still take significantly more damage than other Shuca Berry holders like Jirachi and Tyranitar. This means that Raikou is not as secure of a check for Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite comparatively. Don't depend on Raikou too much in the teambuilder to check these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shuca Berry Raikou functions rather independently for the most part, but it can especially benefit from Spikes and Rapid Spin support. A lead Skarmory or Froslass can set up entry hazards early and help Raikou maintain momentum with its coverage and speed to maximize its effectiveness. Starmie can help to combat foes like Infernape and Gengar and provide essential Rapid Spin support to support Raikou in staying healthy to increase its capabilities as a Shuca Berry holder. Other means of preventing entry hazards from going up also pair well with Raikou, like Taunt Azelf and Aerodactyl. A mixed Jirachi with Iron Head can combine well with Raikou to both wallbreak and potentially prevent hazards from going up with its Iron Head and additional type coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Raikou can function as a unique attacking lead due to its natural bulk that enables it to often survive one attack as well as high power, great coverage, priority, and, most importantly, STAB-boosted Thunderbolt. Aura Sphere is a desirable move for an Electric-type special attacker, as Tyranitar is not a secure check like it is versus other Electric-types like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Jolteon. Hidden Power Ice combines with Thunderbolt and Aura Sphere to give Raikou perfect coverage. It also hits Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor for devastating damage, as well as Grass-types and Latias super effectively. Extreme Speed rounds out the set with priority to finish off opposing leads like Azelf, Empoleon, and even Aerodactyl. Hidden Power Grass can be used as an alternative to deal massive damage to Swampert; however, Hidden Power Ice is quite crucial for its better coverage overall, especially versus Latias and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Raikou is required to use a Rash nature due to Aura Sphere, but on this set it's not as consequential. The reduced Special Defense is rarely impactful, as Raikou usually only takes one hit in the lead position and doesn't have as much longevity to take advantage of extra Special Defense. In addition, the bonus in Special Attack is essential to deal as much damage as possible to foes like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Clefable, as well as more securely guaranteeing a 2HKO on Focus Sash Machamp with Thunderbolt. Lum Berry is the recommended item to more reliably take on Machamp and Roserade; however, Life Orb is an alternative option to have better odds versus lead Azelf and go all in on dealing as much damage as possible and wreaking havoc early on. A Life Orb strategy is a bit more risky, as the lead matchup versus Machamp and Roserade becomes worse, and Lum Berry is often very convenient in its own right for attacks like Jirachi's Body Slam and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Shuca Berry is a strong alternative item as well to surprise lead Choice Scarf Flygon and for its overall utility.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lead Raikou is simple to use, as Thunderbolt is very powerful and hits most non-Ground-types for significant damage. Playing aggressively with predictions can be very rewarding, like using Thunderbolt on a Ground-type pivot that's weak to Hidden Power Ice as it switches out, dealing significant damage to the switch-in with Thunderbolt. This is further supported by Raikou's ability to pressure common Stealth Rock leads like Jirachi, Empoleon, and Metagross, often forcing them to choose between attacking Raikou and setting up Stealth Rock. Due to Raikou's diverse toolkit, many leads that it may match up badly against, like Swampert and even Flygon, may try to scout for Hidden Power Grass and Shuca Berry. In these cases, if you wish to switch out, it's important to find a solid midground against these Pokemon. Even if Raikou takes an attack and is at low health, it is often worth preserving it for death fodder later. Furthermore, if you're lucky, Raikou can come in again and fire off one or two powerful attacks before going down, hopefully doing enough damage to make it a worthwhile attacking lead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lead Raikou functions quite independently in a more hyper offensive manner. That said, some Pokemon combine well with it to compensate for its bad matchups. Skarmory is a fantastic partner because it can switch into all of the leads that Raikou loses against, like Metagross, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Starmie appreciates Raikou's strength against bulky Water-types like Milotic and Suicune and can wear down Ground-types and Metagross for it. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Lucario appreciate Raikou's ability to chip Pokemon like Jirachi and Rotom-A. Gyarados can take advantage of Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquake, which is often used to take out Raikou. Lucario's powerful Extreme Speed is great for finishing off weakened foes from Raikou's attacks. If you're using a Raikou + Skarmory hyper offensive Spikes-stacking team, Gengar, Rotom-A, and Tyranitar pair nicely for entry hazard control.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune has established itself as a DPP staple due to its prowess as a bulky sweeper. Its Water typing, awesome defensive stats, decent Speed tier, and access to Calm Mind allow it to be an enormous offensive threat while checking Heatran, Infernape, Swampert, Gyarados, Kingdra, Bronzong, and Metagross—threats that Suicune teams typically struggle to handle. It can also take advantage of defensive teams’ lack of strong counterplay to Water-types; +1 offensive Suicune almost 2HKOes Clefable and Jirachi with Hydro Pump and 2HKOes everything else commonly used on these teams, opening up the way for other Water-types and attackers such as Infernape. In addition, it also is one of the more difficult threats for hyper and bulky offenses to beat, as it has enough bulk to be an emergency answer to Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>Suicune is also a good sweeper on defensive teams, with its Pressure ability and high defenses allowing it to use Calm Mind multiple times and eventually sweep through defensive teams that can’t punish it while asleep or behind a 101 HP Substitute. Suicune is one of the better Substitute users in the game; it loves blocking status, Knock Off, Trick, and Explosion and can also drain PP effectively with Pressure, especially against Seismic Toss. In a last Pokemon situation, Suicune has strong comeback potential, as it can no longer be phazed. Additionally, while Suicune has a limited movepool, it can effectively use options such as Protect to further drain PP with Pressure, Toxic to punish walls such as Milotic, and even Roar to win Calm Mind wars against Latias, Jirachi, and other Suicune.</p> <p>However, Suicune is vulnerable to all entry hazards—sets without Rest struggle mightily against Toxic Spikes, and even with Rest, Suicune can get chipped easily if it is forced in by phazing repeatedly with Stealth Rock and Spikes set. Suicune also has little protection against Trick, struggles against status, and is threatened by powerful Electric- and Grass-type attacks from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A, Celebi, and Roserade. Suicune’s offensive Calm Mind sets often get chipped quite easily, whereas the defensive sets can struggle with coverage issues against Pokemon like Breloom, Latias, Dragonite, and Milotic. Suicune’s Substitute sets also are crippled by sand, as they can no longer repeatedly use Substitute against the likes of Clefable, Blissey, and defensive Jirachi without Leftovers recovery. Finally, Suicune can be easily crippled by special walls such as Clefable using Knock Off or Encore and Blissey using Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar on the offensive Calm Mind set lets it set up alongside Latias, Jirachi, and other Suicune and phaze them. This is particularly notable because Calm Mind + Roar Latias is typically slower than an invested Suicune. Suicune can also use Roar to make up for the lack of Hidden Power Electric against boosted Gyarados, which is unlikely to use Taunt out of fear of Hidden Power Electric. Toxic on the offensive Calm Mind set ruins Latias, Milotic, and Swampert. Suicune has usable non-Calm Mind sets, such as running Roar or Ice Beam over Calm Mind on the RestTalk set. However, these are extremely passive and struggle against anything that resists Water. Suicune can use other Hidden Power types, with Grass nailing Swampert and Quagsire while still hitting Water-types other than Gyarados, and Fire surprising Abomasnow. However, these are quite niche and not hitting Gyarados hard is a big loss. Substitute Suicune can change the weather itself with Rain Dance over Protect or Ice Beam. However, this strategy still struggles against Encore Clefable while not giving additional help against Latias and Breloom. Suicune can use Tailwind, Reflect, or even Mirror Coat to beat specific matchups but all are niche at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are very few Pokemon that can check all of Suicune’s sets. Grass-types that are fantastic answers to CroCune mostly lose to +1 offensive Suicune’s Ice Beam. Strong special walls can easily lose to Substitute + Protect Suicune and CroCune. As such, Suicune is often checked with multiple Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Abomasnow, Roserade, Celebi, Breloom, and Shaymin are great initial switch-ins into Suicune. Abomasnow is perhaps the best counter in the game, as it sets up hail and easily eliminates all Suicune sets with its Wood Hammer or annoys them with Leech Seed. However, all of the others need to be careful: bulkless Roserade is OHKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock and its Leaf Storm can’t always OHKO back without a boosting item or Modest nature, Celebi needs a lot of Speed and a boosted Leaf Storm to KO back, Breloom cannot take boosted Ice Beam at all, and Shaymin needs to be careful of running out of Seed Flare PP.</p> <p><strong>Sand Stream</strong>: While Tyranitar and Hippowdon handily lose to Suicune, their summoned sand negating Leftovers recovery makes it much harder to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Clefable and Blissey are great initial switch-ins to Suicune. Clefable has Encore and Knock Off to cripple Suicune, and Blissey completely walls offensive Suicune. However, Clefable is almost 2HKOed by +1 Suicune and Blissey completely loses to CroCune and Substitute Suicune unless sand is up—both will eventually run out of Seismic Toss PP against CroCune and Substitute Suicune as long as Suicune still has its Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos, Rotom-A, Raikou, and even Jolteon can offensively check Suicune. Modest Choice Specs Zapdos notably OHKOes +1 offensive Suicune with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock in sand. However, they all struggle to take boosted hits from offensive Suicune and can eventually run out of PP against the Substitute + Protect set.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>:  Even though Latias, Dragonite, and Kingdra generally lose against Suicune's boosted Ice Beam, they completely stop sets that rely solely on Surf. Latias also can paralyze offensive sets, remove less bulky sets with super effective coverage, or phaze, while Dragonite and Kingdra hit Suicune hard with their Dragon-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>:  Water-types such as Empoleon, Starmie, and Gyarados can check Suicune if it lacks Hidden Power Electric. Vaporeon and Quagsire are completely immune to Suicune's Water-type moves and can cripple it with Toxic, Encore, or Roar. Milotic has access to Haze, although Suicune can PP stall it due to Pressure.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Suicune despises Toxic Spikes. In addition, poison and burn seriously cut into its longevity and force CroCune to use Rest earlier. Latias is a great way to force paralysis onto Suicune, as it typically outspeeds and has great defenses. If Suicune is paralyzed, Pokemon like Breloom, defensive Roserade, and Celebi become better checks, as they can use STAB moves without fearing boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Phazing with Entry Hazards</strong>: As Suicune mostly doesn’t run Roar, forcing it to lose boosts via Roar, Whirlwind, or even Encore is a great way to wear it down. Making Suicune come in on Spikes and Stealth Rock while asleep and then forcing it out again is a common way for defensive teams to defeat it. Skarmory, Latias, Clefable with Encore, and defensive Zapdos phaze it well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: A common way to neuter Suicune is to chip it and revenge kill it with a Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tyranitar, whose Stone Edge does 43.4 - 51.3%, Latias, whose Draco Meteor does 35.1 - 41.6% to +1 Suicune, or Flygon, whose Jolly Outrage does 42.5 - 50.4%. Entry hazards often weaken Suicune to the point where it can be revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Giving Suicune a Choice item via Rotom-A, Latias, or Jirachi especially cripples CroCune and Substitute sets. However, one must be careful of a boosted offensive Suicune sweeping a weakened team with +1 Hydro Pump regardless.</p>",

      "Supercune (Offensive Calm Mind)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Suicune is one of the most dangerous Calm Mind users in the metagame, taking advantage of its bulk to set up on Pokemon such as Heatran and Gliscor.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is threatening even with no boosts, OHKOing Heatran without bulk investment after Stealth Rock. It additionally OHKOes Lucario with a Special Defense drop, 2HKOes most Metagross, and 2HKOes most Tyranitar without a Passho Berry. Ice Beam gives Suicune coverage against many Grass- and Dragon-types that threaten it, including Breloom, Latias, Roserade, and Dragonite, while also giving a super effective option against Zapdos. Finally, Hidden Power Electric threatens other Water-types, notably OHKOing bulkless Gyarados 75% of the time after Stealth Rock, combating opposing Suicune and eventually beating Haze Milotic through PP stalling.</p> <p>After using Calm Mind, Suicune becomes even more threatening and able to seriously damage most of its answers. Frail offensive checks such as bulkless Rotom-A and most Breloom can no longer take Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Common answers to Water-types such as Kingdra, defensive Latias, and Empoleon can be 2HKOed by Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric. Additionally, do not underestimate Suicune’s ability to tank hits at +1—only Modest Choice Specs Zapdos can guarantee an OHKO on +1 Suicune after Stealth Rock. This allows Suicune to, in an emergency, take a strong hit, such as Roserade’s Leaf Storm, Celebi’s Leaf Storm, or Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, and come out on top. Another option over Hidden Power Electric is Protect, as a common answer to Suicune is an Explosion from Passho Berry Heatran, Bronzong, or Metagross—especially helpful in the lead slot to block Explosion. In addition, Protect drains foes' PP, gives additional Leftovers recovery, and scouts moves such as Trick and Encore. However, missing coverage on Water-types like Gyarados, Milotic, Empoleon, and Starmie is a big loss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Suicune should be running a Timid nature most of the time. Suicune sits at a very valuable Speed tier, and typically needs to invest fully or nearly fully in Speed to outspeed Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and Mamoswine. Additionally, Timid Suicune’s Speed outpaces defensive variants of Jirachi, Celebi, Roserade, Zapdos and Latias. However, as a lesser option, Modest allows Suicune some notable power benchmarks, such as a chance to 2HKO Clefable and specially defensive Jirachi after Stealth Rock at +1. Suicune can also sacrifice Speed and Special Attack to run more bulk, as, without Stealth Rock, it is normally very close to getting OHKOed by +1 Dragonite's Outrage and 2HKOed by +1 Gyarados. An example spread is 48 HP / 52 Def / 180 SpA / 228 Spe with a Modest nature, which maximizes Leftovers recovery, survives +1 non Life Orb Dragonite after Stealth Rock and one round of Leftovers, and outspeeds Jolly Breloom, Adamant Gyarados, and Adamant Dragonite.</p> <p>Suicune can be even more offensive and forgo Leftovers for Lum Berry. Lum Berry grants Suicune an enormous advantage against defensive teams, as a common way to neutralize it is to paralyze it and slowly wear it down with Clefable. To paralyze at +1 Suicune, Latias or Clefable typically will sacrfice themselves to pull off Thunder Wave, potentially opening defensive teams to other threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While offensive Calm Mind Suicune can sweep, it typically plays as an offensive team’s primary switch-in to Heatran, answers Gyarados and Dragonite in emergencies, trades with threats such as Metagross, Swampert, and Infernape, and sets up early-game before sand is up to weaken answers to Water-types such as Latias and Roserade. Especially if it has a Lum Berry or is leading, Suicune should be very aggressive with its health to open up holes in the opposing team.</p> <p>Suicune should be ready to use Calm Mind immediately if the opposing Pokemon can’t threaten it effectively, as even its checks can struggle against it if boosted. Suicune really appreciates teammates weakening or eliminating Water switch-ins, offensive Electric-types, and special walls such as Roserade, Shaymin, Zapdos, and Clefable. Suicune also enjoys a field clear of sand to use its natural bulk and power at +1 to push past its checks. Try to avoid getting Suicune statused, as it becomes much worse against Breloom and defensive Roserade if paralyzed, for example. Trick from Rotom-A or Latias can cripple Suicune; however, if Hydro Pump answers are gone, Suicune can sweep at +1 despite being Choice locked. If Suicune has Protect, aggressively predicting Explosion, such as right after switches it in on non-Leftovers Heatran, can often pay dividends against opponents desperate to remove it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune really shines on bulky offensive Fire / Water / Grass cores, where it complements Pokemon like Heatran and Roserade. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and generally threatens the Grass-types that scare out Suicune, such as Roserade and Celebi. Bulkier Heatran sets also assist against defensive Jirachi, which can tank boosted Suicune hits and paralyze it with Body Slam. Roserade especially assists Suicune by removing Toxic Spikes, a giant thorn in its side. Roserade can also set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which helps wear down Celebi, Milotic, Blissey, and even Vaporeon. Suicune also appreciate a strong offensive Water-type alongside it, such as Empoleon, Kingdra, Choice Specs Starmie, or Swampert, so both can synergistically weaken Water-type checks. Teammates like Gengar and the aforementioned Heatran can cripple or remove defensive checks such as Clefable, Blissey, and Latias with Explosion, while Heatran can further lure Water-types such as Starmie and Milotic with a Passho Berry + Explosion set. Trick users like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice item Latias are another way to hinder special walls. Breloom is a great Suicune partner, as it absorbs status and Knock Off once its Toxic Orb has activated and counters special walls. Suicune appreciates a Ground-type or Tyranitar—but remember that sand weakens it—to absorb strong Electric-type attacks from the likes of Zapdos and Rotom-A. Effective Ground-types include Swampert, Nidoqueen to set up and absorb Toxic Spikes, Gliscor, and Choice Scarf Flygon. Suicune also appreciates Magnezone support, as bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Skarmory can cripple Suicune with status, tank a hit and use Explosion on it or phaze it.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune can fit on a variety of other archetypes too. Hyper offense teams, such as those built around dual screens provided by Uxie, Azelf, or Cresselia, enjoy its strong power at +1 as well as its ability to plug many defensive holes these teams typically have. Very aggressive special offensive teams built around Infernape, Choice Specs Latias, and Rotom-A appreciate Lum Berry Suicune's ability to power through defensive Pokemon. Other Pokemon that can fit on these aggressive teams are Dragon Dance Tyranitar to help break through shared checks like Milotic, Dragon Dance Gyarados to form a strong Water-type offensive core, Life Orb Swords Dance Scizor to eliminate Skarmory, and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Suicune can also fit on rain teams alongside other Water-types such as Empoleon, and generally it works well on offensive teams that want some added security against Dragon Dance users and Heatran.</p>"

      "CroCune (Defensive Calm Mind + RestTalk)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>CroCune is a strong late-game sweeper for defensive teams that also serves as a great switch-in to common threats to those teams such as Heatran, physical Jirachi, Metagross, and Swampert.</p> <p>A defensive Calm Mind set allows Suicune to set up many boosts in the face of Pokemon that can’t really threaten it, such as Swampert, Heatran, physical Jirachi, Metagross, and most Tyranitar. Calm Mind also makes Suicune amazing in a last Pokemon situation, as it can set up without being phazed. Surf is the only viable attack, as this Suicune really needs the additional PP to handle Clefable, defensive Jirachi, Blissey, and Milotic. Despite lacking investment, Suicune’s Surf can still dent what it needs to, OHKOing Infernape after Stealth Rock, 2HKOing Heatran, and 3HKOing most Tyranitar. At +6, the only common threats Suicune can’t break through are defensive Celebi, Latias, and Milotic, though Breloom and Dragonite are especially difficult to handle if Suicune hasn't gotten enough boosts to KO them. RestTalk is Suicune's only form of recovery and status removal, but its status removal means Suicune isn't immediately crippled by Toxic Spikes, can set up on status inducing defensive answers such as Body Slam Jirachi, and isn't as affected by sand as other sets are.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Suicune should always be running at least 401 HP for Seismic Toss from Clefable or Blissey in case sand is up or Suicune takes Knock Off from Clefable important if sand is up. A Bold nature helps it survive its sleeping turns and be a blanket check to physical threats such as Metagross, Swampert, Infernape, and Trick Room Bronzong. However, Suicune can run more Speed, such as 16 EVs to outspeed Machamp and minimum Speed Rotom-A and 64 EVs to outspeed Swampert and neutral nature Tyranitar. Additionally, it is possible to put all or some of the physical bulk into Special Attack and run a Modest nature.  A spread of 252 HP / 240 SpA / 16 Spe lets Suicune significantly threaten defensive teams with a much stronger Surf against Scizor, Bronzong, Metagross, Clefable, and Jirachi.  However, without a Bold nature, Suicune is more vulnerable to Explosion and takes more damage from physical Pokemon it is meant to help wall, especially if sand or entry hazards are set. This also makes it harder to get past bad Sleep Talk turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Suicune commonly plays as a more offensive version of Milotic, using its resistances and Pressure to shore defensive teams against strong threats, like Choice Band Gyarados, Swampert, Heatran, and Dynamic Punch Machamp. However, Suicune is very vulnerable while using Rest, so one should not be careless with its health—it should not be the only switch-in to these Pokemon. Suicune shouldn’t attempt a sweep while threats such as Breloom, Milotic, and Roar Latias are still active, as they will instantly stall any momentum it has. As Suicune is vulnerable to sand and really wants its Leftovers, it should avoid Clefable's and Gliscor’s Knock Off. If many entry hazards are set, Suicune will have trouble getting out of spamming Rest, so opposing Spikes stacking teams mandate picking the correct time to wall a threat or set up is. Take advantage of this Suicune’s ability to shrug off status against Pokemon like defensive Jirachi to get multiple boosts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Suicune is commonly used as a late-game sweeper on defensive teams and really appreciates teammates that can mitigate its flaws: reliance on one attack, relative passivity, and vulnerability to Trick and Explosion. Suicune needs solid answers to Breloom as well as Haze Milotic and defensive Celebi. Examples of these teammates include Gliscor, Zapdos, and Latias. RestTalk Suicune can even absorb Breloom’s Spore, allowing Gliscor and Zapdos to beat it more comfortably. Latias can also use Healing Wish on Suicune in dire situations. Good Pokemon to punish Milotic and Celebi, such as Skarmory, are also appreciated. Strong special walls like Clefable and Blissey can help with Suicune’s vulnerability to Rotom-A, Roserade, and Zapdos, while Choice Scarf Tyranitar can Pursuit trap any Rotom-A or Latias trying to use Trick. Since this Suicune is so passive before boosting, Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Flygon can revenge kill Gyarados and Dragonite trying to set up on it. Rotom-A can also run more defensive sets such as RestTalk to absorb Explosion and handle some of Suicune's defensive responsibility. Suicune struggles with entry hazards and appreciates Rapid Spin support. Forretress is a common choice on defensive teams, especially as Starmie and Tentacruel don’t fit well alongside this Suicune, and it provides Spikes support to wear down Suicune answers. In the event spinning is difficult, Suicune also enjoys a grounded Poison-type teammate to absorb Toxic Spikes. Roserade and Nidoqueen are solid choices that can set their own Toxic Spikes. They help with threats such as Milotic and Water Absorb Pokemon such as Quagsire and Vaporeon. While this Suicune is not as weak to sand as other Suicune sets, removing sand with choices like Rain Dance Bronzong, Cresselia, Uxie, and Latias, or Sunny Day Breloom and even Flygon, is effective.</p> <p>Calm Mind RestTalk Suicune also fits well with lures or trappers to remove its answers. For Skarmory, the gold standard is Magnezone, but other options like Trick Iron Ball Metagross and unexpected Fire- or Electric-type coverage on a Pokemon such as Tyranitar work well too. For Breloom, Dragon Dance Chople Berry Tyranitar fits well with its boosted Ice Punch. Additionally, options that absorb Breloom's Spore such as Choice Specs Sleep Talk Latias and Lum Berry Jirachi, as well as Lum Berry Metagross with Psychic-type coverage, are also effective. Other Tyranitar and Jirachi, such as those with Thunder Wave and Body Slam, respectively, also work well for helping check defensive Latias with Roar. Passho Berry Magma Storm Heatran can lure in Milotic and Clefable and offensively check Roserade, Celebi, and Rotom-A.</p>"
      },
      "SubCune": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute Suicune is strong setup sweeper that uses Pressure, Protect, and 101 HP Substitutes to quickly drain PP from moves like Seismic Toss and Thunderbolt. Notably, teams often use low PP moves to counter Suicune, such as Clefable’s Encore, Roserade’s Leaf Storm, and Latias’s Draco Meteor. Substitute also protects Suicune from common ways to neutralize it such as status, Trick, Knock Off, critical hits, and Explosion while scouting opposing moves.</p> <p>In addition to making Suicune such a threat, Calm Mind makes its Substitute very difficult to break by special moves, such as Timid Heatran's Earth Power. RestTalk Rotom-A’s Thunderbolt cannot break +3 Suicune's Substitute, and non-Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball cannot break +1 Suicune. Surf is the standard due to its much greater PP, as Substitute and Protect allow Suicune to accrue many boosts. However, Hydro Pump can be used on more offensive variants, particularly those that forgo Protect for Ice Beam or invest more in Special Attack instead of Speed. Protect makes further use of Suicune’s Pressure, but Ice Beam is very nice to prevent Roar Latias and Breloom from defeating Suicune and more quickly damage Ice-weak threats in general like Zapdos, Dragonite, and Roserade.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Suicune needs maximum HP for its 101 HP Substitute. Beyond this, there are many to EV this Suicune. The standard spread gives its Surf some power in case it can't set up very much. The remaining Speed lets Suicune outspeed all non Choice Scarf Tyranitar and also set up on defensive Body Slam Jirachi without getting paralyzed. Some additional Speed EVs can be used to outrun Jirachi built for a similar benchmark. 196 Speed and a Timid nature outpaces Adamant Lucario and can potentially prevent Thunder Wave from defensive Latias or Explosion from Heatran. Other Speed investments include 16 EVs to outspeed RestTalk Rotom and Machamp, 64 EVs to outspeed neutral Tyranitar, and 228 EVs to outspeed Jolly Breloom and Adamant Gyarados. The remainder can be put into Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since this Suicune is much more of a dedicated sweeper than the other sets, it needs to be played carefully so that it doesn’t lose too much HP. How it plays depends on whether or not it has Protect. With Protect, try not to reveal Suicune until the opposing team is scouted for anything that could beat it. Suicune’s Protect + Substitute antics allow it to PP stall answers to it, but it absolutely must avoid status. With Ice Beam, preserving its health isn't quite as important, as typically it won't try to get higher than +1. For both variants, try to avoid setting up in sand or hail and eliminate Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow to make the most of Leftovers recovery. If Clefable directly switches into Suicune, try to use Protect to PP stall Encore.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Suicune set needs quite a bit of support. Above all else, this Suicune loves a grounded Poison-type that can absorb and set up Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen and Roserade are conventional options that cover defensive holes, while Qwilfish can take advantage of its offensive presence to set up entry hazards or use Explosion on walls. Another valuable piece of support is changing the weather, as Suicune is much more effective with Leftovers actively healing it. This can be done on a dedicated rain team with Pokemon like Rain Dance Azelf, Uxie, Bronzong, Scizor, Latias, and Rotom-W, or with Sunny Day Flygon or Breloom. Suicune enjoys lures and trappers to remove solid answers such as Roar Latias, Whirlwind Skarmory, and Encore Clefable. Pokemon working well here include Trick Iron Ball Metagross for Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, Magma Storm + Explosion Heatran for special walls, Gengar, Choice Specs Latias for Breloom, and Magnezone. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Swampert, Life Orb Mixed Flygon, and Breloom work well too.</p> <p>This Suicune generally needs to be close to full HP and have the opposing team scouted for answers before it can sweep. As such, it greatly appreciates Wish and Healing Wish support from the likes of Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable after getting forced out. Additionally, since this Suicune cannot play a defensive role, good switch-ins to Fire- and Water-type coverage such as Latias, Roserade, and Heatran are appreciated. A strong revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Scarf Rotom-A can handle Water-resistant sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite. As mentioned above, Suicune is best alongside general rain sweepers such as Qwilfish and Kingdra, as these Pokemon force in Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow and hit them very hard. In addition, Qwilfish provides Toxic Spikes removal and Kingdra hammers shared soft answers to Water-types such as scoring a 2HKO on offensive Gyarados with Hydro Pump. Suicune also fits as a strong cleaner alongside Roserade and Heatran in a Fire / Water / Grass core to bait in and remove counters as well as take advantage of Roserade's entry hazards.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is an excellent Pokemon, being one of a meager handful of the dreaded Dragon-types left in OU. Its resistance to Stealth Rock is a major boon in comparison to Dragonite, which takes 25% damage upon switching in. On top of that, Flygon has a plethora of resistances and immunities of which it can take advantage. U-turn is an awesome attack to have on Choice item sets since it makes predicting switches a lot easier. A mixed-attacking set can also be quite devastating with its powerful STAB Dragon- and Ground-type attacks, and it has some other tricks up its sleeve. Overall, Flygon's unique typing, ability, all around solid stats, and its useful movepool make it a great teammate on many different types of builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flygon's typing and ability make it an excellent Substitute + Roost attacker with Earthquake and Dragon Claw while holding Leftovers or Soft Sand alongside Magnezone. In the same vein, a bulkier set with Toxic + Roost set has potential, but it's difficult to make room for both of these moves. Screech can be used alongside entry hazards to force many switches and pressure its foes. Fire Blast can be used on the Choice Scarf set to more immediately pressure Skarmory, but it's often unreliable and it's actually possible for Skarmory to outstall the move. Quick Attack is an interesting choice on the Choice Band set to give Flygon a somewhat decent priority move, granting it revenge killing capabilities. A Sunny Day or Power Herb + Solar Beam set could bait in and remove Swampert, but it's extremely gimmicky, and other Pokemon are better at baiting Swampert.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Ground-immune Pokemon can take advantage of Choice-locked Earthquake from Flygon and put their opponent in a bad position. Bulkier ones like Zapdos, Gliscor, and even Gyarados with its Intimidate can switch in a bit more safely. While most Steel-types fear Earthquake, Skarmory and Bronzong can counter Choice Scarf Flygon quite well, as they resist Dragon-type attacks and are immune to Earthquake; however, they must be careful of a potential mixed set with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Suicune and Milotic can check all Flygon sets aside from Choice Band provided that they are healthy. Hippowdon and Swampert are bulky enough to take most hits from Flygon as well. Clefable ignores Spikes and can stave off the mixed set with investment. Although it's niche, Porygon2 can trace Flygon's levitate, and has enough natural bulk to function as a check; it also regularly packs Ice Beam to OHKO Flygon. All of these Pokemon besides Clefable need to beware of Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types can function as a check to Flygon on a predicted Outrage. Jirachi can use Body Slam or Ice Punch, Heatran can use Hidden Power Ice, and Lucario can use Close Combat to answer Flygon. Scizor isn't weak to Earthquake and can come in on Outrage without taking too much damage, but needs to watch out for a Fire-type attack. All of these need to beware of the mixed set, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority users</strong>: Bullet Punch Scizor and Extreme Speed Lucario can deal large amounts of damage with their powerful priority moves. +1 Life Orb Dragon Dance Dragonite can KO Flygon with a bit of residual damage. Abomasnow, Mamoswine, and Weavile can deal massive damage with their 4x super effective Ice Shard.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flygon's resistances and immunities give it plenty of opportunities to switch in and revenge kill a large portion of the metagame. Earthquake and Outrage are Flygon's primary STAB options, resisted only by Levitate Bronzong and Skarmory in OU. Thunder Punch is Flygon's most consistent tool for revenge killing Gyarados, but Dragon Claw is a solid move that enable Flygon to take advantage of its Dragon-type STAB and not commit to Outrage, which can catch many opponents off guard. Roost is an interesting option on more defensive teams, as Choice Scarf Flygon is an effective Knock Off absorber and can pressure Clefable without its Choice Scarf. Although not listed, Stone Edge can be used to potentially revenge kill Gyarados and it can also pick off a weakened Zapdos. U-turn is to scout for common counters and works well with entry hazards in play as Flygon can force a lot of switches and gain momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature should be used to outspeed Tyranitar at +2 Speed or, at minimum, Speed tie with Choice Scarf Jirachi. If you feel that Jirachi and Tyranitar are controlled without the assistance of Flygon, use Adamant for more power. 88 EVs can be taken out of Attack and invested into Defense to always survive a +2 Adamant Lucario's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, but the sacrifice in power is usually not worth it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The idea of using Choice Scarf Flygon is simple. While its goal is being a revenge killer, Flygon makes an excellent secondary scout. With U-turn, Flygon can help ease the prediction when switching and, to add, could reveal another Pokemon on the opponent's side. It is best to use U-turn often when Flygon is sent out. Outrage is used as your trump card, so make sure that Flygon is not spamming this move often. If it's locked into Outrage, beware of Steel-type revenge killers like Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and even Heatran that could possibly switch in after Flygon KOes a Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this set's goal is to revenge kill Pokemon, Flygon wants support in the form of chip damage. Besides that, Flygon appreciates bulkier Pokemon first being eliminated from the field, as this set lacks the power to muscle through them. Tyranitar pairs well with Flygon, as it boasts the ability of taking down Clefable, Skarmory, Rotom, Cresselia, and other bulky Pokemon with its large range of attacks. If you're seeking a Pokemon who can keep Dragon-type attacks as well as Ice-type attacks at bay, the best solution is to use a Steel-type of your own. Magnezone support is also welcome as Steel-types counter Flygon locked into Outrage. Heatran helps Flygon take on Pokemon such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong. Heatran's nifty resistances to Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed also help Flygon revenge kill more easily as well. Furthermore, STAB Fire Blast will dent Dragonite and Gyarados switch-ins, especially if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p>Scizor can pair well with Flygon due to U-turn being common on both their movesets, greatly easing prediction and gaining momentum. Scizor also makes a great Pokemon to revenge kill Dragonite, especially one locked into Outrage. If you elect to use Scizor and Flygon, wallbreakers such as Infernape, Breloom, or Lucario are recommended. U-turns from Flygon or Scizor makes it easier to switch the wallbreakers in. Despite its use as a revenge killer, Flygon appreciates support such as Stealth Rock. Any form of indirect damage (Spikes, sandstorm, or Toxic Spikes) also makes Flygon's job easier. Skarmory doesn't mind being paired with Flygon as its weaknesses can be easily absorbed by Flygon.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This Flygon set defeats foes with brute force and also works as a lure. It is easy to fool many opponents into thinking that this Flygon is the popular Choice Scarf set, which means that the opponent will be inclined to switch in Pokemon such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Dragonite on an expected Earthquake, and they will all be heavily damaged by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Fire Blast is used for Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong, while Earthquake deals with other Steel-types and can effectively pressure Clefable. The fourth moveslot depends on your needs. Roost is invaluable to stave off residual damage and effectively answer Heatran. However, sometimes Flygon can be walled by very bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Milotic. Outrage provides the extra push need to break through, as little can withstand both physical and special Dragon-type moves as well as Fire Blast and Earthquake. Flygon is often easily revenge killed after Outrage, however.</p> <p>Flygon has many other options over Roost in the last slot; however, Flygon sorely misses recovery, especially against stall teams. These options should generally be run with an Expert Belt rather than Life Orb. U-turn is useful to scout switch-ins and deal more damage on offensive teams, but has little utility against stall. Toxic is a great option that can cripple Flygon's counters, like Hippowdon, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Suicune. Hidden Power Ice can eliminate opposing Flygon and especially specially defensive Gliscor, a common check for Flygon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flygon wants as much Speed as possible to Speed tie with maximum Speed Jirachi, Zapdos, and other Flygon at minimum. It also needs as much Special Attack investment as possible, as its base 80 Special Attack is not very high. It can also spare a few attack EVs to improve damage on Clefable, especially with Outrage. Generally, Flygon should be using Defense hindering nature rather than a Special Defense lowering one; Flygon avoids a 2HKO from maximum Special Attack Heatran's Fire Blast with its Special Defense in tact and can heal off the damage. Therefore, a Hasty nature is recommended. A Mild nature is an alternative that allows Flygon to pressure Milotic, Zapdos, and Gliscor more effectively. Exceptions to using a Defense hindering nature are teams that handle Heatran well elsewhere or need Flygon to act as a makeshift check to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, such as fully Spikes immune teams. Alternatively, Flygon can hold an Expert Belt to increase its potential to bluff holding a Choice Scarf and also not take residual damage, but Life Orb's power bonus is extremely useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Perhaps the best way to play this Flygon is to behave as if it has a Choice Scarf at first. For example, come in on a Pokemon such as Starmie (who outspeeds Flygon) and threaten it with U-turn or Thunder Punch. The Starmie user will likely switch out, at which point Flygon can use Draco Meteor against the opponent's switch-in. Against stall, you do not have to risk your Flygon as such, as it can 2HKO or OHKO every common foe on a stall team bar Hippowdon, Clefable, and Suicune, along with using Roost to heal off the residual damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flygon is a staple of the Spikes offense style due to its potency against defensive teams and more midpaced offenses that struggle to switch into it. Skarmory is perhaps mixed Flygon's best partner, as many bulky walls besides Clefable are grounded and struggle to switch-in with Spikes up. Flygon can itself switch into Skarmory's resistances to wreak havoc. Ways to prevent Rapid Spin are especially helpful too. Rotom-A and Gengar are excellent choices to block Rapid Spin. Gengar is especially potent against defensive teams, as it heavily threatens Clefable alongside Flygon, commonly outspeeds defensive Latias that try to outspeed Flygon, and can burn walls such as Hippowdon. Tyranitar is also great due to Pursuit trapping Starmie and Flygon already heavily threatens Forretress. Tyranitar can additionally sweep with Dragon Dance, as it appreciates mixed Flygon's wallbreaking ability. Lucario can take advantage of Gliscor, Gyarados, and Zapdos being lured in and defeated. Flygon appreciates revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Lucario, as they can check all of Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite that can set up on Flygon after it uses Draco Meteor. Swampert is an excellent partner to set up Stealth Rock and help Flygon against Clefable.</p> <p>Flygon also enjoys ways to remove Clefable's Leftovers, as it can 2HKO it with Earthquake + Draco Meteor without Leftovers. Specially defensive Empoleon and one's own Clefable can be quite effective and provide back up into strong special attackers that threaten Flygon. Latias also can help against Water-types and Breloom and appreciates a weakened Clefable. Modest Choice Specs sets threaten to break through Clefable, while defensive sets provide a remarkable amount of defensive utility. Other strong Clefable punishers such as Heatran and Breloom can fit alongside mixed Flygon, while Bronzong can help shore up Flygon defensively without being weak to Spikes. Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi appreciates Flygon breaking through slower defensive Latias with Roar, while more defensive Jirachi appreciates Spikes and wallbreaking.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Flygon is often forgotten in favor of Dragonite, the Choice Band set can pose a huge threat to a lot of teams. Thanks to its excellent Dragon / Ground typing and its ability, Levitate, Flygon has many opportunities to switch in with its unique resistances to Rock and Fire, and immunities to Electric- and Ground-type attacks. Many opponents underestimate the power of Flygon's STAB attacks because of its 100 base Attack; however, Flygon can 2HKO Pokemon like Swampert, Zapdos, and even Bold Suicune if it takes prior Stealth Rock damage. U-turn is a fantastic option on Choice Band Flygon, as it can give you the benefit of scouting your opponent's Flygon counter. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Skarmory and 2HKO specially defensive variants after Stealth Rock, and it reliably 2HKOes Bronzong and OHKOes Scizor. If one has Magnezone support to eliminate these Steel-types, though, Stone Edge or Dragon Claw become the superior options, letting Flygon hit Flying-types and Levitators without locking itself into Outrage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature maximizes Flygon's power, which is crucial for foes slower than Flygon like Suicune, physically defensive Zapdos, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Jolly nature, however, can be important for getting the jump on Roserade, faster Jirachi variants, Jolly Lucario, and Gliscor. 88 EVs can be taken out of Attack and invested into Defense to always survive a +2 Adamant Lucario's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, but the sacrifice in power is usually not worth it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>All Choice Band users require prediction to use effectively, but this applies to Flygon more than most other Pokemon due to its risky STAB moves. A Choice-locked Earthquake is a great opportunity for the likes of Dragonite and Gyarados to switch in; allowing these dangerous free switches can be problematic. Outrage, while hitting almost everyone for good damage, forces Flygon to remain in play for two to three turns, leaving it very vulnerable to revenge kills from Mamoswine or other fast Ice attackers. Try to use U-turn whenever you can, as Choice Band U-turn actually deals a ton of damage to foes like Tyranitar, Latias, and Uxie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Heatran pairs well with Choice Band Flygon due to the fact that many of Heatran's checks and counters are beaten by Flygon, and vice versa. Heatran easily resists Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed, which hit Flygon for neutral damage and impend Flygon from being effective. Scizor still pairs well with Flygon due to U-turn spamming. Scizor works better with Choice Band Flygon, however, because the Pokemon who usually outspeed Flygon can be picked off by Scizor. As Scizor is a problem for Flygon, Magnezone support is always welcome. Choice Scarf Magnezone obtains the bonus of defeating Lucario much easier and, with Knock Off or Trick support, takes down Skarmory as well.</p> <p>Pairing Flygon with wallbreakers is always welcome due to the abundant Pokemon who are strong on the defensive side and Flygon's access to U-turn. Gliscor, Hippowdon, and the aforementioned Skarmory give issues to this Flygon. Infernape wrecks all three of these Pokemon easily with a combination of Hidden Power Ice, Grass Knot, and Fire Blast. Seeking versatile Pokemon such as Infernape or Gengar is always welcome. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support is also always welcome. Forretress can look into either entry hazard while Skarmory has Spikes, a recovery move, and a phazing move to help with Flygon's team.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's ability Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap Steel-types and effectively cripple or remove most of them, is unmatched by any other Pokemon. The consistency that comes with trapping as opposed to luring a target can enable a variety of setup sweepers and physical attackers. In particular, trapping Skarmory, Jirachi, Empoleon, and even Bronzong can be extremely desirable. Magnezone can fit on just about any team thanks to its unparalleled utility. Not to mention, its extremely powerful base 130 Special Attack and desirable Electric-type STAB distinguishes its offensive potential outside of its ability. In addition, Magnezone is the only Electric / Steel type in the metagame—other than its pre-evolutions—that resists the popular BoltBeam coverage, and it has a 4x resistance to Steel-type attacks. In the latter case, Jirachi's Iron Head does barely any damage to Magnezone.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Magnezone's main competition is with its lower evolution, Magneton. Magneton's Speed advantage allows it to outspeed Dragon Dance Tyranitar and neutral-natured Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite with a Choice Scarf and revenge kill them. This is a huge advantage, as more balanced teams featuring Choice Scarf Magnezone can struggle against these Pokemon. However, outside of Choice Scarf sets, Magneton's lower base stats come back to haunt it, as Magnezone is both significantly bulkier and stronger. It is much harder to overwhelm Magnezone with attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor, Dragonite's Outrage, Scizor's Superpower, Rotom-A's Thunderbolt, and Gyarados's Waterfall than it is for Magneton. While Magneton is generally preferred for Choice Scarf sets, Choice Scarf Magnezone notably can use Hidden Power Fire without drawbacks and is significantly better against bulkier Steel-types like Jirachi and Empoleon.</p> <p>Magnezone's main flaws come from its typing, low Speed, and how the metagame adapts to it. Magnezone has a huge number of resistances, but very common weaknesses to Fire-, Fighting-, and especially Ground-type attacks mean many offensive Pokemon threaten it. Prime targets such as Metagross, Bronzong, Scizor, Lucario, Heatran, and Jirachi can potentially OHKO Metagross with their attacks should they get the chance, such as when Magnezone switches in. This is exacerbated by its low Speed, as non Choice Scarf Magnezone can struggle to trap faster variants of Scizor, Empoleon, and Metagross who can OHKO Magnezone before Magnezone KOs them back. Steel-types have also largely adapted to Magnezone, as prominent targets such as Skarmory can carry a Shed Shell to get away unimpeded, while Jirachi can either U-turn out, beat down frailer Magnezone with Fire Punch or Hidden Power Ground, or outstall Choiced Magnezone with Wish + Protect.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used to punish Choice-locked Jirachi and Bronzong while levitating with Magnet Rise. This move combines especially well with Charge Beam, as Magnezone can safely boost its Special Attack while behind a Substitute. Discharge is an alternative STAB move that can be used over Thunderbolt for its increased paralysis chance; however, Magnezone usually wants Thunderbolt's additional power to increase its odds in one-on-one matchups against a variety of Steel-types. For very aggressive teams, Magnezong can fake having a Choice Scarf and use Focus Sash instead—this allows it survive one strong hit and revenge kill with Explosion or coverage. However, beware that Magneton's superior Speed tier means Magnezone's bulk needs to be emphasized, lest it be outclassed. Refresh is a nifty choice that can enable Magnezone to combat Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A, especially in conjunction with Metal Sound. The latter makes Magnezone quite threatening versus defensive teams thanks to its gargantuan 64 PP. In addition, Metal Sound can be used to check Calm Mind Clefable and even CroCune if you can switch Magnezone in quickly. Psych Up is another interesting choice to mess with the aforementioned Calm Mind sweepers and should be used with Substitute. Mirror Coat can catch opposing Latias, Zapdos, and Kingdra by surprise, but it may not be an overall reliable choice. Magnezone can use Rain Dance to clear the sand for something like Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, but it should only do this if it can't make too much use of its other utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert, Hippowdon, Flygon, Gliscor, and even Mamoswine can give Magnezone a very difficult time. While these Pokemon need to watch out for utility options like Toxic or a super effective Hidden Power, they can typically find many opportunities to come in and force Magnezone out with the threat of a devastating 4x super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario can devastate Magnezone with their powerful Fighting-type moves. While Infernape and Lucario need to watch out for Choice Scarf Magnezone, they can almost always force Magnezone out provided that they switch in safely. Breloom resists Magnezone's Electric-type attacks, and thanks to Poison Heal, it can block status moves like Thunder Wave and Toxic. While it needs to watch out for Hidden Power Fire, Magnezone is often disadvantaged in the one-on-one matchup.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, Infernape, and other Fire-types can threaten Magnezone with their STAB super effective Fire-type attacks. Heatran in particular has a lot of natural bulk, so it can often switch in safely while healthy into Magnezone's Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune and -resistant Pokemon</strong>: Ground-, Grass-, and Dragon-types like the aforementioned Ground-types, Breloom, Shaymin, Celebi, Rotom-A, and Latias are immune to or resist Electric-type attacks and can all give Magnezone a hard time. Shaymin and Celebi in particular don't mind status too much thanks to Natural Cure and don't take that much damage from Hidden Power Fire. Latias, especially a Refresh variant, can shrug off status and effectively wall most Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Clefable, Tyranitar, and other special walls that aren't extremely crippled by status can give Magnezone a very difficult time and often force it out by threatening it with status or chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: While Magnezone's typing is a blessing, it also comes with some nasty weaknesses. Many Pokemon carry super effective, threatening moves that can make Magnezone difficult to use. Examples include but are not limited to: Jirachi's Fire Punch and Hidden Power Ground; Hidden Power Fire from the likes of Roserade, opposing Magnezone, and Latias; and Ground- and Fire-type moves from Tyranitar and Flygon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Magnet Rise": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magnezone can maximize its trapping potential by utilizing Magnet Rise, which enables it to effectively remove additional Steel-types like Bronzong and even slower Metagross variants because of the temporary Ground immunity it provides. Furthermore, Magnet Rise provides counterplay to Pokemon like Hippowdon and Flygon. In Bronzong's case, no other trapper can even come close to threatening it, let alone remove it consistently, so this truly distinguishes Magnet Rise Magnezone. Thunderbolt is recommended over a move like Discharge because Magnezone needs all the power it can get against foes like Jirachi and Skarmory. Hidden Power Fire is preferred to devastate Scizor and Forretress, but Hidden Power Grass or even Hidden Power Ice can be used as alternatives. Hidden Power Grass lets Magnezone lure in and remove Swampert while still hitting other Ground-types like Hippowdon super effectively, while Hidden Power Ice allows Magnezone to lure in and KO Gliscor and Flygon while doing nice damage versus Latias and Dragonite.</p> <p>From there, Magnezone has many different options for its final move. Thunder Wave gives it great consistency versus a myriad of Jirachi variants while crippling Pokemon like Latias and Tyranitar. Toxic can also cripple them, but it has the additional benefit of synergizing with Magnet Rise to beat Hippowdon in a one-on-one matchup. Protect is a great option to scout Choice item users like Flygon, Infernape, and Rotom-A while giving Magnezone greater longevity. It has the added bonus of wearing down foes like Infernape and Latias when under sand. Explosion is a solid alternative that enables Magnezone to deal significant damage to or KO foes like Blissey, Clefable, Latias, and Swampert. However, Explosion is more of a luxury than Thunder Wave or Toxic, as it is on the weaker side, especially with a Modest nature, so you may have to sacrifice Magnezone's Defense or Special Defense to accommodate the move.</p> <p>If Magnet Rise's utility is not important for your team, you can opt to replace it with a different utility move, such as Thunder Wave or Protect.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magnezone can go in two different EV directions. The first is to go as fast as possible to best trap Metagross, Empoleon, and Scizor. A Timid nature and maximum Speed EVs emphasizes this, as this always outspeeds Adamant Scizor and almost all Metagross. This allow Magnezone to OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire and get Magnet Rise up before Metagross uses Earthquake. This also allows it outspeed offensive Empoleon and KO it after some chip damage. A Modest nature is also possible to give a chance to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory and more easily 2HKO Metagross. Additional Speed is recommended when using Hidden Power Grass as well to outspeed maximum Speed Swampert. The other route to go with maximum HP EVs and use enough Speed to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory and Metagross with an EV spread of 252 HP / 168 SpA / 88 Spe. This gives Magnezone the best chance to beat Fire Punch Jirachi, survive an errant Earthquake from defensive Bronzong, and still outspeeds slower offensive Scizor and Metagross.</p> <p>Leftovers is extremely important to ensure that Magnezone can effectively beat Wish + Protect Jirachi in a one-on-one matchup. Without passive recovery, Jirachi can flinch Magnezone down with Iron Head. Chople Berry can be an alternative item for teams that really need a backup check for Gengar and even Lucario and Infernape, but this should only be done if it's absolutely necessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To better confirm your trapping target, keep Magnezone concealed for as long as possible. If your goal is to remove Wish + Protect Jirachi with Magnezone, try to avoid taking status like burn and having Leftovers be removed by Knock Off. Try to scout the movesets of trapping targets as much as you can before sending Magnezone in so you're not caught off guard by something like Hidden Power Ground or U-turn on Jirachi. Be careful when sending Magnezone in against Bronzong and Metagross, as they may use Earthquake to catch Magnezone on the switch or, worse, disable Magnezone with an Iron Ball. Iron Ball removes the Ground immunity from using Magnet Rise. If using Toxic, concealing it can be beneficial for confirming targets like Hippowdon and Latias. If you opt for Protect, however, using it frequently to wear down foes, scout their moves, and gain passive recovery with Leftovers is strongly recommended. Protect is also great for catching Bronzong and Metagross using Explosion after Magnezone uses Magnet Rise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnezone is much more of a team supporter rather than a Pokemon that requires support to function; however, certain Pokemon can help to make Magnezone's job easier. Knock Off users like Clefable, Gliscor, and even Tentacruel can remove Skarmory's Shed Shell so Magnezone can trap it. Knock Off also helps tremendously to increase Magnezone's odds one-on-one versus Jirachi. U-turn users like Flygon, Jirachi, and Scizor can help Magnezone switch in more safely. Choice item Pokemon with Trick, such as Latias and Jirachi, can create opportunities for Magnezone to switch in and trap a foe by locking it into a move. Spinners like Starmie can synergize nicely with Magnezone, as trapping Skarmory and other potential entry hazard setters like Bronzong and Jirachi and then spinning the entry hazards away can be a huge asset against defensive teams.</p> <p>There are a large number of Pokemon that can benefit from Magnezone's ability to trap and remove Steel-types. Examples of Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Skarmory and Bronzong are Choice Scarf Flygon, Gliscor, Dragon Dance users, Latias, Metagross, offensive Trick Room Bronzong, Suicune, Nidoqueen, Milotic, and Swampert. Other Pokemon like Tyranitar and Jirachi may have sets that don't match up well against Skarmory and Bronzong, so they can also benefit from Magnet Rise Magnezone.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone sets itself apart from other Magnezone sets by trapping Lucario and faster variants of Empoleon, guaranteeing paralysis versus Jirachi provided that it switches in safely, and outspeeding Pokemon like Infernape, Latias, and Gengar. Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most consistent STAB move. Hidden Power Fire helps with hazard control by removing Forretress, and it also removes Scizor. In addition, it hits Breloom and other Steel-types for super effective damage. Magnezone makes excellent use of Thunder Wave by paralyzing Jirachi and Latias. Explosion rounds out the set with a hit-all type of approach. While Magnezone's Explosion is not that powerful, it will still do a significant amount of damage to any non-resistant foe. Flash Cannon is an acceptable alternative to Explosion, which can hit Tyranitar, Latias, and Gliscor for decent damage. Toxic can be used to catch Swampert, Gliscor, and Latias off guard, but it's difficult to fit and can be quite risky in the face of setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Even with Explosion, a Timid nature is recommended here, as sacrificing either one of Magnezone's defensive stats is counterintuitive for its trapping consistency. A Naive nature, for example, will make it significantly more difficult for Magnezone to pivot into Latias's Draco Meteor. A Special Attack-increasing nature is not a good choice here either, as Magnezone will be unable to outspeed Infernape, Latias, and Gengar, and it may have to Speed tie or be outsped by maximum Speed Jirachi.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If you're trying to trap and cripple Jirachi, try not to switch into a Body Slam, Thunder, or Fire Punch, as a Magnezone with no additional bulk can be easily worn down. It is extra important to keep Magnezone around for as long as possible if you solely depend on it to shut down Lucario, so this practice can be ill-advised. You can often make use of Magnezone's great Speed with this set to finish off weakened Steel-types, like Bronzong, Metagross, and even Heatran, so keep that in mind when executing a gameplan. When making use of Thunder Wave, try to make sure a setup sweeper or an already crippled Pokemon cannot properly take advantage of Magnezone being Choice-locked into a non-attacking move. Also, try not to hastily use Explosion, as it is relatively weak, especially with a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone is much more of a team supporter as opposed to a Pokemon that requires support to function. U-turn users like Jirachi, Celebi, and Scizor can enable Magnezone to come in safely against opposing Jirachi. Pokemon that don't mind Magnezone's lack of Magnet Rise to consistently remove Bronzong but appreciate Magnezone's removal of Skarmory and Lucario are great partners. Scizor comes to mind, as Bronzong can have a lot of difficulty breaking it, while Scizor can consistently wear Bronzong down for Magnezone to finish off later. Swampert and Suicune appreciate Magnezone's removal of Skarmory and can also have a decent matchup versus Bronzong. Knock Off users like Clefable and Gliscor pair quite nicely with Magnezone, which can assist in removing all Steel-types.</p>"
      },
      "Endure": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Endure Magnezone takes a much more offensive approach as opposed to a balanced one and functions as a soft check to Dragon Dance Gyarados and Kingdra through an Endure + Custap Berry strategy. Additionally, this Magnezone has the unique ability to trap and remove Heatran with Hidden Power Ground provided that it enters Custap Berry range. Hidden Power Fire is generally recommended, however, for the removal of Scizor and Forretress as well as the super effective damage against Breloom. Explosion rounds out the set to hopefully take another Pokemon with it when its health is low. Sometimes, Magnet Rise will be desired here to trap and remove Bronzong and maybe even Metagross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Rash nature is recommended to maximize Special Attack while not reducing Explosion's power. While it may seem like a bad idea to reduce either of Magnezone's defensive stats, this set uses Explosion much more often than most other sets, so it usually wants the power. In addition, the Endure + Custap Berry strategy means that it's not usually as concerned about being weakened. 56 HP EVs enable Magnezone to survive Choice Scarf Scizor's Superpower after Stealth Rock damage. This is quite helpful because Magnezone will not need to use Endure against a suspected Choice Scarf Scizor. 220 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed Machamp and minimum Speed Suicune. The remaining EVs are poured into Special Attack to maximize its power given the constraints.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't haphazardly use Endure, as revealing it while not sustaining damage will cause the strategy to go wrong. Try to save it as an emergency option to push back an offensive assault from your opponent and shift momentum in your direction. Even with Hidden Power Ground, do not over-rely on Magnezone to trap and remove Heatran, as moves like Magma Storm can throw a wrench in the strategy, and Lava Plume can inflict a burn. Be careful versus Jirachi, as without Leftovers providing passive recovery or Choice Scarf letting Magnezone outspeed it, Magnezone becomes a lot less consistent against it. Magnezone still has the potential to deal significant damage to Jirachi or even KO it, but to do this you should preserve Magnezone's HP as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor and Jirachi may appreciate the Hidden Power Ground variant of this set, especially the former, as trapping Heatran and providing an emergency check to Gyarados is extremely beneficial to Scizor. A hyper offense team consisting of several physical attackers appreciates Magnezone's ability to trap Skarmory and function as an emergency check to opposing setup sweepers, which can be a great tool to reverse momentum. A team with other Explosion users, like Gengar, Bronzong, and Metagross, can synergize well with Magnezone. Overall, if your team wants Magnezone but needs a backup answer to Dragon Dance sweepers, this set will often be a solid choice.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade fulfills its niche by having the widest movepool of any Fighting-type in the tier. Gallade's access to Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and a strong Close Combat make it an excellent lead against defensive teams. Defensive counterplay to burns typically are frail (most Fire-types such as Infernape or Camerupt), weak to Fighting (Heatran and Clefable), or are ruined by Taunt (passive Natural Cure Pokemon including Celebi and Blissey and RestTalk users such as Suicune, Rotom-A, or Gyarados). Combined with Gallade's unusually high Special Defense stat and uncommon weaknesses to Flying- and Ghost-types, it can spread burn to foes that typically do not want to be statused, such as Jirachi, Zapdos, and Latias. Gallade also has numerous excellent coverage moves such as a STAB boosted Zen Headbutt, Shadow Sneak, Ice Punch, Stone Edge, and even Leaf Blade. These, all of which can be powered up with Swords Dance, make an unknown Gallade set dangerous to face.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Gallade cannot run all of these options at the same time and additionally struggles due to its mediocre Speed stat, poor defensive profile, and competition from other Fighting-types such as Lucario and Machamp. Gallade's average Speed and likelihood to lower its own defensive stats with Close Combat makes it easy to revenge kill with almost every faster threat in the tier, such as Flygon, Latias, Rotom-A, and Scizor using Bullet Punch. This issue is exacerbated by Gallade's lack of resistances, weakness to residual damage, and poor HP and Defense stats. As a lead, Gallade really struggles with physically bulky or faster leads that carry a Lum Berry if it doesn't have the coverage to deal with them, such as Metagross, Gyarados, Azelf, offensive Jirachi, and some Swampert. These Pokemon either survive Gallade's attacks and KO back, or fulfill their role to set up Stealth Rock. While its ability is nice against Jirachi trying to flinch it, the Speed boost is often nullified by Jirachi spreading paralysis. Gallade struggles to differentiate itself from Lucario and Machamp: Lucario is faster, has much better priority in Extreme Speed, better defensive typing, and can reliably use Life Orb without residual damage piling up. As an anti-lead, Machamp's greater overall bulk, confusion from Dynamic Punch, and a stronger coverage option against Ghost- and Psychic-types in Payback makes it generally threatening to more offensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gallade can also set up Swords Dance, immediately hit hard with Choice Band, or be a serviceable revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. However, all of these roles are better done with Lucario, who has much better defensive typing to set up. On the other hand, Gallade does have access to Trick, something Lucario cannot do. Trick + Choice Scarf on the lead set makes Gallade effective at preventing Stealth Rock, especially against Azelf and Aerodactyl, and still threatens Will-O-Wisp. Beware that it is immediately forced out after using Taunt, however. Gallade's best shot as an all out attacker involves using Close Combat, Shadow Sneak, Zen Headbutt and a coverage move of choice such as Ice Punch, but this set often gets worn down very quickly. Gallade also has a wealth of other utility moves, but these are often used better by other Pokemon. Some of the more prominent of these are Wish (unfortunately illegal with moves such as Destiny Bond and Will-O-Wisp), Hypnosis, Thunder Wave, Encore, Knock Off, Bulk Up, and Memento. These moves often can surprise the opponent and generate set up opportunities, but lack consistency. Gallade also has access to Trick Room, but lacks the bulk to set it up effectively. Gallade has other coverage options such as Night Slash, X-Scissor, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake, but these are often very niche and not worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gallade lacks a good move to deal with especially bulkier Ghost-types almost all of the time. RestTalk Rotom-A can burn Gallade while only not enjoying Will-O-Wisp, while both Rotom-A and Gengar 2HKO Gallade with Shadow Ball. While bulkless versions of both Rotom-A and Gengar do not enjoy Shadow Sneak, both survive easily.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Gallade struggles to do anything but burn bulky Psychic-types such as Latias, Celebi, and Cresselia, as Shadow Sneak is too weak to do much damage to them. Starmie and Celebi also even shrug off a burn with Natural Cure and only fear the rare X-Scissor. Note that while frail, bulky Azelf shrugs off most of what Gallade can do and OHKOes with Explosion after setting up Stealth Rock</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Gallade is quite physically frail and takes a lot of damage from strong attacks such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Lucario's Extreme Speed. Note that unless Gallade has reduced its Defense or is chipped, these attacks often OHKO while Gallade can hit these Pokemon hard in return.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Gallade's typing makes it vulnerable to both Spikes, sand, and Toxic Spikes as well as all forms of status. Burn ruins Gallade's ability to deal damage, while paralysis and poison make Gallade faint exceptionally quickly due to its poor defensive stats.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Gallade generally struggles to hit bulky foes that are neutral to Close Combat and hit hard back, especially hit they can shrug off a burn with a Lum Berry. Metagross, Swampert, Bronzong, and Hippowdon all survive a hit and can KO back.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Even with the proper coverage move, Gallade struggles to OHKO Flying-types such as Zapdos, Gyarados, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Dragonite. All can KO back, especially after a Defense drop, and should Gallade lack the correct coverage move, all they have to fear is a burn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Gallade has average Speed, lowers its own defensive stats, and doesn't have many resistances. Almost every faster Pokemon in the tier, such as Flygon, Latias, Rotom-A, Roserade, and offensive Suicune can remove Gallade after it uses Close Combat. Even Choice Scarf Tyranitar OHKOes Gallade after a Defense drop with Crunch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gallade's strong Close Combat threatens the many Fighting-weak Pokemon in DPP OU, such as Tyranitar, Clefable, Heatran, and Empoleon. Close Combat also has pretty good neutral coverage on the tier and 2HKOes foes such as Flygon, Scizor, and Machamp. Will-O-Wisp is excellent for hampering bulky Pokemon such as Jirachi, Swampert, Metagross, and Zapdos with a burn. Will-O-Wisp makes Gallade challenging to switch into without a Lum Berry and a resistance to Fighting, as Gallade outspeeds and OHKOes Clefable and Heatran.</p> <p>Taunt makes it much harder for the foe to shrug off Close Combat and Will-O-Wisp by preventing defensive Pokemon from healing. Taunt also makes Gallade serviceable for preventing Stealth Rock and other set-up from slower leads such as Swampert, Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Breloom, but beware that these leads all take advantage of Gallade's frailty. Ice Punch completes Gallade's coverage by OHKOing Dragonite, 2HKOing Gliscor, and at least 3HKOing defensive Latias and Zapdos. Another option is to forgo the coverage and use Destiny Bond to guarantee Gallade takes slower foes down with it. Despite Gallade's average Speed, it outspeeds slower offensive Pokemon such as Metagross and Swampert that might aim to attack into Gallade to take advantage of Close Combat's Defense drop or avoid Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple EV spread of 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs maximizes Gallade's offensive potential to hit as hard as it can. It notably needs almost maximum Attack investment to OHKO Dragonite with Ice Punch. While an Adamant nature is appreciated for power, Gallade sits as a crowded speed tier and really needs a Jolly nature to outspeed Gyarados, Breloom, Heatran, Adamant Lucario, and Dragonite that heavily threaten it. It also notably allows it to outspeed most defensive Latias and Taunt while it uses Recover. As Gallade is very weak to status, a Lum Berry helps it stave off common status-inducing moves such as Jirachi's Body Slam and Choice Scarf Breloom's Spore. Some other options include using a Custap Berry to surprise faster threats with Destiny Bond, Focus Sash to survive any one attack, Leftovers to help mitigate residual damage, and Life Orb to really power up Gallade's attacks, but the latter is often better with additional coverage moves.</p> <p>Gallade can also invest in its bulk to take advantage of its Special Defense stat. Notably, Gallade survives Modest Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor and can still outspeed up to Adamant Lucario with an EV spread of 148 HP / 124 SpD / 236 Spe with a Jolly nature. Notably, Gallade doesn't need Attack EVs to threaten targets such as Clefable and the bulk lets it live attacks such as Roserade's Leaf Storm and Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Beware that such a spread makes it harder to punch through neutral targets with Close Combat while the stat drops from Close Combat make it harder to survive attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gallade generally should lead with Will-O-Wisp unless the opposing lead is likely to have a Focus Sash or Lum Berry. Foes such as Tyranitar often will switch out to a Fighting-resist such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, or Latias and get burned in the process. However, leads such as Metagross, Gyarados, and Azelf are difficult to account for, as all are bulky enough to survive Gallade's attacks and can KO or set up on it. It's often best to just switch against these leads, as it is very possible to lose Gallade for nothing. However, do not be afraid to freely sacrifice Gallade if it has accomplished its job, as it is meant to get momentum early. Additionally, leads such as Heatran and Empoleon, while heavily threatened by Gallade, might have a Focus Sash and just KO Gallade back after it has reduced its defensive stats. Gallade should also leverage the threat of good coverage to burn targets; Gallade's huge movepool often makes opponents less likely to send in answers that Gallade could have the coverage move for, most notably frail Ghost- and Psychic types that are threatened by Shadow Sneak should as Gengar, Rotom-A, and Starmie. Taunt is often unexpected from Gallade and can be effective in preventing entry hazards and set up, but beware of Gallade's frailty.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gallade makes for a great choice on hyper offensive teams trying to get early momentum and potentially burn bulky Pokemon. Its main competition for this role are Breloom and Machamp, as Breloom can sleep the foe and hits very hard while Machamp's confusion from Dynamic Punch can potential push past bulkier Pokemon such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Gallade is generally more effective against defensive teams due to more permanently disabling walls with a burn. This prowess is highly useful for teammates such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Agility Metagross. Gyarados really enjoys walls being burned, as the residual damage puts Skarmory in 2HKO range for +1 Waterfall, while defensive Zapdos and Latias are permanently weakened by burn damage combined with +1 Ice Fang and Stealth Rock. Calm Mind Jirachi also enjoys a weakened Latias and a burned Jirachi, as they can no longer check its offensive Calm Mind set. As Gallade cannot set up Stealth Rock, synergetic partners such as Metagross, Camerupt, Swampert, Empoleon, and Heatran can help take on problem match ups for Gallade, such as against Azelf and potentially Metagross. Gallade's access to Taunt and decent Speed makes it a serviceable lead for partners who are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and offensive Zapdos. Mixed Dragonite is an exceptional partner, as it can further threaten defensive teams once Gallade has initially weakened Dragonite's checks with burns and Close Combat. Other offensive partners such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance + Pursuit Scizor, offensive Empoleon, and Lucario are also excellent partners.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is a premier DPP OU Pokemon thanks to its fantastic versatility and offensive prowess. Heatran's unique defensive typing bolstered by Flash Fire and colorful movepool make it one of the best utility Pokemon in the tier. As a Fire-type with many resistances, a neutrality to Stealth Rock, and an immunity to sand, it can roast many of the common Pokemon weak to Fire—such as Jirachi, Bronzong, Scizor, Breloom, and Metagross—while having enough longevity to set up Stealth Rock, spread status, and KO a problem foe with Explosion. With Magma Storm, Heatran is a great trapper, as it can customize its moveset to lure in and KO not only offensive Pokemon like Swampert, Starmie, Gyarados, and Dragonite but also walls such as Latias, Clefable, Milotic, and Blissey. Heatran's versatility makes it the anti-metagame Pokemon: offensive teams despise dealing with burns and struggle to continually switch into its powerful attacks, while defensive teams tremble for this special attacker that can 2HKO Clefable with a boosting item, as well as exploiting stall staples such as Skarmory, Jirachi, defensive Zapdos, and defensive Rotom-A.</p> <p>Heatran features on a wide variety of teams in almost any role. The most offensive of teams love it beating defensive Jirachi and weakening its switch-ins such as Latias and Clefable for other special sweepers, using its power, Taunt, and Explosion. More balanced teams can use Heatran as an excellent standalone wallbreaker with Choice Specs, a great revenge killer with Choice Scarf, or a devastating Substitute attacker backed by entry hazards. With Substitute and Protect, Heatran is a fantastic partner for Toxic Spikes, as it can wear down poisoned checks such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, and Blissey. More defensive teams enjoy it spreading burns with Lava Plume, preventing Forretress and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards, or even sweeping with a Torment set.</p> <p>Heatran is held back from breaking the metagame in two by its debilitating weaknesses and how the metagame has adapted to it. While Heatran has good defensive typing and bulk, Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks are extremely common from Pokemon such as Flygon, Gliscor, Swampert, Suicune, Starmie, Lucario, Infernape, Breloom, and Machamp; these Pokemon force Heatran to either run a resistance Berry or switch out. Even attackers that Heatran offensively threatens, such as Metagross, itself, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Magnezone, can easily run Ground-type attacks to at least 2HKO it. Heatran struggles against both very offensive teams, which have multiple Pokemon that can OHKO it, and slower defensive teams, where it needs to sacrifice itself to make progress. While they do not appreciate burns without a Lum Berry, Dragon Dance sweepers in Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Dragonite all resist Heatran's main attacks and can set up on it, forcing Heatran to use Explosion, or OHKO it. Heatran's mediocre Speed stat also it either gets outsped by these threats or loses a critical amount of bulk, depending on its EVs. Other Speed-boosting sweepers such as Agility Empoleon and Metagross can outspeed even Choice Scarf Heatran and OHKO it back. Against more defensive teams, Heatran often needs to take major damage, take status, or sacrifice itself with Explosion to KO Clefable, Blissey, and Latias, as these Pokemon are bulky enough to survive Heatran's unboosted Fire-type attacks. Heatran lacks reliable recovery, and with Spikes and Stealth Rock, it struggles to come in repeatedly to break open defensive teams. Heatran also has to rely on moves with subpar accuracy, such as Fire Blast, Will-O-Wisp, and especially Magma Storm, and it struggles to fit every option it wants; it often cannot fit Lava Plume or Flamethrower alongside its less reliable attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heatran’s offensive prowess and coverage make it a great user of Life Orb. The power boost makes Heatran’s coverage moves especially scary, as it can switch from blasting something with Fire-type attacks to eliminating the target with coverage or Explosion. However, Heatran isn’t quite fast enough to pull off such a set and does not appreciate the residual damage alongside Spikes and Stealth Rock. Heatran can shore up its lack of recovery with a RestTalk set. With Roar and Lava Plume, it can phaze the opposing team around while partially alleviating its weakness to Spikes and spreading status. It often is ineffective against Clefable and isn’t useful enough of a wall offensively to justify otherwise, however. Heatran is an excellent user of Metal Sound, either as an alternative move on Substitute or as a standalone attacker. It notably allows Heatran to 2HKO Clefable much more easily and is highly effective with entry hazards, but Heatran still struggles to actually do enough damage to prevent switching around it. Any Heatran set with Dragon Pulse is free to use Hidden Power Ice, as it is guaranteed to OHKO Flygon and offensive Dragonite without a Yache Berry after Stealth Rock, preventing Flygon from ruining it with a mixed set and allowing it to revenge kill Dragonite. Heatran can use a Substitute and Salac Berry set to maximize its coverage and try to sweep more offensive teams, but it struggles against Clefable and has trouble doing enough damage to Gyarados and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Heatran can also effectively run a lot of physical bulk as well, especially with a Shuca Berry on utility sets. This allows it to survive Dragon Dance-boosted attacks after Stealth Rock and KO the user with coverage or Explosion. It also takes pittance from mixed Flygon and retaliates with Hidden Power Ice. Heatran is also a solid weather clearer, as with Sunny Day, it powers up its own Fire-type attacks and can use Solar Beam to wipe out Water-types, but it should watch out for Tyranitar switching in. Heatran can also use Dark Pulse as a coverage option to hit Latias as well as Starmie and Slowbro, but it struggles to fit it, and it is weaker than Dragon Pulse. Heatran can generally use Roar and Toxic on most of its utility sets to take advantage of entry hazards or effectively spread status. Offensive versions of Heatran can also run Hidden Power Electric. This gives a 93.8% chance to OHKO non-Wacan Berry Gyarados after sand and hits other Water-type Starmie and Suicune super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Heatran is a difficult Pokemon to directly answer, as it can take advantage of any potential checks with its versatility and item choice. However, especially without Leftovers, Heatran often only gets a few chances to break through if entry hazards are up and has debilitating type weaknesses. Once its set is known, it becomes much easier to answer.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Swampert, Starmie, Milotic, Gyarados, and Suicune can at least scout out Heatran’s set. Without a Passho Berry, they all at least 2HKO Heatran. Swampert and Gyarados both have the choice to use either Earthquake or Waterfall to bypass the resistance Berry, while Starmie and offensive Suicune outspeed Heatran and hit it hard. None of these Pokemon enjoy Explosion, while Heatran can hit them all hard with the correct Hidden Power, although it only rarely carries Hidden Power Electric for Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Heatran struggles to break through Blissey and Clefable without Choice Specs, Taunt, a Flash Fire boost, or Explosion. Both Blissey and Clefable can shrug off burns to wear it down with Seismic Toss. Blissey is much more resilient than Clefable, however, as Heatran can 2HKO Clefable with a Modest nature and a boosting item, while Taunt and Magma Storm shut both of them down. Heatran can sacrifice itself with Explosion to take them out, though it’s not a guaranteed OHKO on either of them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latias, Flygon, Kingdra, and Dragonite are all good checks to Heatran. Latias and Kingdra both can survive even Choice Specs Fire-type attacks and either status or KO Heatran, while Flygon and Dragonite can switch into Heatran and threaten it out. Defensive Latias in particular can stall out any Heatran not designed to handle it. None of these Pokemon enjoy Dragon Pulse, Explosion, or Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Gliscor are bulky enough to take Heatran’s attacks and OHKO back with Earthquake. However, they can all be overwhelmed by the Choice Specs set and do not enjoy Shuca Berry weakening their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type coverage is really common, and Heatran cannot have a resistance Berry for all of them. Earthquake is an especially ubiquitous move that Heatran is 4x weak to, meaning offensive teams might have multiple Pokemon that can OHKO Heatran. Some examples of super effective coverage include Choice Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Ground OHKOing bulkless Heatran after Stealth Rock; Scizor OHKOing Heatran with Superpower; Metagross OHKOing Heatran on the switch with Earthquake; and Choice Specs Latias hitting hard with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Heatran is heavily limited by Spikes, especially if it doesn’t have Leftovers. While it can prevent common Spikers such as Skarmory and Roserade from setting them up, if they do go up, Heatran struggles to continually come in and wallbreak. This is especially troubling because defensive teams often have multiple Heatran switch-ins, while more offensive Spikes teams have mixed Flygon, which destroys most Heatran and Tyranitar. Even Stealth Rock can make it harder for Heatran to continually survive weaker attacks such as defensive Rotom-A’s.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they cannot really switch in, Fighting-types such as Machamp, Lucario, Breloom, and Infernape offensively threaten Heatran with either an OHKO with Close Combat or Superpower or a chance to 2HKO with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Especially with a Lum Berry, Tyranitar is a nice check to Heatran, as it has a resistance to Fire and Explosion, has enormous special bulk due to sand, and can retaliate with Superpower or Earthquake. Without a Lum Berry, it needs to be careful of status, as poison wears it down and burn cripples it. Heatran can also fight back with Earth Power, which commonly 3HKOes Tyranitar depending on stats of both.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Even when fully invested, Heatran is outsped by a lot of the faster threats in the metagame. Flygon, Gengar, Lucario, Infernape, Starmie, Suicune, and Gliscor can all potentially outspeed Heatran and OHKO it. These should watch out for various resistance Berries, though.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heatran is an excellent user of Stealth Rock, as it can use its offensive pressure and bulk to set the entry hazard up. Heatran also offensively pressures spinners such as Forretress. However, with another Stealth Rock user, Heatran can run Will-O-Wisp to spread burns on Tyranitar, Swampert, Machamp, and Gyarados. Will-O-Wisp mitigates Heatran's weaknesses, as it can often survive physical super effective coverage moves from burned Pokemon. Taunt is another choice it can use, especially with a faster EV spread; Heatran is naturally close to 2HKOing Clefable with Fire Blast, and preventing it from healing opens up other special attackers. While risky, Taunt also prevents foes such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up on Heatran, and it can prevent Stealth Rock from Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon, which often try to set it up as they predict Heatran will switch out.</p> <p>Heatran can run many different Fire-type attacks. Fire Blast is the most common, as it muscles through neutral targets such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Clefable while OHKOing Gengar after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is the more reliable choice, as Heatran needn't worry about accuracy and PP against threats it OHKOes such as Breloom, Scizor, uninvested Jirachi, and physically defensive Skarmory. Heatran can also use Lava Plume, Magma Storm, or Overheat. Lava Plume combines Flamethrower's reliability and Will-O-Wisp's burns, but Heatran often wants more power than it gives. Magma Storm is best on sets with more coverage. Overheat provides a strong initial hit, but Heatran does not enjoy being forced out, and it cannot pressure Clefable.</p> <p>Heatran's coverage move often depends on its item and the role it wants to play. The most common choice is Earth Power, which gives excellent coverage with two moves and covers other Heatran, Tyranitar, Infernape, and Water-types such as Swampert, Starmie, and Milotic. Earth Power is especially great with Shuca Berry, as it lets Heatran more comfortably beat opposing Heatran trying to absorb its Fire-type attack. Hidden Power Grass allows Heatran to OHKO uninvested Swampert and notably keep Stealth Rock up against Starmie. Hidden Power Grass easily 2HKOes Starmie, while Starmie needs a boosting item to OHKO Heatran after using Rapid Spin. When holding a Passho Berry, Heatran can even avoid a 2HKO from defensive Starmie's Surf. Another option is Dragon Pulse, as it notably 2HKOes Latias and Kingdra without defensive EVs, as well as possibly OHKOing Dragonite and Flygon after Stealth Rock. Heatran can even drop the coverage option to run two of its utility moves, such as Stealth Rock and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Explosion is Heatran's best way to KO special walls and setup sweepers like Gyarados alike. Even Clefable, Blissey, and Latias can be taken out by a surprise Explosion, opening the door for other special attackers. Heatran is uniquely good at using Explosion, as it has a good Attack stat, its special offensive presence deters physical walls, Steel- and Ghost-types can't take its Fire-type attacks, and Heatran can take on the most common Rock-type, Tyranitar, with Earth Power and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heatran has myriad viable EV spreads; the listed spread gives Heatran maximum HP and outspeeds slower threats such as Adamant 252 Speed EV Scizor and Jolly Tyranitar, with a slight boost in power with a Modest nature. Explosion still hits hard even with a hindering nature. Utility Heatran often focuses EVs in either HP or Speed; if maximizing HP, other options include 128 Speed EVs to outspeed all neutral-nature Swampert, Tyranitar, and Empoleon, 196 EVs to outspeed Scizor, or 216 Speed EVs to outspeed Tyranitar, Magnezone, and neutral-nature Metagross. The extra EVs can be put into Special Attack. If Heatran wants to focus on Speed, some possibilities include 200 Speed EVs with a boosting nature, which outspeed Breloom, neutral-nature Dragonite, and neutral-nature Gyarados, and maximum Speed to outspeed Kingdra and slower defensive Latias. For these options, Heatran uses 252 Special Attack EVs with either a Timid or a Hasty nature. Heatran should generally avoid using a Naive nature, as this stops it from surviving Hydro Pump from Suicune and Starmie after Stealth Rock. However, not lowering Attack can let Explosion KO foes such as Clefable, offensive Gyarados after Stealth Rock, and Blissey after Stealth Rock and sand damage. While utility Heatran can use less Speed investment than listed, it generally is not recommended to run fewer than 128 EVs due to how many foes can then offensively pressure it. Heatran has incredible customization: for example, 16 HP / 52 Atk / 208 SpA / 236 Spe with a Mild nature can outspeed Agility Metagross and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, OHKO offensive Suicune, and potentially OHKO defensive Latias with Explosion after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Utility Heatran often runs Leftovers to heal and best answer defensive Jirachi. With Leftovers, Heatran heals more than Jirachi's Iron Head deals, meaning it can't flinch Heatran down. It also can't wear down Heatran throughout a game to eventually break through it. Another great choice is Shuca Berry, which notably lets Heatran survive many ways to remove it, such as opposing Heatran's Earth Power and Earthquake from Tyranitar, mixed Flygon, and Metagross. It survives all of these without any HP EVs, meaning faster Heatran can use Shuca Berry to bypass the need for bulk for its most common weakness. Passho Berry lets Heatran more comfortably survive hits from many Water-types such as Starmie, Suicune, and Empoleon. Heatran can then use the appropriate coverage move or Explosion as they attack.</p> <p>Heatran has numerous other items it can use. The most prominent is Focus Sash, especially if it leads. Heatran can very aggressively use Taunt on opposing leads to prevent setup, attack, or just use Explosion to take out the foe. While it can use bulk EVs with a Focus Sash, dropping them for maximum Speed is often the best choice. Another great option is Lum Berry to neutralize status moves such as Clefable's Thunder Wave and Breloom's Spore, possibly switching into Spore and forcing Breloom out. Chople Berry helps Heatran survive strong Fighting-type attacks, such as Gengar's Focus Blast, Machamp's Dynamic Punch, Infernape's Close Combat, and Lucario's Close Combat. Heatran can also use Custap Berry to give it one last attack before fainting, especially since it often survives strong attacks with not a lot of HP remaining. Heatran can even use Endure to put itself in Custap Berry range.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heatran should come into the game fairly early or even lead to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, threaten possible switches, or weaken checks. Heatran’s versatility makes it hard for opponents to figure out the set early-game; for example, opponents might believe Heatran is Choice Specs in the lead position and switch to a special wall in response. Leverage this to wear down switch-ins and get opportunities to use its utility moves. Against more offensive teams and when holding a resistance Berry, Heatran is a fantastic Pokemon can beat foes one-on-one, as it often can switch in on a Steel-type like Jirachi, threaten whatever switches in with the appropriate coverage move, and then use Explosion. Against more defensive teams, Heatran can often get worn down quickly, especially if it lacks Leftovers. However, Heatran is a great way to prevent entry hazards, because none of Roserade, Skarmory, or Forretress can set up as long as it’s active. Being aggressive with Explosion can often net KOs on Clefable and Latias. However, Heatran is one of the best checks against physically defensive Jirachi, and the rest of the team can suffer if it sacrifices itself too early.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran is one of the best offensive Stealth Rock users in the tier and fits with many teammates. Breloom is a fantastic teammate, as Heatran can switch into offensive Latias's Draco Meteor and either heavily weaken it or KO it with Explosion. Breloom in turn can switch into special walls such as Clefable and Blissey, as well as Water-types such as defensive Starmie and Suicune, which wall Heatran or force it to use Explosion. Breloom and Heatran can also perform well in a Fire-Water-Grass core with Water-types such as Swampert, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance Gyarados. These Pokemon also appreciate Heatran weakening Latias, Zapdos, and Rotom-A, and some can take on opposing Water-types so Heatran doesn't have to use a Passho Berry or Explosion against them. Other less common Grass-types such as Roserade, Celebi, and Shaymin are also good choices in the core, being good switch-ins to Heatran's type weaknesses.</p> <p>Heatran also threatens Skarmory and Forretress and prevents them from setting entry hazards, especially Spikes, ensuring they don't limit grounded attackers such as Breloom, Suicune, and itself. Threatening Skarmory and other special walls, while providing Stealth Rock and early-game pressure no less, is also very valuable to sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Metagross, and offensive Jirachi. These sweepers benefit in different ways: offensive Calm Mind Jirachi appreciates Latias and other special walls being weakened or KOed; Tyranitar, Metagross, physical Jirachi, Scizor, and Dragonite enjoy Heatran forcing out Skarmory after it phazes them, thus stopping it from healing, or baiting in Water-types and using Explosion on them; and Scizor and Dragonite appreciate Heatran switching into and forcing out their counters, like Jirachi and Skarmory. Further, Tyranitar and Scizor can freely switch into most Latias sets and heavily threaten it alongside Heatran. Offensive Latias can synergistically weaken Tyranitar and other special walls that absorb Heatran's attacks. Heatran can even use Will-O-Wisp and prevent Tyranitar from using Pursuit on Latias effectively. Starmie works like Latias but can also use Rapid Spin, keeping Heatran from being worn down.</p> <p>Heatran appreciates backup against physical sweepers with Earthquake, as it can often only prevent setup by sacrificing itself via Taunt or Explosion. Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Latias, and Flygon all can switch into some of these sweepers and revenge kill them if they set up. Another choice is Skarmory, which can handle many of the boosted physical sweepers that Heatran struggles to deal with. Heatran also enjoys Spikes and especially Toxic Spikes; Heatran forces many switches to rack up damage and threatens Pokemon trying to break through Spikes Skarmory, such as Substitute Jirachi and Breloom. Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Tentacruel are good choices to set up Toxic Spikes. On more offensive Spikes teams, Gengar and mixed Flygon are excellent teammates. Gengar can come in on Fighting- and Ground-type moves aimed at Heatran and start attacking, spread status, or set up Substitute, while Flygon appreciates Heatran dealing with faster Latias sets and potentially KOing Clefable with Explosion.</p>"
      },
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The purpose of this Heatran is to trap the opponent's switch-in with Magma Storm and deal with it accordingly, eliminating common answers such as Latias, Clefable, Gyarados, and Swampert with the appropriate coverage move. The strength of Magma Storm and the residual damage make it a strong primary offensive move to break through walls such as Clefable, as well as weakening foes such as offensive Latias and Swampert into KO range of its coverage moves. Dragon Pulse prominently allows Heatran to KO offensive Latias without having to sacrifice itself. The combination of Magma Storm and Dragon Pulse also traps and KOes Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra—Heatran can run resistance Berries to survive their attacks. Another great option on bulkier sets is to use Toxic. With Toxic, Heatran can rack up residual damage on Latias, as defensive Latias typically can't hurt it much and despises being poisoned. Toxic also hits prominent foes such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Gliscor on the switch, and in tandem with Taunt, it is effective for pressuring Blissey trapped by Magma Storm.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass is another excellent option, as Magma Storm + Hidden Power Grass KOes all but the most specially defensive Swampert. With a Passho Berry, Hidden Power Grass Heatran can trap and remove many other Water-types such as Starmie, Milotic, and Quagsire, and it does a lot of damage to Suicune. Taunt is a fantastic option, preventing Blissey, Clefable, and especially Latias from healing off Magma Storm damage, statusing Heatran, or phazing it. Taunt on a trapped foe also can secure a safe enough switch to a setup sweeper. Earth Power maximizes Heatran's coverage alongside Magma Storm, as it nails opposing Heatran and can more reliably remove weakened Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Tentacruel.</p> <p>Explosion allows Heatran to trade with whatever foe it traps, most notably bulkier foes that can take multiple Magma Storms or coverage moves such as Blissey and Suicune. Explosion also allows Heatran to trade with Clefable if it misses too many Magma Storms after trapping it. Bulkier Heatran can also use Protect instead, which racks up the residual damage of Magma Storm and potentially Toxic as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread lets Heatran outspeed Adamant 252 Speed EV Scizor and Jolly Tyranitar. With the primary listed moves, Heatran should run at least 216 Special Attack EVs and a boosting nature, as this allows it to trap Swampert and Blissey and KO them with Hidden Power Grass or Explosion, respectively. As Heatran is on the cusp of surviving attacks such as mixed Flygon's Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Life Orb Dragonite's Earthquake—both with Shuca Berry—it can invest 128 EVs in HP instead of reaching this benchmark. Heatran can also run more HP EVs and not a lot of Speed EVs, but Hidden Power Grass Heatran should run at least 128 Speed EVs to outspeed and trap Swampert. With Toxic and Protect, Heatran should run maximum HP, as this slower removal process necessitates the extra bulk. Since it won't be using Hidden Power Grass, this set can run a spread such as 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature to outspeed as much as it can, which maximizes what foes it can effectively use Taunt on.</p> <p>Both Passho Berry and Shuca Berry are great for Heatran, as it can survive both strong Water- and Ground-type attacks and eliminate the foe with the appropriate move. Passho Berry lets Heatran trap almost every Water-type in the game, provided it has Hidden Power Grass and they switch into Magma Storm, while Shuca Berry lets it survive Earthquake from various Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Gliscor, and Bronzong. If Heatran is using a bulkier set with Protect, it should run Leftovers to survive throughout the game and exploit free turns from Protect. Lastly, Lum Berry staves off status moves such as Latias's and Clefable's Thunder Waves, letting Heatran keep its Speed high to use Taunt on their recovery moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magma Storm Heatran is primarily a lure; it should come in on Pokemon Heatran forces out such as Jirachi and Skarmory and use Magma Storm as they switch out. Depending on Heatran’s moveset, it can KO what came in with its coverage and potentially Taunt, use Taunt to safely bring in another Pokemon that can set up or use Pursuit, or immediately remove the new foe with Explosion. While the resistance Berries can allow Heatran to survive strong attacks, taking entry hazard damage can invalidate those feats, so Heatran should try to take immediate advantage of what it traps instead of having to switch out, when possible. Unless Heatran has Taunt or possibly Toxic, it should refrain from trying to take down special walls with Magma Storm alone, as Magma Storm’s subpar accuracy and low PP make it a poor choice to wear down Clefable and especially Latias. Bulkier Heatran is less punished for switching in and out, but it should try to preserve Magma Storm PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magma Storm Heatran should be used alongside teammates that have similar checks—often Clefable and Latias. Some prime teammates include offensive Suicune, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Starmie, Nasty Plot Celebi, Substitute + Petaya Berry Empoleon, and offensive Zapdos. Breloom and Dragon Dance Gyarados additionally enjoy Latias being weakened, while one’s own offensive Latias appreciates Clefable being gone. Passho Berry Heatran luring in and removing various Water-types, such as Swampert and defensive Suicune, is great help for Dragon Dance Tyranitar, physical Substitute Jirachi, and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Heatran also is an excellent partner for Machamp, as Heatran can switch into its checks such as defensive Rotom-A, Skarmory, and defensive Zapdos to exert pressure and set up potential traps. With a Shuca Berry, Heatran is a great trapper for mixed Flygon, Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Dragonite while also checking opposing Heatran. Heatran is also bulky enough to survive Superpower and Earthquake from offensive Tyranitar to heavily weaken it or poison it. These roles help setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Substitute + Pain Split Gengar, and Agility Metagross.</p> <p>If running a bulkier EV spread, Heatran appreciates switch-ins to its Pokemon that exploit its weaknesses and/or set up, especially mixed Flygon, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and opposing Heatran. Clefable is a fantastic partner, as it can handle mixed Flygon and appreciates Heatran potentially KOing other Clefable. Choice Scarf Jirachi can help against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and appreciate Toxic Heatran poisoning Ground- and Water-types. Defensive Latias is a good Heatran check and attracts Steel-types for Heatran to take advantage of. Starmie is also great to spin for Heatran, and Toxic Heatran can poison Tyranitar to put it in KO range for Starmie. Toxic Spikes users prevent Heatran from having to use Toxic itself, and in turn, Heatran can trap and remove Clefable, which is immune to poison; Nidoqueen sets Toxic Spikes reliably and provides important defensive utility; for example, it can switch into strong Fighting-types such as Lucario.</p>"

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heatran is fantastic at forcing switches, and Substitute is one of the best ways to take advantage of that. Substitute eliminates Heatran's need to predict switches, blocks status and Knock Off, and scouts for super effective coverage. With Protect + Leftovers, Heatran maximizes its survivability to make more Substitutes, and it's especially effective with Toxic Spikes to wear down foes such as Tyranitar, Blissey, and various Water-types. However, another option is to make Heatran a full-on lure with Explosion. Few expect Heatran to use Explosion behind a Substitute, and the difficulty of surviving its attacks after Substitute invites in special walls such as Clefable, Blissey, and Latias. Heatran can also use both Explosion and Protect, with the latter replacing Earth Power, but you should watch out for opposing Heatran and Lum Berry Tyranitar. There are several other strong options for this moveslot as well: Toxic is a fantastic choice to manually spread status onto Water-types—Substitute both makes it easier to spread and stalls for more damage. Roar spreads entry hazard damage should Heatran force a switch and set up Substitute. Taunt optimizes Heatran's Clefable matchup and stops Latias from phazing it.</p> <p>Lava Plume is the best STAB option with Substitute, which stalls for burn damage alongside Protect. Offensive teams despise switching into burns, especially since Substitute forces any switch-in to risk burn again before hitting Heatran—there is basically a 50% chance that two Lava Plumes inflict a burn. Despite its lack of of power, with investment, it KOes foes weak to Fire such as Breloom, physically defensive Skarmory, and Scizor reliably. Fire Blast is another option for general firepower; behind a Substitute, Heatran can threaten frailer attackers that outspeed and otherwise OHKO it, such as Gengar and Mamoswine. Magma Storm can also work, as Substitute prevents status from trap targets like Clefable, slow Latias, and Blissey while giving Magma Storm a second chance should it miss. Earth Power prevents opposing Heatran from walling Heatran and helps break through Fire-resistant, potentially burned attackers such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Kingdra. Especially alongside Magma Storm, Dragon Pulse is an excellent option to take advantage of Latias: if Heatran has Taunt or sets up a Substitute when Latias comes in, it can trap and defeat it. Dragon Pulse also is excellent for taking down mixed Flygon trying to switch into Heatran, as it OHKOes after Stealth Rock and either burn damage or Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Using maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature, or Hasty if using Explosion, lets Heatran get Substitute up as quickly as possible. Substitute and Protect alleviate Heatran’s lack of bulk with no defensive investment. With Magma Storm, running a Modest nature is possible to 2HKO defensive Latias with Dragon Pulse and Magma Storm damage. Leftovers is by far the most common item to set up more Substitutes and passively heal, but Charcoal is helpful on more aggressive sets to, once behind a Substitute, guarantee a 2HKO on Clefable with Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heatran should set up Substitute once it comes in on some foe it forces out, such as Scizor, Breloom, or Jirachi. From here Heatran can freely use any move. Especially with entry hazards up, a Heatran behind a Substitute using Lava Plume or Toxic is very difficult for offensive teams to handle, as they really hate status, and their options to break the Substitute are easy to wear down. Beware of being too predictable with Protect and using Substitute too much, as opponents can exploit this to set up or wear Heatran down, respectively. With more offensive options such as Magma Storm, Explosion, or Charcoal, Heatran should set up Substitute to draw in walls and mislead opponents on Heatran's power level; opponents probably won’t predict Heatran behind a Substitute using Explosion or 2HKOing Clefable, for example.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Substitute Heatran loves entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, which helps wear down soft checks vulnerable to status such as Tyranitar, Infernape, Swampert, Suicune, and Blissey. With Protect and Substitute, Heatran can wear them down very quickly, even through Lum Berry due to Lava Plume’s high burn chance. Roserade is one of its best partners, as it can lay down Toxic Spikes and Spikes while also being a great check to Water-types. Skarmory and Forretress can also set Spikes and have good type synergy with Heatran, while Tentacruel and Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes. This Heatran set is an excellent candidate for a Fire / Water / Grass core alongside Swampert or Suicune. Both can help Heatran deal with Ground-types and Dragon Dance sweepers that threaten it, and they enjoy Roserade absorbing Toxic Spikes. Suicune appreciates more offensive versions of Substitute Heatran eliminating Latias and Clefable. With all variants, other Steel-types that can absorb Heatran's defensive responsibilities so it can conserve its health, such as Metagross and Jirachi, are also helpful. Both of these can threaten Clefable, which walls Substitute + Protect + Lava Plume Heatran. Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor can Pursuit trap Roar Latias and potentially Clefable, as well as Blissey for the former—all three targets can give Substitute Heatran problems. Tyranitar can check Zapdos and draw in physical Jirachi, allowing Heatran to switch in, while Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor can grant Heatran a free switch and a Flash Fire boost.</p> <p>Ghost-types, such as Will-O-Wisp + Taunt or Explosion Gengar and offensive Rotom-A, are great at keeping entry hazards up and provide different kinds of utility; Gengar heavily threatens Clefable, while Rotom-A with Pain Split can stay in indefinitely on Clefable, and both Pokemon can spread burns effectively to assist Heatran. Other Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gliscor can help against Lum Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Gyarados, while Heatran may even assist Gliscor in sweeping by wearing down Water-types. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Flygon and Rotom-A can backstop the team against more offensive threats, which Heatran can commonly let set up if they carry a Lum Berry or Heatran cannot status them.</p> <p>Substitute Heatran also fits alongside more defensive teammates such as Latias and Clefable, as Heatran threatens the Steel-types that beat them such as Jirachi. With Skarmory's Spikes, it also fits well alongside offensive Spikes teammates such as mixed Flygon, especially if Heatran baits in Clefable and uses Explosion on it or 2HKOes it with Fire Blast. Other strong defensive teammates such as Celebi and Bronzong can also switch into Heatran's type weaknesses, and they appreciate it pressuring more offensive teams. Starmie can spin away entry hazards to give Heatran more HP to use Substitute.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Choice Specs, Heatran becomes the hardest-hitting special attacker in OU, devastating almost everything that doesn't resist Fire. Overheat outright OHKOes bulky Pokemon like Zapdos, Gliscor, and Machamp while even 2HKOing resistant Pokemon such as Starmie, as well as Gyarados and Dragonite after Stealth Rock. However, Eruption powers Heatran up even more, as at full health, it can even 2HKO defensive Latias and Blissey after Stealth Rock. Further, it not causing Special Attack drops means it can 2HKO Pokemon such as Clefable and defensive Suicune. The main issue with Eruption, besides its power being based on HP, is that it forces Heatran to use a Quiet nature, only outspeeding up to neutral-nature Swampert, Tyranitar, and Empoleon. As both Overheat and Eruption have drawbacks, Flamethrower is recommended alongside them to have a reliable attack for foes Heatran easily OHKOes, such as Celebi, Jirachi, and Metagross.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is fantastic for Dragon-types, as it almost always OHKOes Dragonite, Flygon, Kingdra, and offensive Latias after Stealth Rock. With the Fire-type move of choice, it has good neutral coverage on the whole tier besides opposing Heatran. Hidden Power Grass unquestionably OHKOes Swampert, as well as Starmie after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes Milotic and Suicune. Earth Power instead can give Heatran perfect coverage, OHKOing even Shuca Berry Heatran after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Tyranitar. Note that Overheat and Eruption outdamage Heatran's coverage moves unless the foe resists them and the coverage move is super effective.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Overheat Heatran can run a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed more Pokemon, but it will miss out on OHKOing defensive Starmie after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Milotic and defensive Suicune, so Modest is standard. Eruption is only legal with Quiet. Even with a Quiet nature, Heatran should run maximum Speed EVs to outspeed as much as it can. However, as the closest relevant benchmark is maximum Speed Tyranitar, Modest Heatran can invest 216 Speed EVs to outspeed positive-nature Tyranitar, and 228 Speed EVs with a Quiet nature can outspeed neutral-nature Tyranitar. The remaining EVs can be put into HP to be as bulky as possible, but this is generally not recommended.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Heatran typically comes into the game early or leads and uses Overheat or Eruption. Heatran should only deviate from this if the foe is hit harder by a coverage move or easily KOed with Flamethrower. Especially early-game, when not much has been revealed, Heatran can weaken prominent checks such as Latias and Suicune with Overheat and Eruption. With Overheat, Heatran generally should not try to finish off the foe at -2, as it is much easier to switch into Heatran with a Special Attack drop. Eruption doesn't have this problem, although Heatran should only use Eruption if it faster than the foe or forces the foe out, as its power drops rapidly as Heatran is damaged. Although Heatran can get a lot out of predicting switches, it generally should only do this against more defensive teams; there are few common pivots that avoid the 2HKO from Overheat or Eruption on offensive teams, only opposing Heatran and bulky Tyranitar, meaning whatever switches in will likely take huge damage, regardless of prediction. Against more defensive teams that can afford defensive Latias, predicting when it comes in and nailing it with Dragon Pulse can open up the team to Heatran's attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Heatran enjoys teammates spreading paralysis, especially if running Eruption, so it can outspeed foes and hit them with powerful attacks. It's an excellent early-game wallbreaker for teams that spread paralysis, meaning Starmie, Blissey, and defensive Zapdos are excellent partners. Starmie can spin away entry hazards, keeping Heatran's health high so it can use Eruption or its other strong attacks for longer. Blissey can switch into many attackers that aren't OHKOed by Overheat or Eruption, such as Starmie, offensive Suicune, and offensive Latias, and set up Stealth Rock or spread paralysis. Zapdos similarly can switch into all attacks Heatran is weak to, and it can threaten or wall their users. It additionally appreciates Starmie's Rapid Spin, given its Stealth Rock weakness. As Heatran is primarily an attacker, it cannot use its Steel typing to switch into powerful Dragon-type moves. For this reason, Jirachi and Choice Scarf Metagross are great teammates, as they can revenge kill or wall Dragonite, Choice Scarf Flygon, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar—further, each threat can survive one hit from Heatran and potentially set up. Other Pokemon that can help cover for Heatran defensively include Celebi, Clefable, Bronzong, and Gliscor, and the former two can provide paralysis for it. Breloom is also a great partner, as it takes advantage of all of the bulky Water-types and Blissey trying to survive Heatran's attacks, and it appreciates Heatran potentially incapacitating Latias.</p> <p>Heatran also can fit alongside more offensive teammates that can lure in and KO the few Pokemon that repeatedly survive its attacks, such as Tyranitar, Latias, and Suicune. Dragon Dance Gyarados with Outrage is excellent, as it lures in and KOes defensive Latias and can switch in on all of Heatran's type weaknesses. As these offensive teams typically do not have much defensive backbone, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Latias and Rotom-A are excellent teammates, revenge killing the many Pokemon that can set up on Heatran locked into Overheat or a coverage move. Similarly, offensive Swords Dance Scizor has a Bullet Punch strong enough to prevent Tyranitar and Dragonite from taking advantage of Heatran, and it can potentially trap defensive Latias with Pursuit. Also, Scizor and offensive Empoleon can switch into powerful Dragon-type attacks Heatran cannot take. Once defensive Latias is down, Heatran can often open up defensive teams, as they simply have no other common Overheat or Eruption switch-ins. Choice Specs Latias and offensive Suicune can take advantage of Heatran heavily weakening Clefable switching in, and both offer defensive utility.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heatran makes for a good revenge killer and late-game sweeper with a Choice Scarf, as it hits hard even without a damage-boosting item and is resistant to most priority. Fire Blast and Flamethrower provide Heatran with a strong Fire-type move, and the choice is reliability versus power. Fire Blast is a great sweeping tool, as Heatran can power through offensive Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie, Dragonite, and Gyarados after Stealth Rock and sand damage. Flamethrower does not have to worry about missing late-game and has more PP, but the power loss is noticeable. Earth Power gives Heatran great coverage alongside Fire Blast or Flamethrower and allows it to revenge kill Swords Dance Lucario without worrying about missing.</p> <p>Explosion is one of Heatran's great tools as the fastest prominent revenge killer with it, as Heatran has no hope to OHKO some threats such as Dragonite, Latias, and Clefable, as well as Water-types like Dragon Dance Gyarados. Heatran can use Explosion on these targets, ending the threat or breaking open a wall. In the last slot, Hidden Power Ice is the best choice, as it can revenge kill Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor. Dragon Pulse is another option, as it is very close to OHKOing Dragonite after Stealth Rock and hits Kingdra and Latias hard. Hidden Power Electric also works, as it OHKOes Dragon Dance Gyarados lacking a Wacan Berry without having to resort to Explosion. Heatran’s Speed can potentially make it a great Stealth Rock user, but it's locked into it afterwards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heatran should use maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs with a Speed-boosting nature, as they allow Choice Scarf Heatran to outspeed neutral nature +1 Dragonite and +1 Gyarados and slower Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Breloom and Metagross. A Modest or Mild nature can be used to hit hard, such as anti-leading Azelf with Overheat, but the loss in Speed is significant. The choice of Hasty versus Timid is primarily about power on Explosion or surviving various super effective priority. With a Hasty nature, the primary attacks Heatran needs to worry about are Breloom and Infernape's Mach Punch, which now 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, and +2 Empoleon's Aqua Jet after Stealth Rock, OHKOing it the majority of the time. Should these not be important, the extra damage on Explosion is worth it against foes such as Latias, Dragon Dance Gyarados after Intimidate, and Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Heatran should only come in when it needs to revenge kill or late in the game, as it does not have much longevity and can be walled relatively easily. While Heatran can take one or two resisted or neutral attacks to revenge kill a foe, most sweepers have an attack that can OHKO it. As such, try to avoid using Heatran to revenge kill Dragon Dance sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite through Explosion if it lacks the correct coverage, as it is easily predictable. On the other hand, it is a strong revenge killer to foes that do not boost their Speed, such as Lucario, Gengar, and Scizor, so switching into a setup move or resisted attack can be devastating. Beware that all of these Pokemon can hit Heatran hard on the switch. If all Fire-resistant foes are removed, Heatran's Speed and offensive firepower make it a good sweeper. However, do not be afraid of sacrificing Heatran with Explosion if needed to open up the opposing team to another threat, as it should not be the only line of defense against a foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Heatran is both a late-game sweeper and secondary revenge killer; it enjoys partners that can lure in and remove Fire-resistant Pokemon and can revenge kill the Dragon Dance and other Speed-boosting sweepers it struggles with. One of the best partners for it is Swords Dance Scizor, as it gives Heatran a free switch into Fire-type moves, can revenge kill weakened Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Dragonite, and can potentially Pursuit trap Latias. Choice Scarf Heatran is an excellent choice for a revenge killer on teams built around offensive Zapdos, as Zapdos can weaken Clefable, Tyranitar, and Latias as well as check Agility Metagross for Heatran, while Heatran can potentially use Explosion on Zapdos's checks. Starmie is also a great choice, as it can remove entry hazards that wear down Heatran and use Surf to weaken Tyranitar trying to trap it. Breloom can also take advantage of special walls that prevent Heatran from sweeping and take advantage of Water-types and Tyranitar, while Passho Berry utility Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, take on special attackers Heatran loathes, and potentially handle Agility Empoleon and rain sweepers that Heatran fails to revenge kill. Other sweepers such as Agility Metagross, offensive Suicune, Nasty Plot Celebi, offensive Trick Room Bronzong, and offensive Jirachi are also good options. These Pokemon can also take on sweepers Heatran is forced to use Explosion against, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Choice Scarf Heatran can be effective against offensive teams late-game, but it appreciates help against defensive teams. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Latias, Gengar, and offensive Empoleon are good options.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With full Special Defense investment, Heatran is remarkably bulky: it will avoid the OHKO from most powerful super effective special moves such as Starmie’s Choice Specs Hydro Pump, opposing Heatran's Earth Power, and Gengar’s Life Orb Focus Blast. It also becomes a fantastic switch-in to Latias and Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-A, especially since it is both immune to burn and Toxic. This ability makes it fantastic to spread burns with Lava Plume, as even without investment, it still is powerful enough to OHKO physically defensive Skarmory and at least 2HKO every Steel-type weak to it. It is also is quite annoying to switch into, as Heatran has the bulk to continually fish for devastating burns. As Heatran lacks reliable recovery, Protect is Heatran's best way of healing itself. It’s especially helpful due to Heatran using its raw bulk to answer defensive Pokemon. Protect also scouts strong attacks and racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Roar is prominent on specially defensive Heatran, as it is a fantastic way of spreading entry hazard damage and preventing foes from setting up on Heatran. Heatran is an excellent user of Stealth Rock and can set it up repeatedly. Beware that this set does not deal well with defensive Starmie, however. Another option for good general coverage is Earth Power, as Heatran survives most other Heatran’s Earth Power and can KO back should the opposing Heatran lack Shuca Berry. Another option is to use Explosion, as Heatran can be a great lure. Once it has revealed Protect and especially Roar, opponents are unlikely to scout for Explosion, leading to Heatran getting a KO on a special wall or problematic sweeper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heatran needs full Special Defense investment to comfortably shrug off special attacks from Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias. However, it can spare some Speed EVs to make Roar more effective against defensive Gyarados for example. Heatran can use 80 Speed EVs to outspeed minimum Speed Rotom-A and Machamp. Should Heatran use Explosion, Sassy is an option to power it up, but beware that Heatran is now slower than Skarmory, Breloom, and Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Specially defensive Heatran only recovers health through Leftovers and can be worn down quickly through entry hazards and repeated weaker attacks. As such, it should only come in on attacks it is immune to and Pokemon that it walls to maintain its HP. From here, it should set up Stealth Rock if it has it, phaze the foe, and then spread status. Avoid being too predictable with Protect, especially since Heatran has no protection from Substitute to prevent sweepers from OHKOing it. Opponents often underestimate how specially bulky Heatran is, especially at full health; it can survive attacks such as offensive Suicune's +1 Hydro Pump, Gengar's Life Orb Focus Blast, and unboosted Heatran's Earth Power and retaliate appropriately. Explosion is often unexpected from a Heatran with Roar and Protect, allowing it to bait in and use Explosion on Clefable and Latias should Heatran no longer be needed defensively. Be wary of using Explosion too early, as it might be needed to check physical Jirachi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Heatran is often used a special wall for more offensive Spikes based teams that cover threats based on resistances and can also be used as an answer to defensive Steel-types for slower teams. Some of its best partners are Spikers such as Roserade, Forretress, and Skarmory, as Spikes wear down its switch-ins, and Heatran can spread entry hazard damage with Roar. As Heatran is an excellent switch-in for weaker Electric-types such as defensive Zapdos and Rotom-A, Scizor is an excellent partner, as it baits in Fire-type attacks, gets Heatran easy entry with U-turn, and revenge kills dangerous sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Heatran also facilitates Pokemon such as Calm Mind Latias, Calm Mind Suicune, offensive Zapdos, and mixed Flygon, as it can potentially bait in Clefable and KO it with Explosion. Latias also helps out against Water-types such as Gyarados and Swampert as well as faster Breloom trying to take advantage of Heatran. Starmie is also an excellent partner, as Heatran can get worn down by entry hazards, and Rapid Spin helps to alleviate that burden. Heatran can also effectively partner with Grass- and Water-types to form a Fire-Water-Grass core; some good partners for Grass-types include the aforementioned Roserade as well as Celebi and Breloom, while Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune are great choices. Other good partners for this pairing include Metagross, Gengar, and utility or Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Good defensive teammates include Hippowdon and defensive Jirachi to better handle physical setup sweepers Heatran cannot deal with, such as Clefable, defensive Latias, Gliscor, and Bronzong. Heatran appreciates Wish support to keep it healthy, all of Jirachi, Latias, and Clefable can provide this support.</p>"
      },
      "Torment": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Torment makes Heatran a unique sweeper by taking advantage of the fact many Pokemon only have one move that breaks its Substitute and most of the metagame does not enjoy a burn. Torment blocks repeated moves, meaning Heatran can use the Substitute and Protect combination to stall out the attack, especially against Choice-locked foes. While Torment does need to be reapplied once a new target switches in, Heatran will often already be behind a Substitute, meaning it can use Torment as the foe attacks and then safely set up another Substitute. Substitute is critical to this set’s success, as it blocks super effective coverage should the foe switch in and is faster. Heatran can then use Protect to prevent the Substitute from being broken. Substitute and Protect are naturally effectively with Heatran, as it forces switches to get the initial Substitute and then stalls for more HP with Protect.</p> <p>Roar is another option over Substitute to prevent phazing from defeating Heatran. Additionally, Taunt can be used to stop phazing and, with Toxic Spikes support, can stop mono-attackers such as Blissey and defensive Suicune from beating Heatran. While losing Protect makes Heatran less reliable, just using Substitute is often enough to be effective with Torment. The most common last move is Lava Plume to spread burns and still threaten foes weak to Fire-type moves. While Heatran can use Roar over Lava Plume to maximize its utility options, it isn’t recommended, as Heatran would be completely helpless against Clefable and couldn’t threaten what it needs to.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Torment Heatran should use maximum HP investment with some Special Defense EVs, as it aims for the Substitute to survive weaker attacks such as defensive Rotom-A’s Discharge and resisted ones such as Gengar’s Shadow Ball. However, it should also use a fair amount of Speed, as it does not want to take status or super effective attacks before it sets up a Substitute. The standard is to use 216 Speed EVs to outspeed Tyranitar and uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Jirachi and Zapdos. However, another option for more bulk would be to run 160 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Scizor. A Calm nature is preferred, as Heatran’s Substitute can survive weaker special attacks, but it will typically either break against physical attacks or do insignificant damage such that a Bold nature would be unnecessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torment Heatran should not reveal Torment until late in the game when its counters, such as phazers resistant to Lava Plume like Latias, foes with two moves that can break Heatran's Substitute like Swampert, and Rest + Sleep Talk sweepers such as Suicune have been incapacitated and many entry hazards are up. Before that, it should either stay hidden or act as a normal Substitute Heatran: set up Substitute when it comes in, use Protect or Roar as needed, and spread burns with Lava Plume. Once the field is ready, using Torment on Choice-locked foes or attackers that only can break Heatran's Substitute with one move is devastating, as Choice-locked attackers will be forced to struggle, and Heatran can keep up its Substitute for much longer. Once it uses Torment, Heatran should aim to have a Substitute up at all times in case the foe switches to remove Torment, so it can use Torment on opposing switch-ins unimpeded. Try to keep Heatran's health high so it can repeatedly set up Substitute, but avoid being too predictable with Protect on a foe affected by Torment, as this gives an opportunity to faster foes that switch in and try to stop Heatran.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torment Heatran needs the entire team built around setting it up. Entry hazards, Trick users such as Rotom-A and Latias, sand, and Knock Off users go a long way to setting the field up. Both Spikes and Toxic Spikes are great; Forretress in particular is a great teammate, as it potentially set up both entry hazards, use Rapid Spin to clear hazards, and potentially take out a problem Pokemon such as Clefable or Gyarados with Explosion. Skarmory and Roserade also provide defensive utility and can set up Spikes. Trick + Choice Scarf is a fantastic way to help Heatran deal with problem Pokemon such as defensive Latias, Suicune, and Clefable, as it struggles to wear these Pokemon down, and they can either defeat it or phaze it. Latias and Rotom-A are premier choices that also act as backstops against Speed boosting setup sweepers that Heatran cannot handle. Tyranitar, especially with a Choice Band, is also an excellent choice, as it can Pursuit trap Clefable and Latias and also set up sand to further wear down the foe. Generally good defensive teammates can help Heatran: Clefable can act as a primary special wall and also spread Knock Off to further wear down foes. Avoid using Knock Off around Choice item users, however. Celebi has fantastic type synergy with Heatran and can answer Swampert, Gyarados, and RestTalk Suicune. Other defensive stalwarts such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, defensive Jirachi, RestTalk Gyarados, and Bronzong also can work well with Heatran, absorbing its weaknesses and defensive responsibilities so it only has to come out late in the game when it is ready to sweep. Starmie also works to provide Rapid Spin support, keeping Heatran healthy.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia is the bulkiest Pokemon in DPP OU and with its excellent movepool and immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it has a place on very defensive stall teams or as a dedicated support slot. Cresselia has a couple of unique advantages for defensive teams: it is notably one of the only counters to mixed Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon in the tier; with Rest, it has a huge quantity of PP and can survive a long time while attempting to freeze the foe with Ice Beam; and Lunar Dance allows it to both heal up and restore PP for Clefable or another valuable Pokemon, which can be back-breaking. However, Cresselia has many exploitable weaknesses. Firstly, the prevalence of sandstorm severely limits its healing capabilities. Secondly, its pure Psychic-typing and poor offensive stats notably gives it a huge weakness to Tyranitar, Jirachi, Scizor, and Heatran, some of the most popular Pokemon in the metagame. Therefore, it requires significantly more team support than most Pokemon to work properly -- on defensive teams, it really wants Heal Bell support, is extremely passive, and often competes for a teamslot with the versatile Latias.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used in conjunction with Calm Mind, Psychic, and Moonlight as an alternative bulky setup sweeper set. Clefable will have much more difficult when facing this set, as it cannot remove Cresselia's item through a Substitute, and Seismic Toss fails to break it as well. This set requires a tremendous amount of support from Magnezone and a weather clearer to work effectively, which is often asking for a bit too much support.</p> <p>Cresselia can use an offensive set with Calm Mind and 3 attacks, either Psychic, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Fire or Psychic, Hidden Power Electric, and Ice Beam. Grass Knot is fantastic against bulky Water-types and is especially effective versus Swampert. Hidden Power Electric and Ice Beam are good versus Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Latias. These sets generally have a difficult time sweeping compared to a bulkier Calm Mind variant, however.</p> <p>A RestTalk set with Charge Beam and Ice Beam can be used as an alternative to boosting its Special Attack without Calm Mind while also having BoltBeam coverage, but this set isn't very reliable and is not as effective at cleaning late-game as a Calm Mind set is.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set with Trick, a support move such as Rain Dance or Trick Room, Ice Beam, and Lunar Dance has some potential, but other Choice Scarf users are more reliable revenge killers, since Cresselia's Special Attack is quite lacking.</p> <p>Psycho Shift + Flame Orb can debilitate Cresselia's counters; in particular, a set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Psycho Shift, and Solar Beam can cripple Jirachi and Tyranitar with sleep or a burn. This set can also sponge Trick and pass a Flame Orb to the opponent in the process. However, this set is extremely passive. Solar Beam is used because Sleep Talk cannot summon it, giving Cresselia a 50% chance to pass sleep.</p> <p>Toxic is an option to slowly whittle foes down; Skill Swap can be used in conjunction with Toxic to target Clefable, but it has no means of preventing Clefable from switching out, so it's gimmicky overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar:</strong> Tyranitar is the main way to beat Cresselia due to its strong Dark-type Pursuit and Crunch, summoning Sandstorm to reduce Moonlight's effectiveness, and having the ability to switch in safely even if it's chipped quite a bit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Jirachi can induce flinches on Cresselia with Iron Head or use Trick to give it a Choice Scarf. Metagross and Bronzong can use powerful Steel-type attacks or even Explosion to make quick work of Cresselia. Heatran can use Magma Storm to trap Cresselia and either remove it with Explosion or use Taunt to prevent it from setting up and healing.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable</strong>: Blissey can switch into Cresselia and use Seismic Toss to slowly wear it down if it doesn't carry Rest, or fish for a freeze with Ice Beam. Clefable can remove Cresselia's item with Knock Off, use Encore to disrupt its setup, and use Seismic Toss to wear it down as well; Calm Mind sets also have high odds to beat Cresselia in a Calm Mind war. Both of these Pokemon have very high Special bulk, so they can easily switch into any of Cresselia's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types:</strong> Gengar has STAB Shadow Ball, which does a ton of damage to Cresselia, and it can even set up Substitute on sets that lack Psychic. Rotom-A can Trick a Choice Scarf or use its own STAB Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types:</strong> Scizor can maim Cresselia with its powerful U-turn and Bug Bite, or even use Pursuit if it tries to flee. Although rarer, Heracross can hit Cresselia with STAB Megahorn for large amounts of damage.</p> <p><strong>Hippowdon:</strong> Hippowdon can summon Sandstorm to disrupt Cresselia, phaze it with Roar, or fish for a freeze with Ice Fang.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users:</strong> Gliscor, Heatran, Gyarados, and Gengar can use Taunt to prevent Cresselia from setting up, greatly reducing its effectiveness.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Wave is Cresselia primary disabling move, as its enormous bulk means even strong boosted attacks such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar's +1 Crunch and Life Orb Dragonite +1 Outrage don't come even close to KOing it, allowing it to spread paralysis effectively. Ice Beam is critical to answering Dragon-types such as Flygon and Dragonite, as it has a good chance to KO them after Stealth Rock. It also complements Thunder Wave well, as it hits Ground-types immune to Thunder Wave such as Gliscor and Hippowdon hard. Ice Beam's freeze chance is quite helpful against other defensive teams, as Cresselia has many chances to go for it. However, since Ice Beam does not do much damage to neutral targets such as Gyarados and Machamp, Psychic is another option to hit them harder.</p> <p>Lunar Dance is Cresselia's primary niche on defensive teams, as it restores both HP and PP, which can completely turn around a game once Cresselia is no longer needed. Rest is Cresselia's best means of healing, as constant sand and low PP make its other recovery move, Moonlight, unreliable. Cresselia's bulk also lets it survive its sleeping turns</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Cresselia prefers to be as physically bulky as possible. Cresselia mainly takes physical moves, especially Pursuit and Dragon Dance boosted attacks and Cresselia's natural special bulk is enough. Minimizing Cresselia's Speed gives is a Speed stat of 157, allowing it to take less damage from Machamp's Payback and potentially use Lunar Dance after the foe. Due to Lunar Dance's mechanics, the turn does not immediately end once Cresselia uses it, meaning if Cresselia is faster than the foe, the healed Pokemon might take a hit. Using a Bold nature and 31 Speed IVs is also possible, as Cresselia naturally outspeeds foes such as slower Breloom and Swampert, letting it use Rest or attack before they can.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cresselia is quite passive outside of paralysis, weak attacks, and PP stalling, so it should only come into what it answers such as mixed Flyon, Dragonite, and Machamp. Despite its titanic bulk, Cresselia is vulnerable to passive damage from sand, Stealth Rock, and status and struggles to continually walls threats due to relying on Rest. Use Cresselia to survive hits that would be devastating to other parts of your defensive core; it should not be the only defensive answer to a threat. Lunar Dance also cna be quite helpful to revive another defensive wall, but make sure you no longer need Cresselia. Against more defensive teams, Cresselia does invite set-up from entry hazard users such as Skarmory and Forretress, but it often is exceedingly difficult to KO. Leverage this to burn opposing PP with Rest and go for freezes with Ice Beam. Once Cresselia is close to running out of PP or is no longer useful, using Lunar Dance to heal Clefable or another wall is devastating, as defensive teams often really struggle to PP stall Clefable twice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia needs a lot of support to function, as it is quite passive and often competes with the versatile Latias for a teamslot. One of its main needs is Heal Bell support, as it is vulnerable when it is asleep due to Rest. Clefable is the primary Heal Bell user in the tier and is an excellent partner, but Celebi and Blissey are also helpful. Clefable is perhaps its best overall partner, as it is one of the best targets for Lunar Dance against defensive teams and appreciates Cresselia's support against mixed Flygon, powerful physical sweepers such as Dragonite and Gyarados, and Fighting-types such as Machamp and Breloom. Cresselia also appreciates strong defensive partners, as this allows it to only use its bulk when needed. Good choices include Gliscor, Quagsire, defensive Jirachi, and Skarmory. All of these Pokemon help Cresselia take on Dragon Dance sweepers while taking care of the mixed Flygon and Dragonite that threaten them. Skarmory can even use Secret Power to help spread paralysis to Pokemon such as Gliscor alongside Cresselia. Note that since Cresselia does not resist Fire or Water like Latias does, teammates such as Quagsire and RestTalk Gyarados are quite helpful.</p> <p>Cresselia also role compresses quite well, allowing for some unique configurations on defensive teams. Forretress is an excellent teammate in this regard, as it allows Pokemon such as RestTalk Gyarados to take on some of Cresselia's defensive duty and spreads Spikes and Toxic Spikes for Cresselia. Other offensive threats such as mixed Flygon and Machamp can fit alongside Cresselia, as Cresselia both absorbs defensive duty and can potentially heal them with Lunar Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Due to Cresselia's enormous bulk, she can easily set up Reflect and Light Screen multiple times to assist your team. She also has one more trick that other dual screen supporters don't: Lunar Dance. As Cresselia's secret weapon, this move lets her sacrifice herself to allow another Pokemon to come in fully healed and cured of any status ailments it might have. All these combine to let Cresselia assist one of your remaining Pokemon in setting up and sweeping the opponent's team. Few teams can handle assaults from the same threatening sweeper twice over, which can secure the game for your team.</p> <p>Thunder Wave gives Cresselia more time to set up screens, while Ice Beam handles Dragon-types such as Dragonite, as well as Gliscor, who is a common mid-game Taunt user. As an alternative, Psychic provides STAB and a way to take out Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread helps Cresselia better sponge attacks. Specifically, the defensive investment lets her survive the 2HKO from Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch after Reflect, Stealth Rock, and one turn of sandstorm damage. The 68 Speed EVs ensure that Cresselia outspeeds Choice Band Tyranitar and Swords Dance Scizor, which allows her to set up Reflect before being hit by Crunch or Bug Bite, respectively. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense to better take special attacks. Light Clay extends the duration of Reflect and Light Screen to make Cresselia a better team supporter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Cresselia has the potential to set up Light Screen and Reflect multiple times, take advantage of this by first doing it in the early game, hopefully after Stealth Rock is up. Use Thunder Wave against common switch-ins like Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Heatran. Try to conceal Ice Beam, as the opponent may reveal a Gliscor, which will likely use Taunt to try preventing Light Screen and Reflect from going up. Pivot Cresselia into suspected Choice item holders like Flygon and Heatran, and try to punish a bad lock like a Ground-type attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Plenty of Pokemon appreciate dual screens; however, there are a few that pair especially well with Cresselia. Lucario and Tyranitar can capitalize on the Dark-type moves that your opponent will likely launch at Cresselia to bring her down. Other Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite and Gyarados appreciate dual screens because they can compensate for their weakness to Stealth Rock. Substitute + Calm Mind Pokemon like Suicune and Jirachi can take huge advantage of dual screens because their Substitutes will be much more difficult to break. Agility Metagross becomes very difficult to take down under screens and is a potent late-game cleaner.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Cresselia's astronomical bulk but mediocre Special Attack, a Calm Mind set suits Cresselia to a T. Psychic is Cresselia's best STAB move and is used versus most non-Steel-types. In addition to Psychic, Hidden Power Fire is Cresselia's recommended coverage move to turn the tide versus Scizor and 2HKO even the bulkiest variants almost all the time; it's also useful to hit other Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong as hard as possible. As an alternative, Hidden Power Fighting is Cresselia's best option versus Tyranitar, Heatran, and Empoleon, and it also hits all Steel-types for neutral damage at minimum. Ice Beam is very useful for taking on Dragon-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Flygon; it's also useful for Gliscor, which can use Taunt to prevent Cresselia from boosting with Calm Mind and remove its item with Knock Off.</p> <p>Sleep Talk is a non-attacking option that combines with Rest to make Cresselia less passive, but it replaces Cresselia's coverage move, so it will require significantly more support. Rest is Cresselia's most consistent form of recovery because its bulk allows it to burn off its sleep turns consistently. Moonlight is an alternative to Rest that doesn't force Cresselia to sleep, but it has reduced effectiveness in all forms of weather except sun, and Rest's higher PP increases Cresselia's capabilities in a PP war. Overall, Moonlight can leave Cresselia more effective offensively, but it mandates more support, and its low PP limits it tremendously.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment gives Cresselia as much general bulk as possible, while 40 Special Attack EVs allow it to always OHKO standard Choice Band Scizor with Hidden Power Fire after one Calm Mind boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as 2HKO bulky Swords Dance Scizor over 90% of the time without any boost at all. As an added bonus, Cresselia can 2HKO offensive Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite with a +1 Psychic after Stealth Rock damage. 80 EVs in Special Defense ease entry into Latias, specifically maximizing Cresselia's chance to take two Draco Meteors from Modest Choice Specs variants from full. 16 Speed EVs enable Cresselia to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Machamp and potentially get the jump on bulky Suicune and RestTalk Rotom-A. If it's using Hidden Power Fighting, an EV spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 80 SpD / 68 Spe enables Cresselia to outpace all Tyranitar with a neutral nature. With Ice Beam, an EV spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 20 SpA / 80 SpD / 16 Spe fits best; with the Special Attack investment, Cresselia can OHKO Flygon after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers keeps Cresselia as healthy as possible through passive recovery at the end of each turn, which plays a vital role in allowing Cresselia to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cresselia is most effective when revealed late-game after all its checks have been weakened or removed; if it's revealed haphazardly, your opponent can much more easily prevent it from cleaning later on. Use your other Pokemon to try to damage Steel-types and Tyranitar as much as possible. Scout the opposing team and determine what's stopping Cresselia to come up with a solid gameplan. If Cresselia is revealed early—whether a phazing move forces it in or it's needed for its defensive value—use its massive bulk to your advantage by pivoting in and double switching to another Pokemon to potentially gain a positional advantage. Furthermore, try to stay as healthy as possible, and avoid using Rest unless absolutely necessary because a myriad of setup Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Metagross can easily take advantage of a sleeping Cresselia with no boosts. Try to avoid staying in versus Pokemon with Knock Off like Clefable and Gliscor, as without Leftovers, Cresselia has a much harder time setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia has a difficult time versus some of the more prominent Pokemon like Tyranitar, Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross, so it requires quite a bit of support compared to most Pokemon. Weather setters like Rain Dance Kingdra and Rain Dance Latias work well with Cresselia to clear sand, which is useful for both Moonlight and Rest, making Cresselia much more difficult to take down; without sand, Moonlight will heal a greater amount of HP, and it will be easier for Cresselia to take hits while asleep with passive recovery at the end of each turn. Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A can bait in Tyranitar; it walls Metagross, and by spreading burns, it enables Cresselia to set up more easily on physical attackers. Bulky Pokemon with Toxic like Heatran, Bronzong, and Magnezone support Cresselia well by spreading poison to foes like Zapdos, Rotom-A, Tyranitar, Swampert, and Latias. Heatran with Special Defense investment can ward off Rotom-A and Jirachi, and it can even gain a Flash Fire boost from a potential Will-O-Wisp. Bronzong does quite well versus Metagross and Jirachi and can hold its ground often versus Tyranitar. Magnezone can trap Steel-types like Jirachi and Bronzong that Cresselia dislikes facing, especially if it uses Sleep Talk over a coverage move. Toxic Spikes are effective at supporting Cresselia, so Nidoqueen and Roserade are also good pairings; Nidoqueen checks Tyranitar quite well, and Roserade can threaten Swampert, which can often be a nuisance if it packs Roar. Blissey has great defensive synergy with Cresselia, and it can play the role of a cleric, which can assist Rest Cresselia quite well.</p>"

  "Kakuna": {
    "overview": "<p>Kakuna is still one of the most interesting Bugs out there. I expect it to be UnderUsed for a while as people drool over sweepers like Scizor and Azelf, and then returned to as people go back for the old reliable standards. Overall, Kakuna hasn't changed much, but it didn't really need to. That said, it got a few new toys in terms of moves and items. Expect to see Kakuna work the same way it did in ADV.</p> <p>With Kakuna's new move Bug Bite, it's justifiable that it has moved up to the NFE (Notoriously Freaking Epic) tier. (Seriously, who thinks of the names for these tiers, anyway?) With this new, extremely useful move under its shell, Kakuna has the ability to effectively shape its tier to its personal needs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kakuna's movepool is rather shallow; however, it still has a couple different choices. A Lum Berry can be used should Kakuna accidentally switch into Hypnosis. Type-resist Berries can also be useful. The big three that will help Kakuna are Charti, Coba, and Occa. Charti will reduce damage inflicted from Rock-type attacks, Coba the same with Flying, while Occa will do the trick for Fire. Occa is most helpful when considering the widespread usage of Heatran and Infernape. Rock- and Flying-type attacks are much less common.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Parasect can kill it, but it has to be careful switching in because of Bug Bite and Poison Sting. Farfetch'd resists its moves, but can be walled by Iron Defense. Thief Banette with Frisk also causes some problems by selectively stealing items while snatching away Kakuna's Iron Defenses.</p> <p>Steelix and Steel-type Arceus, although somewhat manageable thanks to Bug Bite, still cause problems for our cocooned friend. Other Steel-types, such as Dialga, give Kakuna issues. Luckily, the Steel / Psychic-typed Pokemon are neutral to Bug-type attacks, meaning that Kakuna can ravage them with a powerful STAB Bug Bite.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {"description": "<p>As the standard, this is easily the most popular Kakuna set.</p> <p>Iron Defense increases its already high Defense. String Shot can be used to try and mediate quicker things such as Weavile and Dugtrio. Bug Bite is a solid move to use—as Kakuna's most powerful STAB—and is useful to nab a Ganlon or Apicot Berry, both of which will help Kakuna take hits more easily. Black Sludge is an option to not only heal Kakuna, but to help ward off use of Trick or Covet. It is important to note, however, that if you opt for Black Sludge, your opponent can cripple one of your other teammates by Tricking it on to them.</p> <p>The given EVs provide a good balance between offense and defense, as well as allowing Kakuna to take physical hits quite well.</p>"},
      "Sweeper": {"description": "<p>A sweeping set. Iron Defense a few times, then sweep with Bug Bite—Kakuna's most reliable STAB option—using the Metronome. Be careful about Steel-types switching in, as they easily counter this set. Poison Sting is for an additional STAB option, though you'll usually be using Bug Bite. With Metronome, make sure to stick with the same attack, as your Metronome boost will eventually equal the boost given even by a Choice Band by spamming the same attack repetitively.</p>"},
      "Choice": {"description": "<p>This is your standard Choice sweeper. With Bug Bite, Kakuna is not walled by the likes of Steelix and Steel-type Arceus. As a matter of fact, Bug Bite's addition lowers max HP / max Def Steelix from a 94HKO to a 36HKO. Max HP Steel-type Arceus is now a 25HKO, while min HP/Def Psychic Arceus is a 22HKO.</p> <p>With Jolly and a Choice Scarf, Kakuna outruns anything slower than Heatran, but if it manages to bite a Salac Berry off of some unsuspecting opponent, it gets boosted up to under Ninjask, allowing for a fast physical sweeper. Without the Attack boost from Adamant and Choice Band, you get a 45HKO on Steelix. In 2 vs. 2, pair it up with something with a Salac Berry and Bug Bite the Berry to receive the extra Speed boost.</p>"},
      "Trapper Counter": {"description": "<p>This Kakuna is mainly a Trapinch and Dugtrio counter, though it will also work against Wobbuffet if you're willing to use Kakuna in Ubers. Use String Shot to decrease Dugtrio's Speed, possibly hit it with poison status from Poison Sting, and then switch out using Shed Shell. Wobbuffet especially hates being poisoned, but watch out for Encore. If the enemy Wobbuffet Encores your String Shot, they can switch in an already slow sweeper, such as Tyranitar or Rhyperior; a locked Poison Sting makes way for an entrance by a Steel-type, such as Metagross or Dialga.</p>"},

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's great Special Defense, Speed, and Water typing give it a niche as a solid check to special Water- and Fire-types. Tentacruel critically has access to Rapid Spin, and it's a grounded Poison type, letting it absorb Toxic Spikes upon switch-in, which separates it from the other prominent Water-type spinner of the tier, Starmie. In addition, Tentacruel's unique mix of utility moves, such as its own Toxic Spikes and Knock Off, make it a very appealing choice for stall teams and further differentiates it from Starmie. Knock Off is especially valuable, as it reduces Tentacruel's passivity by crippling bulkier Pokemon and Choice item users; it also complements Toxic Spikes, as bulkier Pokemon tend to run Leftovers, which would otherwise mitigate the poison damage. Tentacruel's Poison typing gives it an important resistance to Fighting, letting it check Fighting-types with Grass-type coverage such as Breloom and Infernape, as they typically lack the options to hit it super effectively.</p> <p>However, Tentacruel is still a rare sight in OU with fairly fringe viability. Despite having Knock Off, Tentacruel is fairly passive due to its mediocre Special Attack stat and struggles to damage the main spinblocker of the tier: Rotom-A. It's also weak to the omnipresent Earthquake, meaning it can't check powerful physical attackers such as Flygon, Swampert, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Dragonite, unlike most other defensive Water-types. In addition, many common defensive Pokemon Tentacruel would want to spin or set up Toxic Spikes on can potentially 2HKO it, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Rotom-A. Above all, Tentacruel's low physical bulk, lack of recovery, and crucial vulnerability to Spikes and sand mean it struggles to safely get in and actually utilize its support movepool. Even resisted attacks such as Breloom's Focus Punch and Gyarados's boosted Waterfall can 2HKO it after entry hazard damage. Tentacruel has high base Speed, but it needs all the bulk investment it can get, so it is commonly outsped and then KOed by strong attackers. While the other viable Rapid Spin users, Starmie, Forretress, and Donphan, don't clear Toxic Spikes upon switching in, their longevity is significantly better; the former has reliable recovery and Natural Cure to stave off status, while Forretress and Donphan are immune to sand and much more physically bulky. Additionally, the ability to absorb and set up Toxic Spikes isn't hugely valuable, as stall teams commonly respond to that threat by running multiple Pokemon immune to them, such as Clefable, Jirachi, and Skarmory.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is a decent option to OHKO Flygon, Gliscor, and Dragonite while chipping Latias and Breloom. However, it is hard to fit due to the value of Tentacruel's other moves. Hidden Power Electric may seem appealing to let Tentacruel 2HKO Gyarados, but due to its weakness to Earthquake and many Gyarados using Wacan Berry, it can struggle to pull that off. Hydro Pump can help Tentacruel push past spinblockers like Rotom and Gengar more easily, 2HKOing the latter and offensive versions of the former. With 68 Special Attack EVs, it can even 2HKO defensive versions of Rotom-A in sand after Stealth Rock. However, the extra PP of Surf is generally more beneficial. Mirror Coat could be used to take advantage of Tentacruel's massive Special Defense stat, taking powerful special attacks and then seriously denting the opposing Pokemon back, if not outright KOing them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Tentacruel's low physical bulk and Poison typing make it a Water-type that can't switch into physical Ground-types. Many Earthquake-using Ground-types such as Flygon, Swampert, Gliscor, Quagsire, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon can severely damage if not outright KO Tentacruel with Earthquake. However, with Surf and potentially Ice Beam, Tentacruel can deal heavy damage to Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is the hardest counter to Tentacruel available, as it is immune to passive damage with Magic Guard, shrugs off Surf with ease thanks to its high HP and Special Defense, and can use Knock Off itself to remove Tentacruel's Black Sludge. Calm Mind sets can also set up on Tentacruel with impunity, but Tentacruel can only threaten a Knock Off itself.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Tentacruel is vulnerable to all of Spikes, Stealth Rock, and sand while lacking reliable recovery, and it must switch in through said entry hazards to spin, and thus it gets worn down very easily.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-A and Zapdos easily 2HKO Tentacruel and are immune to Toxic Spikes while shrugging off Surf. Rotom-A is especially difficult to deal with, as it is immune to Rapid Spin. Both do not enjoy taking Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attacks</strong>: Tentacruel's low physical bulk means it struggles with most physical attackers of the tier, especially if it can't hit them super effectively. All of Tyranitar, Swampert, Flygon, Metagross, Dragonite, Gyarados, Lucario, and Gliscor won't have many issues overwhelming Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Tentacruel's passivity means that sweepers can often switch in on it and set up, such as Calm Mind Jirachi, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Calm Mind Clefable. Dragonite can also set up on it should Dragonite have a Yache Berry or Tentacruel lacks Ice Beam, and it can KO Tentacruel with Earthquake and Outrage.</p>",

      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Surf provides Tentacruel with a reliable attack to check threats weak to Water, such as Gliscor, Heatran, Infernape, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon. Despite Tentacruel's mediocre Special Attack, Surf 2HKOes Infernape and offensive Heatran, and it can even OHKO Naive Infernape. It 3HKOes most variants of Hippowdon, 2HKOes the physically defensive versions, and 2HKOes most variants of Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes is the most common third move, as Tentacruel is one of the few Pokemon with access to it. It helps to cripple grounded offensive and defensive Pokemon alike such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Quagsire, and Hippowdon. Sludge Bomb helps overcome Tentacruel's passivity against Breloom, OHKOing it, and can spread status to Toxic Spikes-immune Pokemon like Latias, Gyarados, and Dragonite. Knock Off is another fantastic choice to make up for Tentacruel's general passivity; it can be critical to wearing down defensive Pokemon by removing Leftovers, as well as crippling Choice item attackers trying to exploit Tentacruel such as Flygon, Gyarados, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Knock Off also has excellent synergy with Toxic Spikes, preventing Leftovers from reducing poison damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge gives Tentacruel passive recovery and offsets sand chip damage. Unlike Leftovers, it also dissuades Trick users such as Rotom-A, Metagross, and Latias. The given EV spread and nature let Tentacruel avoid the 2HKO from offensive Timid Heatran's Earth Power after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to make up for Tentacruel's low Defense stat, letting it better take physical Fighting-type attacks. Alternatively, a Bold nature with a spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe could be used to improve Tentacruel's ability to switch in on physical attacks, as its Special Defense is already quite good. Here, 32 Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outrun maximum Speed Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacruel's unique palette of resistances allows it to switch into common Water-, Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks effectively, especially from Choice item attackers such as Choice Specs Latias locked into Surf, Choice Scarf Tyranitar using Pursuit or Superpower, and Choice Specs Zapdos using Heat Wave or Hidden Power Ice. Tentacruel preys on bulky Water-types bar Swampert, Fire-types such as Heatran and Infernape, and bulky walls that can't status it, such as Skarmory, some Blissey, and some defensive Jirachi. It uses these Pokemon to remove entry hazards, set up Toxic Spikes, and hit more foes with Knock Off. However, Tentacruel is vulnerable to all entry hazards and sand; therefore, it can't be switching around too cavalierly to remove entry hazards, lest it be too weakened and overwhelmed. This weakness is exacerbated by its lack of recovery. Tentacruel typically enjoys switching in early to establish Toxic Spikes and spread Knock Off, as well as checking threats while it is healthy, and then coming in conservatively afterwards to maintain health for an emergency Rapid Spin. This emergency Rapid Spin is especially effective against defensive teams that lack Rotom-A, as many of their members are passive and don't damage Tentacruel outside of entry hazards. It can even use Toxic Spikes or Rapid Spin against Clefable in a pinch. However, keeping it in against Clefable means Tentacruel risks getting hit by Knock Off or Thunder Wave, the former of which is particularly debilitating. Generally, with its physical frailty and tendency to get worn down, using other Pokemon to get Tentacruel in is advised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacruel fits best on specific teams that benefit from the specific set of roles that it compresses. Though it is an equally rare sight in the tier, Abomasnow absolutely loves having Tentacruel as a partner. It appreciates Tentacruel resisting Fighting and Fire alongside clearing Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. In turn, Abomasnow can switch in on Ground-type attacks, and it easily scares out Ground-types like Gliscor and Flygon that threaten Tentacruel. The duo of Tentacruel and Abomasnow is great against most Water-types, with the exception of Gyarados. Hippowdon is another great partner, as it loves having Toxic Spikes cleared, and it appreciates Toxic Spikes being laid down to give it an easier time stalling out the opposition. Magnezone can remove Skarmory and Forretress early on to limit the number of times Tentacruel needs to remove Spikes. Latias and Zapdos can switch in on Ground-type attacks and force out the likes of Gliscor and Flygon, and their best checks being vulnerable to poison, combined with their own instant recovery, lets them take great advantage of Toxic Spikes. Substitute + Roost Zapdos particularly has synergy with Toxic Spikes, potentially stalling out Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, and Hippowdon that would otherwise check Zapdos. Both Pokemon's reliable recovery also makes them reliable answers to Fighting-type and, in Latias's case, Fire-type attacks, making sure Tentacruel isn't overburdened and letting it focus on managing entry hazards. Specially defensive Jirachi ensures Tentacruel won't be overwhelmed by special attackers while being effective with Toxic Spikes due to Iron Head flinching and Wish stalling. Clefable greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes wearing down would-be checks and making it easier to stall out said Pokemon. Tentacruel can also lure in opposing Clefable and cripple it with Knock Off, meaning that Clefable can potentially drop Knock Off itself and use another support move, such as Encore, Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, or even Heal Bell. The reverse also can be done, with Clefable running Knock Off so Tentacruel can run Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam instead. Calm Mind Clefable, as well as other special attackers, especially likes Toxic Spikes, as it cripples special tanks and walls like Tyranitar, Blissey, and Swampert.</p> <p>Tentacruel also can be useful for many grounded walls that enjoy Toxic Spikes support. Blissey appreciates Tentacruel's Rapid Spin, as one of Blissey's primary faults as a wall is its vulnerability to all entry hazards, especially Spikes. Blissey can in turn use Wish to heal up Tentacruel, thus mitigating Tentacruel's proclivity to getting worn down. Similarly, Celebi appreciates entry hazard removal alongside Tentacruel switching into special Fire- and Ice-type attacks; Celebi and Tentacruel work well together against almost all Water-types as well. As a fellow Grass-type, Breloom also appreciates Tentacruel's resistance palette and enjoys Rapid Spin support, and in turn, Breloom can break through Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Swampert that can wear down or flat out KO Tentacruel. Swords Dance Breloom is especially good at wallbreaking for Tentacruel, as passive Pokemon and Ground-types give it easy setup chances. Though an uncommon sight, Lunar Dance Cresselia also makes for a good partner to Tentacruel, as it can heal Tentacruel of status and bring it back to full health in a pinch; it can also switch in on Ground-type attacks and paralyze Pokemon like Jirachi, Latias, Heatran, Lucario, and Infernape to make it easier for Tentacruel to stay in on said Pokemon.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>While Slowbro seems like an odd choice for the OU tier, it can be handy for checking some of the metagame's top threats. When using Slowbro in OU, make sure that it isn't being used in a role where it can be outclassed by Suicune and Vaporeon. Slowbro is a blessing on teams that struggle with Dragon Dance sweepers (excluding Tyranitar), and will see the most use on those teams. With its rock-solid Defense and decent Special Defense, however, it can be used as either a physical wall or a mixed wall. Slowbro does greatly struggle with Scizor, however; Scizor can easily switch in on Slowbro's relatively weak Surf and spam a STAB U-turn. Tyranitar can also be a huge problem for Slowbro, as it can deal hefty damage to it via Crunch. While Slowbro is quite bulky, it will fall to powerful special attacks. Gengar's Shadow Ball and Rotom-A's STAB attacks will deal a hefty hit to Slowbro. Don't let these negative factors discourage you, however, as Slowbro can be a huge asset to a team when used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>All of Slowbro's more effective options for use in the OU environment have already been discussed. Psychic can be used to hit Machamp harder, but even with a STAB boost and factoring in the super effective hit, Slowbro can still only 2HKO standard 252 HP / 0 SpD Machamp. Slowbro does have access to Light Screen, which can be useful in certain situations if you are aiming for Slowbro to perform more of a support role on your team. It is generally outclassed by Bronzong and Cresselia, however, as far as setting up Light Screen goes. Slowbro can also use Grass Knot as a more powerful means of hitting fellow Water-type Pokemon than Hidden Power Electric, but Slowbro generally has more productive things to do with its precious moveslots. Slowbro also has access to Flamethrower and Fire Blast. While these moves can be useful for hitting Scizor switch-ins for an OHKO, they warrant little use outside of that. Scizor can outspeed and deal ridiculous damage to Slowbro with a STAB-boosted Choice Band U-turn as it is, so Flamethrower and Fire Blast are really only useful if you are positive your opponent is switching in Scizor. Should it not be the metal bug, your opponent will have gotten a new Pokemon in practically for free, while Slowbro will have wasted one of its moveslots.</p> <p>Calm Mind Slowbro can also be used effectively in OU after Scizor and Tyranitar are taken out by teammates. Calm Mind Slowbro is somewhat outclassed by Suicune, but the fact that Slowbro is much more physically bulky and has two powerful STAB attacks to work with does somewhat help its case. Slowbro is also a great user of Trick Room, as it is one of the slowest Pokemon in the entire game. A simple 252 HP / 252 SpA spread can work wonders on a Trick Room team, as Slowbro's dual STAB combination and decent Special Attack stat can tear through weakened teams. Slowbro is a great support Pokemon in general, and while other Pokemon may have a wider movepool, Slowbro's bulk and access to Slack Off allow it to fulfill a valuable niche on almost any kind of team; moves like Trick, Yawn, and Counter set Slowbro apart from fellow bulky Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Suicune. This is important, as when you are playing with Slowbro in OU, you should try and make sure you're using it in a role where it cannot be \"outclassed\".</p> <p>A simple 252 HP / 252 Def EV spread will generally be best, as it maximizes Slowbro's physical bulk; OU is a tier crammed with powerful physical sweepers, and Slowbro needs all of the bulk that it can muster to stand up to these giants. Maximum defense allows Slowbro to survive a +1 Dragon Dance Dragonite's Life Orb Outrage after Stealth Rock damage (to give you an idea of how bulky it truly is). On the Choice Specs set, an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA will generally be the best, as it allows Slowbro to balance bulk and power. It will not be able to take as many hits as it would with 252 EVs in Defense, however; while it is by no means frail when lacking defense EVs, it isn't as bulky as it was, and can no longer survive a Swords Dance Lucario's +2 Life Orb Crunch (among other attacks).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned a few times in the analysis, Tyranitar and Scizor are very problematic for Slowbro to handle. Slowbro, while very bulky, simply cannot stand up to repeated Crunches and U-turns from these Pokemon. Basically, any Pursuit user will give Slowbro a rough time, as they can scare Slowbro away with their STAB attacks and proceed to take out the fleeing Slowbro with Pursuit. Weavile is a major pain for the Choice Specs set, as it can switch in on an expected Psychic and simply Pursuit away as Slowbro has no choice but to switch. Weavile can switch in on Slowbro, but it will lose a large chunk of health in the process due to its frailness and Stealth Rock weakness. Blissey can put a full stop to Slowbro's plans with ease thanks to her absurd Special Defense and HP stats, but she will not enjoy being hit with Trick from the Choice Specs set. Slowbro, as bulky as it is, will not be able to take multiple neutral hits. Slowbro's typing somewhat limits its defensive capabilities, as it leaves it weak to Grass-, Dark-, Bug-, Electric-, and Ghost-type attacks. These attacking types are relatively common in the OU tier, and the fact that most Grass-, Ghost-, and Electric-type attacks are special attacks doesn't help at all. Gengar and Jolteon are big pains for Slowbro, as while they cannot switch in on it, they can certainly come in after a teammate faints; from there, they simply have to spam their STAB move for a clean OHKO on Slowbro.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Counter": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro is usually seen in the UU metagame, but it can also be used very well in the OU environment. It is a perfect counter to Machamp, and can take on other top threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite very well. It also has reliable recovery in the form of Slack Off, which sets it apart from its fellow bulky Water-type Suicune.</p> <p>Surf gives Slowbro a reliable STAB to work with. In the third slot, the move that you use is entirely up to what Pokemon your team needs Slowbro to check. Ice Beam can OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock, while Hidden Power Electric is a guaranteed 2HKO on Gyarados, who struggles to 2HKO in return, even with a +1 Adamant Life Orb Bounce. In the final slot, two moves can be used. Thunder Wave is a nice choice for providing paralysis support for slower sweepers like Bulk Up Machamp. Toxic, on the other hand, is more useful for stall teams, as Toxic Slowbro can stall out many of the OU tier's top physical forces with Slack Off.</p> <p>Slowbro counters Dragon Dance Dragonite and Gyarados, but also fares well against other common sweepers such as physical Infernape, Metagross, and Flygon. It is also notable as a perfect counter to Machamp, thanks to Own Tempo (which prevents confusion), a resistance to Dynamic Punch, and its low base Speed, which ensures it never takes double the damage from Payback. Slowbro is particularly good at taking neutral unboosted physical attacks, as most do not even 2HKO, and Slowbro can slowly bring the opposing Pokemon to the ground with a combination of Surf, Toxic, and Slack Off. Slowbro faces competition for a team slot from Suicune and Vaporeon, but has distinct advantages over both. Suicune must use the unreliable Rest and Sleep Talk combination for recovery, while Slowbro has access to Slack Off. Slowbro's ability to use Thunder Wave to stop sweepers that it can't hit effectively sets it apart from Vaporeon. Its Psychic sub-typing also lets it counter Fighting-types more effectively than either Suicune or Vaporeon.</p> <p>Slowbro generally fits better on defensive or stall teams, as its natural physical bulk and access to instant recovery tend to draw out matches and make for a slower game; however, that isn't to say that Slowbro can't be used on offensive teams. Slowbro makes a great partner for Pokemon who enjoy having the opponent's setup sweepers taken out of the game. This includes Choice item wielding Pokemon such as Choice Band Metagross, as predicting incorrectly can lead to some sticky situations (such as if Dragon Dance Gyarados or Dragonite switches in on Metagross's Choice-locked Earthquake).</p> <p>Scizor and Tyranitar, two of the OU tier's most common Pokemon, are huge threats to Slowbro. These Pokemon can switch in rather easily on any of Slowbro's attacks (but Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar won't enjoy paralysis from Thunder Wave). They can then proceed to severely dent Slowbro with their STAB U-turns and Crunches, respectively. Machamp is a nearly surefire Tyranitar counter, and benefits greatly from Slowbro's paralysis support. Protect Gengar with Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast can lure and kill both Scizor and non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lucario makes a good partner due to Slowbro's Pursuit weakness, as it can easily come in on a Choice-locked Pursuit from the likes of Scizor, Weavile, and Tyranitar, and proceed to set up a Swords Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Slowbro can be a dangerous force in OU, as its STAB combination of Surf + Psychic gives great type coverage. An advantage of using Choice Specs Slowbro is that your opponent will never see it coming; Slowbro is uncommon to begin with, and Choice Specs Slowbro is even more so. Slowbro can hit extremely hard with Choice Specs equipped, and as such, should not be underestimated. The great thing about Specs Slowbro is that it defeats its own counters. Scizor and Tyranitar are unable to switch in on a Choice Specs boosted Surf, and Celebi will take huge damage from Fire Blast. More frail Pokemon will have a hard time trying to deal with this Slowbro variant thanks to its amalgam of bulk and power, while defensive Pokemon are crippled with Trick.</p> <p>Surf is easily Slowbro's best form of STAB, providing nice neutral coverage; Water is a fantastic offensive typing in the OU tier, as the only Pokemon commonly found there that resist it are other bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Gyarados and Vaporeon, Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragonite, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Celebi and Roserade. Psychic gives Slowbro a nice way of hitting opposing Water-type Pokemon harder than with Surf. Trick is great on Slowbro, as it allows it to cripple any defensive Pokemon, like Blissey, that may be switching in on it attempting to wall its attacks. In the final slot, there are two viable options. Fire Blast is the better choice as it allows Slowbro to handle Steel-type Pokemon who attempt to switch in on it, as well as Celebi. Ice Beam can also be used to get past Celebi. Slack Off is a viable alternative if your team already has a powerful user of Fire-type moves, however, such as Life Orb Heatran.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set are Pokemon who can take advantage of the massive holes that Slowbro opens up in the opposing team. Dragon Dance Dragonite is a good choice for this role, as it resists Grass-type attacks and takes neutral damage from Electric-type attacks. Dragon Dance Dragonite can easily sweep an opposing team once its physical walls have been weakened. Swords Dance Lucario and Dragon Dance Gyaradaos are in a similar boat, although Gyarados shares Slowbro's Electric-type weakness. Slowbro needs Stealth Rock to be most effective, as it secures some OHKOes and 2HKOes that would otherwise be impossible. Swampert is a good choice for this role, as it is immune to Electric-type attacks. It does, unfortunately, share Slowbro's Grass-type weakness, but Grass-type moves are rarely seen in the OU environment, barring Grass Knot.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate how powerful this set is:</p> <ul> <li>Surf vs. 248/0 Scizor: 75 - 88%</li> <li>Surf vs. 4/0 Tyranitar: 83 - 98%</li> <li>Surf vs. 160/0 Tyranitar: 75 - 88%</li> <li>Surf vs. 252/0 Tyranitar: 70 - 83%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Metagross: 100%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Celebi: 89 - 100%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/92 Bronzong: 78% - 92%</li> <li>Psychic vs. 0/0 Gyarados: 61% - 72%</li> <li>Psychic vs. 188/0 Vaporeon: 47% - 56%</li> </ul>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>While Magneton may appear to be outclassed by its evolution, Magnezone, Magneton's higher Speed stat gives it a specific niche. With a Choice Scarf or a Salac Berry boost, Magneton has the ability to outspeed a much bigger portion of Pokemon in the OU tier than Magnezone, allowing it to both revenge kill more threats and avoid being revenge killed while it's sweeping. Magneton still has the rare ability to trap and remove Steel-types from the game with Magnet Pull. When using Magneton, always remember to abuse its higher Speed, or you are better off using Magnezone.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Magneton has the same movepool as Magnezone, its lack of bulk makes a lot of other options harder to perform, so they are generally better left to Magnezone. Such options include the traditional Substitute SteelKiller set, Choice Specs, and Dual Screens. Magneton also has other moves at its disposal, such as Discharge and Thunder Wave, but again, these moves are better used by Magnezone, which boasts more impressive bulk.</p> <p>On the Choice Scarf set, one can sacrifice some Special Attack EVs to power up Explosion a little more. However, if one were to add some Attack EVs onto Magneton, make sure that its Special Attack stat does not fall any lower than 327 (which is no less than 204 Special Attack EVs). This is because Magneton will lose the guaranteed 2HKO on Jolly Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Magneton's counters are essentially the same as Magnezone's. Blissey and Snorlax's massive Special Defense lets them take any attack that Magneton can throw at them with ease (barring Explosion). Celebi can also absorb most attacks that Magneton uses, but must watch out for the occasional Signal Beam, which will OHKO it. Lastly, Rotom-A can also switch into Magneton without much trouble, but must rely on Overheat or Hydro Pump to do significant damage to it.</p> <p>Depending on which Hidden Power Magneton runs, Flygon, Gliscor, and Swampert can counter Magneton. Zapdos can OHKO any Magneton with Heat Wave, but will detest taking Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice. While Choice Scarf Heatran will not enjoy switching into Thunderbolt or the rare Hidden Power Ground, it can outspeed all forms of Magneton and OHKO with a Fire-type move or Earth Power.</p> <p>Opposing Magneton and Magnezone can trap and KO Magneton that are not using Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground. Electivire can switch into Electric-type attacks, obtain a Motor Drive boost, and proceed to OHKO Magneton with Flamethrower, Cross Chop, or Earthquake. Thanks to Volt Absorb, Lanturn and Jolteon can switch into Electric-type attacks with impunity while resisting most of the other attacks that Magneton can throw at them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf attached, Magneton reaches 393 Speed, enough to outspeed many dangerous threats such as Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, Jolly Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance, and Starmie. Magneton can then proceed to revenge kill all of them with the appropriate move. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados and Starmie, Hidden Power Ice destroys Dragonite, and Flash Cannon can pick off weakened Tyranitar and OHKOes Weavile. Explosion is always a good move to allow Magneton to go out with a bang, potentially taking down an opposing Pokemon in the process. Hidden Power Fire can be used if you want to quickly kill Scizor and Forretress. Note that Magneton will Speed-tie with max Speed Adamant Gyarados if you choose to use Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Signal Beam can replace Explosion in the last spot if you find sacrificing Magneton unappealing, as it can be used to OHKO Celebi and hit Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ground can be used to KO opposing Magneton, Magnezone, and non-Choice Scarf or Shuca Berry Heatran. Discharge is also an option if you want to spread paralysis, but Thunderbolt is usually always better due to the extra power needed to revenge kill opposing Pokemon. Maximum Speed EVs and a Naive or Hasty nature are used so Magneton is as fast as possible while leaving Explosion's power intact. 252 Special Attack EVs let Magneton hit as hard as possible. If you do not want to use Explosion, Timid is the best nature to use.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Magneton's intrinsic ability to trap and KO Steel-types make great teammates. Dragonite, which resists all of Magneton's weaknesses, loves Skarmory and Scizor being removed from the battlefield. Flygon and Kingdra also appreciate the removal of Steel-types that otherwise stop them cleaning up late-game. Aside from Dragonite, bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and Swampert make good partners to Magneton because they can easily switch into Fire-type Pokemon (Heatran in particular). Celebi, Breloom, and Shaymin can switch into Ground-type attacks that plague Magneton. Gyarados gets a special mention, because just like Dragonite, it also resists all of Magneton's weaknesses. Magneton will find itself walled by Blissey if it can avoid Explosion. Lucario and Infernape can force out Blissey and set up for a sweep as long as they avoid Thunder Wave. Gliscor can switch into any attack from Blissey apart from Toxic or the rare Ice Beam and Taunt it. Note that opposing Magneton or Magnezone can trap and kill Magneton if it is not locked into Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie returns as a reliable Rapid Spinner and strong attacker. Entry hazards are everywhere in DPP OU, and Starmie's access to reliable recovery, excellent base 115 Speed, and offensive prowess give it opportunities to remove them. Starmie's Speed allows it to outspeed Infernape, Gengar, Choice Scarf Magnezone, and Latias, while its strong Water-type attacks threaten Ghost-types and Tyranitar trying to stop it from using Rapid Spin, even potentially OHKOing Gengar, Rotom-A, and Tyranitar without bulk investment with a Choice Specs Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock. These qualities make Starmie arguably the best Rapid Spin user in DPP OU, as no other spinner can universally threaten Ghost-types like it can. Starmie provides fantastic support for Stealth Rock-weak threats such as Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite as well as grounded Pokemon vulnerable to Spikes such as Breloom, Heatran, Blissey, and Jirachi. Furthermore, Starmie has a fantastic movepool; it can support its team by spreading Thunder Wave or can go on the offensive with options such as Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Grass Knot. Starmie's Speed, Water / Psychic typing, and serviceable bulk let it check threats such as Gyarados, Infernape, Jirachi, Heatran, Bronzong, Swampert, and Metagross. Natural Cure especially helps with this—Starmie can switch into status-inducing moves such as Heatran's Lava Plume, Jirachi's Body Slam, and Clefable's Thunder Wave to either threaten them out or remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. It especially helps with Toxic Spikes, so it isn't hampered for the rest of the game after removing them.</p> <p>Starmie is limited by how easily it is Pursuit trapped by the omnipresent Tyranitar and how the metagame has adapted to it. Tyranitar can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed and checkmate Starmie with a faster Pursuit or OHKO all but the most physically defensive sets with Crunch. On the other hand, bulkier Tyranitar sets with a Passho Berry survive even Choice Specs boosted Hydro Pump with ease and remove Starmie. Stealth Rock users have also adapted to Starmie's prowess—even those weak to Water such as Heatran commonly carry Passho Berry to survive Starmie's attacks and KO it back with Explosion or Hidden Power Grass. On top of this, Starmie's overall average bulk and vulnerability to residual damage is easily taken advantage of. Starmie is weak to all three entry hazards, sand, and often wants maximum Speed; this makes it difficult to invest into its bulk to better survive Tyranitar's attacks or coverage options from Stealth Rock users such as Jirachi's Thunder or Thunderbolt, Metagross’s Thunder Punch, Swampert's Earthquake, and Infernape's U-turn. Thus, Starmie often has to choose between staying healthy or making progress. This conundrum is made worse in that DPP OU is notoriously hostile to spinning; even Tyranitar without bulk investment and offensive Rotom-A can survive Starmie's unboosted attacks and trap it or KO back with Thunderbolt, respectively, while Clefable can use Knock Off to wear it down even more quickly. Offensive Starmie can be particularly devastating against opposing offensive teams due to its Speed, power, and coverage, but it is extremely frail and relies on the inaccurate Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Starmie is perhaps the best user of Trick + Flame Orb in the tier, as Starmie naturally threatens Fire-types immune to burns, lures in and ruins Pursuit Tyranitar and Scizor with a Flame Orb, and has Natural Cure to get rid of burn after it switches out. However, since Flame Orb reveals itself immediately, is neutered by Clefable, and chips Starmie very quickly, it should either lead or come in on a sacrifice and use Trick immediately to get make sure it gets the most out of it. Starmie can also run a Choice Scarf, as its high Speed and good coverage make it a serviceable revenge killer able to outspeed very fast threats such as neutral-natured Kingdra in rain and +2 neutral-natured Dragon Dance Gyarados. However, without the power boost from Choice Specs, it is even weaker to Pursuit trapping than normal. Starmie can use Toxic instead of Thunder Wave to more immediately threaten Tyranitar and Rotom-A, but Starmie’s other common switch-ins such as Clefable and Steel-types generally don’t mind Toxic.</p> <p>Starmie’s wide support movepool includes dual screens, which in conjunction with Rapid Spin, can help set up Stealth Rock weak teammates such as Dragonite and Gyarados, but Starmie often has better things to do. However, using Reflect instead of Thunder Wave on defensive sets makes Starmie significantly more physically bulky, including allowing it withstand Choice Scarf Tyranitar, surviving Metagross's Explosion with a Bold nature and nearly full investment, and being much better versus Swampert. However, such a set has fallen out of favor, as it is still very vulnerable to residual damage and is passive to set up threats without the ability to paralyze them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Starmie’s frailty and weakness to Dark-types is a huge problem, as they can remove it without fail. Tyranitar is the biggest menace, as Choice Scarf sets checkmate Starmie with a faster Pursuit, while bulkier sets or those with a Passho Berry shrug off even boosted Hydro Pump and remove Starmie. While not as strong or bulky, Scizor similarly forces Starmie into a difficult position with U-turn or Bug Bite and Pursuit. While Weavile can’t switch in, it notably outspeeds and OHKOes offensive Starmie after Stealth Rock and one turn of sandstorm damage with a Choice Band Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Unless Starmie Tricks them Choice Specs, Starmie struggles to damage Clefable and especially Blissey. Their Seismic Toss takes advantage of Starmie’s low base HP, while Clefable’s Knock Off wears Starmie down even faster.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Starmie’s frailty means most Electric-types easily OHKO it. While Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Magnezone don’t enjoy paralysis or Starmie’s boosted attacks, they can generally survive one hit and OHKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types block Rapid Spin and OHKO Starmie back with Shadow Ball. Both Rotom-A and Gengar should be careful, however, as Starmie outspeeds and potentially OHKOes them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Especially if it lacks Ice Beam, Starmie is setup fodder for dangerous sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite and Kingdra. Even with Ice Beam, Latias is only 2HKOed by Choice Specs Ice Beam and is an excellent pivot against Starmie’s Hydro Pump for offensive teams.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Due to resisting Hydro Pump, bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, Abomasnow, and Roserade are good checks for Starmie. Breloom notably is an excellent choice against defensive Starmie, as it often can’t hit Breloom very hard. Frailer Grass-types should watch out for Ice Beam, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Quagsire, Suicune, Gyarados, Milotic, and opposing Starmie often can either set up on defensive Starmie or force it to use Thunderbolt or Grass Knot, allowing a teammate to switch in more easily. Water Absorb Quagsire is especially good at this, as it is immune to both Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. However, as most Water-types lack super effective coverage on Starmie, they cannot punish it from spinning.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Starmie is grounded, often tasked with removing entry hazards, vulnerable to all status, and weak to sand. It gets worn down quickly even with Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Starmie is fast, it notably struggles with Pokemon faster than it that can hit it hard. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-A, Flygon, Tyranitar, and Latias are all strong choices to outspeed and OHKO Starmie, but beware of Thunder Wave.</p>",

      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin and Recover give Starmie the longevity to remove entry hazards over the course of the game. This longevity is especially helpful against defensive teams lacking a Pursuit user and against Water-weak Stealth Rock users like Heatran, as Starmie can survive hits from them and ensure entry hazards stay off of the field. Rapid Spin has a lot of PP, allowing Starmie to PP stall foes that struggle to hurt it such as Blissey, Skarmory, and defensive Jirachi. Surf or Hydro Pump hits Gengar, Rotom-A, and Tyranitar hard. Surf 2HKOes non-bulky variants of all three most of the time after Stealth Rock, while Hydro Pump guarantees the ranges on Rotom-A and Tyranitar without bulk investment and is generally being more threatening, but it has poor accuracy and PP for a defensive Pokemon. This is exacerbated by defensive structures featuring Protect users such as Heatran and Jirachi, as they can take multiple Hydro Pumps and force Starmie to conserve PP over the course of the match. While Surf is underwhelming against more defensive Tyranitar, it is the primary option for reliability.</p> <p>In the last slot, Thunder Wave is the primary option to prevent a wide variety of foes from setting up on Starmie. Thunder Wave synergizes well with its Water-type STAB, move threatening Ground-types immune to Thunder Wave. Paralysis helps Starmie slow down Gengar, both defensive and Calm Mind Jirachi, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Suicune, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Starmie has a wide variety of other moves it can use as well. Thunderbolt more directly threatens Dragon Dance Gyarados, as Gyarados cannot OHKO Starmie without both Life Orb and a strong neutral attack such as Bounce or Outrage. It also hits Skarmory, opposing Starmie, and Calm Mind Suicune hard. Psychic has good synergy with Surf and Hydro Pump, OHKOing Gengar, most Breloom, and hitting Kingdra as hard as possible. Other options include Ice Beam to 3HKO Latias, 2HKO Breloom, and OHKO Dragonite, Gliscor, and Flygon. Reflect helps to prevent Tyranitar from trapping it as easily and generally shrug off attacks from Swampert, Metagross, and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Starmie needs absolute maximum Speed EVs to outspeed Choice Scarf Magnezone; even if this benchmark is not as important to the team, Starmie generally wants at least 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Latias, Gengar, and Infernape. As the extra EVs are not appreciably enough to prevent Tyranitar from Pursuit trapping it, they are generally put into Speed. Maximum HP lets Starmie survive hits as much as it can, as it has meager overall bulk and relies on its Speed and Recover to stave off threats such as Swampert and Bronzong. However, if Starmie uses Psychic or another coverage move, it is possible to allocate EVs into Special Attack. A common EV spread for this is 136 HP / 156 SpA / 216 Spe, as this guarantees Psychic OHKOes maximum HP Breloom and Gengar and Surf 2HKOes Tyranitar without bulk investment and Rotom-A after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Alternatively, Starmie can look to improve its physical bulk to better handle common physical threats such as Swampert, Metagross, and Bronzong with a spread of 136 HP / 156 Def / 216 Spe. An even bulkier spread is 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 Spe EVs with a Bold nature. With this, Starmie is much bulkier and can reliably take on Gyarados while still outspeeding Adamant Lucario, Heatran, and Mamoswine. However, Starmie is now outsped by Infernape and Gengar, two foes it is supposed to threaten, and it can be flinched by faster Jirachi.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The number one rule when using defensive Starmie is to not be too hasty using it to remove entry hazards; if brought in constantly, it is both very easy to wear down via residual damage and remove with Pursuit. Unless it is absolutely necessary to check a threat or remove entry hazards, Starmie is more effective if used cautiously. Bring it in later in the game, possibly after the opposing entry hazard user has been KOed, to force the opponent to either check it or risk losing their entry hazards. Starmie is excellent at soft checking Pokemon such as Heatran, Infernape, Metagross, and Hippowdon with its coverage and Speed; this is especially useful if they are the primary Stealth Rock user. This situation forces the opponent into the uncomfortable position of either letting their Rotom-A or Gengar take Surf or potentially Thunder Wave, or losing their entry hazards. Continually weakening these Ghost-types can facilitate its spinning capabilities.</p> <p>Starmie generally does not want to be on the field for very long against most teams; while it can PP stall with Rapid Spin, it is not very bulky and has limited Recover PP. Try to stay clear of Tyranitar, as Starmie not hitting it on the switch is usually a death sentence, either via Pursuit if it switches or Crunch if it stays in. Starmie also should try to avoid Clefable's Knock Off if possible, as it really struggles to stay healthy in sand without Leftovers. While Starmie can heal off status from foes such as Heatran and Jirachi with Natural Cure, status only exacerbates it frailty and typically forces it to continuously use Recover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie is generally the best support Pokemon in the tier for Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as Zapdos and Dragonite as well as grounded walls weak to Spikes and Toxic Spikes such as Blissey, Jirachi, and Celebi. Removing Stealth Rock makes physically defensive Zapdos oppressive to deal with, as it has fantastic overall bulk, great coverage, Pressure, and excellent defensive typing. More offensive variants of Zapdos enjoy using its natural bulk to survive one attack and hit hard in return, something much more difficult to do with Stealth Rock. Dragonite, especially Choice Band or more defensive Dragon Dance sets, enjoy being able to switch back in later in the game without worrying about Stealth Rock. Due to how much Spikes warps DPP OU, Starmie is generally a great partner for grounded Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Breloom, Swampert, Abomasnow, Scizor, Metagross, and Jirachi, as it prevents them from being worn down by entry hazards. Tyranitar is especially good, as it can Pursuit trap Rotom-A to prevent spinblocking.</p> <p>With Thunder Wave, Starmie provides great support for teams built around paralysis spreaders, as they generally let entry hazards go up easily and want to use Blissey's sheer bulk to stop special attackers. Starmie also provides good speed control for these builds and checks dangerous Pokemon such as Infernape, Gliscor, and Gengar. Some example partners include Blissey, Jirachi, Zapdos, Machamp, Clefable, Magnezone, and Breloom. Machamp in particular is an excellent partner, as it is very slow, has just enough bulk to avoid 2HKOs, and appreciates Rapid Spin support to preserve its bulk and; in return, Starmie can paralyze foes such as Jirachi, Skarmory, and Metagross to facilitate it getting a Substitute. Jirachi can use Starmie's paralysis support to flinch foes with Iron Head and act as a back-up check to almost anything in the tier with a defensive set. Breloom both enjoys paralysis support with a Swords Dance set and mitigating its Spikes weakness. Magnezone also helps prevent Skarmory from setting up entry hazards later in the game and can potentially remove dangerous Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, and Bronzong that try to use Explosion on Starmie. Starmie also offers great support to powerful Pokemon that need paralysis support such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Substitute + Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Rhyperior.</p> <p>Starmie is also great alongside other Pokemon that wear down Tyranitar, such as Heatran and Zapdos. Toxic Spikes are also effective for wearing Tyranitar down, especially since it often does not have ways to heal status or residual damage. Celebi can also lure in and weaken Tyranitar with Grass Knot or U-turn and appreciates Rapid Spin support. Other ways to take advantage of Tyranitar include Substitute Breloom, Swords Dance Scizor, Rock Polish Metagross, Substitute or otherwise physical Jirachi, and Swampert.</p>"

      "Offensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Starmie can take advantage of its fantastic coverage and offensive prowess to provide opportunities to use Rapid Spin. Hydro Pump makes Starmie very threatening, OHKOing bulkless Heatran and Gengar after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Rotom-A, Metagross, and Tyranitar without a Passho Berry. Surf is also a possibility for higher PP and accuracy, as Hydro Pump especially struggles to pressure defensive Jirachi due to running out of PP against Protect. Thunderbolt pressures Water-types, hitting Starmie, Suicune, and Gyarados hard. Grass Knot is another option to surprise Swampert and hit Suicune harder at the expense of only hitting Gyarados neutrally. However, Starmie needs bulk to not get OHKOed by Gyarados's +1 Earthquake after Stealth Rock. Another option is Thunder Wave, which is often a surprise alongside coverage moves and an invested Hydro Pump or Surf. It can paralyze Steel-types that generally take Starmie's attacks well such as Jirachi, but beware that Starmie no longer offensively threatens Water-types and is setup fodder for Gyarados, Suicune, and Kingdra, despite the fact they do not enjoy paralysis.</p> <p>Ice Beam provides crucial coverage for Dragon- and Grass-types, OHKOing Dragonite, Flygon, and frailer Breloom while also hitting Latias, Zapdos, and Celebi hard. Ice Beam gives an accurate attack to hit weakened Ground-types such as Gliscor. Starmie’s coverage allows it to hit most Water-resistant foes super effectively except for weather Pokemon such as Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Offensive Starmie needs maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature to be as threatening as possible. With the Special Attack investment and its coverage, it is difficult for frailer hyper offensive teams to switch into. Starmie has an excellent Speed tier that facilitates this but needs absolute maximum investment to outspeed Choice Scarf Magnezone and Latias, Gengar, Infernape as well as Speed tying with opposing Starmie and Azelf. However, it can also use a spread of 92 Def / 200 SpA / 216 Spe with a Timid nature, as this lets it survive +1 Gyarados's Earthquake after Stealth Rock and sand damage as well as its +1 Outrage without Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Starmie has a couple of item choices. The foremost one is Leftovers, as this help Starmie make up for its lack of Recover and bulk. With Leftovers, Starmie can often fake being a more defensive set and unexpectedly hit Breloom or Latias with Ice Beam. Colbur Berry is another choice to stave off Tyranitar, as without investment, Starmie is extraordinarily frail and very easy to trap. With a Colbur Berry, Starmie can survive any attack from Tyranitar and either remove entry hazards, switch out, or 2HKO it back. Another choice is Life Orb, which lets it hit extremely hard and punish frailer teams. However, the recoil damage makes Starmie faint exceptionally quickly against more defensive foes such as Jirachi and Clefable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Starmie is only designed to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards once or twice at most a game and requires careful play to get the most out of it. Starmie’s power and extra coverage is often unexpected, and it can be very dangerous for offensive teams to deal with due to its power and Speed. Use this pressure to remove entry hazards, preferably after the opposing Stealth Rock user is incapacitated. Predicting switches to either Ghost-types or pivots and hitting them hard can be backbreaking for both offensive and defensive teams. Colbur Berry is also relatively unexpected, meaning Tyranitar can be 2HKOed if it tries to switch into Starmie. However, Starmie is very frail and cannot heal, so try to pick your spots and only remove entry hazards when absolutely needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie fits best on bulky offense and hyper offense teams, as it tends to faint quickly and does not provide any form of long-term pivoting. Pokemon that enjoy entry hazard removal such as offensive Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite appreciate having Starmie as a partner to use Rapid Spin. Offensive Pokemon vulnerable to Spikes such as Scizor, Jirachi, Heatran, and Breloom also enjoy Starmie's Rapid Spin, particularly Scizor and Jirachi, which can use U-turn to keep momentum against Tyranitar. On the other hand, Starmie enjoys partners that help it beat Blissey and Clefable, such as Breloom, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Scizor. Scizor and Tyranitar can Pursuit trap them as well as Latias, a common pivot for more offensive teams. Explosion lures such as Heatran and Gengar can also be effective. Faster Choice Band variants of either are especially good at this, as they can also trap defensive Rotom-A. In terms of offensive synergy, Starmie appreciates being paired with other special attackers that are also vulnerable to Tyranitar so they can overload it. Ghost-types such as offensive or Choice item Rotom-A and Gengar, Calm Mind Jirachi, Electric-types such as Zapdos, and offensive Rotom-A can be effective. Starmie is also useful alongside other Water-types such as offensive Calm Mind Suicune, Gyarados, Kingdra, Vaporeon, and offensive Empoleon to overwhelm opposing Water-resistant foes and help them against entry hazards. Empoleon is an especially good partner, as offensive variants can either use Knock Off on Clefable or blast past it with Choice Specs, threaten Water-resistant foes with coverage, and weaken neutral targets so Starmie can get by them later.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Specs makes Starmie’s Hydro Pump extremely dangerous, OHKOing variants of Tyranitar without bulk and 2HKOing even bulky ones holding a Passho Berry. Even walls such as Clefable and offensive Pokemon that resist Water like Dragonite, Gyarados, opposing Starmie, and Breloom have a decent chance to be 2HKOed by Hydro Pump. While Surf is a possible replacement, the power of Hydro Pump, especially against Tyranitar and Ghost-types, makes it the preferred choice. Psychic hits various Water-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Kingdra and Roserade very hard, but watch out for Tyranitar switching in to Pursuit trap it. Psychic hits neutral targets so hard it mitigates the need to run coverage moves, as Psychic has decent neutral coverage. Because of this, Starmie can run Rapid Spin to fulfill its role as a spinner on predicted switches.</p> <p>However, Thunderbolt and Ice Beam still have good coverage. Thunderbolt always OHKOes Wacan Berry Gyarados after Stealth Rock, 2HKOes +1 offensive Suicune after Stealth Rock, and defeats bulkier Water-type checks such as Milotic on predicted switches. Ice Beam is Starmie's best choice to hit Latias hard, always 2HKOing it and providing a more accurate option for Flygon and Gliscor. To round out the set, Starmie can use Trick to give its Choice Specs away to walls such as Clefable, Blissey, and even defensive Latias trying to absorb Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Starmie needs maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature to outspeed threats such as Gengar, Latias, and Choice Scarf Magnezone and Speed tie with Azelf, opposing Starmie, and Raikou, while maximum Special Attack EVs are necessary to hit as hard as possible. Starmie has no recovery and is incredibly frail, so it should not use any bulk EVs. Starmie can use a Modest nature, as the power level is enormous, 2HKOing Clefable guaranteed and powering through offensive Water-resistant foes, but losing out on outspeeding Latias, Infernape, and Gengar is a big loss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Starmie should come into the game relatively early or lead to start blasting through with Hydro Pump. Starmie is extremely frail and should avoid switching in directly; getting it in via predicted switches or with U-turn is very helpful. Starmie decimates many offensive teams with soft Water resistances or easily predicted pivots, so it should be attacking as often as possible when it’s in. Before it uses Trick, Starmie should only be using Rapid Spin in an emergency, as it requires predicted switches to get in and often cannot take more than one hit. Against more defensive teams, Trick can be an excellent weapon against passive walls, and then Starmie can remove hazards more easily, but watch out for Tyranitar trying to trap it.</p> <p>Starmie can get a lot out of predicted switches, as predicting Latias or Suicune with the appropriate move can be backbreaking. This also helps preserve Hydro Pump PP. However, it’s often best to just use Hydro Pump against offensive teams, as Stealth Rock and Hydro Pump are often enough to break through.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Starmie fits best on fast-paced offense teams that both want to have an emergency spinner and can afford the loss of momentum should Starmie hit a Water-resistant Pokemon with Hydro Pump and be able to KO it on the follow up turn. As Starmie is very frail, U-turn attackers vulnerable to Spikes such as Scizor and Infernape make excellent partners. Both assist Starmie in dealing with Latias, one of the most prominent Water-resistant foes, as Infernape hits it with U-turn on the switch in, and Scizor can potentially trap it. Although Starmie can break through special walls with Trick and its raw power, supporters such as Breloom, Explosion Heatran, and Gengar are also helpful. Gengar especially enjoys Starmie blasting through Tyranitar trying to remove it. To help deal with the momentum loss of using Hydro Pump into bad targets, some good choices include utility Tyranitar, offensive Swords Dance Gliscor, and Jirachi. These Pokemon help absorb hits from various Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types such as opposing Empoleon, Roserade, Celebi, Latias, and Dragonite. As Starmie is highly effective in blasting through soft Water-resistant Pokemon, additional Water-type sweepers are effective alongside it, such as Agility Empoleon, Dragon Dance Gyarados, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Rain Dance Kingdra. Some additional good partners include Swords Dance Lucario, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and offensive Calm Mind Jirachi.</p> <p>While Choice Specs Starmie can be used to support Stealth Rock-weak teammates like Zapdos, this is often difficult to pull off due to Starmie’s frailty and the unfavorableness of being locked into Rapid Spin. Remember that Choice Specs Starmie is primarily a strong attacker that can remove entry hazards in an emergency.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is a centralizing threat in DPP OU due to its potent mix of power and defensive prowess. Gyarados is perhaps the best sweeper in the tier with its access to Dragon Dance, making it a staple of the hyper offensive playstyle. Gyarados's Water / Flying typing, bulk, and Intimidate give it chances to set up, while its superior coverage and strength allow it to potentially muscle through walls. Gyarados also provides critical resistances to offensive teams, as Gyarados is an excellent check to prominent Pokemon such as Lucario, Swampert, Heatran, Scizor, and both Tyranitar and opposing Gyarados lacking Stone Edge. This bulk and Intimidate also make Gyarados a fantastic wall, as with full defensive investment and Roar, it can continually phaze offensive threats. Especially without Stealth Rock up, defensive Gyarados is one of the best answers to opposing offense, as the same prowess that makes it easy to set up Dragon Dance also makes it difficult to overwhelm. Additionally, Gyarados is a great Choice Band user, as it hits hard immediately and is an excellent lure. With Payback, Gyarados can potentially OHKO many of its prominent Dark-weak checks on the switch after Stealth Rock, such as defensive Latias, Rotom-A, and Celebi. Gyarados's Waterfall has a prominent flinch chance, meaning walls that do not resist Water such as Skarmory and defensive Zapdos are often one flinch away from Gyarados breaking them.</p> <p>Gyarados has two crippling flaws: losing 25% of its HP to Stealth Rock and its huge Electric weakness. Offensive Gyarados's power is such that running dedicated anti-Stealth Rock leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl or leading Gyarados itself are often worth it, just to not have to deal with Stealth Rock. For defensive variants, dedicated Rapid Spin support is mandatory, as defensive Gyarados lacks reliable recovery and struggles to wall foes with Stealth Rock up. Offensive Gyarados struggles to deal with bulky defensive Pokemon that resist Water and can phaze, status, or KO it, such as Latias, Suicune, opposing defensive Gyarados, Quagsire, and Milotic. Gyarados also must pick and choose its coverage moves; it needs dedicated options such as Taunt or Stone Edge to deal with walls such as Skarmory and Zapdos reliably, while it despises Breloom and Latias should it lack Ice Fang, Outrage, or Bounce. Gyarados's huge weakness to Electric is another big issue, as most Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Latias, and Flygon can revenge kill it should it lack a Wacan Berry due to its average Speed. However, this item choice leaves it open to status, as without a Lum Berry or Substitute, Gyarados can be crippled by defensive Jirachi, Celebi, and Breloom. Similarly, without Leftovers, Gyarados is worn down quickly, as it is vulnerable to sand and already struggles with residual damage. Choice Band Gyarados is less effective once its surprise is revealed, as all its attacks have reliable switch-ins and rely heavily on prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gyarados's primary other options revolve around bulkier Dragon Dance sets. Dragon Dance sets can primarily invest in HP EVs instead of Attack EVs to increase their survivability, especially with Leftovers and a utility move such as Taunt, Thunder Wave, or Substitute. An example EV spread would be 248 HP / 40 Atk / 36 Def / 184 Spe, as this emphasizes Gyarados's bulk against Fighting-types, Metagross, and Scizor while still being offensively threatening. Note that Gyarados should run at least 184 Speed EVs even on bulkier spreads to outspeed Starmie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +1. With Substitute, Gyarados can dodge status and Explosion while also taking advantage of Pokemon it forces out. With a Substitute up, it can either spread paralysis more easily with Thunder Wave or use an additional coverage move such as Double-Edge, Return, or Ice Fang. Substitute + Thunder Wave sets are particularly devastating alongside offensive Pokemon that enjoy paralysis, such as Machamp and Mamoswine. Gyarados can also use Chesto Berry + Rest to set up, heal off the residual damage, and then sweep; however, it struggles against faster Choice Scarf Electric-types that force it out even it if has a boost.</p> <p>Any offensive Gyarados set can use Aqua Tail over Waterfall for the additional power, but beware of its poor accuracy. On a similar note, Gyarados can also use Life Orb for more power, but it already struggles with residual damage. Other items include Power Herb to immediately use Bounce and OHKO Grass-types and Liechi Berry to give it one last Attack boost at low health. Gyarados can also run other options in its Rest + Sleep Talk set, the most prominent of which is Dragon Dance. A mono-attacking Gyarados makes for a bulky tank that can set up and sweep; however, it is commonly forced out due to not posing enough of a threat until multiple boosts are accumulated and does not provide much utility outside of a late-game sweeper. Gyarados has much more niche sets such as Substitute + Flail on rain teams and sets revolving around special attacks like Thunder and Hydro Pump, but these generally require more support than they are worth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock is a thorn in Gyarados's side, as keeping the entry hazard up is often enough to neutralize Gyarados after it is forced out. Sand also chips at Gyarados without Leftovers and eats away at its survivability. Defensive Gyarados in particular struggles to be effective if its forced to use Rest more often.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Gyarados is plagued by its 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks, and Rotom-A, Zapdos, Raikou, and Magnezone all can easily OHKO Gyarados, even through Wacan Berry after Stealth Rock. While uncommon, both Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton outspeed Adamant +1 Gyarados and easily OHKO it. All these Pokemon need to be careful, as Gyarados can hit them hard on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Latias, Flygon, Lucario, and Metagross can all outspeed Adamant +1 Gyarados and revenge kill it, but they must watch out for Wacan Berry. Aerodactyl and Crobat are uncommon choices but also outspeed boosted Adamant Gyarados and 2HKO bulkless versions. Slower Choice Scarf users such as Magneton and Metagross should beware of Jolly Gyarados. Dragonite and Scizor can also pick off weakened Gyarados with priority.</p> <p><strong>Latias</strong>: Physically defensive Latias resists Water-type attacks and is bulky enough to survive Gyarados's most common coverage move in Ice Fang. Latias can either phaze it with Roar or KO it with Thunderbolt. It needs to be careful of a boosted Outrage and Choice Band Payback, but it can deal with the majority of Gyarados sets.</p> <p><strong>Very Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Even if they do not resist Water, very bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Skarmory, Jirachi, Cresselia, and Porygon2 can survive repeated attacks to either status, KO, or phaze Gyarados. Porygon2, while uncommon, is perhaps the best answer in the game by bouncing Intimidate back and OHKOing it with Thunderbolt. Tyranitar with a Passho Berry can survive any one boosted attack and OHKO it Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Suicune, Quagsire, Starmie, and opposing Gyarados can effective deal with Gyarados. Offensive Suicune is a fantastic check, as it survives any two hits and 2HKOes back with Hidden Power Electric. Starmie is similar, as it will survive any one hit and retaliate with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave. Opposing Gyarados can use their Intimidate to weaken Gyarados and either attack it with Stone Edge or Ice Fang or phaze it with Roar. Quagsire is an excellent check, as it is immune to Waterfall and can use Encore or Toxic to wear it down or Counter to answer it directly. Other less common Water-types such as Milotic and Vaporeon can survive Gyarados's attacks easily as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Shaymin, Breloom, and Celebi are strong Gyarados answers. While they are hit fairly hard by Ice Fang and do not appreciate Bounce, all at least 2HKO Gyarados after Stealth Rock with either Seed Flare, Seed Bomb, or Grass Knot, respectively. Physically defensive Celebi especially is effective against Gyarados, as +1 Ice Fang does not 2HKO it, while Shaymin and Breloom can use Protect to dodge Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Both Dragon Dance Gyarados and defensive Gyarados despise Taunt. Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Taunt Skarmory all can be effective in keeping Gyarados from setting up or healing itself.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While some Gyarados carry Lum Berry or Substitute and defensive Gyarados can heal status, paralysis, burn, and poison are catastrophic for Gyarados. Gyarados will often either faint very quickly or have its average Speed be exposed by paralysis. Defensive Gyarados is forced to heal much more often if inflicted with status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyarados is bulky enough to set up one Dragon Dance and start attacking. Waterfall is Gyarados's main means of doing damage, being able to break through the many walls that don't resist Water. The most common coverage option is Ice Fang, as Gyarados struggles to damage Latias and Breloom with just Waterfall. However, since Ice Fang is fairly weak even when super effective, Outrage is another, much more powerful option to OHKO Latias, Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra at +1. Beware that locking into Outrage can easily lead to Gyarados getting revenge killed, and the confusion is debilitating without a Lum Berry. Gyarados can also use its most powerful option in Bounce to get excellent coverage with Waterfall, but since it's a two-turn charge move, it can be taken advantage of.</p> <p>Gyarados often completes its coverage with Earthquake, as it hits Steel-types such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Metagross, and Magnezone super effectively. However, since Ice Fang doesn't hit opposing Gyarados and defensive Zapdos very hard, Stone Edge can be used to OHKO them after Stealth Rock. For more utility-oriented options, a common last choice is Thunder Wave, as Gyarados lures in Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Latias and ruins them with paralysis so that they can no longer check Gyarados. Another option is Taunt, as Gyarados can completely shut down walls such as Skarmory and Blissey trying to phaze or status Gyarados. Typically, Earthquake and utility moves are used with Ice Fang or Bounce, while Stone Edge is used with Outrage for best coverage; however, this is not a hard and fast rule.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gyarados gets the most out of maximum Attack and Speed EVs to outspeed Dragonite and hit as hard as possible. Gyarados can run some arbitrary bulk to better survive attacks, as it only needs 184 Speed EVs to outspeed Tyranitar before a Dragon Dance and Starmie at +1. An Adamant nature helps Gyarados hit as hard as possible—a Jolly nature is possible to outspeed slower Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Metagross, Magneton, and Heatran at +1 and Choice Scarf Latias at +2, but Gyarados loses a lot of power doing so and typically cannot get to +2 anyway.</p> <p>Gyarados has many possible items it can run to circumvent normal checks. The most prominent one is a Wacan Berry, as Gyarados can survive weaker Electric-type attacks and KO or heavily damage foes such as Choice Scarf Latias, Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Jirachi, Choice Scarf Lucario, offensive Suicune, and Jirachi. 8 HP EVs and 16 Special Defense EVs let Gyarados survive Choice Scarf Rotom-A's Thunderbolt without Stealth Rock after sand. However, another option is Lum Berry, as a common way to beat Gyarados is paralyzing it with defensive Jirachi, poisoning it with Toxic, or burning it with Heatran as it tries to set up. Leftovers helps mitigate Gyarados's weakness to residual damage; Leftovers is more common on sets with Bounce or utility moves such as Thunder Wave and Taunt to survive longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless Gyarados has Rapid Spin support, it should aim to hit the field relatively early before Stealth Rock is up, or even lead, and set up Dragon Dance. With the additional Speed and power, Gyarados can break through defensive counterplay depending on its coverage. Once Gyarados is at +1, it generally should just attack unless there's a specific reason to not do so, as taking additional heavy damage getting to +2 often is not worth it. While Gyarados can sweep, it typically opens opposing teams for another offensive Pokemon to break through. Gyarados is fantastic at forcing predictable responses, like Latias or Skarmory being forced to switch in on Dragon Dance and either try to phaze it or use Counter in Skarmory's case. Taking advantage of these responses, either through Gyarados's moveset choices or teammates, is critical to getting the most out of it.</p> <p>Gyarados can also be used a bit later in the game as a punishment for setting up Stealth Rock, as dealing with a full-health Gyarados can be daunting. In this scenario, Gyarados typically comes in on a Pokemon that cannot really damage it like offensive Swampert. From here, Gyarados can break through the Choice Scarf Pokemon or even opposing offensive Gyarados tasked with checking it. This can open up the opposing team to other offensive threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gyarados is commonly paired alongside the other prominent Dragon Dance users in the tier like Dragonite and Tyranitar. Dragonite similarly appreciates anti-Stealth Rock measures, and both Dragon Dance and mixed sets are devastatingly powerful. Dragon Dance Tyranitar provides important defensive synergy for Gyarados's weaknesses, as it sets up on Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Scarf Rotom-A locked into Thunderbolt. All three synergistically weaken walls such as Skarmory and defensive Jirachi so that one of them can sweep. Anti-Stealth Rock measures are fantastic alongside Gyarados. Taunt leads such as Azelf, Aerodactyl, and Skarmory, as well as sleep leads such as Choice Scarf Breloom and Choice Scarf Roserade, are excellent partners to prevent Stealth Rock from going up immediately and wearing down Gyarados. Other synergetic offensive Pokemon such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Swords Dance Scizor, Heatran, Swords Dance Lucario, and Agility Metagross appreciate Gyarados wearing down walls for them to break through. All these Steel-types appreciate Gyarados potentially setting up on their weaknesses as well. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit is an especially synergetic partner, as it can potentially remove Latias and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. While offensive Dragon Dance Gyarados can fit with almost any offensive teammate due to its unique defensive prowess, it needs a good switch-in to Choice Scarf Rotom-A, as Gyarados cannot outspeed it, and Rotom-A will almost always OHKO it with Thunderbolt. While Tyranitar does help, other options such as the Ground-type Camerupt and Flygon are appreciated.</p> <p>Gyarados can also fit alongside more dedicated Rapid Spin support, such as Forretress and offensive Starmie. Gyarados here typically aims to enter much later in the game to take advantage of weakened teams. Other common partners include defensive Empoleon, Swampert, Choice Scarf Latias, and Jirachi. Magnezone also helps deal with Steel-types that aren’t OHKOed by Earthquake and can retaliate with Explosion or status. Other prominent Magnezone offense teammates such as Choice Specs Latias and Gengar can work well with this core.</p>"

      "Defensive RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Good defenses combined with Intimidate and an excellent array of resistances mean that Gyarados can take on a defensive role. However, Gyarados lacks reliable recovery and can only heal itself through the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk. Rest helps Gyarados answer foes trying to deal with it through status, such as defensive Jirachi, various Toxic users such as Quagsire, and Will-O-Wisp Heatran. Waterfall has no immunities and is Gyarados's most reliable attack. Even without investment, it 2HKOes frail or Water-weak foes such as Gengar, bulkless Tyranitar, Heatran, and Infernape.</p> <p>Roar is perhaps the most important move defensive Gyarados has, as it prevents offensive Pokemon from trying to set up on Gyarados and spreads entry hazard damage. Roar has great synergy with Sleep Talk, as if Gyarados is faster than the target and Sleep Talk uses Roar, Gyarados will phaze the opposing Pokemon before it can do anything and get itself closer to waking up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs caps Gyarados's HP off at 393, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock five times. Defense is maximized, and the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense. Gyarados can spare some Special Defense EVs to better handle attackers like Heatran, such as 56 EVs to survive two non-Life Orb Shadow Balls from Gengar after Stealth Rock. Gyarados sits at a crowded Speed tier and can invest some Speed EVs to use Roar before other Gyarados and outspeed Machamp and Swampert. However, avoid taking too many EVs away from its Defense, as it relies on Intimidate to augment its physical bulk and will struggle to wall what it needs to without heavy investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Especially if Stealth Rock is not up, Gyarados should switch in liberally to check Fighting-types, Swampert, Heatran, and Scizor. With Intimidate and its huge bulk, Gyarados is one of the best ways to stop opposing physical sweepers, especially if they cannot hit it super effectively. Take advantage of this to use Roar to spread entry hazard damage and scout more of the opposing team. Keep Gyarados away from Taunt users such as opposing Gyarados and Skarmory, as they will set up on it with impunity. Intimidate is an incredible tool: do not be afraid to find creative ways to weaken opposing attackers to set up entry hazards or help a teammate heal up.</p> <p>Should Stealth Rock be up, Gyarados should be much more careful about when it switches in. Gyarados struggles to check powerful attackers such as Swords Dance Lucario and Infernape repeatedly, especially if they switch out before Gyarados can heal. This will force Gyarados to use Rest often and be vulnerable to offensive pressure and unreliable Sleep Talk rolls. Smart sequencing from Gyarados's teammates can limit the number of times that Gyarados must switch in and check something with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapid Spin support is mandatory when using defensive Gyarados; it simply is not consistent enough to use without it, and other defensive Pokemon such as Latias and Skarmory are better walls if Stealth Rock is up. By far the best partner for Gyarados is specially defensive Forretress, as it has the best synergy with Gyarados as a spinner and sets up entry hazards. Gyarados resists Fire-type attacks targeting Forretress and answers sweepers trying to set up on Forretress. Other spinners such as Starmie and Donphan are more commonly used alongside Zapdos, which occupies a similar niche as a defensive Flying-type. Gyarados appreciates walls that can switch into Pokemon it's weak to, mainly Electric-types and sweepers with Rock-type coverage. Clefable, Latias, and Blissey are fantastic answers against offensive Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Suicune. Clefable can effectively remove items with Knock Off, exacerbating hazard damage, while Blissey can absorb powerful attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latias and Empoleon that heavily threaten Gyarados while also appreciating Rapid Spin. Latias is an excellent teammate, as Gyarados takes on many of its defensive duties, allowing it to use more offensive sets such as a two-attack Calm Mind set with Hidden Power Fire. Gyarados enjoys another physically defensive Pokemon that resists Rock, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, or Jirachi, that can ease its burden, especially if Stealth Rock is up. All these Pokemon check Tyranitar with Stone Edge well for Gyarados, while Gyarados phazes opposing Gyarados and absorbs Breloom’s Spore. Other defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Celebi can be effective partners with Gyarados, as Rotom-A helps spread burns with Will-O-Wisp and blocks Rapid Spin, while Celebi helps Gyarados take on offensive Water-types.</p> <p>Gyarados's ability to check many physical sweepers affords defensive teams flexibility among its teammates. Some example partners include Cresselia to better answer strong attackers such as Dragonite and Flygon, Hitmontop to form a double Intimidate core, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar for speed control, Pursuit trapping Starmie to keep entry hazards up, and handling Electric-types such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. Other defensive Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support such as Heatran and Breloom can potentially fit alongside Gyarados.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyarados is perfectly capable of using a Choice Band to surprise some of its potential counters. Waterfall is incredibly powerful with a Choice Band boost, 2HKOing many defensive Pokemon that do not resist Water such as Rotom-A and special defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Payback is what Gyarados uses to beat many of its counters, 2HKOing Celebi after Stealth Rock and OHKOing Rotom-A, Latias, and Starmie as they switch in. Stone Edge hits Flying-types that resist Water, such as other Gyarados and Dragonite. Earthquake prevents Empoleon, Magnezone, and Metagross from walling Gyarados, OHKOing Empoleon and Magnezone and 2HKOing Metagross.</p> <p>Ice Fang is an alternate option, hurting Breloom that would otherwise wall Gyarados, as well as being more accurate than Stone Edge as a move for hurting Flying-types. Gyarados can also use Sleep Talk, typically alongside Ice Fang and over Payback to hit Breloom, so it can still function when absorbing Breloom's Spore, but doing so loses out on critical coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gyarados should run as much Attack EVs and Speed EVs as possible with an Adamant nature, as it is primarily an early-game attacker and struggles to switch in repeatedly. The additional Speed EVs help outspeed other Pokemon in its crowded Speed tier, as many Pokemon such as defensive Zapdos, defensive Jirachi, Heatran, and Dragonite aim for a 244 Speed stat to outspeed Tyranitar. If this is unimportant, Gyarados can use some arbitrary HP EVs to better take attacks, as it only needs 184 Speed EVs to hit this 244 Speed stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Gyarados is most commonly in the lead spot or comes in early in the game to attack before Stealth Rock is up. In the lead position, Gyarados should attack whatever is in front of it; leverage the common Dragon Dance lead set to pick up surprise KOs. If Gyarados is forced out without revealing Choice Band, predicting a common answer such as Latias or Rotom-A and hitting them with Payback can be devastating. Once these bulky checks are removed, Gyarados can repeatedly use its powerful Waterfall to break through opponents. Once its set is revealed, Gyarados should be used aggressively, as it has no recovery and cannot boost its average Speed. Creatively using Intimidate to set another Pokemon up and sacrificing it to give a free switch or damage a wall are all worthwhile options.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Gyarados is primarily a wallbreaker; its goal is to open holes early for other attackers to take advantage. Pokemon that take advantage of weakened or KOed Rotom-A, Latias, Zapdos, and Celebi are excellent partners. One of the best partners is Swords Dance or other offensive Empoleon, as it struggles to deal with Latias and other Water-resistant Pokemon, and its typing attracts Ground- and Fighting-type attacks for Gyarados to switch in on. Another common option is to use multiple strong Water-types, such as Swampert and offensive Starmie, to break through the opposing Water-resistant Pokemon. Offensive Starmie can also use Rapid Spin for Gyarados to switch in more easily, as Choice Band Gyarados struggles to fit alongside more dedicated spinners. Other offensive Fighting-types such as Breloom and Lucario as well as other sweepers such as Swords Dance Gliscor are also helpful. Breloom is especially useful against the defensive Water-types such as Suicune, Quagsire, and Milotic that can absorb multiple hits from Gyarados. One way to mitigate Gyarados's weakness to residual damage is Wish or Healing Wish, and defensive Jirachi is one of the best providers of it. Jirachi can even run Thunder to further help Gyarados break through physically defensive Skarmory. Latias is an excellent partner, as even more offensive sets such as Choice Scarf can provide Healing Wish support for Gyarados to continue wallbreaking. Following this idea, Gyarados appreciates Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Rotom-A and Flygon should it be locked into a bad move. Utility Tyranitar sets with Pursuit can finish off Rotom-A and Latias should Gyarados be unable to beat them with Payback. It can wear down Skarmory and Breloom with Fire Blast for Gyarados while also providing defensive backbone against Electric-types that force Gyarados out.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon is stuck in the middle of two paths in DPP OU. On one hand, Vaporeon has the second highest Special Attack stat of viable Water-types and, because of its great HP stat, is bulky enough to be a utility counter to many common threats such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, Gengar, and Heatran. Its low weight also makes it resilient against Grass Knot, helping it against foes such as Jirachi, Empoleon, and Infernape. On the other hand, Vaporeon has access to rare utility moves such as Wish, Haze, and Heal Bell, making it potentially a great support Pokemon. Water Absorb also is a fantastic ability, as it shuts down premier threats such as Gyarados, Kingdra, and Empoleon and makes them more hesistant to use their strongest attacks lest they heal Vaporeon. Against teams that don't have the tools to deal with it, such as rain teams, more defensive Vaporeon sets can be oppressive to deal with by scouting with Wish + Protect and healing against rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the modern DPP metagame is mostly inhospitable to Vaporeon. As a grounded Water-type, Vaporeon is hugely weak to residual damage from sand, all three entry hazards, and status. Unlike other grounded Water-types such as Suicune and Starmie, Vaporeon does not provide enough immediate offense or utility to be relevant. Suicune's significantly higher physical bulk, Speed, and access to Calm Mind make is more preferable as a utility offensive threat, while Starmie's great Speed and access to Rapid Spin make it a superior choice to Vaporeon. As a Choice Specs Water-type, Empoleon is preferred to Vaporeon, as Empoleon's Steel-typing, slightly higher Special Attack, and access to Grass Knot outclass Vaporeon marginally higher Speed. The Steel-typing helps against residual damage and hide its item in sand. Vaporeon also struggles as a wall, as Milotic is bulkier and has access to instant recovery with Recover, while other defensive Water-types such as Swampert, Quagsire, and Gyarados have beneficial secondary typings. The additional turn for Wish to activate helps it pass Wish; however, that additional turn makes it harder for Vaporeon to survive against residual damage when it desperately needs to heal itself.</p> <p>Vaporeon also struggles to deal with many common threats. Vaporeon does not enjoy absorbing strong attacks from even foes it wants to check, such as Infernape's Close Combat, Tyranitar's Crunch, Gyarados's +1 Earthquake, and Heatran's Explosion. Vaporeon needs full investment to even remotely take on these foes comfortably. However, defensive Vaporeon is extremely passive, as it needs two slots to afford Wish and Protect. Vaporeon despises dealing with Clefable, as it is bulky enough to survive any non boosted Water-type attack and threatens it with Knock Off. Vaporeon's best niche is passing 101 HP Substitutes against bulky Pokemon. While Vaporeon can work as a standalone offensive threat, it is not recommended for use in DPP OU, as it is often outclassed in whatever role it tries to fulfill.</p>",

Jolteon is extraordinarily frail and very weak to residual damage from sand, entry hazards, and status; most strong neutral hits at least 2HKO it and it is KOed by almost any Earthquake. Jolteon is also highly dependent on its Speed, and any faster attacker, whether holding a Choice Scarf, boosted, or if Jolteon is paralyzed, is likely to OHKO it. Unlike other fast and frail attackers such as Infernape or Gengar, Jolteon possesses neither the offensive firepower nor the utility these Pokemon have. Jolteon is perpetually checked by most Ground-types depending on its Hidden Power type, Tyranitar, Clefable, and Latias due to its lackluster offensive options and it doesn’t have the bulk to use its utility movepool effectively. Jolteon also faces stiff competition from the other Electric-types in the tier, as Zapdos, Rotom-A, Magnezone, and especially Raikou typically do what Jolteon does and more. While Jolteon can theoretically be used alongside these Pokemon to overwhelm their checks, it generally isn’t recommended for use in DPP OU.</p>",

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is one of the best Rain Dance sweepers in OU. With an Attack stat higher than Lucario's, it is no surprise that it is so powerful. This extra power combined with the usefulness of Stone Edge are Kabutops' main benefits over Qwilfish. The impressive combination of Water / Rock is not resisted by many, allowing Kabutops to rip through many teams with little effort. If you can keep the rain up, Kabutops will almost certainly do you proud, and if your opponent underestimates this beast, it will likely lead to their demise.</p> <p>There are Pokemon who can cause it a few problems, but usually once Kabutops gets a Swords Dance off, your opponent better get ready for a painful experience.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Return and Aerial Ace are other attacking options for Kabutops, but have limited use in OU; a +2 Waterfall in the rain OHKOes most Breloom anyway. Kabutops can use a Focus Sash and set up Stealth Rock in the lead position, but there are better options for doing this in OU and for a Rain Dance team; it is better to stick to Azelf, Crobat, Electrode, or Jirachi for leading. Kabutops can set up Rain Dance itself, but the loss of a moveslot hurts it and there are better Pokemon to do this. Kabutops can use Endure / Substitute + Flail, but priority and the abundance of Choice Scarf users makes this hard to set up. Rapid Spin could be useful to get rid of entry hazards, but this is better left to Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel in OU. Knock Off is an option since getting rid of an opponent's Leftovers could prove useful, but this has limited use in OU. Surf and Hidden Power are possibilities for use on a mixed set, but Kabutops can usually get through most physical walls by using Swords Dance anyway, and its low base 65 Special Attack makes this even more unappealing.</p> <p>Kabutops could run a Choice Band, sacrificing versatility for straight out power, but this is usually a bad idea since rain turns are precious and a misprediction when using a Choice Band could therefore prove costly. A Lum Berry could be used to stop status ending your sweep.</p> <p>Running maximum Speed is fine should you wish to Speed tie with Adamant Mamoswine and outspeed the rare Modest Heatran. When using a Jolly nature, running maximum Speed is best as this Speed ties with Jolly Mamoswine. Jolly and 236 Speed EVs will outspeed Adamant Lucario, while running 192 Speed EVs will outspeed neutral natured Kingdra and other neutral base 85 Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Not much can take repeated hits from Kabutops so it often depends on the move choice. Celebi is among the best counters if Kabutops lacks X-Scissor as even with Stealth Rock, it almost always survives a +2 Stone Edge and can then OHKO Kabutops with Grass Knot. Very bulky Breloom can deal with most Kabutops since a +2 Waterfall in the rain only does 66.6% - 78.4% to 236 HP / 248 Def +Defense nature Breloom, allowing it to easily take a hit then Seed Bomb Kabutops for the OHKO. Defensive Empoleon also does well since Waterfall can only manage 75.8% maximum at +2 in the rain, allowing Empoleon to take a hit and OHKO Kabutops with Grass Knot. More offensive Empoleon can do decently, but they have a chance of being OHKOed by a +2 Waterfall in the rain.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Swampert, and Vaporeon, can do decently as long as Kabutops has not got a Swords Dance up, although non-offensive Suicune and Vaporeon will need Kabutops to be slightly weakened to OHKO it. Choice Scarf Gengar can outspeed and OHKO most Kabutops, but it generally can't switch in directly. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to finish off a weakened Kabutops, but it must be in high health to take an Aqua Jet in the rain from a +2 Kabutops. Shaymin can do well against Kabutops if Bold and with maximum or close to maximum HP and Defense EVs, as it will almost always survive a +2 Stone Edge, even with Stealth Rock support, and has around a 50% chance to survive a +2 X-Scissor with Stealth Rock up. It can then easily OHKO Kabutops with Seed Flare. Non-bulky versions of Shaymin won't like Kabutops at +2, but they otherwise can take a hit and OHKO Kabutops with Seed Flare.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Kabutops is a truly fearsome Swords Dance sweeper in OU when Rain Dance is in effect, and this set aims to take full advantage of that. Waterfall and Stone Edge are the primary moves on this set, providing an awesome attacking combination as the only two Pokemon commonly used in OU who resist both types are Breloom and Empoleon. Aqua Jet finishes off the set by allowing Kabutops to OHKO Infernape before it hits you with Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave. Not to mention it does 74% minimum to Choice Scarf Gengar without a Swords Dance boost, who outspeeds you even in the rain. Most important of all, it can hit Scizor before it Bullet Punches you, although it will need to be weakened a bit for you to OHKO it at +2 in the rain, as it does 74.3% - 87.8%. Priority is also just a useful thing to have in general since the rain won't always be up. When it is raining, Waterfall will have a massive 180 Base Power with Aqua Jet at 90 thanks to the boost to Water-type moves provided by the weather.</p> <p>Unlike Qwilfish, Kabutops has a higher Attack stat and access to Stone Edge which gives it an easier time against bulky Water- and Dragon-types, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. While Qwilfish may have a powerful Explosion and the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes on entry, it usually won't do as much damage to your opponent's team as Kabutops can. Although Aqua Jet is generally the preferred option in the last slot, there are some other possibilities. X-Scissor can be used since it has a high chance of OHKOing Celebi with Stealth Rock support, even before a Swords Dance. It also provides a more accurate attack to hit Starmie with, rather than relying on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Low Kick, Superpower, and Brick Break are some Fighting-type alternatives that hit Empoleon for super effective damage and hit most Fighting-weak Pokemon harder than Waterfall. Aqua Tail can replace Waterfall if you want even more power, at the cost of 10% accuracy, but Waterfall is usually strong enough and the accuracy loss from Aqua Tail can hurt at times. Also, the 20% flinch rate can be useful at times. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge since it has slightly more reliable accuracy and a nice flinch rate, but the loss of power makes it unappealing.</p> <p>The EVs are aimed at making Kabutops hit hard, while outspeeding as many important foes as possible. Max Attack is obvious, while 204 Speed EVs allows Kabutops to hit 247 Speed, outrunning anyone up to and including +1 +nature base 100s, assuming Rain Dance is in effect. When rain isn't up, it will outspeed Choice Scarf-less Tyranitar, and many others trying to just outspeed Tyranitar. 32 HP EVs give a Life Orb number, while the rest is put into Defense to take physical hits slightly better. An Adamant nature is preferred for the extra power, but a Jolly nature can be used should you wish to outrun Timid Choice Scarf Gengar while rain is up, and also outrun neutral natured Gyarados, Kingdra, and Lucario regardless of whether the rain is up or not. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since it doubles Kabutops' Speed to impressive levels, while Life Orb is used for the extra power that is necessary against important threats, such as Skarmory.</p> <p>Kabutops' teammates should all be centered around either sweeping in Rain Dance or setting it up. All versions of Kingdra are great partners to Kabutops for a few reasons. Mixed versions can easily OHKO Breloom with Draco Meteor and often OHKO standard 252 HP Celebi with Signal Beam, assuming Stealth Rock is up. Both Dragon Dance and special versions can outspeed and OHKO Timid Choice Scarf Gengar in the rain, who causes Kabutops problems. The special versions can also lure in both Celebi and Empoleon, always OHKOing the former with Signal Beam (with Stealth Rock support) and 2HKOing offensive versions of the latter with Hidden Power Electric, allowing Kabutops an easier time sweeping. Ludicolo is a great partner since it can deal with bulky Water-types who can trouble Kabutops if it can't get a Swords Dance up. It can also Ice Beam Breloom to its grave. Qwilfish works effectively as a partner since it OHKOes Celebi 100% of the time at +2 with a STAB Poison Jab. Also, they have similar Pokemon who trouble them, and Qwilfish Exploding on one of them could give Kabutops a chance to sweep.</p> <p>The Rain Dance supporters who partner up best with Kabutops are those who resist its weaknesses to Electric-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves. Levitate Bronzong is immune to Ground-type attacks and resists Grass-type attacks, so it makes a great partner. It is also one of, if not the best, mid-game Rain Dance replenishers due to its lack of multiple weaknesses and great defenses. Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-W, and Zapdos are all effective partners as they all resist many of the moves which trouble Kabutops and can fire off powerful Thunders at some of the troublesome bulky Water-types, such as Suicune. Scizor can take the Grass-type attacks aimed at Kabutops and also use Bullet Punch to deal with Abomasnow and Tyranitar whose abilities clear the rain, as well as having super effective Bug-type attacks to hit Celebi and Starmie with.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is one of the premier leads in DPP OU in controlling the early entry hazard game, as it has access to Taunt and is the fastest Stealth Rock user in the tier outside of Choice Scarf Pokemon. These qualities make Aerodactyl a great candidate for hyper offensive teams, as it notably prevents fast leads such as Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar from setting up Stealth Rock. This is critical for maximizing teammates weak to entry hazards including Gyarados and Dragonite, and also potentially enabling Focus Sash users outside of the lead slot, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can venture from the lead position by making use of its great Speed not only offensively but defensively as well. Offensive Aerodactyl outruns the majority of the metagame, including prominent set up sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. It can also use its fast Taunt, sand immunity, and recovery to take advantage of stall teams. Defensively, Aerodactyl can use the SubRoost strategy effectively to be a complete annoyance against any team, provided it has the correct support.</p> <p>Aerodactyl is otherwise niche in DPP OU and must have a specific reason to be used. While it easily fulfills its niche of preventing set up and getting up Stealth Rock, it faces tough competition from Azelf. Other than Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Azelf is faster than almost all other leads, has access to Explosion, and is much more versatile. Aerodactyl's many common weaknesses and inability to boost its Attack make it struggle outside of the lead slot. Many of the common Steel-types of DPP OU, such as Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and especially Scizor can stomach its attacks and remove Aerodactyl easily. Aerodactyl also struggles to break through bulky Pokemon resistant to Rock, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Breloom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerodactyl can also use Rock Tomb on the lead set, especially if it does not have maximum Speed to prevent opposing Aerodactyl from setting up Stealth Rock. Power Herb + Sky Attack can be used to surprise Fighting-types trying to take advantage of Aerodactyl's weak coverage. Pursuit can be used to trap and remove foes like Gengar and even Rotom-A.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Steel-, Fighting-, and Ground-types all resist Aerodactyl's best attacking moves, Stone Edge and Rock Slide. Bronzong completely stops offensive Aerodactyl and can potentially set up Stealth Rock, while faster Steel-types like Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Scarf Lucario can find opportunities to pivot in and force Aerodactyl out. Other variants of Lucario commonly pack Bullet Punch, which can OHKO Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock damage. Even though many Steel-types are weak to Earthquake, Aerodactyl's attacks are quite weak: Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Empoleon can shrug off a weak Earthquake and OHKO or 2HKO Aerodactyl in return. Breloom resists both Rock- and Ground-type attacks and devastates it with Seed Bomb, Superpower, or Focus Punch. Machamp takes negligible damage from Earthquake and can destroy it with Dynamic Punch, Stone Edge, or Ice Punch. Hippowdon can use Ice Fang to force Aerodactyl out, and Swampert can use Water- or Ice-type moves to do the same.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads</strong>: Lead Metagross, Jirachi, Empoleon, and Swampert can make it difficult for Aerodactyl to both prevent Stealth Rock from going up and set it up for its team.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Celebi, Latias, Rotom-A, Suicune, Milotic, Quagsire, and even Tyranitar have enough physical bulk to switch in while healthy and force Aerodactyl out with the threat of super effective attacks or status moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Move Users</strong>: Scizor, Lucario, Metagross, Abomasnow, Weavile, and Mamoswine all carry super effective priority moves that can do major damage to Aerodactyl. Scizor is especially painful, as Bullet Punch always OHKOes and it can easily survive Aerodactyl's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Lucario, Flygon, Latias, and Jirachi can outpace Aerodactyl and revenge kill it with strong attacks.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Against the perpetually changing OU metagame, Aerodactyl has consistently filled its niche as one of the best suicide leads. This niche is made up of Stealth Rock, Taunt, and its Speed. Aerodactyl is faster than almost every other common lead, and so can Taunt to prevent setting up in any way. From here, it can get Stealth Rock up and then faint. However, Aerodactyl's Speed and coverage can be difficult to answer for more frail offenses, as it can often outspeed the entire team. With this, it can use Stone Edge and Earthquake to threaten foes such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar effectively. It can also take advantage of the coverage to threaten Rock- and Ground-weak Pokemon in the lead slot such as Zapdos and Heatran. Otherwise, Aerodactyl's remaining options help it faint as soon as possible. Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to finish itself off after doing its job, especially if it is down to 1 HP due to its Focus Sash. Fainting due to recoil has some advantages: it prevents the opponent from using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, it allows a teammate to take advantage of a foe under the influence of Taunt, and most importantly it gives a free switch. Substitute allows Aerodactyl to avoid status effects that could allow the opponent to use Stealth Rock. This is most notable against Jirachi trying to neutralize Aerodactyl with Body Slam and Iron Head. It also lowers Aerodactyl's health to further facilitate fainting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's EV spread can go in two different directions: the first is to go no bulk and use Focus Sash. Aerodactyl can rarely take more than a hit or two, meaning Focus Sash lets it survive to do its job. It not only gives Aerodactyl a second chance if Taunt is mispredicted, but also allows it to survive hits from faster Pokemon. Speed and Attack are maximized to make it as fast as possible so it can guarantee to use Stealth Rock before its foe, and as powerful as possible to either faint faster with Double-Edge or attack with Stone Edge and Earthquake.</p> <p>Another direction to go in is invest in Aerodactyl's bulk to stave off defensive Jirachi. Jirachi is a difficult opponent for Aerodactyl to face, as it can easily set up Stealth Rock or use Body Slam to paralyze Aerodactyl and then remove it Iron Head before it sets up Stealth Rock. Aerodactyl can use a 128 HP / 236 Def / 144 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature and Lum Berry to survive Jirachi's Body Slam and Iron Head. Aerodactyl can then use Taunt and set up Stealth Rock. This EV spread still outspeeds Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lum Berry also helps against status leads such as Choice Scarf Roserade, Machamp, and Choice Scarf Breloom if not running maximum Speed. Beware of strong leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, and Choice Specs Latias just OHKOing Aerodactyl, though.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aerodactyl should be very aggressive in using Taunt on potential Stealth Rock leads, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Some common counters to watch out for are Choice Scarf Jirachi, Metagross, and Empoleon, which can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Iron Head, Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, and Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet respectively. Aerodactyl should then try to lay Stealth Rock and then either faint as soon as possible or switch to be death fodder. It is strongly encouraged to carry pivots for bulkier leads as Aerodactyl can't deal significant damage to them. Aerodactyl must also watch out for other lead Aerodactyl, as whichever wins the Speed tie gains an immediate advantage. If one is fighting an opposing Aerodactyl, it would be wise to attempt to Taunt first to stop it from setting up Stealth Rock unless Aerodactyl doesn't have maximum Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's teammates should be aggressive to take advantage of a field clear of entry hazards. Offensive Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Zapdos enjoy coming in at full health and with a free switch. Dragonite can also run a mixed set to heavily threaten opposing defensive teams that Aerodactyl can't damage effectively. Aerodactyl can facilitate Focus Sash users outside of the lead position, as it is the best option to prevent entry hazards in the tier while getting Stealth Rock up itself. This allows hyper offensive teams to survive revenge killing from otherwise difficult opponents, such as Choice Scarf Lucario and offensive Suicune. Common choices include offensive Heatran, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Lucario, and Swords Dance Gliscor. Heatran is an especially synergetic partner, as it can immediately threaten Choice Scarf Jirachi trying to prevent Aerodactyl from doing anything. It also beats other leads that threaten Aerodactyl such as Metagross and Roserade; it can then use Taunt and Explosion to give another teammate a free switch.</p> <p>The team must have a fast enough pace that can sufficiently punish the opposing Stealth Rock user should it come in later to set it up. Other strong offensive Pokemon such as Infernape, Swords Dance Scizor, Rock Polish Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, and offensive Empoleon appreciate Stealth Rock up and can maintain this pace. While Aerodactyl does appreciate strong Ghost-types to block Rapid Spin, such as Gengar and Rotom-A, it is difficult to afford with the pace of the team.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With great coverage in only two attacking moves, blistering Speed, and access to Roost and Taunt to beat stall teams, Aerodactyl fills a niche on offensive teams outside the lead spot.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's primary Rock-type move and deals a lot of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it, while Earthquake completes the EdgeQuake combo, providing fantastic type coverage. Roost alleviates the weaknesses given by Aerodactyl's Flying typing, and lets it heal against weak special attacks such as Latias's Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Speed, Aerodactyl outspeeds every relevant non-boosted Pokemon in the metagame. In addition, Aerodactyl outpaces both neutral-natured +1 Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. Some Speed EVs can be relocated towards HP to sustain Aerodactyl's ability to take special attacks in sandstorm while maintaining the capability to outrun certain threats. Specifically, a spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe lets Aerodactyl outspeed the common Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Aerodactyl into foes that have a hard time threatening it, like Skarmory, Choice Scarf Flygon locked into Earthquake, and Gliscor. Be mindful when using Stone Edge because the move only has 8 PP. Use Roost against weaker special attackers to keep Aerodactyl healthy. Try to get sand up through Tyranitar or Hippowdon before sending Aerodactyl in, as the increased Special Defense is crucial for staying in as long as possible and threatening the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards and hard-hitting Pokemon both help Aerodactyl clean up. As Aerodactyl doesn't hit very hard, powerful teammates such as mixed Dragonite help Aerodactyl break down bulky walls, such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Swampert. Tyranitar and Magnezone are two great partners for Aerodactyl. The former provides sandstorm, which increases Aerodactyl's Special Defense and makes it one of the best Heatran switch-ins in the game; Tyranitar can also lure and remove some of Aerodactyl's counters, including Gliscor, Bronzong, and Breloom, with a mixed set. Magnezone traps pesky Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and Scizor, which get in Aerodactyl's way. Starmie can provide Rapid Spin support, which assists Aerodactyl in dealing with its Stealth Rock weakness. Since Breloom can cause issues for Aerodactyl, Sleep Talk Latias is a good teammate that resists its Grass- and Fighting-type attacks as well as can take Spore.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's Speed, resistances, and Pressure ability give it all the right tools to run a successful SubRoost set. The idea behind this set is to set up sand and bring in Aerodactyl on an attack it resists or is immune to, such as Fire Blast or Earthquake. From there, Aerodactyl can usually set up Substitute with its base 130 Speed stat and attempt to stall out the foe's PP with Pressure. To ensure that Aerodactyl can continue using Substitute, Roost is a necessity on the set.</p> <p>The other two attacks on the set are almost as important as Substitute and Roost. Taunt prevents foes from using any phazing or healing moves, which can be a major asset in conjunction with entry hazards. Rock Slide helps damage Flying-type or Levitating Pokemon that are immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While most Aerodactyl should only focus on Attack and Speed, the SubRoost set is the only exception; it must capitalize on its defensive abilities along with keeping a steady amount of Speed. The Attack investment allows Aerodactyl to KO non-bulky Dragonite and Gyarados with Rock Slide after Stealth Rock and two turns of sandstorm, while the Speed investment lets it outrun Dragon Dance Gyarados; the rest is put in HP to better take hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is hugely important for sand to be up before taking advantage of this set. Not only does it increase Aerodactyl's Special Defense significantly but it also assists to wear down foes much quicker. With sandstorm boosting Aerodactyl's Special Defense to a respectable level, Aerodactyl can usually feel free to use Roost even when not protected by a Substitute. In a safer position, Aerodactyl can use Rock Slide to potentially make its opponents flinch to get extra Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Aerodactyl set clearly benefits from entry hazards and Knock Off support as well as strong defensive teammates, as Pressure and Taunt will cause havoc and force plenty of switches. Hippowdon and Tyranitar are necessary for the extra boost from sandstorm, as Aerodactyl is not very specially bulky without it. Specially defensive walls with Knock Off, such as Clefable and Empoleon, can facilitate wearing down the opponent and appreciate Aerodactyl switching into Heatran. Entry hazard support is hugely important to help wear down the foe. Skarmory, Forretress, and Roserade can provide Spikes, while Forretress, Roserade, and Nidoqueen can provide Toxic Spikes. Since Aerodactyl is trying to passively PP stall, it is particularly vulnerable to Rapid Spin. Defensive Rotom-A is an excellent Spinblocker and also can answer Breloom and Scizor, two huge threats to this set. As Aerodactyl can be forced out by common Pokemon such as Metagross, Machamp, Jirachi, and Tyranitar, it appreciates Rapid Spin support to alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness. The most common choice for this support is Forretress to further help with entry hazards, but Starmie is also quite effective.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>On the surface, Snorlax looks good in DPP OU. Snorlax's huge special bulk and access to Pursuit give it a niche as a special tank. With a Lum Berry, it notably can switch in on any move Gengar or Choice-locked Rotom-A can use and Pursuit trap it or remove it with Crunch, something neither Tyranitar nor Scizor nor Weavile can do. In addition, its natural bulk and Thick Fat let it check the many powerful special attackers in the tier despite its lack of resistances, such as Latias, Heatran, Starmie, Suicune, Empoleon, and Zapdos. Snorlax also has access to the strongest move in the game with a STAB-boosted Self-Destruct, which KOes anything that doesn't resist or is immune to it, as well as putting a huge dent in even bulky Steel-types such as physically defensive Skarmory at +1. Self-Destruct, the potential for paralysis with Body Slam, and its bulk also allow Snorlax to soft check physical sweepers that lack strong Fighting-type coverage such as Dragon Dance Gyarados. In addition, Snorlax has niche usage as a wincon as a Curse sweeper with Rest, as some defensive teams can struggle against it when it is the last Pokemon and can no longer be phazed.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Snorlax suffers from many issues in DPP OU—primarily, Snorlax is extremely slow, is very vulnerable to residual damage, and struggles with common Fighting-types such as Breloom, Machamp, Infernape, and Lucario. Snorlax is the slowest Pokemon in DPP OU; it really struggles with offensive pressure from faster Pokemon, as even if it increases its Defense with Curse, it still takes a lot of damage from physical attackers such as Metagross, Scizor, Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Dragonite. Residual damage ruins Snorlax's ability to take hits, which is further exacerbated by Snorlax’s lack of reliable recovery. Stealth Rock, sand, and Spikes make it struggle to handle strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor and Life Orb Gengar's Focus Blast over the course of the game. These special attackers can further hurt Snorlax with Trick or Explosion. Snorlax also struggles to hold Leftovers, as all of Gengar, Heatran, and Rotom-A like to use Will-O-Wisp to neutralize any Snorlax without a Lum Berry or Rest. Snorlax further has to make important choices with its moves. Not only is Snorlax walled by almost all Steel-types and Tyranitar due to struggling to fit Earthquake, it also has to choose between using Self-Destruct and Pursuit, as they are illegal alongside each other. Snorlax also struggles to damage physically defensive Skarmory and RestTalk Rotom-A even with the correct coverage options, as they are bulky enough to survive boosted hits. Beyond all of this, Fighting-types easily outspeed and OHKO it. Breloom freely generates momentum on Snorlax that lack a Lum Berry with Spore, while Lucario can OHKO it through a Defense boost. These faults make Curse + Rest Snorlax a very rare sight in the tier, as supporting it requires far too many resources to be worth it. As such, while Snorlax can fit a few very aggressive teams as a one-time special tank, it generally isn't recommended for use in DPP OU.</p>",

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is perhaps the most powerful Pokemon in DPP OU. Dragonite's boosted Outrage warps the tier, as it at least 2HKOes everything in the tier that does not resist it, while even less bulky Steel-types like offensive Heatran, Scizor, and non-physically bulky Jirachi can be 2HKOed with Life Orb at +1. Dragonite also has the strongest no-drawbacks priority in the tier with Extreme Speed, allowing it to bypass weakened Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Latias at +1. Dragonite's item choice affects it counters; foes hoping to status Dragonite or let it confuse itself are stymied by Lum Berry. It can also lean into its survivability with a resistance Berry—Dragonite can live most attempts to revenge kill it with either a Yache Berry or a Haban Berry. These, including its wide resistance palette, make Dragonite one of the best sweepers in the tier and a staple of hyper offense.</p> <p>Dragonite has more utility beyond an offensive Dragon Dance set. Dragonite's mixed set has very few guaranteed switch-ins and often decimates defensive teams with its coverage and power. Because it is difficult to tell if Dragonite is mixed or physical, switching in the wrong Pokemon can be devastating if a physical wall is OHKOed by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Choice Band is destructively powerful without setup and is excellent against opposing offensive teams with its strong Extreme Speed and ability to absorb opposing sleep moves such as Breloom's Spore. Dragonite also can run bulky Dragon Dance sets as a wincon, aimed at defeating defensive teams that handle Dragon Dance Dragonite with status or residual damage.</p> <p>Dragonite's main flaw lies in its severe weakness to residual damage and relatively low Speed. Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, takes sand damage, and often wants the extra power of Life Orb. Combined with Outrage forcing Dragonite to stay in at least another turn after using it and its confusion, Dragonite can sometimes feel underwhelming—hitting something hard and then getting immediately revenge killed or fainting to residual damage. Mixed sets struggle even more with this, as because it can’t boost its below average base 80 Speed, slower threats like defensive Latias can easily revenge kill after Stealth Rock. Many Choice Scarf Pokemon are faster than +1 Dragonite and outfitted to handle it: Flygon and Latias OHKO it, Jirachi and Lucario have Ice Punch, and Rotom-A and Heatran sometimes carry Hidden Power Ice. Defensive Dragon Dance sets often need heavy support such as Magnezone and weather change yet still can struggle against offensive teams due to lacking coverage, Speed, and power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has numerous niche sets in DPP OU due to its huge movepool and high stats. Dragonite can run more midground Dragon Dance sets, with Leftovers, maximum HP, Roost, and Earthquake. These sets mitigate residual damage while not needing as much support to remove Steel-types as the bulky Dragon Dance set. Doing this often leaves it vulnerable to status and power while still being weak to revenge killers. Dragonite also can run Substitute on its offensive Dragon Dance set to block status alongside a Lum Berry. This can be used alongside another coverage move such as Fire Punch or Earthquake, or even Thunder Wave to paralyze revenge killers and walls like Jirachi. Dragonite also can run mixed sets with Dragon Dance, with options such as Draco Meteor, Superpower, Fire Blast, Earthquake, and others to mitigate its low Speed while opening up walls. These sets often end up trying to do too much with too low of investment, however. The most prominent other sweeping move is Agility with many different options such as Life Orb mixed with Draco Meteor, Fire Blast and Outrage, Expert Belt with Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake, or any combination thereof. Agility doesn't allow Dragonite to outspeed Choice Scarf Latias without a Speed-boosting nature, while it generally isn't strong enough to break through teams without Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Dragonite can run physically defensive sets due to its access to Heal Bell and Roost, as it is a fantastic Breloom counter and handles most threats if they can't hit it super effectively. It often needs full team support to do so and Rapid Spin, however. Dragonite has many niche moves such as Waterfall, Stone Edge, and Thunder Punch on physical sets or Ice Beam, Thunder, and Surf on mixed sets, but these are often outclassed by other Pokemon, and Dragonite is strapped for moveslots anyway. Dragonite's support movepool includes Haze, Light Screen, Roar, Toxic, and Rain Dance, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and typing make it difficult to pull these off without being outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dragonite is difficult to answer without it heavily damaging something. Dragonite can at least 2HKO everything in the tier with the correct attack, and switching in the wrong answer can be catastrophic. However, Dragonite is quite easy to revenge kill, as its attacks have heavy drawbacks, it suffers badly from residual damage, and it has common weaknesses.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory, Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, and Bronzong are excellent initial switch-ins to Dragonite, as its Dragon-type moves either have heavy drawbacks or are easy to wall. Should Dragonite lock itself into Outrage, Skarmory can phaze it, Jirachi and Bronzong can survive boosted attacks and status it, while Metagross, Heatran, and Bronzong can also use Explosion. However, this can backfire, as only Bronzong and physically defensive Jirachi avoid an OHKO with the correct attack, while Dragon Dance Dragonite sets up and can hit all of these Pokemon hard.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Latias, Flygon, Lucario, Metagross, Jirachi, Rotom-A, and Heatran all can outspeed Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and eliminate it after Stealth Rock. Dragonite can get past all of these with the right resistance Berry or, in the case of Latias and Flygon, with Extreme Speed and some residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Ice Beam Cresselia is perhaps the tier's best answer, as it is bulky enough to survive any one attack and can set up Reflect, paralyze Dragonite, or eliminate it with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. All others should be careful. Hippowdon, Gliscor, Bold Clefable, Suicune, and Milotic can all stave off unboosted Dragonite and retaliate with an Ice-type attack. However, Life Orb boosted +1 Dragonite OHKOes many of these checks with Outrage, while some of the weaker Ice-type attacks need Stealth Rock before they can OHKO. These Pokemon are also setup bait for very specially bulky Dragonite with Heal Bell should they lack phazing moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, takes sand damage, and generally wants Life Orb. Additionally, its attacks have drawbacks, such as Outrage forcing it to stay in and Draco Meteor’s as well as Superpower’s stat drops. Because of this, Dragonite will often be at low health should it come in again, meaning anything that can hit it super effectively, status it, or outspeed it can eliminate it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong> Mamoswine, Weavile, and Abomasnow are excellent checks with Ice Shard, as if Dragonite lacks Yache Berry, it will OHKO. Even with Yache Berry, Dragonite takes heavy damage from especially Mamoswine’s and Weavile’s Ice Shards, as with a Choice Band, sand, and Stealth Rock, they can KO. However, Dragonite with Extreme Speed at +1 will outprioritize Ice Shard and KO Weavile after Stealth Rock while heavily damaging Mamoswine and Abomasnow.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: While they can't switch in, Latias, Flygon, and Kingdra all outspeed Dragonite and can easily OHKO with their Dragon-type attacks should it lock into Outrage without a Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Tyranitar can hit Dragonite hard with both Ice- and Rock-type moves, while Choice Scarf sets outspeed all non-boosted Dragonite. Dragonite also doesn't take Pursuit well should it switch out. While rare, Aerodactyl outspeeds most Dragon Dance Dragonite at +1 and can OHKO with Stone Edge. Gyarados, Machamp, and Swampert can generally survive a non-boosted hit and retaliate with a super effective Stone Edge or Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragonite's bulk and offensive prowess can typically get it a Dragon Dance, solving its Speed problems and making it extremely strong. With Outrage, it can overwhelm very defensive Pokemon such as specially defensive Hippowdon and physically defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock. The main downfall to Outrage is being locked into it and the confusion afterwards. However, the power difference from the safer Dragon Claw makes it a necessary evil, as Dragon Claw fails to OHKO offensive Suicune and generally doesn’t hit hard enough even when boosted.</p> <p>Fire Punch is a great option to hit Steel-types resistant to Outrage. Fire Punch at +1 easily 2HKOes Skarmory, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi. However, another option is Earthquake, OHKOing grounded Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Heatran. Due to its much higher Base Power than Fire Punch, Earthquake helps against other foes, such as OHKOing Tyranitar at +1 without locking into Outrage. Finally, Extreme Speed has incredible utility, as it generally hits unresisted targets such as Starmie, Latias, Flygon, and Gyarados for more than 50% of their health unboosted. At +1, it also can bypass weakened revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Weavile using Ice Shard, and Choice Scarf Latias.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonite generally runs a maximum Attack / maximum Speed Adamant nature EV spread, as it needs all the Speed and power it can get. Don’t put the extra 4 EVs into HP, as Dragonite will take extra Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature is possible to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Heatran and Adamant Lucario at +1 while also outspeeding Choice Scarf Latias at +2, but the power loss is enormous, and Dragonite often can’t get to +2 anyway.</p> <p>Lum Berry is the preferred item, as it prevents status from ruining Dragonite’s sweep. A common way for defensive teams to stave it off is to send in physically defensive Jirachi on Outrage and then paralyze with Body Slam. Not only does Lum Berry prevent this, but even if Jirachi paralyzes it again, Dragonite’s Inner Focus ability prevents Iron Head flinching. Lum Berry also crucially alleviates one of the main downsides to Outrage by curing confusion, meaning it can lock into Outrage again unimpeded. Another option is to use Yache Berry to help survive Dragonite 4x weakness to Ice-type moves. As many Water-types, Zapdos, and Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-A, Lucario, some Tyranitar, and Jirachi try to revenge kill Dragonite with Ice-type moves, Yache Berry lets Dragonite survive and either set up again or unleash attacks. Should Dragonite lead, Focus Sash in another item to use, allowing Dragonite to live any hit and continue attacking.</p> <p>Life Orb is another great choice of item for Dragonite, as the extra power is very valuable, allowing it to bypass checks such as Bold Clefable and offensive Calm Mind Suicune with Outrage. Life Orb also makes using Extreme Speed over a coverage move more viable, as the extra damage is very important to KOing Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Latias while generally raising its utility. If Dragonite is used on more hyper offensive teams, Life Orb should be the item of choice for its destructive power. However, beware of the already huge weakness to residual damage.</p> <p>Dragonite can also use Haban Berry to survive various Outrage and Draco Meteor from Latias, Flygon, Kingdra, and opposing Dragonite. Dragonite can run a 196 Atk / 80 SpD / 232 Spe EV spread, which allows it to survive Choice Scarf Latias’s Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock and one round of sand damage while still outspeeding Modest Heatran unboosted. Should Dragonite want to live Modest Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor, it should run 108 Atk / 212 SpD / 192 Spe. However, beware of taking too much investment out of Dragonite’s Attack, as it won’t KO what it needs to.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How Dragonite is used depends on the opposing team. Against more defensive teams, Dragonite needs the additional power from Dragon Dance to break through soft checks like specially defensive Hippowdon, Milotic, and Bold Clefable with a boosted +1 Outrage. Many of these teams answer Dragonite by either baiting it into Outrage and then switching to a physically bulky Steel-type such as Jirachi or by using Skarmory to either phaze or use Counter against a boosted Dragonite. Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite rarely sweeps defensive teams on its own, but breaking open holes by weakening Skarmory or checks such as Hippowdon can open up for another teammate.</p> <p>Against more offensive teams, Dragonite sometimes struggles to find time to set up. However, Dragonite can open holes by sometimes just attacking; +0 Outrage is so strong that even somewhat bulky foes such as maximum HP Swampert struggle to take it. Dragonite despises residual damage from Stealth Rock and sand, so hitting the field early can be beneficial. However, Dragonite's bulk and Extreme Speed can let it trade or revenge kill foes late in the game. Dragonite's answers are often forced to either lock into exploitable moves, such as Flygon's Outrage, Latias's Draco Meteor, and Rotom-A's Hidden Power Ice, or be heavily weakened by Dragonite's attacks. Take advantage of this by setting up another sweeper on these attacks. Should Dragonite lead, even good setup opportunities such as Heatran can potentially have Focus Sash and OHKO Dragonite with Explosion, meaning just attacking is often better.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite is a staple of the hyper offense style, as little breaks open teams like Dragonite can. Dragonite loves to hit the field without Stealth Rock being up, so Taunt leads such as Azelf, Aerodactyl, and Skarmory are beneficial. Dragonite also appreciates other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Lucario. All of these synergistically sweep with Dragonite: Gyarados and Tyranitar appreciate Dragonite weakening or KOing bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, Skarmory, and Bronzong that can tank a hit and paralyze, phaze, or use Explosion on them. Metagross, Scizor, and Lucario all resist Dragonite's weaknesses, meaning they can get free setup on the Choice-locked attacks used to revenge kill Dragonite. Dragonite enjoys Magnezone's support to remove the Steel-types, especially Skarmory, that survive its Outrage. Other mainstays of Magnezone offense such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, and offensive Stealth Rock Bronzong are helpful. Dragonite also takes advantage of other ways to weaken levitating Steel-types, such as surprise Fire- and Electric-type moves from Tyranitar and Jirachi, Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Band from Bronzong and Metagross, and special moves from Pokemon like Swampert. Dragonite appreciates Pursuit support from Tyranitar and Swords Dance Scizor, as Latias and Rotom-A are prominent Choice Scarf users that revenge kill Dragonite.</p> <p>Dragonite does appreciate Rapid Spin support to remove Stealth Rock, but it is difficult to fit the pace of the team. Dragonite fits alongside other Dragon-types such as Latias, Kingdra, and Flygon in a DragMag style built on weakening Steel-types for powerful Dragon-type moves. Other mainstays of this style include Mamoswine, Lucario, and Gengar. Dragonite also fits well alongside dual screens, as it can set up multiple Dragon Dances and is impossible to wall. Other mainstays of this style such as Uxie, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, Machamp, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Jirachi are excellent teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragonite can take advantage of its physical prowess to lure physical walls in and hit them with devastating special moves. Dragonite's Draco Meteor is extremely strong, heavily damaging common switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Suicune, and Bold Clefable. Both Fire Blast and Flamethrower destroy the many Steel-types trying to absorb Dragonite's Dragon-type attacks, and the choice is a matter of accuracy and PP versus power. Flamethrower OHKOes physically defensive Skarmory and Scizor while at least 2HKOing every Steel-type in the tier except the bulkiest of Jirachi, Heatran, specially defensive Empoleon, and Heatproof Bronzong. Fire Blast additionally OHKOes bulkless Jirachi, Metagross after Stealth Rock, and has a 75% chance to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Superpower completes Dragonite's coverage and is a major advantage over other mixed Dragon-types such as Flygon and Kingdra. Dragonite is almost guaranteed to OHKO non-Bold Clefable with Superpower while also OHKOing Tyranitar, most Empoleon, and Heatran after Stealth Rock. It also gives Dragonite the ability to hit something hard even after Draco Meteor's stat drops. Extreme Speed maximizes Dragonite's utility against offensive teams, as an uninvested Life Orb Extreme Speed does significant damage to frail sweepers that don't resist it. Roost mitigates the residual damage of Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and sand to keep Dragonite healthy against defensive teams. The last choice is to focus on more destructive power with Outrage, limiting checks that can switch in to just Cresselia. Outrage means even common mixed Dragonite answers such as specially defensive Hippowdon and Gliscor can never switch into Draco Meteor because Outrage will KO them. Beware of the consequences of being locked into a slow Outrage, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonite should almost always run a Special Attack-boosting nature and 252 Special Attack EVs. Maximum Speed allows Dragonite to outspeed as much as it can and Speed tie with itself. 192 EVs with a neutral nature allows Dragonite to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar. However, Dragonite can also run a Speed-boosting nature, as it crucially allows it to outrun slower defensive Latias as well as Heatran, Gyarados, slower offensive Suicune, and Adamant Lucario. Dragonite can also run other Speed benchmarks, such as no Speed at all or 104 EVs to outspeed neutral nature Tyranitar. Dragonite can spare some Attack EVs to improve Superpower's damage to Clefable, Empoleon, and Heatran. 72 Attack EVs is needed to guarantee maximum HP Clefable. Other benchmarks include 140 Attack EVs to OHKO Blissey with Stealth Rock and one round of sand as well as 2HKOing specially defensive Hipppwdon with Outrage after Stealth Rock, or just maximum Attack to do as much damage as possible. Life Orb is generally the item of choice, as Dragonite needs all the power it can get. It also doesn't have a lot of survivability and is easily revenge killed, so maximizing the damage it can do is preferred. Dragonite can also run a Focus Sash in the lead position to guarantee a Draco Meteor and a follow-up.</p> <p>Dragonite shouldn't be lowering Attack, Special Attack, or Speed, so it either has to lower its Defense or Special Defense. Special Defense-lowering natures are generally better, as Dragonite can't survive most special Ice- and Dragon-type moves after Stealth Rock anyway. With its Defense intact, it can be serviceable against Breloom—notably, it avoids a 2HKO from Focus Punch. Dragonite can survive weaker Ice Beams from Swampert and Milotic without Stealth Rock with a Defense-hindering nature; however, since Dragonite is almost never at full health, this often is irrelevant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Dragonite generally operates with the element of surprise and hammers unsuspecting physical walls with special moves. As such, Fire Blast or Flamethrower is generally the safest move to use. Surprising physically defensive Skarmory or Jirachi can sometimes win the game immediately, and Draco Meteor targets such as Latias generally won't switch into Dragonite. It also keeps Dragonite's Special Attack intact. Dragonite generally should come in early before Stealth Rock is up. Dragonite often only gets a few moves to make an impact due to residual damage, so getting the most out of them requires exact play. Against more defensive teams, only a few Pokemon can avoid a 2HKO from it or outspeed it and OHKO. Should Dragonite have Roost, it can come in repeatedly on Pokemon such as defensive Breloom, Clefable, Starmie lacking Ice Beam, and Forretress and break up the opposing defensive core.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite generally belongs on more offensive teams looking to break defensive builds open and can prevent early Stealth Rock. For this reason, it doesn't really compete with other mixed attackers like Flygon. Dragonite appreciates anti-Stealth Rock leads that can give it a free switch and potentially status the foe. Aerodactyl, Thunder Wave Azelf, Choice Scarf or Focus Sash Breloom, and Gallade with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt can let Dragonite in for free and disable the foe. As some of these leads cannot set up Stealth Rock, Dragonite appreciates alternate setters such as Metagross, Heatran, and Camerupt. Metagross is especially synergetic, as Skarmory commonly switches into Metagross, which is a free switch in for Dragonite to rip open the opposing team. Beyond the lead game, mixed Dragonite appreciates partners that take advantage of the holes it breaks. Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Swords Dance Scizor, Swords Dance Lucario, and offensive Empoleon are excellent partners. Lucario is an especially good teammate, as Dragonite can lure in most Lucario walls and hammer them with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast. Another great partner for Dragonite is Tyranitar, as all sets benefit from Dragonite removing Hippowdon. Choice Scarf sets open up other sweepers and help against potential revenge killers such as Latias; Dragon Dance sets take advantage of the opening of defensive Ground-types; and utility sets get up Stealth Rock and absorb Dragonite's weaknesses. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit can also take advantage of defensive Latias trying to revenge kill Dragonite. Other Pokemon that can take advantage of breaking open walls are Trick Room Bronzong, Agility Metagross, and Machamp. On more balanced teams, Dragonite is commonly paired with ways to mitigate residual damage. As such, it can be found alongside Wish Jirachi and Rapid Spin Starmie. Dragonite is also commonly forced out after using Draco Meteor or Superpower, so Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Latias and Rotom-A are effective to help against set up. Steel-types in general help Dragonite, as they resist its weaknesses and give Dragonite an opportunity to come in.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Band, Dragonite hits hard immediately, as Outrage at least 2HKOes everything in the tier that doesn't resist it. Extreme Speed makes up Dragonite's other primary niche, as it 2HKOes most sweepers such as Gyarados, Kingdra, and even Lucario after a Defense drop with Stealth Rock, while Dragonite is bulky enough to survive most other priority such as Lucario's own +2 Extreme Speed and opposing Dragonite's boosted Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Dragonite's other moveslots help it handle Pokemon trying to absorb Outrage. Superpower is the best of these, as it has strong neutral coverage while slamming most Steel-types hard. It also OHKOes Clefable and Tyranitar without having to lock into Outrage. It provides another neutral option to hit Breloom should Dragonite absorb Spore. Beware that prominent Dragonite switch-ins such as Jirachi, Bronzong, and Skarmory may not be 2HKOed by Superpower, however. Fire Punch is Dragonite's best option against Skarmory and Bronzong, as it 2HKOes them while also hitting physically defensive Jirachi and Breloom hard. Earthquake is another option, as it will at least 2HKO every Steel-type in the game besides Bronzong and Skarmory. Dragonite's ability to switch into Breloom successfully with Sleep Talk makes it a solid check, as with Outrage, Extreme Speed, and Superpower or Fire Punch, all moves will do a lot of damage. Dragon Claw is an option alongside Outrage, as it still is very strong, 2HKOing Milotic and most Swampert after Stealth Rock. Waterfall is a nice midground for Tyranitar switch-ins and less bulky Steel-types such as Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonite should not deviate from a fast and strong spread of maximum Attack / maximum Speed with an Adamant nature. A Jolly nature is possible to outspeed defensive Latias, Adamant Lucario, and Heatran, but the power loss is enormous and especially hurts when using Extreme Speed or fighting offensive Suicune and physically defensive Hippowdon. As Dragonite only needs 192 EVs to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, it is possible to invest in arbitrary bulk numbers such as 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe. However, this often is not worth it, as Dragonite is easily revenge killed anyway and prefers to at least tie with itself and potentially outspeed slower Dragon Dance Gyarados and Breloom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How to use Dragonite depends on the opposing team. Against offensive foes, most of the opponent's team should be able to revenge kill Dragonite after it locks into Outrage. As such, hitting the field before Stealth Rock is up and using Dragon Claw or Superpower can scout out the opposing team so that Outrage's power is only used when needed. Dragonite's Extreme Speed is also an extremely valuable tool for revenge killing opposing sweepers, so keeping it alive until late in the game can be helpful. However, do not hesitate to switch Dragonite into Breloom's Spore early in the game should it have Sleep Talk, as even if Breloom avoids the attack with Substitute or Protect, Dragonite has accomplished its job of absorbing sleep. Dragonite can even fire off strong attacks in the lead position.</p> <p>Against defensive teams, scouting for opposing Skarmory and Jirachi that can absorb Outrage is crucial, as once these threats are weakened, Dragonite can freely fire off Outrage. The only common Pokemon that are faster than Dragonite and can KO on defensive teams are Latias, which cannot guarantee an OHKO on Dragonite after Stealth Rock without Ice Beam, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, faster Gliscor with Ice Fang, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A. As Dragonite is so weak to residual damage, Dragonite can also just use Outrage when it comes in to get the most out of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Dragonite generally features on more balanced teams that appreciate its wallbreaking ability, help against opposing hyper offense teams, and absorb sleep from Breloom. In return, they can mitigate the exploitable nature of its attacks, weakness to Stealth Rock, and lack of a defensive profile. One of the best partners to this Dragonite set is Magnezone, as it traps Dragon-resistant Pokemon, allowing Dragonite to use Outrage with impunity. This Dragonite is more likely to appear with other Dragon-types such as Latias, Flygon, and Kingdra, as with Magnezone and Dragonite, Steel-types and other bulky Pokemon that can survive their attacks like Water-types and Hippowdon will not survive. Other Pokemon that fit well alongside Magnezone offense work well too; however, because of this pair's defensive liability, they should be bulkier to handle many different Pokemon. Examples include Uxie, Jirachi, Swampert, and utility Tyranitar, while other more frail staples such as Gengar and offensive Metagross are harder to fit.</p> <p>Dragonite also appreciates Rapid Spin support, as it has no way to heal itself with this set and is weak to Stealth Rock. Starmie, Forretress, and Donphan work well for this purpose. Starmie especially works well, as Dragonite fits well in more offensive paralysis styles as a wallbreaker and sleep absorber. Example teammates with this pairing include Machamp, Jirachi, and Blissey. Blissey and Jirachi can even Wish pass to Dragonite. Other Blissey offense teammates such as Heatran, Skarmory, and Breloom fit well for this purpose, as they cover a lot of the metagame effectively in a few teamslots. Heatran also enjoys if Dragonite can remove offensive Water-types and Hippowdon with Outrage.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Dragonite's Dragon Dance sets are often crippled by status, this set mitigates this flaw while taking advantage of teams trying to defeat it with residual damage with Roost. As a bulky wincon, one advantage Dragonite has is the ability to boost its Speed. To prevent status moves, Dragonite can use either Heal Bell or Substitute. Heal Bell broadly helps the team more and cures Dragonite of its status ailments. However, Substitute blocks them in the first place. Substitute also has a lot more PP than Heal Bell should the foe repeatedly use status moves, such as Jirachi and RestTalk Rotom-A. Substitute also shields Dragonite from revenge killing, as a boosted Dragonite can OHKO all common Choice Scarf Pokemon besides Heatran and Lucario. Another option to block status is Safeguard, although Dragonite is easily forced out by revenge killers without enough Speed boosts, and it constantly needs to reapply Safeguard after five turns.</p> <p>With Roost and any of the status-abating moves, Dragonite can use many defensive Pokemon trying to stall it out as setup fodder, such as defensive Jirachi, RestTalk Rotom-A, Breloom, Clefable lacking Encore or Ice Beam, Starmie lacking Ice Beam, Blissey, and defensive Heatran. Roost also offsets residual damage such as Stealth Rock, sand, and Substitute. Dragon Claw is the attack of choice, as it has no immunities and can at least 2HKO everything at +6 besides physically bulky Steel-types like Jirachi and Skarmory. While Heal Bell can cure Outrage's confusion and it hits much harder, being locked into Outrage and the confusion is counterproductive to the set as well as opening it up to revenge killers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonite's EVs are a balance between what it wants to set up on and Speed. The EV spread listed focuses on special bulk while outspeeding up to maximum Speed Jirachi and Flygon after one Dragon Dance, slower Choice Scarf users such as Adamant Flygon and Rotom-A at +2, and everything after three Dragon Dances. The special bulk gives Dragonite the best chance to set up against defensive teams, as it avoids a 2HKO from every common special attack used on defensive teams and can Roost it off, including Clefable +0 Ice Beam, defensive Swampert's Ice Beam, and Latias's Ice Beam. The spread also avoids an OHKO from Choice Scarf Latias's Draco Meteor and every Ice Beam up to offensive Empoleon's, meaning Dragonite can Roost off the damage can stall out the attack. Dragonite can also run even more special bulk with a spread of 248 HP / 216 SpD / 44 Spe, as this spread means RestTalk Rotom-A Thunderbolt will never break a Substitute and can even survive Choice Specs Latias's Dragon Pulse in sand. However, the speed trade off means it only outpaces positive nature base 90 Speed foes such as Roserade and Lucario at +1, can't outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran at +2, and needs +4 to outspeed everything.</p> <p>Dragonite can also focus on Speed more with a Jolly nature, as a maximum HP Dragonite's Substitute is still bulky enough to not break to Jirachi's Body Slam, and Iron Head only has a 75% chance to do so. With a boosting nature and 176 EVs, Dragonite can outspeed the unboosted tier at +1 and everything at +2. This significantly cuts into its bulk and can't set up on as much, as Rotom-A's Thunderbolt will break the Substitute guaranteed. Only use this spread with Substitute, as Heal Bell and Safeguard need more bulk to function properly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Dragonite, even with bulk, Roost, and possibly Heal Bell, is very easy to wall before its counters have been removed because of its slow Speed even when boosted and reliance on one attack. As such, it generally only comes in at the end of the game to set up or if the team desperately needs Heal Bell. Other than this, how to play Dragonite depends on the opposing team.</p> <p>Against offensive teams, once Dragonite uses Dragon Dance, it generally won't be able to set up again. Should Dragonite be forced out, it loses a ton of momentum due to both its weakness to Stealth Rock and how many boosts it needs to outspeed common Choice Scarf users and break checks with Dragon Claw. As offensive teams generally don't require Heal Bell, try to keep Dragonite hidden as long as possible until it's favorable to sweep, as once its counters are removed, offensive teams struggle to do enough damage to stop a bulky, healing Dragonite from accumulating boosts.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, it is more forgiving should Dragonite be forced out. These teams generally do not apply so much pressure that Dragonite can't heal up as well as generally only have one Pokemon that outspeeds +1 Dragonite. As such, Dragonite can heal status more easily and set up on bulky walls. Be careful to remove bulky phazers such as Skarmory, as Dragonite will not sweep without being at +6 unless it is the last Pokemon. With Heal Bell, Dragonite can be stalled out of PP against bulky Steel-type status users such as Jirachi, so be make sure to KO these.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite needs a vast support structure and the entire team built around it to sweep. First, Magnezone support is mandatory, because Steel-types will wall Dragonite unless it gets many boosts. Multiple Magnezone sets can work, as Choice Scarf Magnezone can remove Skarmory, paralyze defensive Jirachi and remove offensive sets, Empoleon, and Scizor, and also check Lucario and Gengar. Magnet Rise Magnezone can also eliminate Metagross and Bronzong that can remove Dragonite with Explosion. Choice Scarf Magneton can also remove Skarmory and help against neutral nature Dragon Dance sweepers like opposing Dragonite and Gyarados. As Dragonite struggles in general against offensive teams, strong walls that work alongside Magnezone such as Clefable, Zapdos, Uxie, Latias, Skarmory, and even Quagsire are effective. These also have redundant Pokemon they wall with Dragonite, meaning it can come in only when it is ready to sweep. In addition, Dragonite appreciates Rapid Spin support due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and the general passivity of the team surrounding it. Starmie, Forretress, Donphan, and Tentacruel are good choices here. Entry hazards in general are also effective, meaning Skarmory, Roserade, Tentacruel, and Forretress can help weaken the opposing walls.</p> <p>Dragonite, especially Substitute variants, appreciates weather clearing for general longevity. Rain Dance Bronzong, Cresselia, Uxie, Azelf, and Latias are effective. Another way to give Dragonite the support it needs is to use it in rain teams. These teams provide the infrastructure needed to sweep, such as Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, and Bronzong providing weather clearing. Weather sweepers such as Qwilfish, Ludicolo, and Kingdra can hammer Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow that answer Dragonite. Choice Specs Kingdra especially is helpful, as it is fantastic in rain against offensive teams and weakens Steel-types with powerful Water-type attacks. Qwilfish can use Explosion, set Toxic Spikes, and hit physical walls hard, while Ludicolo resets rain effectively and hurts offensive teams. Magnezone support, while uncommon on rain teams, is still necessary, and other rain support such as Rotom-A, Latias, Suicune, Heatran, and even Tyranitar are quite effective alongside Dragonite.</p>"

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat’s great Speed, access to Taunt, and good defensive typing make it a solid lead and threat to passive, bulkier Pokemon. With Taunt and Crobat's base 130 Speed, it can outspeed most common leads to prevent Stealth Rock, most notably Azelf and tying with Aerodactyl. Against more threatening leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, and Machamp, Crobat can U-turn out to break Focus Sash and switch into a more favorable Pokemon. Crobat’s defensive profile is also nothing to scoff at, as with Roost and its resistances, it can be a threat to slower teams. From here, it can slowly wear down foes such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Skarmory while healing off their attacks.</p> <p>However, Crobat is mainly held back by its mediocre stats besides Speed, its weakness to Stealth Rock, and its inability to deal with common Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Jirachi. Due to these mediocre stats, Crobat struggles to deal damage to anything that can shrug off Brave Bird and can hit it hard back. Additionally, Crobat is not very bulky even with investment and relies on its Speed and recovery to handle defensive Pokemon; it crumbles to strong neutral attacks such as Heatran's Fire Blast, Tyranitar's Crunch, and Gyarados's Waterfall. This vulnerability is made worse by its weakness to Stealth Rock—while it can be an excellent scout with U-turn and its Speed, it struggles to do so repeatedly with Stealth Rock up. While Crobat's typing makes it an excellent check to Breloom, it also gives it major issues dealing with common Pokemon on defensive teams such as Rotom-A and Zapdos. Both easily at least 2HKO Crobat with Thunderbolt and Crobat can't damage them effectively. While Crobat is immune to flinching from Jirachi's Iron Head, it cannot stop Jirachi from ruining it with paralysis from Body Slam. These vulnerabilities mean it is largely outclassed by Gliscor, who is slower but has much greater bulk, more versatility, and a better defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crobat has a few options not particularly effective in DPP OU. Crobat can use a Choice Band set to take advantage of Brave Bird, fast Speed, and stronger U-turn, but still is not very strong and struggles greatly with Stealth Rock. Crobat also can run Sleep Talk to further its ability to counter Breloom. However, the move doesn’t have much utility outside of that. Crobat can also use a fully special set built around Nasty Plot and its coverage options like Heat Wave, but its awful base 70 Special Attack and the terrible coverage of Sludge Bomb make this difficult. Crobat also can put something to sleep with Hypnosis, but the accuracy makes this more difficult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rotom-A</strong>: Rotom-A is the biggest annoyance to a Crobat, no matter what set it uses. It resists both Brave Bird and U-turn, is immune to Super Fang, and can potentially OHKO Crobat after Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric types in general are a huge issue for Crobat. Zapdos, Magnezone, and even Jolteon easily stomach Brave Bird and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Jolteon even commonly outspeeds it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Crobat is deathly afraid of status. While it is immune to poison, a burn greatly reduces its longevity and hampers Brave Bird, while paralysis ruins its main asset: its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel types resist all of Crobat’s attacking moves whilst generally being able to 2HKO back or threaten it with status. Heatran, Jirachi, Metagross, Scizor, and Empoleon all heavily threaten Scizor while it can do little back besides Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Crobat generally folds to very strong attacks, such as Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor, Dragonite's Outrage, Heatran's Fire-type attacks, and Kingdra's rain boosted Hydro Pump. Generally, if a move hits super effectively, such as Machamp's Stone Edge or Jirachi's Psychic, Crobat won't last very long.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Crobat is weak to Stealth Rock and is vulnerable to sand. This cuts into its already mediocre bulk and makes it hard to repeatedly come in and pivot or use Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crobat's niche is primarily as a stallbreaker, as with Taunt, recovery in Roost, and its Toxic immunity, it can survive a long time against weaker attacks. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Clefable, and Skarmory from statusing Crobat or healing. Should Crobat lead, it also stops Azelf and Hippowdon from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Brave Bird is Crobat’s primary tool for dealing damage. Its high base power somewhat makes up for Crobat's lack of Attack, and it chips bulkier Pokemon that do not resist it such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Flygon well. U-turn lets Crobat act as a pivot, letting teammates come in on its checks and chipping threats such as Tyranitar and Jirachi. Super Fang can also be used as an alternative to U-turn, as it allows Crobat to deal more reliable damage on bulky foes that resist Brave Bird, such as Zapdos, Metagross, and Heatran. However, this comes at the expense of Crobat’s pivoting capabilities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 144 Speed EVs puts Crobat at 365 speed, enough to outspeed +1 Tyranitar and maximum Speed Azelf and Starmie. The remaining EVs are placed in maximum HP and additional physical bulk. Crobat does not gain much out of extra Speed, as it will only Speed tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon while outspeeding +1 Gyarados and Dragonite at maximum Speed—Pokemon Crobat cannot deal with effectively. 116 Defense EVs allow it to better deal with Fighting-types such as Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario. It specifically survives Lucario's +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crobat should generally lead or come in the game early before Stealth Rock is up to threaten Taunt or pivot around with U-turn. Be wary of stronger offensive threats such as Heatran or Zapdos coming in, however, as Crobat cannot deal with them and is forced out immediately. While Crobat is relatively difficult to OHKO, it should be healing relatively often, as it can be overwhelmed rather easily. However, using Roost can open it up to Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Flygon easily 2HKOing it with Earthquake. Also, be weary of Pursuit users when using U-turn: the damage can add up overtime, especially if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crobat generally enjoys teammates who can take advantage of its hard answers either through Pursuit or strong attacks. It additionally loves Rapid Spin support to remove Stealth Rock. Choice Band Tyranitar makes a great partner, as it can guarantee a kill on Choice Scarf Rotom-A with Pursuit and do significant damage to many of Crobat’s other checks, such as Zapdos and Heatran. In return, Crobat can easily handle Fighting-types that threaten Tyranitar, such as Breloom and Lucario. Rapid Spinning greatly helps Crobat, as taking 25% of health adds up in the long term. Starmie and Forretress are excellent choices. Forretress as well as Skarmory can set up Spikes, as Crobat can force a lot of switches with Taunt and U-turn. Crobat also enjoys Knock Off support, especially on Steel-types such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Skarmory so it can damage them with Brave Bird and Super Fang. Clefable is an excellent choice and can take on Zapdos and Rotom-A. Other strong defensive teammates such as Jirachi, Latias, and Hippowdon appreciate Crobat's ability against more defensive teams and can take on Pokemon it does not enjoy dealing with.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>While Quagsire may be adorable, it is also rather forgettable due to its low base stat total and inferiority to other bulky Water-types, most notably Swampert. Although admittedly flawed, Quagsire does sport access to Recover, Water Absorb, and Encore to differentiate itself from the oversized mudpuppy. These traits allow it to be one of the few hard counters to all variants of Starmie (which is no easy feat) while still faring decently well against Pokemon such as Metagross and Tyranitar. All in all, Quagsire's extremely niche options can allow it to function in standard; just make sure that what it's doing can't be done better by other Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quagsire has no other set that wouldn't have it outclassed by Swampert or some other bulky Water-type, but in the last slot of its only set, there are some possibilities. Yawn, Haze, and Stone Edge are decent alternatives; the former two help against set-up sweepers (and general phazing too with respect to the first), while Stone Edge gets great coverage with Earthquake, nabbing super effective hits on many important Flying-types. STAB Waterfall can also be used as a secondary STAB move with decent coverage. Finally, Body Slam has a nifty 30% paralysis rate that can also be useful for Quagsire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taking advantage of Quagsire's lack of power is often a great way to deal with it. Since it loses much of its presence once its support moves are taken out of the equation, Taunt users such as Azelf and Aerodactyl make good checks. Substitute users such as Gengar and Rotom-A will also cause trouble if they're immune or resistant to Earthquake, for mostly the same reasons. Quagsire will also find it extremely difficult to do anything substantial to most defensive Spikes users, so a Pokemon like Skarmory or Forretress can usually unload themselves on Quagsire with impunity. Obviously, Grass-types such as Shaymin, Celebi, Breloom, and Roserade counter Quagsire with their massive type advantage. Burning or poisoning Quagsire will cut its longevity greatly, as it simply cannot take a negative Leftovers recovery on top of its mediocre defenses. The additional effects of burn and poison will also help when Quagsire has to use its attacks or is trying to Toxic stall itself, respectively. Do be wary of the stray Yawn when switching in your counter though, and make sure not to try to set up on Quagsire unless you're sure it's not going to Encore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Quagsire's stats are admittedly below average, but its access to Encore, Recover, and Water Absorb, in addition to its relatively rare Ground sub-typing, give it some decent perks over other bulky Water-types. For what it's worth, Quagsire is one of the few hard counters to Life Orb Starmie; it is immune to both Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt, while Ice Beam can't even muster a 3HKO factoring in Leftovers. Quagsire also fares quite well against physical threats such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and Gyarados, as well as several Water- and Electric-type attackers that lack a Grass-type move to deal with it.</p> <p>Earthquake is a great STAB move which helps make up for Quagsire's rather disappointing Attack stat, garnering super effective hits on various important threats, including the aforementioned Metagross and Tyranitar. Recover and Encore are what set Quagsire apart from most other Water-types, allowing Quagsire a reliable instant recovery move with decent PP and a particularly creative method to force switches, respectively. Toxic is used in the final slot for when Earthquake just doesn't cut it, allowing Quagsire to Toxic stall with Recover like Gliscor does with Roost. On the other hand, Ice Punch gets almost perfect coverage with Earthquake and allows Quagsire to check Flygon and Dragonite with greater ease.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Quagsire's effective bulk, and is largely geared towards Special Defense since many of the Pokemon Quagsire can check are specially based, such as Starmie. Enough is invested into Special Defense that Life Orb Starmie's Ice Beam never 3HKOes Quagsire, while the hint in Defense helps cushion against physical attackers such as Metagross and Flygon. A physically geared EV spread is viable, but it leaves Quagsire largely outclassed by Swampert.</p> <p>As a bulky Water-type, Quagsire works excellently alongside Grass- and Fire-types as part of a team core. Roserade, in particular, works marvelously for its ability to absorb any stray Toxic Spikes, which absolutely cripple Quagsire, and set up Spikes, which will undoubtedly get their money's worth thanks to Quagsire's ability to force switches with Encore. Similarly, other entry hazard supporters, such as Skarmory and Forretress, also work well with Quagsire, both being x4 resistant to its Grass-type weakness, while it in return is at least resistant to all of their weaknesses. Forretress is also able to Rapid Spin away entry hazards, which is great since Quagsire can find itself Spikes fodder quite easily. Mixed Infernape can be used as the Fire-type in the core that serves as a pivot to break through the bulkier Pokemon that give Quagsire problems. Quagsire's Encore also makes it considerably easier for Infernape to switch in and wreak havoc. Pokemon with a similar lack of resistances or bulk will also appreciate Quagsire's Encore.</p>"

  "Umbreon": {
    "overview": "<p>Umbreon boasts some of the best defensive stats of all Pokemon in the OU tier. Access to various types of support moves allows it to fit a niche role in a team—Mean Look to guarantee a free entry against an opposing Pokemon of your choice, Wish to heal its teammates, Heal Bell to remove status, Taunt to shut down opposing support Pokemon, and stat-dropping moves such as Fake Tears, Screech, and Charm to force switches. Its ability, Synchronize, also allows it to inflict a status ailment like burn, paralysis, poison, or badly poisoned that occurs due to a primary or secondary effect of a move. It is one of the few Pokemon that can use Wish + Protect + Pursuit in one set in order to be able to take out Psychic- and Ghost-types a lot more reliably, with Choice Scarf Tyranitar being the other Pokemon that is commonly used to to take out Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> <p>However, despite all of the support Umbreon can offer, it hardly ever sees any usage in OU. The reasons for this include Umbreon's passivity, since it has only base 65 Attack and an even lower base 60 Special Attack. Umbreon is also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards; as well as prevalent sand, which not only inflicts chip damage but most importantly also halves the amount that Umbreon can heal through its only instant-healing move, Moonlight. Tyranitar, which also is one of the more common Pokemon to set sand, also gives Umbreon a lot of competition as one of the better Dark-types in the tier. Umbreon also used to see some usage when Baton Pass was around in DPP, but the move's ban explains Umbreon's lesser usage as well. All of this suggests to players that there may be better defensive options for them to run over Umbreon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Umbreon can also run Heal Bell + Pursuit alongside Wish + Protect, helping it deal with various variants of Gengar. Will-O-Wisp Gengar gets punished because of Umbreon's ability, Synchronize, if it uses the move, and the combination of Heal Bell and Pursuit allows Umbreon to remove that status and trap Gengar. Umbreon can also use Pursuit to trap Starmie and Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Latias. It has to be careful when those Pokemon use their powerful STAB moves because it could put Umbreon in a range where it may need to use Wish to heal, thereby forcing a mind game between using Wish on the Starmie or Latias potentially staying in or Pursuit on those two switching out. Instead of using Wish + Protect on the Curse set, one could opt for the combination of Rest + Sleep Talk to negate the need for a Heal Bell user, as Rest already allows it to eliminate status ailments such as burn, paralysis, and poison; however, a Heal Bell user could still be helpful with allowing Umbreon to wake up immediately or curing it of freeze.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Almost every Steel-type, like Skarmory, Jirachi, Lucario, Scizor, or Heatran, can come in and punish Umbreon. Skarmory can assuredly set an entry hazard and inflict Taunt on Umbreon before it can use Taunt back because of its higher Speed. Jirachi can inflict Toxic on Umbreon or possibly set up on if running a bulky Calm Mind set. Scizor and Lucario usually get a free Swords Dance, which can make them threatening. Heatran has access to burn-inducing moves like Will-O-Wisp and Lava Plume, can cripple Umbreon with Toxic, shut it down with Taunt, take it down with Explosion, or even use Metal Sound to cause Special Defense drops so that it can beat Umbreon with a Fire-type move such as Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Machamp, Heracross, and Infernape threaten Umbreon with their powerful physical Fighting-type moves. They may need to be careful of Umbreon carrying Toxic, though. One of the best Fighting-type switch-ins to Umbreon would be a Poison Heal Breloom. Breloom can come in freely on Umbreon, and it behind a Substitute is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users like Gliscor can stop Umbreon if sand is up, as it negates Umbreon's Leftovers recovery and Umbreon's low damage output, by blocking its recovery with Taunt and using Earthquake to defeat it. A Gliscor with Knock Off will help it even further in beating Umbreon, as it will remove Umbreon's Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Milotic can negate Umbreon's Curse boosts. Hippowdon and Skarmory can remove it from the field with Whirlwind, whereas Milotic can use Haze to clear any state changes. Umbreon's low base Attack will not be enough to threaten these Pokemon when they try to negate its stat boosts.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Status Users</strong>: Pokemon like Latias and Rotom, which are among the few that Umbreon can switch into and set up on, can possibly defeat all variants of Umbreon by using Trick on it or defeat Curse Umbreon with status moves like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is capable of enhancing Umbreon's strengths and weaknesses while also giving it more longevity. Curse boosts the power of Payback, which allows Umbreon to hit the foe with a move that has an effective Base Power of 150, since Umbreon generally tends to move last because of its low Speed, which Curse lowers even further. Curse also helps Umbreon boost its physical bulk, which is what most Pokemon will try to target, since physical moves such as Superpower and Close Combat are what usually can OHKO Umbreon. Wish + Protect helps Umbreon heal while also being able to heal up its teammates or scout for a set on an opposing Pokemon. A lot of bulky offense teams will also rely on Explosion to stop a Curse Umbreon, and Protect can be helpful in such a situation.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers helps keep Umbreon healthy and negate sand damage. A Careful nature with maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Umbreon to not worry about special attackers; very few Pokemon are capable of threatening Umbreon with a special move, and one of that would be, Focus Blast Gengar, can be OHKOed with Payback. Pokemon such as Infernape and Lucario can also carry Focus Blast, but they more commonly run the physical counterpart, Close Combat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is possible for Umbreon to set up versus special attackers like Starmie and non Will-O-Wisp-Rotom or against a Tyranitar that is Choice-locked into a move like Crunch or Pursuit. If the opponent uses a move that causes limited damage to Umbreon, like Crunch or Pursuit, the best option would be to set up with Curse at that point. However, if it is a move that is capable of inflicting 30% or higher damage, it would be better to use Wish. The goal is to keep setting up while using Wish to heal Umbreon from any damage it takes and then potentially sweep an opposing team. Umbreon can also use Latias as a Pokemon to set up on, but it needs to be wary of Toxic or Trick. It is important that if the opponent runs a Skarmory or another Steel-type, you need to take it out before you reveal that your Umbreon is running the Curse set, as that would cue to your opponent to try to preserve their Steel-types longer than they should.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types are what heavily punish Umbreon, as they will always be able to safely switch into it as Umbreon is passive and cannot affect them due to Umbreon being passive and unable to affect them with a status move like Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp. Magnezone aids Umbreon in this regard by trapping Skarmory and Scizor, as well as Lucario if Lucario is running a physical set and Magnezone is using Choice Scarf. Umbreon could pair itself with a Heal Bell or Aromatherapy user in order to remove a status like burn or poison, which will prevent it from potentially sweeping by reducing its damage output or gradually causing it to faint. Other Pokemon that can safely switch into Umbreon would be Breloom and Leftovers Heatran. The former can threaten it with Spore or a combination of Substitute + Focus punch, so having a Pokemon to absorb the Spore and the hit would be nice. Zapdos, Latias, and Celebi are among a few that can take on Breloom, but make sure that they don't take the Spore. By looking at what all Pokemon your opponent has revealed and by predicting what the unrevealed Pokemon, if any, of your opponent would be, you can determine what Pokemon in your team would have the least impact against the opposing team and let that Pokemon absorb the Spore. Heatran can be handled by Milotic and Clefable. Clefable especially is a good option to handle the Leftovers variant with Knock Off, limiting the number of times Heatran can come onto the field. Since physical Fighting-types are quite common in the tier, Umbreon with teammates to take on such users is helpful. Bold Rotom and Jolly Gliscor can take on Lucario, but they still would need to worry about Lucario running Crunch or Shuca Berry with Ice Punch, respectively. Latias can handle Infernape. Nidoqueen is especially a nice option, as it helps absorb Toxic Spikes on the field.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress's access to Rapid Spin and all three entry hazards allow it to provide unmatched team support. Reliable Rapid Spinners are rare in DPP OU, and Forretress is one of the best at it. It takes advantage of defensive teams commonly using choiced Tyranitar to prevent Rapid Spin via Pursuit trapping. Forretress also can fight back against Ghost-type spinblockers such as Gengar and Rotom-A with Payback, as it will 2HKO Gengar and 3HKO defensive Rotom-A after Stealth Rock in sand. With its stellar typing and bulk, Forretress is generally able to set up at least a layer of either Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Forretress with Rest or Wish support is notably a good answer to defensive teams without a spinblocker. Defensive Pokemon often deal with Forretress with status, Knock Off, and entry hazard damage, allowing Forretress to set up entry hazards of its own and Rapid Spin easily. Forretress can run both specially defensive and physically defensive sets: specially defensive sets can set up entry hazards on more Pokemon and notably can survive Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire. Physically defensive sets take less damage from foes trying to wear down Forretress with physical moves, such as Skarmory using Brave Bird and Metagross using Earthquake.</p> <p>Forretress has noticeable flaws that mostly limit it to use on defensive teams. Forretress struggles to fit Explosion and cannot phaze, meaning it is setup fodder for the majority of the tier. Forretress's Fire weakness is easily exploitable by offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragonite, mixed Flygon, and Jirachi. Since Forretress needs to set up entry hazards and Rapid Spin away entry hazards, it can struggle with trying to do too much, since if it needs to come in multiple times and use Rapid Spin. Especially if it lacks Rest, it is deathly afraid of Knock Off and status, because it is slow and will get worn down quickly. Forretress also is trapped by Magnezone and typically cannot fit Earthquake to fight back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Forretress has many other options to include into its other two moveslots besides Spikes and Rapid Spin. Forretress can fit Stealth Rock onto either of these sets, but typically doesn't have the room for it. Another form of recovery Forretress has is Pain Split, but it isnt reliable enough to use consistently. Forretress has Zap Cannon and Counter to help dissuade set up too. Zap Cannon 2HKO Gyarados and physically defensive Skarmory while ruining Gengar with paralysis. Watch out for its low accuracy, however. Counter can KO opponents trying to break through with physical attacks, but physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite commonly use Fire Punch that OHKOes Forretress at +1 anyway. Revenge is another attack that takes advantage of Forretress's low Speed, providing coverage against Lucario, Tyranitar, and, to an extent, Magnet Rise Magnezone. Forretress can also use Light Screen to better protect itself against special attacks. Other options such as Power Trip to give itself a strong Payback or Explosion, Refresh to heal itself of status, and Sleep Talk alongside Rest are possible, but generally are not worth the moveslot. Forretress has some variablility in items. Forretress can use a Macho Brace to power up Gyro Ball. It notably OHKOes Gengar and Dragon Dance Tyranitar at +1 after Stealth Rock. Occa Berry allows Forretress to live weaker Fire-type hits more comfortably, such as Rotom-A's Overheat, mixed Flygon's Fire Blast, Tyranitar's +1 Fire Punch, and Latias and Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire. It generally is not worth losing Leftovers, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Infernape easily OHKO Forretress and only have to worry about the uncommon Earthquake or Explosion in Infernape's case.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Magnezone traps Forretress and removes it with either Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt while most Forretress can only set up entry hazards or Rapid Spin in return. Choice Scarf Magneton almost never carries Hidden Power Fire but threatens Forretress the same. Both need to watch out for Earthquake, as it will OHKO them after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Surprise Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Forretress is generally at least 2HKOed by any Fire-type attack. As such, Forretress is typically threatened out by anything that could potentially have one, such as Jirachi, Flygon, Dragonite, Tyranitar, Roserade, and Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage</strong>: Forretress has no reliable recovery and is grounded, meaning it can easily get worn down over the course of the match as entry hazard damage adds up. Various other ways to wear down Forretress, such as with status, Knock Off removing Leftovers, and weak attacks can leave Forretress too low on HP to do its job, especially without Wish support or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Set-up Threats</strong>: Even with various coverage and Explosion, Forretress is not able to mitigate set-up against the majority of the tier. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados can set up with impunity on most Forretress; Substitute attackers such as Breloom, Heatran, Empoleon, Machamp, and Jirachi freely generate momentum; Swords Dance Lucario, Scizor, and Gliscor threaten to sweep the whole team; and Calm Mind attackers such as Suicune, Clefable, Latias, and Jirachi boost easily. Some of these can be threatened by Explosion and coverage, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Rotom-A block Rapid Spin and can be annoying to deal with. Gengar 2HKOes with Focus Blast Forretress should it have a Life Orb and can OHKO with the rare Hidden Power Fire, while Rotom-A roasts Forretress with Overheat. Both can burn Forretress with Will-O-Wisp to make its Payback very weak. However, both do not enjoy switching into Payback.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Forretress, especially on the special side, is not very bulky. Strong attacks, such as Starmie's Hydro Pump, Breloom's Focus Punch, Machamp's Dynamic Punch, and Kingdra's Rain boosted Hydro Pump, can easily at least 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Forretress often does not carry many attacking moves and is forced to do nothing under the effects of Taunt. Azelf and Aerodactyl are especially effective early in the game to prevent entry hazards, while Gengar can Taunt a burned Forretress or one that does not have Payback. Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados, while rare, decimates Forretress without Explosion. Azelf and Aerodactyl often cannot stop Forretress from spinning away Stealth Rock, however.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Forretress can leverage its naturally high Defense stat to fully invest in Special Defense. This notably gives it several advantages: Forretress can survive strong special attacks such as Latias and Dragonite's Draco Meteor as well as Gengar's Focus Blast while still retaining enough physical bulk to switch into and set up on threats whose attacks it resists, such as Metagross, Scizor, and Jirachi without Fire Punch. It also survives Timid Magnezone's Hidden Power Fire with certainty while Thunderbolt is an unlikely 2HKO. This mixed bulk affords it to set up entry hazards or use Rapid Spin. Forretress often needs to pick between setting up Spikes or Toxic Spikes—Spikes are often more valuable due to hitting more Pokemon, but Toxic Spikes are uniquely useful for wearing down Tyranitar, Blissey, Hippowdon, and other common defensive Pokemon. Rapid Spin is of critical importance to Forretress, as it is one of few viable users of the move. Forretress's typing, bulk, and ability to set up entry hazards often provides opportunities to use Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Payback is Forretress's primary offensive option and facilitates it using Rapid Spin. One huge advantage to special bulk is it allows Forretress to use Rapid Spin against defensive Rotom-A, as it only scores a 4HKO with Thunderbolt in sand. Payback allows Forretress to pressure Rotom-A and Gengar, making it more difficult to block Rapid Spin. Forretress must beware of Hidden Power Fire and Overheat while additionally does not enjoy being burnt by Will-O-Wisp without cleric support, however. With Pursuit support, Forretress can also drop Payback for the more generally threatening Toxic. Toxic allows Forretress to fight back against set up threats that can't mitigate status well, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados. It can still pressure offensive Rotom-A with Toxic. Protect allows Forretress to recover through Iron Head Jirachi with Leftovers while also scouting attacks. It also helps Forretress to more easily passively recover health if it is phazed in unexpectedly. However, with cleric support, Rest is another option to both fully heal Forretress and remove status. Forretress can drop Protect or Rest for a variety of other moves, such as Explosion, Stealth Rock, running both Toxic Spikes and Spikes, Gyro Ball, and Earthquake. However, Forretress often sorely misses recovery due to being grounded and tasked with removing entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>To get the benefits of a specially defensive spread, Forretress should run maximum HP and Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature. Forretress can run an Impish nature with maximum special bulk to try to better take on physical threats, but this often leaves Forretress struggling to take on weaker special attackers such as Rotom-A and not bulky enough to repeatedly set-up on Skarmory with Brave Bird and Swampert. Forretress can run Shed Shell, but it typically can survive one Magnezone attack anyway and sorely misses Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Forretress must be played carefully, as it is a grounded Rapid Spinner without reliable recovery and setup fodder for a lot of the offensive threats of the tier. Forretress should generally prioritize getting at least one layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes down to facilitate wearing the foe down unless the team desperately needs it to Rapid Spin. Forretress struggles to switch in repeatedly to remove entry hazards and should be used cautiously. Switching in on Spikes and Stealth alone can result in Forretress losing up to 50% of its health over the course of a few turns, which is not easily recovered back with Leftovers alone. Leverage the threat of Rapid Spin to set up entry hazards; Forretress is at its best when the threat of it Rapid Spinning away entry hazards is too great not to reflexively switch to a spinblocker. Keep Forretress away from Knock Off especially if it does not have Rest, as it will get worn down very easily from entry hazards and weak attacks.</p> <p>Forretress should use Rest sparingly against more offensive teams, as it becomes even more of a sitting duck when it is asleep. Protect can similarly be taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress should be used in the context of a stall team, as it provides entry hazards effectively and needs good defensive partners to take on the threats it lets in. Some of Forretress's best teammates are strong defensive Flying-types such as RestTalk Gyarados and physically defensive Zapdos. Both are fantastic walls, but are held back by their Stealth Rock weakness. Gyarados is especially helpful in taking on hyper offensive teams, as once Forretress gets rid of Stealth Rock, it can just phaze out threats such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Tyranitar lacking Stone Edge with its bulk and Intimidate. Forretress also appreciates sand to help wear down Ghost-types. Both Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are effective, sometimes even both on the same team. Hippowdon appreciates Rapid Spin, sets up Stealth Rock, and is very bulky. Choice Scarf Tyranitar traps Ghost-types and Starmie, provides speed control, and can also set up Stealth Rock. Forretress appreciates strong special walls: Clefable is the standard, as it has Encore to help stop special set-up sweepers, can spread Knock Off to wear foes down, and answers many threats well. It also can provide Heal Bell support to facilitate Rest. Blissey similarly can help wall special threats, but isn't immune to entry hazards like Clefable is. Latias has fantastic type synergy with Forretress as they resists each others weakness and Latias can use Roar to prevent set-up from Substitute special attackers such as Suicune and Jirachi. Latias can even go on the offensive with a Calm Mind + Hidden Power Fire set. Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune also appreciates Rapid Spin support, provides a strong answer to Water- and Fire-types, and is a strong win condition. Celebi also performs similarly as a strong wall that likes Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Forretress also appreciates defensive redundancy, as it doesn't enjoy being the only switch-in to Dragon-types on the team. Defensive Jirachi is an excellent choice, as it also provides Wish support and sponges both physical and special Dragon-type attacks. Cresselia absorbs mixed Flygon especially well and can even use Lunar Dance to heal Forretress back up. Swampert also can withstand Dragon-type attacks and set up Stealth Rock. Forretress also appreciates Heatran's type synergy and facilitates its defensive and Torment sets with entry hazards. Heatran also helps to prevent opposing Forretress and Skarmory from setting up Spikes. Rotom-A can block Rapid Spin from Starmie and opposing Forretress while also helping Forretress out against physical Substitute users such as Breloom, Machamp, and Jirachi.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Physically defensive Forretress takes advantage of the more common specially defensive set to surprise the opponent. This Forretress is much more difficult to wear down by repeatedly bashing it with physical moves. Once Forretress switches in something it can set up on such as Hippowdon, physical Swampert, Metagross, Bronzong, or Skarmory, they might just attack Forretress to wear it down. These weak attacks do much less damage and Forretress can come back in later in the game to more easily set up entry hazards and use Rapid Spin. Spikes and Rapid Spin make up the core of this set, although Forretress can also use Toxic Spikes if they are more needed. Beware that DPP OU is much more resilient to Toxic Spikes than Spikes, however.</p> <p>Forretress can more easily afford to use offensive moves with this set, as it abandons trying to survive strong special hits and uses Forretress's good movepool to take advantage of the opponent. Payback again features to hit Ghost-types on the switch as Forretress is no longer bulky enough to take their attacks effectively, but another option is Gyro Ball. Forretress is very slow, and pressures faster threats such as Gengar with a 2HKO. However, another advantage is to unsuspectingly hit Dragon Dance sweepers hard, as Tyranitar and Dragonite do not enjoy it and Forretress is bulky enough to beat Gyarados trying to set up on it after Stealth Rock. Earthquake hits Magnezone and Heatran very hard, OHKOing bulkless sets after Stealth Rock. It also helps to pressure Infernape, Metagross, Lucario, and Calm Mind Jirachi trying to set up Forretress. However, another option is Explosion. Explosion makes Forretress much more threatening and denies set up opportunities altogether to foes who do not resist it. It also surprises defensive Pokemon who normally set up on Forretress easily, such as Calm Mind Suicune, Clefable, and Latias. Forretress can also drop an attacking move to run both entry hazards or even Stealth Rock to get entry hazards up quickly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Forretress needs maximum HP and an Impish nature to take on physical attacks well. Forretress should use a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs if it uses Gyro Ball. Should it use Earthquake, it needs 112 EVs to OHKO bulkless Heatran and Magnezone after Stealth Rock. The rest can be put into Defense. Forretress can run a fully physically defensive spread if these benchmarks aren't needed. Forretress can use spare some EVs into its Special Defense, as the stat is quite low, but needs full investment before it can take special hits reliably. Forretress generally should be using Leftovers to help mitigate residual damage, as it typically will not have Protect or Rest with this set. However, since it has no Magnezone protection outside of hitting it on the switch with Earthquake, Shed Shell is an option to escape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While it has more options to defend itself, Forretress should still be played carefully, as most strong special attacks will at least 2HKO it. Keep Forretress away from Ghost-types once they come in even with Payback. Forretress should generally come in early into the game to set up entry hazards and then only sparingly to Rapid Spin afterwards due to easily getting worn down and its relative passivity. Hitting threats on the switch is especially important with this Forretress, as Earthquake is often unexpected and can surprise Magnezone and Heatran. Leverage Forretress's increased physical bulk to come into threats that can't hurt it effectively, like Metagross, Choiced Tyranitar, and Skarmory to set up entry hazards and Rapid Spin away the opponent's entry hazards. Especially against offensive teams that can't get rid of Forretress's entry hazards, Forretress is more free to sacrifice itself to stop an opposing sweep with Explosion or pull off a crucial Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Forretress appreciates defensive teammates, physically defensive Forretress can find itself on more offensive teams due to providing strong Rapid Spin support and still posing a threat with its coverage and Explosion. Physically defensive Forretress can be used over the specially defensive set on teams with very strong defensive cores that only need Forretress to Rapid Spin and set up entry hazards. Physically defensive Hippowdon, physical defensive Zapdos, and defensive Jirachi are excellent teammates that appreciate Rapid Spin and are difficult to break for offensive teams. Jirachi can even provide Wish support. Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune is also a great choice as a wall that can sweep with Rapid Spin support and provides an excellent Heatran and Fire Punch Jirachi check. Clefable also provides Knock Off and Encore to help prevent special set up threats as well as provides a switch into mixed Flygon. On these types of teams, the only defensive responsibilities Forretress has it to absorb Trick from Metagross, Rotom-A, and Latias.</p> <p>On offensive teams, Forretress helps to mitigate Skarmory's impact, provide a check to dangerous attackers with Explosion, and sets up Spikes. Forretress enjoys a crippled Skarmory so it can no longer repeatedly phaze it away after Skarmory sets up entry hazards. Trick Metagross is an excellent partner, as Skarmory very commonly switches in on it. Choice Scarf and Iron Ball permanently cripple Skarmory and allow Forretress to blunt its impact more easily. Forretress also appreciates Pursuit support to remove Rotom-A and Gengar, as both easily 2HKO it. Gyarados, especially Taunt sets, appreciate Forretress spreading entry hazards and removing Rapid Spin. Spinblockers such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A are effective in preventing the opponent from Rapid Spinning. Rotom-A also helps to revenge kill threats Forretress does not like taking on, such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Lucario, and Agility Empoleon.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>With an incredible 130 base Attack, a Technician Bullet Punch, and a potent STAB-boosted U-turn, Scizor is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the OU metagame. Its Bug / Steel-typing gives it a whopping ten resistances with only one weakness, which enables it to answer Pokemon like Gengar, Latias, Metagross, Bronzong, Tyranitar, Starmie, and Dragonite. It is capable of revenge killing, scouting, and even sweeping teams with the help of Swords Dance.</p> <p>That said, Scizor has its fair share of flaws. Entry hazards are especially devastating, as Scizor needs to be decently healthy to reliably switch into what it's supposed to check. Magnezone can consistently trap and remove Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, as it can often catch it on a Choice-locked Bullet Punch or while it sets up with Swords Dance. Its 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks means that it can often be KOed by a surprise Hidden Power Fire and Pokemon like Jirachi, Zapdos, and Infernape can force it out easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While it may seem like Scizor has a shallow movepool, it can actually use a decent number of alternative moves. The Choice Band set can utilize Night Slash, Return, and Double Hit. Night Slash can surprise Rotom-A with massive damage, while Return and Double Hit can provide neutral coverage on foes such as Zapdos and Gyarados. Scizor can use Baton Pass in conjunction with moves such as Swords Dance, Agility, and Iron Defense, but other Pokemon like Gliscor are often better at using this strategy. Knock Off and Toxic can be used on a very defensive set, but once again other Pokemon can use these moves more effectively. Scizor's secondary ability, Swarm, can be used in conjunction with Liechi or Salac Berry in order to pull off a low HP sweep. However, when using Swarm, be sure to use X-Scissor over Bug Bite, as without Technician, X-Scissor is the superior move. Reversal can also be used effectively in tandem with sets sweeping at low HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rotom-A is easily the best counter to Scizor, packing resistances to Bug and Steel as well as an immunity to Fighting. However, Choice variants will have to be wary of Pursuit when locked into a resisted attack, and the odd Night Slash can catch Rotom-A off guard. Gyarados also does extremely well, being able to switch into almost any move Scizor could possibly carry with no repercussions due to Intimidate. Zapdos is in the same boat as Gyarados, and while it may not have Intimidate on its side, it can Roost off any damage incurred or retaliate with Heat Wave, something Gyarados can't do.</p> <p>Heatran's 4x resistances to Bug- and Steel-type attacks makes it a good choice for countering Scizor. However, switching into Superpower can mean a quick death for Heatran, so be wary. Magnezone works extremely similarly, and if it can get in on a Pursuit or Bullet Punch, it guarantees Scizor's elimination due to Magnet Pull. Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Fire is especially notable for doing this, as it cannot be outsped by non-Choiced Scizor.</p> <p>The majority of physical walls can perform relatively well against the Choice Band set, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Skarmory specifically packs a 4x resistance to U-turn and a 2x resistance to Bullet Punch, so it can take advantage of Scizor to lay down Spikes. Forretress can do the same, but lack of instant recovery makes it a slightly more unreliable choice, as it can be worn down more easily by Superpower or random hits. However, note that these Pokemon do not do nearly as well against Swords Dance Scizor, which can pack Roost to turn these Pokemon into setup fodder. They are also reliably 2HKOed by Scizor's moves, be it Bullet Punch or Bug Bite for Gliscor and Hippowdon or Brick Break / Superpower for Forretress and Skarmory.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band Scizor's massive 591 Attack, combined with STAB U-turn and priority in the form of Technician Bullet Punch, makes it a solid revenge killer and scouter. Bullet Punch is the crux of its set. After STAB and the Technician boost, it sports 90 Base Power, which allows it to pick off a weakened opposing sweeper, like Dragonite, Gyarados, and even Lucario after a Defense drop from Close Combat. It can also OHKO frailer Pokemon like Gengar and Roserade. U-turn hits incredibly hard and allows Scizor to scout for its counters and bring in a counter of your own. Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO Blissey and Clefable, while also OHKOing two of its most common checks, Magnezone and Heatran, as they switch in. For the final slot, Pursuit can allow Scizor to pick off opposing Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias locked into resisted moves, as well as Gengar and Starmie. On the other hand, Quick Attack provides Scizor with the ability to revenge weakened Zapdos, Gyarados, or Kingdra more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maxmizing HP and Attack is best suited for Choice Scizor to function as a strong, bulky pivot. While you have the option to invest a bit of Speed into Scizor to speed creep against opposing Scizor and Nidoqueen, this is generally not worth it, as the benefits of being able to use Superpower versus opposing Scizor first don't usually outweigh Scizor's ability to take a hit and then use U-turn last. Furthermore, at minimum, Scizor should have 248 HP EVs and 4 SpD EVs, as with this investment it's able to always survive Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The best way to use Choice Band Scizor is to send it in early-game versus something it forces out, so that you can gain momentum by using Scizor's very powerful U-turn, which even does significant damage to a few foes that resist it. Scizor really wants to retain as much of its HP as possible, so try to utilize it when Stealth Rock is not up, if possible. Be careful when locking onto moves like Bullet Punch and Superpower because the opponent may have a Magnezone in the back to trap Scizor, or something like Substitute Gengar to take advantage of Scizor being locked into Superpower. Overall, it's very important to try to use U-turn as much as possible for scouting purposes, gaining momentum, and taking advantage of Scizor having the strongest U-turn in OU.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is Scizor's best friend, as it allows Scizor to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gengar much more easily. It also allows Scizor's team to take maximum advantage of the switches that U-turn commonly induces. Once Stealth Rock is up, the best teammates for Scizor are Pokemon who can switch into its common counters and either eliminate them or force them out. Tyranitar can eliminate opposing Rotom-A, as well as covering opposing Heatran and Zapdos. Heatran can absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom or Heat Wave from Zapdos, and possibly lure and Explode on bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Swampert. For a more offensive option, effective teammates include frail sweepers such as Gengar and Infernape that can take advantage of free switches scouted by U-turn.</p> <p>Packing a Rapid Spinner can also be advantageous when using Choice Band Scizor, as Stealth Rock and Spikes can prove to be a nightmare for Scizor, which can find itself switching in often. Starmie is the best spinner to pair with Scizor, as it resists Fire and has access to instant recovery. Meanwhile, if Scizor can eliminate Blissey with Pursuit, Starmie is capable of sweeping late-game. Forretress can also function well, as it reinforces Scizor's resistances and can also provide Spikes support to take advantage of the switches caused by Scizor's power. However, be cautious of doubling up on Fire weaknesses, since Forretress and Scizor have the same typing.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With its excellent Bug / Steel typing and decent bulk, Scizor is able to act as a bulky Swords Dance setup sweeper. It's able to check foes like Bronzong, Metagross, and Latias thanks to its typing and can be hard to take down thanks to the longevity granted by its access to Roost to heal itself with, as well as Leftovers.</p> <p>Swords Dance is the best way to increase Scizor's Attack, and when paired with Technician and the powerful priority move Bullet Punch, it can make Scizor into one of the most terrifying sweepers. Swords Dance also allows Scizor to scare off Latias, Bronzong, and Metagross, or in Bronzong's and Metagross's cases, force them to use Explosion. U-turn is recommended, as Scizor can use it to gain momentum or even escape from a Magnezone that switches in. It will also do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, such as Flygon, Jirachi, Suicune, and Swampert. Combined with this set's high Special Defense investment, it's a good answer to Starmie as well. Superpower is an alternative that can KO Heatran, Metagross, Magnezone, and Lucario, not to mention that it'll make Skarmory feel less serene. However, in some situations, the Defense drop caused by Superpower may leave Scizor a bit vulnerable. Furthermore, be aware that with Steel / Fighting coverage, Starmie now resists both of Scizor's moves. Because Bug Bite doesn't force Scizor out like U-turn and doesn't drop its Defense like Superpower, it's a decent option as well, especially against Metagross and Bronzong, although it makes Scizor extremely vulnerable to Magnezone and Heatran. Brick Break is a fourth option that aims to hit the same targets as Superpower but is significantly weaker. It may be the preferred option for its higher PP, lack of drops in Attack and Defense, and ability to break through opposing Reflect and Light Screen.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread is pretty straightforward. 248 HP EVs allow Scizor to best utilize its bulk, and 56 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature allow Scizor to always 2HKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage and always OHKO Tyranitar after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense in order to maximize Scizor's special bulk, which improves its odds against foes like Starmie, Latias, and Jolteon. Note that an alternative spread of 16 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature and 244 EVs in Special Defense is an option if you would prefer more special bulk. Shed Shell is a possible option for escaping Magnezone's Magnet Pull smoothly; however, Leftovers remains crucial in order to help Scizor stay at a comfortable amount of health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Scizor into Pokemon that typically cannot 2HKO it, such as Metagross, Bronzong, Outrage-locked Dragon-types, and Choice-locked Latias. After that, use a combination of Swords Dance and Roost to effectively set up. While it's quite effective to set up Swords Dance late-game when Scizor's checks and counters have been KOed or weakened, it can also be effective to set up Swords Dance early- or mid-game to put pressure on the opponent, which Scizor can do effectively thanks to its good typing and bulk. Try to use U-turn early-game to scout the opposing team and see if it has a Magnezone. If Magnezone is healthy and Scizor lacks U-turn, you might want to double switch in order to escape the obvious Magnezone switch-in. You can also throw out a Superpower if you're expecting a weakened Magnezone to switch in, preventing it from trapping and removing Scizor. However, when using Superpower, be careful about the Defense drop, as it can make Pokemon like Metagross, Bronzong, and Flygon much more threatening. If your team has paralysis support, try to cripple opposing Heatran and Magnezone in order to make them easier targets for Scizor's Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor has a large number of counters such as Heatran, Fire Punch Jirachi, Zapdos, Rotom-A, Skarmory, Infernape, and Haze Milotic. Pokemon that can threaten those counters are often good teammates. Zapdos is a reliable one, as it can threaten Haze Milotic, Gyarados, Jirachi, and Skarmory. Discharge Zapdos is good with Superpower Scizor in particular, as it can paralyze opposing Heatran and Magnezone. Tyranitar is a great teammate, not only because it can Pursuit trap Zapdos and most Rotom-A, but also because it is able to wear down and scare off Heatran. Jirachi's Body Slam paralysis support can be essential as mentioned above, given the help it provides for Superpower Scizor. Jirachi is also able to lure Heatran decently well with Hidden Power Ground, which somewhat compensates for the nasty Fire-type weakness that it and Scizor share. In the same vein, Latias is a pretty nice teammate, as it has perfect type synergy with Scizor and can drop a Draco Meteor or even a Hidden Power Fire to weaken Steel-types. In addition to that, Latias can offer paralysis support with Thunder Wave to shut down opposing Heatran and Magnezone. Heatran has very good synergy with Scizor, as it can switch into Fire-type attacks and power up thanks to Flash Fire, as well as being able to check foes such as Fire Punch Jirachi, Skarmory, and Zapdos. Magma Storm Heatran can trap and remove Swampert, while Toxic variants can assist in wearing down Milotic, Zapdos, and Gyarados. Breloom can take care of Swampert and Milotic or force a counter to sleep with Spore. Moreover, it forms a powerful offensive combination with Swords Dance Scizor. If you add Zapdos to this core, you have the potential to break through the bulkiest of teams, but be wary of the Fire weakness stacking. Starmie is a good teammate as well for spinning away the Spikes that Scizor hates, and it has great synergy with Scizor, as it can switch into Fire moves from threats such as Heatran and Infernape and force them out with Hydro Pump. Swampert and Gyarados are both good teammates as well thanks to their Fire-type resistance and ability to overwhelm and wear down Skarmory and Zapdos for Scizor. Magnezone can trap Skarmory for Scizor. Lastly, Porygon2 and Swords Dance Scizor are incredibly synergistic, especially if Scizor has Superpower. Porygon2 is able to shut down Gyarados and Heatran and can take special hits from the likes of Zapdos, Rotom-A, and mixed Flygon. It can also spread paralysis decently well against foes such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Magnezone, the latter of which it can trap by copying Magnet Pull with trace. Scizor can cover Gengar, Metagross, and Bronzong for it, as well as being able to switch into some variants of Tyranitar. Nevertheless, despite being an unusual choice, the synergy that Porygon2 shares with Scizor is stunning.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Technician boosting the power of both Bullet Punch and Bug Bite, Scizor can run a terrifying offensive Swords Dance set. Bullet Punch is a fantastic priority option that Scizor can take tremendous advantage of thanks to the STAB boost and Technician. Bug Bite is Scizor's most powerful Bug-type attack, able to go as far as OHKOing Suicune, Metagross, Bronzong, and even the most physically bulky variant of Milotic after Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost. Superpower rounds out the set with coverage against Steel-types as well as Blissey and Clefable. Although the latter two would still sustain significant damage from Bug Bite due to their Normal typing, Scizor typically wants to be able to OHKO them due to fear of moves like Thunder Wave, Knock Off, and even Flamethrower. Pursuit is another fantastic option, as the boost with Swords Dance allows it to Pursuit trap foes such as Latias, Gengar, Rotom-A, and Starmie effectively. Quick Attack is a solid alternative to Bug Bite, as it's a great move for targeting offensive Water-types like Gyarados, Suicune, and Starmie, as well as Zapdos and Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investing 224 Speed EVs into Scizor allows it to outspeed threats such as most Magnezone, Empoleon, fast Swampert, Choice Band Tyranitar, most Breloom, Milotic, and very bulky variants of Heatran. Maximizing Attack powers Scizor up as much as possible and secures crucial OHKOs after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs go into overall bulk, a small investment of which can still go a long way against foes like Suicune and Starmie and also allows Scizor to minimize Life Orb recoil. Life Orb is Scizor's best option for an item here, as this set's longevity isn't much better without it and the boost to its power is tremendously useful. Occa Berry is also a fantastic choice, as Scizor can survive some weaker Fire-type moves such as Magnzone's Hidden Power Fire, Jirachi's Fire Punch, and even Tyranitar's +1 Fire Punch to hit the foe hard. It can even run maximum HP with an EV spread such as 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with an Occa Berry to give it more survivability. Metal Coat may be an interesting alternative to try to salvage some longevity while bluffing a Choice item and still powering up Bullet Punch, but the extra power given to Bug Bite is extremely hard to give up. Jolly is an alternative nature choice that enables Scizor to outspeed most Bold Zapdos and Bold Celebi. By outspeeding Zapdos, Scizor can force some extra chip damage onto it upon getting KOed. Outpacing Bold Celebi can make the difference between Scizor getting revenge killed by Hidden Power Fire versus getting to KO Celebi with Bug Bite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The best way to take advantage of this Scizor set is to send it in on a Pokemon Choice-locked into a resisted move like Flygon's Outrage, Latias's Draco Meteor, Rotom-A's Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ice, or Tyranitar's Pursuit. Once Scizor is in safely, it shouldn't be too difficult to set up a Swords Dance. Once it has the boost, firing off attacks with Scizor's deceptively solid coverage can make even the sturdiest of defensive cores weep. Try to look out for your opponent's attempt to stall Scizor out by switching around and hoping for Life Orb damage to do enough to put it in range for a revenge killer to take out. Catching onto this quickly can make the difference between Scizor sweeping a team and losing out because it sustained too much Life Orb damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although this Scizor is more of a standalone hyper offense sweeper, some teammates can support it by luring in its common checks. Metagross and Bronzong can lure in foes like Zapdos and Rotom-A and either wear them down with powerful STAB-boosted Steel-type attacks or remove other foes with Explosion. Lead Azelf can use Taunt early-game, set up Stealth Rock, and use Explosion to chip down a Steel-type like Jirachi or force Rotom-A in to take it. Tyranitar can take advantage of Rotom-A by either setting up on it with Dragon Dance or trapping and removing it with Pursuit. Offensive Calm Mind Suicune can wear down Gyarados, Swampert, and even physically defensive Zapdos. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, fare decently against Zapdos and Rotom-A, and absorb Fire-type attacks like Fire Blast and Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Rotom-A appreciates Scizor's ability to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar, the setup sweeper that Rotom-A struggles the most against. Expert Belt Latias has fantastic offensive synergy with Scizor due to its ability to lure in Steel-types like Magnezone and Jirachi and hit them hard with a super effective Hidden Power Fire. In addition, it matches up well against Zapdos, Hippowdon, Heatran, and Gliscor. Scizor is also a great lure as a sweeper and provides a defensive backstop against sweepers with its Bullet Punch. Scizor's effectiveness at luring in and weakening Skarmory with its powerful Superpower can open the gates for sweepers like Dragon Dance Kingdra and Dragon Dance Gyarados. In addition, a boosted Superpower can do enough to Skarmory to the point where fast Adamant Swampert can come in and finish it off with Waterfall. With a boosted Pursuit, it can remove all variants of Latias, Rotom-A, and Gengar, huge threats to the types of teams Scizor finds itself on and great for offensive Heatran, Empoleon, and Gyarados. In addition, Swampert in particular has great type synergy with Scizor due to its resistance to Fire and immunity to Electric and is a great mid-game Stealth Rock setter.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Despite having Bullet Punch to overcome its low Speed, Scizor can often find itself requiring more Speed than the Choice Band set provides. This is most notable against Pokemon such as Starmie, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, all of whom have a chance to OHKO you before you can U-turn or Pursuit them. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Scizor is able to outspeed all of the aforementioned Pokemon and OHKO them with the appropriate move. Having such a fast and powerful U-turn also makes Choice Scarf Scizor an effective scout, able to avoid taking damage should the opponent refuse to switch.</p> <p>This set may lack the power of Choice Band, but it does not attempt to overpower the opponent like the Choice Band set does. Rather, Scizor is scouting the early-game with a fast U-turn before coming back in on a revenge kill to put someone into a checkmate position with Pursuit or Bullet Punch. This set's boosted Speed stat additionally allows it to check threats such as Swords Dance Lucario and non-Choice Scarf Heatran.</p> <p>The given EVs allow it to outspeed positive-nature base 120 Speed Pokemon, which is all Scizor needs. Only 216 Speed EVs are necessary to beat Starmie, if you'd like to give Scizor a little extra bulk. Bullet Punch is the main option as this allows you to nab some damage on the likes of Mach Punch Breloom and Infernape, Ice Shard Mamoswine, or Extreme Speed Dragonite and Lucario. Iron Head can be used instead for more power if such priority is not a concern. Night Slash is an option for hitting defensive Rotom-A as is Aerial Ace for hitting Breloom, Infernape, and Machamp. Even if you are running Iron Head over Bullet Punch, Technician is still the ability to use, since the power of Scizor's Pursuit rivals that of Choice Scarf Tyranitar's, which is especially important if your opponent does not switch.</p> <p>Since this set can take out Starmie and Gengar with ease, having partners who can sweep with these Pokemon removed is recommended. Heatran, Gyarados, and Dragonite make good partners, since they can switch in on the Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor. Gyarados, in particular, enjoys having Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Starmie removed from the picture. Alternatively, Swampert and Suicune make good choices since they can switch in on Fire-type moves and force the opponent out. Tyranitar earns a special mention since Scizor and Tyranitar have good synergy, and Scizor can U-turn to Tyranitar whose Pursuit can finish off the Rotom-A and Gengar weakened by Scizor. Since the loss of power from Choice Band means that Scizor won't be hitting as hard, bulky walls such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Suicune can often wall it. In the case of Suicune and Skarmory, they can often recover off the damage from Scizor's U-turn or Superpower, although with U-turn you can always switch to a counter without Scizor taking damage. It is good to have high-powered Electric-type attacks to help deal with these threats. Good Pokemon for the job include Magnezone, Zapdos, and your own Rotom-A.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Heracross can be seen as the herald of a dying age, as his basic game style has not changed drastically from when he was first introduced. He has always been offensively-oriented with his base 125 Attack stat, excellent ability in Guts that takes advantage of the burns that terrify most physical sweepers, and high-powered STAB moves. Although his main role has not changed much, he has been blessed with new tools for the job with every generation, such as Close Combat in DPP, and can now fill more roles than ever before.</p> <p>Despite this, Heracross usage has been constantly spiraling downward as fewer and fewer people use him. Heracross's base 85 Speed is simply not high enough in such a fast-paced metagame, and he is not able to stand up to super effective attacks from omnipresent, faster foes. More and more battlers are choosing faster or more versatile sweepers such as Infernape and Lucario, who both have access to strong priority and higher Speed stats. However, regardless of these shortcomings, Heracross remains one of the very best physical sweepers in the game and should under no circumstances be underestimated. He wasn't banned in Japan during the ADV generation for no reason!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heracross lacks anything else impressive in his movepool besides what is listed in his sets. Earthquake is great move, but has mostly redundant coverage with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Shadow Claw is pretty much the same as Night Slash, but Night Slash is always better because a type is immune to Shadow Claw. Other than these two attacks, just use what the sets suggest for moves.</p> <p>Swarm can be used over Guts on any of the listed sets, especially those that use Substitute. Swarm is almost always inferior to Guts, though, simply because one of Heracross's greatest assets is his benefiting from burn status. Leftovers can also be given to basically any set to increase Heracross's durability, but the loss of power allows many more Pokemon than usual to check Heracross, reducing his usability to almost unbearable levels.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Heracross is cursed with one of the largest checks and counters list in all of DPP OU, and this is reflected in his ever-dropping usage. Zapdos, Gliscor, Gyarados, Dragonite, Rotom-A, Tentacruel, and Gengar all resist both of Heracross's STAB moves. Beyond that, there exist many Pokemon that can switch into a predicted Close Combat or Megahorn with impunity and immediately threaten Heracross before he can change attacks. Choice Scarf Heatran and even Infernape can come in on Megahorn and end him harshly with Fire Blast. Skarmory can come in on Megahorn and either threaten to OHKO Heracross with Brave Bird or set up on him if he doesn't have Attack boosts. Faster Psychic-type Pokemon like Azelf can come in on Close Combat and threaten a Fire Blast or an Explosion. One of the most important things to know when facing a Heracross is that despite his low usage and his easily walled STABs, it is a fool's mistake to discredit him offensively. He is one of the strongest Pokemon around, and under no circumstances should you forget that.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Heracross's mediocre Speed is a letdown as a sweeper, especially because so much of the metagame can revenge kill him. With a Choice Scarf, Heracross can switch in with his numerous resistances and immediately threaten the opposing Pokemon. However, Heracross's power is relatively limited without either Swords Dance or Choice Band, so predicting appropriately and switching into Toxic or Will-O-Wisp is advisable. With a Guts boost, Choice Scarf Heracross can rip through much of DPP OU like a chainsaw through a loaf of bread.</p> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn are the high-power STAB attacks for which Heracross is famous. Stone Edge is essential on Heracross, as Heracross's STAB attacks mainly draw in Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gyarados, all of whom are weak to Rock. Heracross has a lot of interesting options available to him for his final attack. Because Heracross is not as powerful when holding a Choice Scarf, bulky Pokemon have no trouble switching into him and forcing him out; Toxic is a nasty surprise for these Pokemon, especially on a Choice set. Night Slash is an option because Rotom-A is one of Heracross's most common switch-ins due to its immunity to Close Combat and resistance to Megahorn. Though Sleep Talk may seem unreliable because it only works if your opponent has a sleep-inducing Pokemon, Heracross can be a dangerous threat with his Guts-boosted attacks when asleep. However, like with Toxic, being locked into Sleep Talk opens up opportunities for the opponent to set up, so use it with caution. Note that Sleep Talk only works once per switch-in with a Choice item.</p> <p>A simple EV spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed is standard for a set like this. Jolly is the recommended nature to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Heatran, Jolly Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, and Modest Empoleon after an Agility, among others. If these threats can be dealt with elsewhere, then Adamant is perfectly acceptable for the Attack boost.</p> <p>It's important to capitalize on Heracross's unique traits, the most important of those being his Guts ability. For this reason, Pokemon that attract burn or poison status make excellent teammates to consider. Metagross and Swampert are good candidates to fit this role, as the former commonly lures Will-O-Wisp and the latter Toxic. Both of them can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps against the many Flying-types switching into Heracross. Rotom-A and Flying-type Pokemon are issues Heracross will come across frequently, so packing a Pokemon that can easily defeat them is highly recommended. Tyranitar can punch through Zapdos and opposing Rotom-A with relative ease. As an added benefit, most people won't risk Will-O-Wisp with Heracross around, so Tyranitar can generally get in safely. A Rotom-A of your own will help tremendously with Gyarados and Skarmory, while Starmie will help with Flygon and Dragonite.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Once Heracross's flagship set, Choice Band Heracross has since lost much of his popularity in favor of variants running Choice Scarf in order to keep up with a faster-than-ever metagame. Unlike Choice Scarf Heracross, however, Choice Band Heracross functions as a wallbreaker that can hopefully open up holes with his massively powerful attacks so that other Pokemon can sweep. Unlike other Choice Band attackers, such as Tyranitar, Heracross actually enjoys being burned by Pokemon like Rotom-A. After a Guts boost, Heracross's Attack stat hits a massive 861 with Adamant or 784 with Jolly.</p> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn return to form the core of Heracross's attacking options. Stone Edge is mandatory for the Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into Heracross. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Pursuit sits comfortably in the last slot, maiming Psychic-types as they flee from Megahorn or Rotom-A after it accidentally burns you. Sleep Talk returns with this set so that Heracross can make a decent switch-in to sleep-inducing moves and subsequently take advantage of the status with Guts-boosted attacks.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is recommended to outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Gyarados, and Adamant Lucario, but Adamant can be used for the substantial boost to Attack it provides. This set should always run 252 Speed EVs to at worst tie with Suicune and Kingdra. 252 Attack EVs are mandatory to hit as hard as possible, while carrying a Choice Band should hopefully go without saying.</p> <p>Luring status for Heracross to switch into is encouraged, as almost nothing can switch into a Guts-boosted attack safely. Rotom-A is the primary user of Will-O-Wisp, and so by using Pokemon that lure it in, such as Metagross or Jirachi, Heracross can absorb the Will-O-Wisp and proceed to Pursuit Rotom-A to death. Stealth Rock support is basically necessary as it helps Heracross wear down the typical Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into him. Tyranitar is also a very good teammate for Heracross, as he can beat both the Ghost- and Flying-type Pokemon that like to switch into Heracross's STAB attacks. Revenge killing tactics are popular for breaking Heracross, as he's not the fastest Pokemon around. For this reason, it's important to have checks to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran and Infernape. Good examples of such Pokemon are Vaporeon and Starmie.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Using this set on your team is akin to making a pact with the devil. With a one turn setup that involves tripling Heracross's Attack stat from 349 to 1047 and two 120 Base Power attacks, even things that used to switch into Heracross with impunity can be brutally massacred. Not simply hoping that Guts will activate, and instead activating it yourself, means that this Heracross has considerably more raw power, thus exchanging survivability for the potential to crush his standard counters.</p> <p>Swords Dance, Close Combat, and Megahorn are all standard fare for Heracross. As this set is guaranteed a status affliction, though, Heracross can use a deadly new weapon: Facade. After a Swords Dance, it OHKOes Weezing, Gliscor, and even bulky Gyarados after Intimidate with Stealth Rock damage. Night Slash is an option for the last slot because it is necessary to beat Rotom-A; Facade is the superior option against basically everything else, though.</p> <p>Flame Orb activates Guts, which is necessary for this set. Toxic Orb can be used for a more hit-and-run approach to using this set, whereas Flame Orb is less damaging over many turns. As a sweeper, Heracross is just begging for 252 Attack and Speed EVs. A Jolly nature is best here for outspeeding Timid Heatran. If, for some reason, you don't feel like abusing a Herculean 1047 Attack stat, you can give Heracross a Life Orb. If by God's good graces Heracross gets burned with a Life Orb equipped, even Pokemon like defensive Rotom-A are OHKOed by a resisted Megahorn at the cost of 22.5% of Heracross's HP per turn.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is utterly necessary for guaranteeing OHKOs against max Defense Skarmory, Forretress, Hippowdon, Bronzong, and all bulky Water-type Pokemon. Dual screen support can ease Heracross's setup as well. Pokemon like Uxie, Azelf, and Jirachi are good candidates for the job as they can accomplish any of these things. Since Heracross is a slow beetle, having switch-ins for the omnipresent faster threats is important. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran, Flygon, and Jirachi are all issues, as well as priority abusers like Scizor. A Heatran of your own makes a good partner for his ability to switch into Fire-type attacks with impunity, his 4x resistance to Scizor's Bullet Punch and Jirachi's Iron Head, and his resistance to Flygon's Outrage. Tyranitar makes another good partner for his ability to beat Rotom-A if you pass on Night Slash. Tyranitar can also take on Fire-type attacks with relative ease, although he should be wary of Steel-type attacks from Scizor and Jirachi.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory returns as one of the best defensive Pokemon and Spikes users in the metagame. Skarmory’s fantastic Steel / Flying typing, base 140 Defense stat, and varied defensive movepool make it a fantastic wall. Skarmory is an excellent answer to hyper offense teams lacking Magnezone, as it can heal off multiple boosted attacks and phaze out the opponent while setting up entry hazards. Skarmory can run physically and specially defensive sets, depending on team composition. Physically defensive sets are great answers to Fighting-types such as Machamp and Breloom and emphasize Skarmory’s ability to answer boosted sweepers, while specially defensive sets stave Skarmory off against mixed sweepers while also absorbing boosted Latias’s attacks well. Skarmory can run an offensive Spikes set focused on setting up hyper offensive teams with Stealth Rock and Spikes while preventing set up with Taunt.</p> <p>Skarmory’s main issues lie in its weakness to Magnezone and the way the metagame has adapted to it. Magnezone is the bane of Skarmory’s existence, as it traps and OHKOes it while Skarmory has no options to damage it. Skarmory can run Shed Shell to escape from Magnezone; however, running Shed Shell means Skarmory loses out on Leftovers recovery and cannot afford to take Knock Off from Clefable or Gliscor that are paired with Magnezone. Without Leftovers, Skarmory cannot recover easily from absorbing powerful physical attacks such as Metagross's Explosion while also struggling with Breloom, Machamp, and Jirachi. Physically defensive Skarmory also is weak to surprise special attacks from Pokemon it is supposed to wall, such as mixed Flygon's Fire Blast, Jirachi’s Electric-type coverage, and Swampert’s Hydro Pump, while specially defensive variants can be overwhelmed by strong physical moves such as +1 Tyranitar’s Stone Edge, +1 Dragonite’s Fire Punch, and Breloom’s Focus Punch. Offensive Spikes variants often have little to no bulk and suffer against Rapid Spinning later in the game. Most specially offensive leads can OHKO offensive Skarmory, while without recovery, Skarmory can be worn down easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Skarmory can run Protect alongside Roost to scout out opposing moves and gain additional Leftovers recovery. On the offensive Spikes set, Skarmory can also use Endure + Salac Berry or Custap Berry to guarantee set up of an entry hazard or use Brave Bird before having hazards spun away by a faster threat such as Starmie. Skarmory can also use Toxic to additionally pressure Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Dragonite as an alternative to Counter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Magnezone is oppressive to Skarmory, as it traps and OHKOes it with ease while it fears nothing Skarmory can do. Fully specially defensive Skarmory can survive Magnezone's Thunderbolt guaranteed should it lack a boosting item or a Modest nature to set up more hazards or phaze it away. Skarmory can also use Shed Shell to escape Magnet Pull. Other more niche Magnet Pull Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Magneton can also trap Skarmory, but aren't as effective at preventing hazards as Magnezone is.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spinners</strong>: Starmie and Forretress counter the primary way Skarmory does damage with Rapid Spin. Both easily survive Brave Bird and punish Skarmory: Starmie either hits it hard with its coverage or paralyzes, while Forretress sets up more entry hazards. Other niche Rapid Spinners such as Donphan and Trick + Choice Scarf Claydol can punish Skarmory in the same way.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Infernape can easily OHKO Skarmory with their Fire-type moves. Infernape should be careful of switching in on Brave Bird, while both are grounded and can be worn down throughout the game with Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Raikou hit Skarmory hard with a super effective Thunderbolt. However, none of them can guarantee an OHKO without a boosting item on specially defensive Skarmory unless they use Thunder. Rotom-A is a prominent Skarmory counter on defensive teams as it is immune to entry hazards and has a good chance to OHKO physically defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Surprise Special Coverage</strong>: Even when invested, Skarmory's Special Defense isn't very good and is vulnerable to surprise special moves from foes such as Jirachi's special Electric-type coverage, utility Tyranitar's Fire Blast, Swampert Hydro Pump, mixed Dragonite and Flygon's Fire Blast, and Calm Mind Clefable's Thunderbolt. These attacks will often leave physically defensive Skarmory very low on health or KOed, but specially defensive Skarmory can Roost off a lot of these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Like many walls, Skarmory is vulnerable to Trick. However, Skarmory is especially vulnerable to being hit by Trick + Iron Ball, which slows it down, removes its passive recovery, and makes it vulnerable to Ground-type attacks and Spikes. Beware of Metagross, Bronzong, and Uxie possibly grounding Skarmory with an Iron Ball. Skarmory notably becomes a much worse answer to Flygon, Metagross, Gliscor, Swampert, and other Earthquake users with an Iron Ball.</p> <p><strong>Very Strong Attackers</strong>: Skarmory can be overwhelmed by very powerful attackers, such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Band Gyarados, Choice Specs Latias, Gengar, Breloom, Machamp, Lucario, and Suicune. Gyarados and Swampert are especially bad if they flinch with Waterfall, while Tyranitar can notably 2HKO physically defensive Skarmory with Stone Edge. Breloom and Machamp hit Skarmory super effectively when it uses Roost, while Lucario can OHKO after Stealth Rock with a +2 Close Combat. However, all of these should beware of Counter, which often OHKOes them after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Gliscor, Gengar, Azelf, opposing Skarmory, and Gyarados can prevent Skarmory from performing its role with Taunt. Skarmory is forced to Struggle should it lack Drill Peck, Brave Bird, or Counter. Gyarados is especially dangerous, as with Intimidate, it can prevent Skarmory from phazing it out, take weak damage from Brave Bird or Drill Peck, and set up Dragon Dance until it OHKOes through Counter.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory is focused on setting entry hazards, walling most physical threats, and phazing the opponent. Skarmory is one of the few viable Spikes setters in the metagame. With invesment, Skarmory's defensive prowess allows it to set up Spikes easily on most Pokemon without special moves. Roost keep Skarmory healthy and negates its Flying-typing for a turn. Beware of opponents taking advantage of Roost to hit Skarmory with a super effective attack such as Swampert’s Earthquake, Breloom's Focus Punch, Machamp’s DynamicPunch, and Scizor’s Superpower, however.</p> <p>One of Skarmory main advantages over other Spikes setting walls such as Forretress is its ability to phaze after setting entry hazards up. Whirlwind has two main uses: phaze out boosted sweepers such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados as well as spread entry hazard damage. Skarmory’s Whirlwind is one of the best ways for defensive teams to hurt the opponent, especially since most Skarmory answers such as Magnezone and Heatran are grounded. Whirlwind also assists against Substitute users, especially Breloom and Machamp if Skarmory lacks a Flying-type move. For more active damaging options, Brave Bird is an excellent move to make it a better answer to Gyarados, Gliscor, Lucario, Infernape, Breloom, and Machamp. Provided it is facing a defensive team, Brave Bird also gives Skarmory an option to pressure Clefable, forcing it to heal more often as well as finishing weakened walls dragged in by Whirlwind. Should recoil be a concern, Drill Peck is a safe alternative that doesn't wear Skarmory down, useful against foes such as Taunt Gliscor. Counter gives Skarmory a more offensive answer to boosted sweepers: as foes do not want to get phazed, physical attackers will often attack into Skarmory to weaken it for later in the game. Counter can OHKO Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar with Stealth Rock after Skarmory takes a boosted attack. As some defensive teams don’t have many Stealth Rock users, Skarmory can set up both entry hazards due to the free turns it generates. This does make Skarmory susceptible to Taunt, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory generally should use close to maximum HP and maximum Defense EVs, as it needs all the physical defense it can get to check Dragon Dance sweepers such as Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar while also answering Breloom, Metagross, and Machamp. It is less vulnerable to Jirachi continuously flinching it with Iron Head as well. If using Counter, Skarmory should use 180 Defense EVs instead to allow it to OHKO Gyarados using +1 Waterfall with Counter after Stealth Rock, with the remaining 76 EVs in Special Defense to help it take stray special hits. Skarmory can also use more Special Defense EVs, as the base stat is quite low and can help against various mixed attackers; however, Skarmory generally needs significant investment before it can reliable take special attacks. Skarmory can run some extra Speed EVs, such as up to around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum Speed Heatran. This allows it to Whirlwind out other Skarmory first and outspeed slower Breloom before it uses Spore.</p> <p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is team dependent. Leftovers is preferred, as Skarmory is forced to Roost much earlier without Leftovers and generally struggles to wall threats. For example, Metagross can KO Skarmory with Explosion much easier if Dragonite hits it hard with a +1 Fire Punch if it doesn’t heal with Leftovers. Skarmory should stick to Drill Peck instead of Brave Bird with Shed Shell to further minimize residual damage. Skarmory has to be much more careful against Clefable and Gliscor, as it still is vulnerable to Magnezone if it takes a Knock Off. Shed Shell is also useless if the opponent doesn’t have Magnezone. However, Shed Shell can invalidate Magnezone teams that rely on it to remove Skarmory. Magnezone teams often are very weak Skarmory otherwise, allowing it to excel in its role of setting up hazards and walling.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory should come in liberally throughout the game to lay hazards and wall threats. Skarmory has a huge list of Pokemon it can use as setup fodder. If Skarmory lacks Shed Shell, it has to worry about potential Magnezone switches. This vulnerability can be answered by double switching to one’s own Magnezone or using Whirlwind immediately. Often, the second layer of Spikes isn’t as valuable as the first and third, so prioritize setting up Stealth Rock then one layer of Spike should Skarmory have both. Some Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Swampert can have strong special coverage, so be careful about using these Pokemon as setup fodder. Being aggressive with Whirlwind is fantastic at wearing down the opposing team even with not many entry hazards set. Counter can also potentially force difficult mindgames for foes trying to break through Skarmory, so take advantage of this if you have it.</p> <p>Despite Skarmory's incredible bulk, it can be overwhelmed by the threats it answers. Mastering the timing of Roost is critical; Skarmory should be keeping its health high with Roost to avoid being overwhelmed by Explosion and set up sweepers. However, opponents can take advantage Roost, as now Skarmory will be vulnerable to super effective Ground- and Fighting-type moves. Skarmory can also be overwhelmed by strong offensive Water-types such as Choice Band Swampert and boosted Gyarados, especially if Waterfall flinches, so don’t rely on it solely for this purpose. Skarmory also can be crippled by Trick, so against threats it easily walls like Metagross and Bronzong, beware of Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Band. Keeping Skarmory unstatused is often critical to beating opposing Skarmory and defensive threats such as Clefable, so avoid taking Jirachi’s Body Slam, Starmie’s Thunder Wave, and Gengar’s Will-O-Wisp for example in this case.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory has many possible teammates as a staple of DPP OU. Both offensive and defensive teams greatly appreciate the extra chip damage Spikes provides and Skarmory’s defensive prowess. Tyranitar is one of the best partners, as its Choice Scarf set can Pursuit trap Starmie trying to Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock and Spikes, utility Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock and handle Electric- and Fire-type coverage better while also covering Starmie, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar’s counters are mostly grounded, allowing it to break through opposing teams. Sand is also helpful for making residual damage stick. Skarmory also appreciates a Ghost-type such as Gengar and Rotom-A to block Rapid Spin. Gengar is excellent on more offensive teams, as it forces many switches with its power and Will-O-Wisp, while Spikes helps put defensive Tyranitar in range of Focus Blast. All Rotom-A sets assist Skarmory: Choice Scarf sets are great revenge killers, utility sets are oppressive with Spikes down, and defensive RestTalk sets spread burns and are best at blocking Rapid Spin throughout the game. Skarmory is a staple of the Magnezone bait style, which involves allowing Magnezone to trap Skarmory early in the game so that one’s own Choice Scarf Magnezone counter traps Magnezone with Hidden Power Ground. This can open up teams to another Steel-type such as defensive Jirachi or Empoleon. Skarmory can even evade being trapped with Shed Shell.</p> <p>Beyond these, Skarmory generally appreciates teammates that can switch into its special weaknesses. On offensive teams, Pokemon like Choice Specs Latias, mixed Flygon, and Swampert provide Fire and Electric resistances while taking advantage of the entry hazards laid down. Flygon especially enjoys Spikes, as it heavily limits reliable switch ins except Clefable. Swampert provides Stealth Rock, and gives back up to physical sweepers trying to break through Skarmory such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Pokemon that take advantage of switches such as Heatran and Breloom as well as mixed threats such as Jirachi, Infernape, and Swampert love having entry hazards wear down the opponent.</p> <p>For defensive teams, Skarmory is typically the primary physically defensive wall while also providing Spikes. As such, it appreciates bulkier teammates to switch into its weaknesses as well as offensive Water-types that can break it. Common choices include defensive Latias, Clefable, Milotic, Zapdos, and Tyranitar. Defensive Jirachi becomes more oppressive to face with entry hazards set while Gliscor, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon cover Electric-types and provide their own utility. Gliscor, Zapdos, Latias, Celebi, and Nidoqueen check Breloom should Skarmory take Spore. Blissey and Clefable are strong special walls that appreciate Skarmory shoring them up against physical threats. Calm Mind Clefable especially loves Spikes to force damage on the bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Jirachi as well as Tyranitar that wall it. Heatran and Skarmory are Steel-types that don’t share weaknesses, shoring the team against Dragon-types. As the best defensive Spikes user in the metagame, Skarmory can fit with almost all defensive teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory is an amazing mixed wall; it notably is one of the only specially bulky Steel-types with access to recovery alongside Jirachi and Scizor. This allows it to take strong special attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor, Gengar's Focus Blast, and even Life Orb Flygon's and Dragonite's attacks more easily. As this Skarmory isn't nearly as vulnerable to surprise special moves such as Tyranitar's Fire Blast, Jirachi's Electric-type moves, and Swampert's Hydro Pump, it can set up Spikes and possibly Stealth Rock with impunity against much of the metagame.</p> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory's Whirlwind typically only phazes out boosted physical sweepers in an emergency, as it doesn't have the physical bulk to stave them off repeatedly. Additionally, Skarmory struggles to repeatedly phaze out strong physical Substitute users such as Machamp and Breloom, but is effective against weaker ones such as Jirachi. However, due to its mixed bulk, Whirlwind becomes a better offensive tool, as Skarmory can use it against more of the metagame due to the grounded nature of its answers. For its last moveslot, Skarmory enjoys the general utility of Brave Bird, but can also set both entry hazards quickly with Stealth Rock or can more offensively check physical sweepers with Counter. Skarmory doesn't have the raw bulk to use the weaker Drill Peck. Brave Bird especially allows Skarmory to fend off Gengar without Will-O-Wisp much better with its special bulk. Skarmory can also control more defensive teams from healing and setting up entry hazards with Taunt. With its recovery and immunity to sand, Skarmory often prevents slower walls such as Clefable, other Skarmory, and Hippowdon from doing anything at all.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory generally needs close to maximum Special Defense EVs invested to stave off special moves effectively, as Latias and Gengar easily 3HKO Skarmory even with full investment. This investment allows Skarmory to do much better against Water-types such as special Swampert, Suicune, Kingdra, Empoleon, and Milotic. Skarmory can run some extra Speed EVs, such as up to around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum Speed Heatran. This investment especially helps out Taunt sets. Skarmory also can run an Impish nature with a fully specially defensive spread such as 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD to balance its two spreads.</p> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory generally shouldn't be running Shed Shell. There are a few reasons for this: the first reason is that Careful Skarmory with maximum Special Defense EVs survives Timid Magnezone's Thunderbolt with certainty, while Modest has a 50% chance to OHKO. The second is due to Skarmory's lack of Defense EVs, it can be overwhelmed more easily by physical attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory should come in early in the game or lead to set up entry hazards, as with mixed bulk, little can stop it from getting up at least a layer. As Skarmory lacks huge physical bulk, beware of trying to counter set up sweepers and strong physical threats, as they will break through. For this reason, Skarmory should be keeping its health high with Roost to avoid being overwhelmed more so than physically bulky sets. This also keeps it healthy against special coverage, as Tyranitar's Fire Blast and Jirachi's Electric-type coverage will generally still 2HKO Skarmory. Skarmory is more vulnerable to physical ways to break through it, such as boosted Gyarados and Swampert flinching and 2HKOing with Waterfall, Explosion + residual damage, and Trick + Iron Ball users such as Metagross now 2HKOing it with Earthquake, so Skarmory should be used in conjunction with other answers to these Pokemon. However, with Counter, Skarmory can often surprise them, as boosted attacks will almost always OHKO back. Skarmory should generally avoid status, especially burn, as it notably can't handle Gengar and Jirachi with a burn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Skarmory has more nuance with its partners than the physically defensive set. This Skarmory isn't used as much on defensive teams, as it can't shoulder the burden of repeated physical hits as well as a primary physical wall and struggles to check Breloom and Machamp effectively. On the other hand, this Skarmory is effective at shoring up a team against many threats as a mixed wall on offensive teams—whereas physically defensive Skarmory needs another bulky Steel-type or Tyranitar to take powerful Draco Meteor from Latias, Kingdra, Dragonite, and Flygon, this Skarmory can shore up the team against special Dragon-type moves and Gengar in one slot while still functioning against physical attackers while at full health. As such, its viable partners go into three categories: general support for Spikes, offensive Pokemon wanting Spikes and possibly Stealth Rock to wear down their counters, and teams with little backbone and need a versatile wall in one slot.</p> <p>As with the physically defensive set, Skarmory especially loves Tyranitar and Ghost-types, as these not only help prevent Rapid Spin, but also uniquely take advantage of Skarmory's defensive traits. Tyranitar generally takes Fire- and Electric-type coverage well, meaning most of its sets are effective: Choice Scarf sets again can trap Starmie and other Psychic-types, such as Latias, and Ghost-types such as Gengar and Rotom-A, utility sets set up Stealth Rock and appreciate Spikes, and Dragon Dance sets get a free Dragon Dance on many Skarmory checks and sweeps with Spikes set. Specially defensive Skarmory is especially good for this, as it can survive strong Draco Meteor and generally forces offensive Starmie to Thunderbolt. Ghost-types are especially useful, as Gengar can help answer Breloom for Skarmory while be very threatening with Spikes set. Rotom-A can shore up the team physically defensively or provide a back up check to Dragon Dance users with its Choice Scarf set.</p> <p>Good offensive teammates for Skarmory include Pokemon that can switch into its weaknesses, such as Choice Specs and other offensive Latias, mixed Flygon, Heatran, Swampert, and even Quagsire. Spikes help Latias, Heatran, and Flygon to break down their grounded checks, while Swampert and Heatran can set up Stealth Rock. Heatran also helps with strong Electric-type coverage, can switch into Will-O-Wisp, and provides a strong Jirachi counter. Swampert and Quagsire assist specially defensive Skarmory against physical threats it doesn't wall that well, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Trick + Iron Ball Metagross. Quagsire is especially a good partner, as is also immune to the strong offensive Water-types Skarmory struggles with and beats every common Dragon Dance user with Encore and Counter.</p> <p>Teams with less of a defensive backbone, such as more offensive Magnezone bait teams and some defensive teams, appreciate specially defensive Skarmory. These styles typically need many pieces to be effective: for example, on Magnezone bait teams, they need Magnezone, another Steel-type, a way to block Rapid Spin such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar or a Ghost-type, and a bulky sweeper such as Curse + Rest Swampert, Swords Dance + Roost Gliscor, or Calm Mind + Roar Latias. Some defensive teams, such as those built around offensive Jirachi, appreciate its ability to sponge Latias's Choice Specs Draco Meteor while also spreading entry hazards needed for Jirachi to thrive. These teams are typically built around Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, and Latias alongside a Ground-type such as physically defensive Hippowdon, specially defensive Gliscor, Quagsire, or Donphan to back up Skarmory defensively. Other strong Pokemon on these styles include defensive RestTalk Rotom and defensive Empoleon.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Spiker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Skarmory can fully lean into supporting offensive teams by controlling the entry hazard game: set up entry hazards while preventing the opponent's with Taunt. Skarmory's defensive typing and bulk afford it to get at least one entry hazard set up if not more. Taunt differentiates this from the standard wall, as Skarmory can prevent Stealth Rock and other entry hazards from slower leads such as Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, opposing Skarmory, and Swampert. Taunt can be especially helpful if Skarmory's team is weak to entry hazards, such as hyper offenses featuring Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>The final move helps to make Skarmory less vulnerable to Taunt as well as opponents trying to KO it. Brave Bird is the standard, as it hits as hard as possible. Brave Bird also outspeeds and damages Machamp, while always OHKOing Breloom and at least speed tying it. Brave Bird also hits non resists hard in general. Drill Peck is another option, especially should one not want to break Focus Sash early or avoid recoil. Drill Peck still 2HKOes Machamp and OHKOes Breloom. Icy Wind is a great option to slow down opposing Taunt users and prevent foes from setting up on Skarmory by boosting their Speed. All offensive  moves break opposing Focus Sash and make Skarmory less passive.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skarmory generally needs to run a lot of Speed EVs to get the most out of Taunt. A 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature emphasizes this, allowing Skarmory to Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock while also getting up its own hazards. It also allows it to outspeed up to Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados, meaning it can Taunt Gyarados to prevent set up. Beware of Choice Band Gyarados just 2HKOing Skarmory, however. It also makes it faster than all non Choice Scarf Magnezone and Tyranitar, while also outspeeding slower base 100 Speed Pokemon like Jirachi and Zapdos. Maximum HP affords Skarmory some survivability against common leads, such as Empoleon's Hydro Pump and Machamp's DynamicPunch. Skarmory can also use 252 Attack EVs to power up Brave Bird and Drill Peck, but doesn't gain any prominent OHKOes by doing so. Skarmory can also run slightly more bulk with a spread of 248 HP / 76 SpD / 184 Spe, designed to live Empoleon's Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet while still outspeeding Tyranitar. Note that Skarmory should use a Timid nature with Icy Wind.</p> <p>Skarmory can use a few different items. The choice between Lum Berry and Focus Sash is determined by what leads Skarmory wants to set up hazards against. Lum Berry saves Skarmory from Roserade, defensive Jirachi, Thunder Wave Uxie, Machamp, and other status leads while getting up its own hazards. However, it affords no protection from the powerful attacks in the lead position such as Heatran's Overheat, Zapdos's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Starmie's Hydro Pump. Lum Berry is generally preferred, as Focus Sash is often negated upon switch out from opposing entry hazards and saving Skarmory from status for a turn can mean getting up the extra Spike or Stealth Rock the team needs. Skarmory can also use a resistance berry such as Wacan Berry to set up two entry hazards on Magnezone or Occa Berry to set up hazards on Life Orb Flygon and other powerful Fire-type attacks. These items are especially helpful if Skarmory isn't leading.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory generally uses Taunt on slower entry hazard leads such as Nidoqueen and Hippowdon while setting up as many hazards as it can. As the standard wall can also lead to get entry hazards early, the two sets are indistinguishable until Skarmory reveals Taunt or outspeeds the opponent. This set also doesn't have to lead, which makes it more difficult to tell what it is. Whether or not to Taunt depends on how weak Skarmory's team is to Stealth Rock, how threatening the opposing lead is, and the likelihood to get entry hazards up later. If Skarmory's team has multiple Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Gyarados, Zapdos, and Dragonite, it should be aggressive to Taunt potential Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, and Swampert—even if they switch out due to being walled, Skarmory has prevented Stealth Rock from going up. If the team isn't as weak to Stealth Rock, Skarmory should forgo Taunt and just set up entry hazards without regard to its own health, as without any recovery or phazing moves, Skarmory isn't going to be walling much for long. Skarmory will only rarely use Brave Bird or Drill Peck: generally only if the opponent is weak to it, it gets hit by a Taunt, or wants to attack before fainting. Skarmory has little midgame utility as it can't phaze, so once it has set up entry hazards, freely sacrificing it or letting it faint so a sweeper can switch in freely is advised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Skarmory generally is only featured on hyper offense teams that wants Spikes and Skarmory's defensive prowess over the Speed and Explosion something like Azelf provides. Skarmory hyper offenses also aren't as all out as some other hyper offenses, due to how much momentum is lost should the hazards get spun away. Common Skarmory partners such as Tyranitar and Rotom-A are good partners, however, they generally run more offensive sets such as Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf, respectively, to match the pace of the team. Tyranitar can also run a Substitute + Focus Punch set to take advantage of forced switches and open up the more defensive teams this set struggles with. Due to Taunt, Skarmory can support offensive Gyarados and Dragonite sets effectively by preventing Stealth Rock while matching the pace of the team. Both enjoy entry hazards to break down walls more easily. Another good partner is mixed Flygon, as it switches in on Skarmory's weaknesses and enjoys entry hazards to break down walls for teammates. Other main stays of hyper offense such as Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Empoleon, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Scizor are good teammates. These Pokemon are also all Steel-types, and since Skarmory will often bait in Magnezone, the opponent might let Magnezone faint to deal with a sweeper such as Tyranitar. This prevents Magnezone from revenging these Pokemon. Of these, Lucario is especially threatening, as because this Skarmory generally forces a Ghost-type to keep up hazards, should Tyranitar Pursuit Rotom-A, Lucario gets free set up to ravage the opposing team. Other offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, and Swampert can fit well alongside this Skarmory, but generally prefer a bulkier Skarmory with recovery.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra marks its niche in DPP OU by being the best rain sweeper and an all around vicious attacker. Kingdra's excellent Water / Dragon typing, balanced stat distribution, and Swift Swim make it a terrific Choice Specs user. Kingdra is terrifying under rain and even outside of it, as its strong Water and Dragon STAB moves hits everything neutrally in OU besides Empoleon, it has a decent Speed tier, and bulky Pokemon such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Gyarados struggle to take it on. With rain support, Kingdra outspeeds everything in the tier and a rain-boosted Choice Specs Hydro Pump is really only stomached well by Blissey and Water Absorb Pokemon such as Quagsire and Vaporeon. Even specially bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as defensive Latias (who is OHKOed by Draco Meteor) and specially defensive Empoleon are 3HKOed. Kingdra's speed and power under rain almost single handedly makes creating a rain infrastructure worth it, as it can mow down offensive teams that don't pack weather changers like Tyranitar and Abomasnow due to outspeeding all relevant Choice Scarf users, being bulky enough to survive priority, and easily 2HKOing even bulkier offensive Water-resistant Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Suicune with Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Kingdra also has access to Dragon Dance and excellent physical offensive options in Waterfall and Outrage. Kingdra's bulk and 4x resistance to Water- and Fire-type moves makes it a great choice on hyper offensive teams alongside Magnezone, as Kingdra can wear down answers to sweepers such as Gyarados and Swords Dance Gliscor and help absorb the defensive burden. Its naturally great coverage in two moves allows it to have a number of different utility moves such as Substitute, Rest, Rain Dance, and even Yawn. Kingdra can also manually set up Rain Dance on more specially offensive sets to act as a weather clearer and power through offensive Pokemon with rain-boosted attacks and the ability to switch moves.</p> <p>Kingdra is held back by its relatively mediocre stats, reliance on moves with low accuracy or heavy drawbacks, and vulnerability to residual damage. While Kingdra has overall solid stats, it unfortunately isn't outstanding in any department. Base 95 offensive stats really hurts it when trying to use Dragon Dance, as it simply isn't strong enough to overcome walls or even offensive Pokemon that it doesn't hit super effectively. Physically defensive Skarmory, Zapdos, and Celebi all withstand multiple hits from +1 Kingdra, while Metagross, Scizor, and Magnezone can all take at least two hits from it and retaliate—especially if it locks itself into Outrage against these Steel-types. Kingdra's Speed tier at +1 is also mediocre, as it is outsped by most common Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Rotom-A, Jirachi, Heatran, and Latias and is dealt with accordingly. Its lack of power stat also hurts it on the special side, as it is forced to use moves such as Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor. While using these moves can work when trying to wallbreak, Kingdra unfortunately just isn't strong enough to sweep using the weaker Surf and Dragon Pulse against bulkier targets such as specially defensive Skarmory, Jirachi, and Passho Berry Tyranitar, even when boosted by Choice Specs. This forces it to use more powerful options with drawbacks, where the inevitable miss or being forced out due to the stat drops is catastrophic. Kingdra also is vulnerable to all entry hazards, status, and sand, meaning that if it is forced to switch out it can struggle to get going again, both as a rain sweeper or with Dragon Dance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kingdra has many other offensive options alongside Rain Dance, such as going mixed or using Dragon Dance alongside special moves. Mixed sets allow Kingdra to get past Steel-types its physical sets struggle with and nail special walls with Waterfall. Unfortunately, Kingdra doesn’t have the raw offensive stats to pull off a mixed set well and it will need to eat into its good bulk to do it, as Life Orb is necessary for power. Focusing on either physical or special sets is often the best. Kingdra has a devastating Dragon Dance + RestTalk set, as its lack of weaknesses and not locking into Outrage when using Sleep Talk makes it great against defensive teams once Steel-types are gone, but it is difficult to fit all the support it needs. Kingdra is one of the best users of Yawn + Protect in the tier, as it has the coverage between Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor to afford it and it hits very hard with Life Orb boosted attacks. Kingdra's physical movepool is rather small, with niche options such as Iron Head and Bounce, but these are almost always not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: While Kingdra can hit very hard on both sides of the spectrum, it generally struggles against bulkier Pokemon who aren’t 2HKOed by Choice Specs rain boosted Hydro Pump and can retaliate. Empoleon, Celebi, Milotic, Quagsire, and Suicune can survive the attack and at least weaken or status Kingdra. Latias and Starmie do too but are obliterated by Draco Meteor. Empoleon is the only OU Pokemon that resists its STABs and can hit hard with Grass Knot or phaze Kingdra out. Other choices such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Roserade, and Slowbro can also survive one rain boosted Hydro Pump and either KO or heavily weaken Kingdra. Note that almost all of these Pokemon can deal with Dragon Dance or Rain Dance Kingdra too.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Kingdra is vulnerable to all entry hazards, status, and sand, meaning it can be chipped very easily into range of priority or other attacks. This also means that once it is forced out, it probably won't be sweeping again.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Kingdra's offensive stats let it down against generally bulky Pokemon, especially if rain is not up. Blissey is a fantastic Choice Specs Kingdra answer, while Clefable can live any one hit and neuter it. Without rain, Kingdra generally hits bulk Pokemon such as Metagross, Zapdos, and Swampert very hard but it doesn't KO them, allowing them to retaliate. Addtionally, even Pokemon weak to Water such as Heatran and Tyranitar can survive a hit with Passho Berry and either KO or heavily weaken Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Changing the weather</strong>: Robbing Choice Specs Kingdra of rain is highly useful, as it has middling Speed and can’t overwhelm Water-resistant Pokemon nearly as easily. Of Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon, Abomasnow is by far the best, as it takes Kingdra Water-type attacks well and hits hard in return, but does not enjoy Signal Beam or Draco Meteor. Passho Berry Tyranitar can survive any one hit and hit hard in return, while specially defensive Hippowdon has good odds to survive a Choice Specs Surf.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Stalling out rain or knowing what move Choice Specs Kingdra is going to use helps a lot in switching in the correct Pokemon. Common users include Jirachi, Clefable, and Bronzong.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While most Steel-types do not enjoy a rain boosted Hydro Pump, they at least can switch into Draco Meteor and Outrage and either force Kingdra out or KO it as it is locked into Outrage. Most Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, Skarmory, Magnezone, and Bronzong are comparably very good at answering physical Kingdra, as they are bulky enough to take Waterfall well, but offensive variants of these Pokemon do not enjoy Waterfall flinches.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Kingdra outspeeds all relevant Choice Scarf users in rain, but most common Choice Scarf users outspeed Dragon Dance Kingdra. Latias, Flygon, Rotom-A, Lucario, and Jirachi all outspeed it and can either heavily weaken or KO it, but all of these Pokemon need to be careful, as Kingdra can OHKO Latias and Flygon on the switch, while Rotom-A, Lucario, and Jirachi cannot OHKO it. If Kingdra hasn't set up, most of the offensive metagame such as Latias, Gengar, and Heatran outspeed it and can heavily weaken it.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kingdra’s STAB options have near perfect coverage on their own, meaning it doesn’t have to run additional coverage. This allows it to have the luxury of running both stronger options (Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor) and safer ones (Surf and Dragon Pulse). Hydro Pump hits extremely hard, OHKOing offensive Tyranitar in sand and 2HKOing even bulky neutral targets such as Clefable. Rain powers this up even further, as Kingdra can OHKO even bulkier Pokemon not resistant to Water such as defensive Jirachi, Bronzong, and Swampert. Surf is helpful when the power of Hydro Pump isn't needed or when Kingdra can't risk a miss, such as against Heatran and frailer offensive Pokemon such as Lucario and Gengar.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is in a similar situation as Hydro Pump, as while it is Kindra's strongest option, the stat drop immediately forces Kingdra out. Draco Meteor OHKOes many Pokemon resistant to Water, such as Latias, Starmie, and Gyarados after Stealth Rock. Dragon Pulse, while much weaker, still has a good chance to OHKO defensive Latias after Stealth Rock, still 2HKOes many Water-types, and is the best option against Pokemon such as Milotic that can survive Draco Meteor and heal off the damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kingdra sits at a valuable Speed tier and should not run less than 228 Speed EVs so it can outspeed Breloom and neutral-natured Gyarados. This also lets it outspeed the fastest common Choice Scarf Pokemon, Latias, in rain. Kingdra needs as much Special Attack as it can get due to its mediocre base stat, meaning a Modest nature and maximum Special Attack EVs. Kingdra can use a Timid nature to outspeed Heatran and KO it before it uses Explosion, but this greatly reduces its power. Kingdra should always use Swift Swim even if not used in rain, as the speed boost if the opponent sets up rain is more valuable than the situational 3x boost for a critical hit. Kingdra already OHKOes almost everything in the tier anyway with a critical hit and the extra boost is gratuitous—an example of its absurd power is a Sniper critical hit Draco Meteor OHKOes Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingdra’s 4x resistance to Water and Fire gives it great opportunities to in on Starmie, most Gyarados, Choiced Latias using Surf, and Heatran and bring some pain. Kingdra also can switch in on entry hazards and some set up moves such as Gyarados’s Dragon Dance, Suicune’s Calm Mind, and Scizor’s Swords Dance and if not KO, heavily weaken the foe due to its bulk and power. Kingdra can get a lot of value predicting switches, as only Pokemon such as specially defensive Empoleon, Milotic, and Blissey avoid getting 2HKOed by the appropriate move. OHKOing Latias with Draco Meteor or devastating Steel-types or Clefable with Hydro Pump can really open up defensive and offensive teams alike for Kingdra and its teammates.</p> <p>In the context of a rain team, Kingdra generally is the first rain sweeper to bring out once rain is set up, as it hits insanely hard and can open up the opposing team for other rain sweepers. Kingdra should generally just use Hydro Pump or Surf, as the additional rain boost nails even offensive Water-resistant foes and hits Tyranitar and Hippowdon extremely hard should they try to change the weather. Try to keep Kingdra away from Protect users and paralysis, as it it easily revenge killed when rain ends or it doesn’t have a speed boost. If Kingdra has the opportunity to sweep, knowing the damage ranges of Surf so it doesn’t have to risk missing Hydro Pump is quite valuable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kingdra is excellent as either a general wallbreaker or as a rain threat. Outside of a rain context, Kingdra doesn’t need much support, as its goal is to wallbreak and act as a utility counter with its bulk, power, and Speed. Additional Water-types such as Gyarados, Empoleon, Swampert, and Suicune are good partners for it, as they can take advantage of the holes it creates. Kingdra really enjoys teammates that bait in Fire- and Water-type attacks. Some of its best partners are Steel-types and Tyranitar that not only can switch into Dragon-type moves, but also entice Choice Specs Latias to use Surf. Heatran, Metagross, Jirachi, Scizor, and Bronzong are fantastic choices. Offensive Focus Sash Heatran is a particular adept partner, as it can use Explosion on special walls and appreciates the support against Water-types. Kingdra also is good alongside Choice Scarf Latias, as it can batter Steel-types and enjoys Latias giving it a fail safe should foes try to set up on -2 Draco Meteor. Other Pokemon that appreciate Kingdra’s resistance palette and wall breaking include Breloom, Gliscor, and Gengar.</p> <p>For rain teams, Kingdra really appreciates bulky supporters that switch into Dragon-type moves to set up rain and additional rain sweepers. Bronzong is its most common partner on these teams due to its bulk and resistances, but Uxie, Azelf, Cresselia, Jirachi, and Scizor are all good partners. Kingdra can support a diverse array of offensive teammates, as their primary goal should be to both remove Tyranitar and bulky pivots into Water-type moves. Qwilfish and Ludicolo are the most common rain sweepers alongside Kingdra, as Qwilfish absorbs Toxic Spikes, has a diverse movepool, and is a strong physical compliment to Kingdra. On the other hand, Ludicolo’s strong Grass-type coverage hits Quagsire and other Water-types extremely hard. For non-Swift Swim Pokemon Heatran, Latias, Metagross, and Rotom-W are all solid partners, whereas Substitute Gyarados and Suicune appreciate Kingdra power through Water-resistant foes and weather clear.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kingdra’s bulk, lack of weaknesses, and offensive threat level generally lets it get a Dragon Dance. As special Kingdra especially outside of rain is more common, this potentially lets Kingdra surprise foes with speed and power. Waterfall is Kingdra’s only physical Water-type attack and is the most reliable option. It also has a prominent flinch chance, letting Kingdra potentially bypass bulkier answers like Metagross and Scizor. Outrage makes up for Kingdra’s mediocre Attack stat by hitting neutral targets very hard, 2HKOing most bulky Pokemon such as physically Zapdos and Swampert. While Kingdra doesn’t generally OHKO foes at +1 or even +2, its bulk generally affords it the opportunity to get another attack off.</p> <p>Kingdra’s lack of good physical options outside of these STAB moves and good coverage affords it many other utility moves. The most prominent of these is Substitute, as the ability to both block status and potentially get a Substitute when a foe tries to bait Kingdra to use Outrage is excellent. Rest is another good option, as Kingdra can take quite a bit of residual damage setting up and can wake itself up with the Lum Berry. Rain Dance acts as a pseudo-second Dragon Dance, as the boost in Speed and Waterfall is more than using Dragon Dance again and also clears the weather.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kingdra should in general run at least 228 Speed EVs and as much Attack EVs as possible to outspeed Choice Latias at +2 and make up for its mediocre Attack stat. However, especially with Rest, Kingdra can invest in its bulk to get more Dragon Dances before it needs to use Rest and better check offensive Water-types such as offensive Suicune and Starmie. An example EV spread that does this is 136 HP / 140 Atk / 228 Spe. Note that Kingdra can run as low as 164 Speed EVs to outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar at +1 and Choice Scarf Flygon at +2, but the prospect of being revenge killed by Choice Scarf Latias is underwhelming.</p> <p>The item of choice is most often Lum Berry, as it not only cures confusion from Outrage, but also lets Kingdra set up on faster status users with Substitute as well as wake it up from Rest. However, Leftovers is another great option with Substitute to mitigate residual damage. Kingdra can also use a Chesto Berry with Rest so it doesn’t burn the Berry before it needs to Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Kingdra can sweep, it typically trades damage with physical walls, sponges Fire- and Water-type attacks, and can potentially absorb status if played carefully with Substitute or Rest. To that end, Kingdra wants to stay relatively healthy, as switch in opportunities such as Heatran or offensive Calm Mind Suicune can still hit it hard if they predict Kingdra coming in. To that end, Kingdra often baits these Pokemon to trade with it, potentially opening up another Pokemon such as Gyarados or Scizor. The reason for this is that the only two revenge killers faster than Kingdra that can OHKO it without Explosion are Choice Scarf Flygon and Latias, both of whom risk being OHKOed by Outrage on the switch in or struggle with Rain Dance Kingdra. Additionally, Kingdra is a rather committal attacker; once it starts using Dragon Dance, it often will stay in until it faints, as it can struggle to set up again due to residual damage.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, Kingdra enjoys Steel-types either heavily weakened or removed first, as its STAB combination simply doesn't hit hard enough to threaten them. Jirachi, Metagross, Scizor, and Empoleon all can absorb Kingdra's even boosted attacks and either phaze it out or KO it. Once these are gone, opponents typically try to beat Kingdra either with Explosion (giving you a chance to block it with Substitute) or by trading a physical wall such as Swampert or Zapdos with it. Take advantage of this to open up attackers such as Metagross or Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Kingdra is almost always used alongside Magnezone, as physical Kingdra struggles broadly to beat Steel-types. Skarmory, Jirachi, and Metagross are the big ones, but most bulkier Steel-types can survive multiple +1 Waterfalls and retaliate. Lum Berry Kingdra also generally struggles to beat bulkier Pokemon, as it doesn’t hit very hard even when boosted. An example is that Kingdra isn’t even guaranteed to OHKO physically defensive Zapdos with Outrage at +3. Using Kingdra alongside other stallbreakers such as Will-O-Wisp Gengar and Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar as well as good offensive Pokemon such as Metagross, Gyarados, and Swords Dance Gliscor helps a lot, while Kingdra is great against offensive Water-types there Pokemon often struggle against.</p> <p>Kingdra also appreciate teammates that bait in Fire- and Water-type moves to give Kingdra a chance to set up. Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, and Heatran. Kingdra can work on rain infrastructures, most often alongside Magnezone and a bulky win condition such as Heal Bell + Dragon Dance Dragonite to take advantage of trapped Steel-types and clear the weather. Leftovers Substitute + Dragon Dance Kingdra can also work as a win condition on Magnezone stall teams alongside teammates such as physically defensive Celebi and Clefable, as it provides a strong Water- and Fire-type resist, but it is hard to fit all of the support it needs.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Kingdra can manually set up rain itself, as this gives it the flexibility of taking advantage of frailer teams without bulky Water-resistant Pokemon while being able to switch moves. A rain boosted Hydro Pump is really strong, OHKOing Tyranitar without bulk after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing bulkier Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Scizor. Kingdra can use Surf for reliability, but sorely misses the power and doesn't have a lot of survivability anyway. Unlike other Water-types such as Suicune, Gyarados, and Empoleon, Kingdra can nail most Water-resistant Pokemon with move in Draco Meteor, which obliterates common Pokemon such as Latias, Abomasnow, and Starmie. Kingdra needs the power of Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse, as these Pokemon all survive one Dragon Pulse and can either KO or status Kingdra.</p> <p>The last move slot is reserved for ways Water-resistant Pokemon without relying on Draco Meteor. The most common option is Signal Beam, as it OHKOes Celebi after Stealth Rock, something none of its other moves can accomplish. Another option is Hidden Power Electric, as it is Kingdra's strongest move against Gyarados and Empoleon. Note that Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor often outdamage Hidden Power Electric except against these specific targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kingdra needs all the power and Speed it can get, especially since it needs to use a turn setting up Rain Dance. The best item for Kingdra is often Life Orb, as really appreciates the extra power to OHKO Starmie and Gyarados after Stealth Rock with Draco Meteor. Kingdra can leverage its natural bulk to mitigate the residual damage, and once it sets up Rain Damage, often only takes damage from priority. Mystic Water is another option to preserve Kingdra's bulk, but it really misses the boost to Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump at the same time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingdra wants to come in relatively unscathed and use Rain Dance, as it gets chipped very easily by entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and sand. Try to get Kingdra in on predicted switches, weaker Fire- and Water-type attacks, and on sacrifices. Once Kingdra has set up Rain Dance, it outspeeds everything in the tier and hits very hard. However, Kingdra needs to be very careful about when it uses Draco Meteor, as if it is used at the right time, it'll heavily weaken a threat. However, it also is forced out immediately due to the stat drop and Kingdra already struggles with residual damage whenever it comes in again. This sets up a situation where Kingdra both wants to wait until it hits the ideal target with Draco Meteor all the while it is getting worn down and doesn't have many turns of rain to begin with. This leads to a situation where Kingdra typically only gets one or at most two shots with Rain Dance, so try to mitigate potential threats to it before it comes in, such as weakening Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow and Water-resistant foes that make it use Draco Meteor. Note that if Kingdra can remove these weather Pokemon and then set up rain, it can permanently remove the weather and potentially accomplish its task.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain Dance Kingdra generally fits best outside of full rain structures as an offensive weather clearer, as it both lets up momentum too easily when it uses Draco Meteor and is vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority once it is chipped down via Life Orb and residual damage. Some of Kingdra best partners are sand vulnerable Pokemon such as Suicune, as these Pokemon really enjoy their Leftovers recovery and can synergistically KO weather Pokemon with Kingdra. Additionally, strong offensive Pokemon such as Heatran and Gengar can potentially bait in special walls such as Clefable and KO them with Explosion or strong attacks. Both Heatran and Gengar are potentially strong against the Steel-types that absorb Kingdra's attacks, as Heatran directly counters most of them and Gengar can chip them enough so that Hydro Pump OHKOes them. Kingdra also works well alongside Water-types such as Agility Empoleon, Gyarados and offensive Suicune, as it can synergistically weaken their checks to allow one of them to sweep.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>Donphan fulfills its niche as one of the rare Rapid Spinners in DPP OU and the only one with a significant physical presence. With its pure Ground-typing, meaty physical stats, and versatile movepool, Donphan can fulfill defensive roles against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite while, with cleric support and Odor Sleuth, it is the only spinner who can reliably Rapid Spin against Rotom-A. Even without this support, Donphan can harass more offensive Rotom-A and Gengar with tools such as Knock Off, Assurance, and Head Smash. Donphan’s utility movepool and access to Stealth Rock make it an excellent option on more offensive teams that can’t afford a Taunt anti-lead and need entry hazard relief for teammates such as Gyarados, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Machamp. On the other hand, when paired with another Rapid Spinner such as Starmie or Forretress, it provides unparalleled support for defensive Pokemon debilitated by entry hazards such as Blissey, Abomasnow, Togekiss, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the reason why it needs an additional Rapid Spin user are because it is unreliable on its own against Ghost-types, its slow Speed and low Special Defense, the many moves it wants to use, and its debilitating weakness to Toxic Spikes and residual damage in general. Even though it can hurt Gengar and Rotom-A if it predicts the switch in and has the right move, they still can completely ruin Donphan, as it despises being burned. Gengar in particular is very difficult for Donphan to beat, as it takes advantage of its low Special Defense and Donphan doesn’t often have moves to hurt it effectively. Donphan often wants more than four moves, as it needs Odor Sleuth and Rest to Rapid Spin reliably against Rotom-A, but wants all of Ice Shard to help with Dragonite and hit Pokemon immune to Earthquake, Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and offensive moves such as Assurance and Head Smash. Lacking these moves significantly increases how many Pokemon can switch into Donphan. Additionally, most special attackers 2HKO Donphan, making it harder for it to do its job. Donphan is completely ruined by Toxic Spikes, as it has no way to rid itself of status besides Rest. It also does not have reliable recovery, struggles to fit Protect or Rest, and is worn down by the Spikes it tries to Rapid Spin, meaning it needs significant support to do its job reliably.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Donphan has a surprisingly good movepool with numerous options like Counter, Seed Bomb, and Roar, but these typically aren’t solid enough to use consistently. More defensive Donphan with Rest can use Magnitude over Earthquake, as it has 3x the PP and on average it does enough damage. Donphan can also use RestTalk for more consistent recovery or Choice Band, but neither are effective in facilitating it using Rapid Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Rotom-A are very annoying, as they’re immune to Rapid Spin and Earthquake, burn Donphan to make it useless without Rest, and hit it hard on its lower Special Defense stat. While Donphan can hit then hard with Assurance and bypass them with Odor Sleuth, Donphan takes too much damage from them if it can’t hit them on the switch. Without Odor Sleuth, defensive Rotom-A sits on Donphan, as Donphan can’t 3HKO it without a Choice Band.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Donphan absolutely despises Toxic Spikes, as it is not immune to them and has no way to rid itself of status besides Rest. Without Rest or Heal Bell support, Donphan is hampered for the rest of the game even with one layer.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Donphan really struggles to deal with especially special Water-types. Most Water-types outspeed Donphan, are not overly threatened by Earthquake, and KO back. Gyarados, Swampert, Starmie, Suicune, Kingdra, Milotic, and Quagsire all threaten Donphan, but don’t stop it from using Rapid Spin. Donphan can survive physical Water-type moves, but often can only survive one.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Donphan loathes to take on Grass-types, as they outspeed it and destroy it. Breloom easily generates momentum on Donphan with Spore and Seed Bomb, although it doesn’t OHKO. Roserade, Celebi, Shaymin, and Abomasnow destroy Donphan, although it can survive defensive Celebi’s Grass Knot with sand and Solid Rock. Abomasnow’s hail hampers Donphan’s passive recovery.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Donphan is grounded and vulnerable to all status. Toxic and burn completely ruin it, while the entry hazards it is trying to Rapid Spin away chip it down, especially if it is hit by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Most special attackers have a move that can hit Donphan hard. Without full special defensive investment, Donphan is at least 2HKOed by special attackers such as Latias, Heatran, and Zapdos. Grass Knot from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Infernape in particular is devastating to Donphan.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types not weak to Earthquake</strong>: Skarmory and Bronzong completely wall Donphan, although they struggle to do much back if it has Rest.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Beyond the obligatory Rapid Spin, Earthquake gives Donphan the power to threaten Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Lucario, as it generally at least 2HKOes foes weak to it. Donphan’s physical bulk and the threat of Rapid Spin affords it the turn it needs to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>As Donphan only needs Earthquake and Rapid Spin, it has a wide variety of available options, especially if another Pokemon can set up Stealth Rock. Odor Sleuth is excellent for more defensive approaches, as it guarantees Donphan will be able to use Rapid Spin, even against Ghost-types, especially when paired with Rest to heal off burns and keep Donphan alive against residual damage. Ice Shard is effective on more offensive slants, as despite the fact it’s weak, it gives almost perfect coverage and helps to revenge kill foes 4x weak to it like Dragonite, Flygon, and Gliscor.</p> <p>Knock Off is also very effective at removing items from Ghost-types and other Ground-immune Pokemon. It also helps break opposing Donphan. With Stealth Rock up, Assurance is an excellent option to hit Ghost-types on the switch, as it OHKOes Gengar and offensive Rotom-A. Unfortunately it doesn’t do enough damage to them if Donphan doesn’t predict the switch-in due to the power loss. Head Smash is another option, as hits Gengar and Gyarados very hard, but the accuracy and recoil are painful and it doesn’t have much utility against defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As Donphan only needs 252 HP EVs to do its job, it has a wide variety of available EV spreads. That said, maximum Defense EVs and an Impish nature is very helpful to help it against Tyranitar, physical Dragonite, Metagross, and Jirachi, as the increased bulk allows Donphan to withstand multiple attacks against Dragon Dance and other physical sweepers and either retaliate or Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Donphan can also fully invest in its Special Defense with a Careful nature to better survive attacks from Gengar, Rotom-A, and Heatran, but the loss in physical bulk is noticeable. Donphan can also use an Adamant nature and heavy Defense investment, especially with Assurance or Head Smash, as the nature guarantees an OHKO on Gengar while KOing Rotom-A on the next switch in of Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How Donphan should be played generally depends on if it has Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock Donphan typically hits the field fairly early to set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon that don't threaten it very much such as Tyranitar. However, without Stealth Rock or if Stealth Rock is already up, Donphan typically is played more cautiously, as it has lopsided defensive stats and despises status and residual damage. Donphan's teammates typically don't 100% need Stealth Rock off at all times; KOing or otherwise heavily weakening the opposing entry hazard user and then sending in Donphan to spin away the entry hazards can make Donphan's job way easier. However, if Donphan is needed defensively, do not hesitate to send it in, as a full health physically Donphan will stop most physical sweepers besides Gyarados. Predicting Ghost-types switching in can be very helpful in weakening them, regardless if Donphan has Assurance or not. If Toxic Spikes are up and Donphan doesn't have Rest, be very careful about when you decide to send it in, as you can only remove them once before Donphan is permanently incapacitated.</p> <p>For more defensive teams with two Rapid Spin users, Donphan should often be the second one sent in, as both Forretress and Starmie better handle Ghost-types. Before Donphan's two additional moves are revealed, they can potentially catch the opponent offguard, so don't hesitate to take advantage of this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Donphan is highly effective on more balanced teams to support offensive threats such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Specs Heatran, and Choice Specs Empoleon alongside a strong defensive core. It also is very effective supporting Pokemon like Machamp and Gyarados alongside paralysis support, and with another spinner such as Starmie or Forretress to support Pokemon debilitated by entry hazards such as Zapdos, Abomasnow, and Togekiss.</p> <p>Donphan is fantastic alongside physically defensive Zapdos, as it can Rapid Spin for it, Donphan helps against Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Zapdos covers many Water- and Grass-types Donphan loathes to take on. Jirachi is also an excellent partner, as Donphan removes Spikes and Jirachi is bulky enough to deal with many special attackers such as Latias and can provide Wish support for Donphan. This partnership is fantastic in supporting strong Choiced wall breakers, as Zapdos, Donphan, and Jirachi cover much of the metagame between them. Choice Band Tyranitar and Choice Specs Heatran are fantastic against Rotom-A, as Tyranitar traps it and Heatran gets a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp. Bulkier Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro are also excellent partners to give a sturdy Water- and Fire- resistance as well as spread paralysis.</p> <p>For more offensive partners, Gyarados and Machamp are excellent options. Removing entry hazards are paramount for these Pokemon, especially Stealth Rock for Gyarados and (Toxic) Spikes for Machamp. In return, they provide offensive pressure and potentially KO entry hazards users so Donphan doesn’t have to Rapid Spin them away again. Donphan also supports Choice Scarf Latias well due to handling Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Another way to help Donphan clear Stealth Rock is to either use a Trick + Choice Scarf lead such as Uxie, Metagross, Azelf, or Latias, or use Magnezone or Magneton to trap them. Locking often slower Stealth Rock users into a move or trapping Steel-types helps Donphan a lot in removing entry hazards.</p> <p>For more defensive teams, Donphan can support teammates heavily hampered by entry hazards. More defensive partners such as Clefable and Blissey are excellent partners, as they can potentially use Heal Bell for Rest Donphan. Other Rapid Spin partners such as Tentacruel can work, as can Pokemon that don’t enjoy Spikes and let them up easily such as Swords Dance Breloom and Calm Mind + Rest Suicune. Donphan can potentially support very uncommon Pokemon such as Moltres, Registeel, and Yanmega deal with entry hazards.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though Porygon2 is an NFE Pokemon, it can still shine in the OU tier due to its ability to check common threats. Its Trace ability allows it to copy the ability of any Pokemon it switches into; this is extremely useful, as it gives the defensive duck a unique niche in the OU metagame. Porygon2 can also be employed as an excellent support Pokemon on a dedicated Trick Room team, as it is able to both set up Trick Room and take advantage of its effects. Even though Porygon2's defensive stats are good, they are by no means great, so Porygon2 will often struggle with powerful STAB attacks from threats such as Shaymin. Additionally, while Porygon2's Normal typing affords only one weakness to Fighting-type attacks, any Pokemon who utilizes Fighting-type attacks will often be able to deal significant damage to it. Despite these drawbacks, Porygon2's unique abilities make it a solid choice on any OU team in need of its specific services.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Counter": {
        "description": "<p>Don't let Porygon2's NFE status fool you; with its decent defensive stats and rare ability, Trace, Porygon2 can be an effective check to a multitude of common OU threats. Examples of such threats include, but are not limited to, Heatran, Gyarados, and Jolteon. However, the aforementioned Pokemon aren't the only Pokemon whom Porygon2 can check, as the defensive duck's Normal typing only comes with one weakness: Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Recover allows Porygon2 to regenerate 50% of its HP in one turn and, as such, is its most reliable means of recovery. Thunderbolt is the primary option in the second moveslot as it is more powerful than its counterpart, Discharge. However, Discharge has a neat 30% paralysis rate and only slightly less Base Power than Thunderbolt, so it is still a viable option. Ice Beam allows Porygon2 to deal solid damage to Dragon- and Ground-types, such as Dragonite or Hippowdon. It also gives Porygon2 a means of harming Jolteon, who is immune to Thunderbolt (and Discharge). In the final moveslot, Porygon2 has your preferred status move. Thunder Wave is great for paralyzing fast switch-ins like Lucario and Jirachi, while Toxic is useful as it enables Porygon2 to bring down more defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Swampert.</p> <p>This set's EV spread is fairly simple: 252 HP EVs let Porygon2 take both physical and special hits well, while 216 Defense EVs and a Bold nature give it plenty of physical bulk. 40 Special Attack EVs are used as they secure the OHKO on Gyarados with Discharge (after Stealth Rock damage). Leftovers is by far the best item choice as it grants Porygon2 constant HP recovery, which will often mean the difference between a 2HKO and a 3HKO.</p> <p>Even though Porygon2 is a defensive Pokemon, it is best used as a defensive pivot on offensive teams that have a weakness to Pokemon like Gyarados and Heatran. Teams that carry Choice Band Scizor will greatly appreciate Porygon2's ability to check two of Choice Band Scizor's most common switch-ins; teams with Breloom are in a similar position. Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Lucario, have a relatively easy time with Porygon2, as they are able to OHKO it with their STAB attacks. With their Fighting typing and immunity to status due to Guts, Machamp and Heracross are able to easily obliterate Porygon2. As such, teammates who can absorb the STAB Fighting-type attacks of the aforementioned Pokemon make excellent partners for this set. Gyarados is probably Porygon2's best teammate, as he can easily switch in on Fighting-type attacks and set up with Dragon Dance. Gengar is also an excellent choice, being immune to Fighting-type attacks and able to wear down the opposition with his powerful special attacks. In general, this Porygon2 variant doesn't require a lot of team support, as it mainly supports its team instead. However, make sure that you aren't just randomly throwing Porygon2 onto your team; it must be used on a team with weaknesses to Pokemon like Heatran, Gyarados, and Jolteon if you are to use Porygon2 to its full potential.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes are a gigantic thorn in Porygon2's side, so having a teammate who can get rid of them is extremely helpful. Rapid Spinners, such as Starmie and Forretress, can easily dispose of the hazard; grounded Poison-types like Roserade and Tentacruel can also absorb Toxic Spikes upon entry. Additionally, Roserade and Tentacruel can set up Toxic Spikes of their own, allowing Porygon2 to break past bulkier Pokemon such as Swampert, Suicune, and Blissey. Porygon2 also has good defensive synergy with the aforementioned Poison-types, as they pack a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, Porygon2's only weakness.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its excellent defensive capabilities and access to Recover, Porygon2 is a wonderful support Pokemon on a dedicated Trick Room team. Trace allows Porygon2 to switch in on a multitude of threats, such as Heatran and Jolteon, with total impunity. It can then proceed to set up Trick Room and take advantage of its effects. While common Pokemon like Lucario and Infernape can immediately threaten this Porygon2 variant, Porygon2 only needs one turn to set up Trick Room; after it has done this, you can simply switch to a teammate who can take advantage of Trick Room. Aside from its defensive capabilities, the main reason that one would use Porygon2 over another Trick Room supporter is that Porygon2 lacks Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses, something that several common Trick Room users are plagued by.</p> <p>There are a few unique options that Porygon2 can take advantage of if you would like to use it in a more offensive light. Download can be used instead of Trace as Porygon2's ability, as this will allow Porygon2 to obtain potential Special Attack boosts. Additionally, Life Orb can be utilized to give Porygon2's attacks more of a kick. While an offensive Porygon2 isn't as powerful as other notable Trick Room sweepers like the deadly Machamp, Porygon2's bulk and ability to be both a Trick Room supporter and sweeper grants an offensive set its own niche on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>The EV spread may look complicated, but it is really quite simple. 252 HP EVs allow for good overall bulk, while 120 Defense EVs let Porygon2 take powerful physical hits while it sets up Trick Room. 136 Special Attack EVs are used to give Porygon2 a bigger offensive boost, and a Quiet nature is used to raise Porygon2's Special Attack while simultaneously lowering its Speed, granting it a higher chance of moving first in Trick Room. 0 Speed IVs are used to ensure that Porygon2 will outspeed almost every Pokemon once Trick Room is up. While the aforementioned EV spread is the most versatile, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpA with a Relaxed nature is quite useable if your team happens to need a more reliable check to Gyarados.</p> <p>Two of the most common Trick Room Porygon2 switch-ins are Blissey and Tyranitar. Both Pokemon threaten Porygon2 in their own way; Blissey sponges all of Porygon2's moves with ease, while Tyranitar takes a pittance from all of Porygon2's attacks and can set up with Dragon Dance or spam STAB Stone Edge. In order to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon, specific teammates should be utilized. Rhyperior is an excellent choice, capable of threatening both Tyranitar and Blissey with his STAB attacks. Additionally, Rhyperior is extraordinarily slow and, as such, can easily take advantage of Trick Room. For similar reasons, Machamp is also an excellent choice. Seeing as Porygon2's chief role is to set up Trick Room, it only makes sense to pack teammates who can take advantage of it. Examples of such teammates include, but are not limited to: Rhyperior, Machamp, Rampardos, and Snorlax. However, any moderately slow Pokemon can take advantage of Trick Room just as the previously mentioned powerhouses do, so potential teammates for this Porygon2 variant are as endless as the horizon.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>For an NFE Pokemon, Porygon2 has an incredible movepool; therefore, there are a multitude of other options that it can utilize. Recycle is an interesting move that can allow Porygon2 to reuse any Berry, whether it is the HP-restoring Sitrus Berry, the PP-replenishing Leppa Berry, or the always-useful Lum Berry. A Choice Specs + Trick set can be used to take advantage of Porygon2's good Special Attack stat while being able to cripple Blissey. In a similar manner, Pain Split can be utilized to let Porygon2 get past Blissey much more easily. Tri Attack is a reliable STAB move that may see some use, but Porygon2 is often better off using specialized moves like Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Hidden Power Ground and Fire can hurt Steel-types, who will otherwise have no difficulty switching in. Psychic and Shadow Ball are alternative attacking options that provide coverage on Fighting- and Ghost-types, respectively, but Porygon2 is usually better off with its other moves. Porygon2 also has a few uncommon support moves that it can use, most notably Psych Up and Magic Coat. Psych Up allows Porygon2 to copy opposing sweepers' stat boosts, and Magic Coat lets it bounce harmful status moves back at the users. While Porygon2 isn't much of a sweeper, Charge Beam, Agility, and Sharpen can be used as boosting moves if you want to try to utilize it in a more offensive role. Finally, a specially defensive EV spread may see use on sets that focus more on countering Heatran and Jolteon than physical attackers. Keep in mind that if you do use a specially defensive spread, Porygon2 will not be able to check physical sweepers like Gyarados as easily, so you must be much more careful when switching in on them.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Porygon2 is somewhat difficult to switch into, as it has a habit of spreading crippling status conditions. Despite this, there are a few Pokemon who, once in, can really hurt it. Heracross, Machamp, and Lucario can smack Porygon2 around with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Tyranitar isn't hurt badly by any of Porygon2's attacking options thanks to his sandstorm-boosted Special Defense stat, and can smash Porygon2 with Superpower (or STAB Stone Edge). Keep in mind that all of the aforementioned Pokemon risk being crippled by a potential Thunder Wave on the switch-in (with the exception of Heracross and Machamp, who can abuse status with their Guts ability), so tread carefully. Blissey can sponge all of Porygon2's attacks with total impunity thanks to her massive Special Defense and HP stats. Jirachi can cause major problems, as the most that Porygon2 can attempt to do is paralyze it (which won't even affect Substitute variants). Finally, while Porygon2 is a sturdy check to Pokemon such as Heatran, Jolteon, and Vaporeon, keep in mind that it is vulnerable to their assaults if it does not Trace their abilities first.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is somewhat of an anomaly in the world of competitive Pokemon. It has the lowest BST of all OU--and even UU--Pokemon, and seems it like it could do something by having a movepool that quite literally expands ad infinitum. Knowing every single move in the game and having a decent Speed stat potentially gives it a niche as a disabler, as it is faster than common leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl with a Choice Scarf and then can put something to sleep, set up entry hazards, pivot out with U-turn, or ruin a wall with Trick. With access to rare support moves like Lunar Dance, Rapid Spin, and Spikes, Smeargle can provide unpredictable support for hyper offensive teams that other leads such as Skarmory and Roserade fail to provide.</p> <p>Unfortunately, those abysmally low stats truly do haunt Smeargle, and as a result, it struggles to adapt to the lead metagame. Smeargle's defensive stats are so low it cannot switch into any attack it isn't immune to and, as such, is almost solely used as a lead. Smeargle is much more reliant on what the opponent leads with than most other leads: Smeargle cannot deal with opposing Pokemon with a Lum Berry such as Metagross, Machamp, and some Azelf, as it has almost no offensive presence without Spore. Additionally, while it is fast enough for slower leads such as Hippowdon and Swampert, it needs a Choice Scarf to avoid getting shut down completely by Azelf, Aerodactyl, Roserade, Choice Scarf Breloom, and Taunt Heatran. However, if it does not hold a Focus Sash, it simply gets OHKOed by almost any attack, meaning foes can just stay in and wait to wake up. While Smeargle has access to every valuable support move, with the pace of the metagame, it struggles to use more than one or two moves after it puts something to sleep, especially if it is locked into Spore. Above all of this, if Smeargle's entry hazards get spun away, all of its work is for naught. While Smeargle can adapt to specific leads, such as using Counter + Focus Sash in tandem with Own Tempo to KO Machamp, Explosion to deny Rapid Spin and heavily weaken offensive Pokemon like Latias, and Trick Room + Endeavor to take advantage of offensive Pokemon without priority, it struggles to have a universal set to perform against most leads. Because of this, it is relegated to the bottom of DPP OU as an unconventional lead not recommended for most games.</p>",

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey's enormous base 255 HP and large base 135 Special Defense stats just scream special wall; in fact, it has the most special bulk in the game and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled. Blissey is so bulky that even extremely strong or boosting special attackers such as Choice Specs Heatran, Choice Specs Latias, Choice Specs Kingdra in rain, Gengar, Starmie, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Calm Mind Suicune, and Substitute + Petaya Berry Empoleon are unable to break through it. This walling prowess allows it to spread status effectively via Thunder Wave and Toxic or take advantage of its huge support movepool with options such as Stealth Rock, Heal Bell, and Wish. Despite its lopsided stat distribution, it has more physical bulk than Clefable when fully invested and can spread status to physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Gyarados that cannot OHKO it.</p> <p>Blissey has been usurped by Clefable as a special wall due to Blissey's massive weakness to residual damage. Clefable's immunity to this residual damage and access to more utility moves such as Knock Off and Encore largely outclass Blissey's astronomical bulk. Blissey's vulnerability to all three entry hazards, sand, and status compromise its bulk and wear it down quickly. Blissey especially struggles with offensive pressure from attackers such as Breloom, mixed Flygon, and Tyranitar when backed by Spikes, forcing either Rapid Spin support or another way to mitigate entry hazards. Blissey also can easily be taken advantage of via Trick, Explosion, Taunt, Ghost-types with Substitute, and Lum Berry, as its offensive options are very weak and it can't afford to be locked into one attack. Blissey despises Fighting-types, as Machamp, Breloom, Infernape, and Lucario all OHKO it after Stealth Rock and force it out. Fighting-type coverage also is very common and attackers such Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Scizor can devastate it with Superpower. Blissey does not enjoy repeatedly dealing with physical attackers such as Gyarados, Metagross, and Swampert, especially if they can mitigate status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey has a humongous movepool, and can always use Heal Bell, Toxic, Sing, Flamethrower, Thunder, and Thunderbolt over Stealth Rock should Blissey not need to set it up. Heal Bell is fantastic on more defensive teams, as it can heal status and gets many opportunities to do so. Toxic allows Blissey to more actively pressure foes, as it has enough bulk to Toxic stall. It does nothing to help against the many Steel-types trying to set up on it, however. Sing is another status move that while it has low accuracy, has high payoff if it does hit and Blissey's bulk gives it chances to use it multiple times. Flamethrower can heavily damage Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, Lucario, and Forretress. Thunder gives Blissey an OHKO on Gyarados and a 2HKO on Skarmory and Starmie, while Thunderbolt more reliably hits these Pokemon. However, the most valuable asset of Thunder is its paralysis chance, which can be further boosted with Serene Grace. This allows it to compress Thunder Wave and an offensive move into one moveslot, letting it use a utility option. Blissey can even use Ice Beam and Thunder as its offensive options over Seismic Toss. Other ways to take advantage of Serene Grace such as Shadow Ball dropping Special Defense, Body Slam paralyzing Ground-types, and Ice Beam causing a 20% chance to freeze are possible. Wish is another possibility, as Blissey can heal teammates effectively and has the bulk to pull it off.</p> <p>Blissey has many other interesting options, such as Counter to OHKO physical attackers, Charm to soften physical moves (but watch out that it is incompatible with Seismic Toss), and Snatch, which can steal certain moves such as boosting moves, recovery, Substitute, Reflect, and Light Screen. Some other options include Healing Wish to heal up a teammate, Copycat to take advantage of moves Blissey does not learn such as setting up entry hazards, Block + Tail Whip to be a complete pest and set up a scenario for Pursuit trapping, and Gravity to enhance accuracy and increase the effectiveness of Ground-type attacks as well as entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Machamp fears almost nothing Blissey can do and OHKOes it with DynamicPunch. Other Fighting-types such as Breloom, Lucario, Infernape, Heracross, and Gallade do the same. Breloom is even immune to status once Toxic Orb activates, while Heracross gains a Guts boost. The others do not enjoy being statused on the switch-in, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Blissey is hugely weak to residual damage and this is the main reason why it is not used as much. Stealth Rock and Spikes make switching in challenging, especially if Blissey is forced out before it can heal, while sand and status further interfere with its walling abilities. Toxic Spikes, especially two layers, make Blissey struggle to do much of anything.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Blissey's very low base Defense stat makes it vulnerable to pressure from physical attackers such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, Scizor, and Swampert. All of them can potentially hit Blissey super effectively, compromising its physical bulk. Explosion also is dangerous to Blissey; special attackers such as Heatran and Gengar can lure Blissey in and use Explosion on it to put it at very low health or remove it outright.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Blissey's attacks are pretty weak, so Taunt prevents it from healing and using status moves. Gyarados, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Tyranitar all can devastate Blissey with either set up or slowly wearing it down.</p> <p><strong>Setting-Up</strong>: Blissey can only mitigate set-up via status, super effective coverage, or slowly wearing them down with Seismic Toss—sweepers who can survive this use Blissey as set-up fodder. Some examples include Substitute attacks such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Suicune, and Machamp; bulky Pokemon with Rest or other ways to mitigate status such as Calm Mind + Rest Suicune or Calm Mind Clefable; Ghost-types with Taunt or Substitute such as Pain Split Gengar or Charge Beam Rotom-A; and with Lum Berry such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Blissey is almost completely useless if one of the special attackers it beats such as Choice Specs Latias or Choice Scarf Rotom-A uses Trick and gives it a Choice item. Blissey should be careful to avoid switching into Trick.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blissey's huge bulk allows it to switch into nearly any special move, heal off the damage, and either wittle the foe down with an attacking move or use its utility moves. Seismic Toss is Blissey's main offensive option, damaging special attackers such as Empoleon, Heatran, Latias, Starmie, Suicune, and Zapdos. Blissey is one of the better Thunder Wave users in the tier—Thunder Wave dissuades offensive Pokemon such as Lucario, Gyarados, Dragonite, Infernape, and Jirachi from taking advantage of it and helps mitigate its slow Speed. As a more offensive option, Blissey can use Ice Beam to discourage Ground-types such as Flygon and Gliscor from absorbing Thunder Wave. Ice Beam also has a chance to OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock and hits Substitute Gengar and Rotom-A. Blissey is an excellent user of Stealth Rock, as it easily keeps it up against the premier Rapid Spinner in Starmie, has the bulk to generate free turns, and has the longevity to do over the course of the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Blissey greatly appreciates as much physical bulk as possible, and a Bold nature and a 252 HP / 252 Def EV spread emphasizes this. It has a very low base Defense stat and easily walls the tier's special attackers even without any Special Defense EVs. As Blissey only needs 252 Defense EVs to be effective, it has many other possible EV spreads. Especially with Ice Beam, it can run some more Special Attack EVs. With 136 Special Attack EVs, it can always break Gengar's and bulkless Rotom-A's Substitute and OHKO Gliscor and Dragonite after Stealth Rock. Blissey can also run some more Speed EVs, anywhere from 44 Speed EVs to outspeed minimum Speed Clefable to even up to maximum investment and a Timid nature to outspeed neutral nature Swampert, Tyranitar, and Empoleon. It can also lean further into its special bulk with a spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature, which avoids the 2HKO from preposterous attacks such as Flash Fire boosted Choice Specs Heatran's Fire Blast. Keep in mind that investing away from HP or a Bold nature significantly decreases Blissey physical bulk, meaning attacks such as offensive Swampert's Earthquake and Metagross's Meteor Mash will 2HKO it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Blissey should generally switch into what it walls early and often to set up Stealth Rock and spread Thunder Wave. However, Blissey is huge set-up bait for attackers and utility Pokemon alike, including Substitute attackers such as Breloom, Jirachi, and Machamp; Calm Mind + Rest Suicune; entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Roserade; and Lum Berry physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Metagross. How to use Blissey greatly depends on the opposing team: for opposing offensive teams, Blissey can be very annoying to special attackers without entry hazard support or ways to mitigate status. Against what it walls, it should be played aggressively to get the most out of it, predicting switches with Thunder Wave and wearing down foes with Seismic Toss. Against more defensive teams, Blissey should take advantage of its huge stock of HP to force Clefable to use its PP and spread paralysis to support Pokemon such as Skarmory and Jirachi. With the moveset given, Blissey has more PP than Clefable and can force it to use a lot of Soft-Boiled PP by using Seismic Toss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey must take advantage of its niche over Clefable lest it be outclassed: Blissey notably answers Choice Specs Latias, Gengar, Heatran, and Suicune better than Clefable does and teammates should take advantage of that. One of the best teammates for Blissey is Starmie, as it provides Rapid Spin support, speed control, and further can spread paralysis. Blissey also appreciates Pokemon that can switch into physical attackers. Alongside Rapid Spin, physically defensive Zapdos is one of the best choices, as it can easily handle the Fighting-type of the tier such as Machamp and Breloom even if they are behind a Substitute. It can further spread paralysis with Discharge and can take on even boosted physical sweepers. Jirachi also appreciates paralysis to faciliate flinching and can handle very strong attackers with a defensive set or revenge kill them with a Choice Scarf set. Blissey prominently features with teammates who enjoy paralysis: some examples include Substitute Machamp, Swords Dance Breloom, and Substitute + Nasty Plot Togekiss. Blissey also can faciliate more versatile Clefable sets, such as Calm Mind, physically defensive, or even Life Orb, as Blissey absorbs its defensive duties. Other strong defensive Pokemon such as Latias, Skarmory, and Gliscor can further help with physical attackers: Latias can deal with Breloom and offensive Water-types; Skarmory forms the famous SkarmBliss combination, walls physical threats, and sets up Spikes; and Gliscor is one of the best Fighting-type answers in the game and, with a fully specially defensive spread, can assist with threats such as mixed Flygon with entry hazards up. Other interesting partners such as Hitmontop as an alternative Rapid Spinner and physically defensive Dragonite are also possible.</p> <p>Blissey also fits alongside more offensive Pokemon to counter special attackers in one slot. In this scenario, Blissey can fit alongside attackers such as offensive Heatran and Choice Band Dragonite that additionally appreciate Rapid Spin support. Choice Specs Heatran is a particularly good partner, as it immediately opens up a hole, appreciates paralysis support, and often gives Blissey a switch-in on Water-types trying to survive Overheat, such as Suicune and Starmie. Other ways to mitigate entry hazards such as with Magnezone can be helpful. Other attackers such as Gengar and mixed Flygon appreciate Blissey switching into Water-types and Zapdos, as they can struggle to KO them and get crippled or KOed in return.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Monstrous, both competitively and aesthetically, Tyranitar is easily one of the most important Pokemon in the tier. Tyranitar's unique typing, ability to summon sand, fantastic stat spread, and diverse movepool give it incredible versatility; it can excel on nearly any type of team in whatever role needed. With a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar becomes the best Pursuit trapper in the tier while also providing important speed control for defensive teams. With Dragon Dance, it becomes one of the best sweepers in the tier due to its coverage and power; it additionally provides important defensive utility against special attackers such as Rotom-A and Zapdos to hyper offensive teams. Choice Band sets pack destructive power while mixed sets can combine Tyranitar's various advantages into one package, such as setting up Stealth Rock and being an important check to Latias, Heatran, and Rotom-A. Tyranitar also can focus fully on its defenses with an excellent stand-alone defensive set. Sand is a centralizing force in the metagame, as it helps residual damage stick on sand-vulnerable Pokemon such as Suicune, Machamp, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape. It also helps to nullify rain sweepers such as Kingdra, Qwilfish, and Ludicolo, especially if Tyranitar is holding a Passho Berry. Tyranitar can be endlessly customized to any team's needs; its naturally fantastic defenses, resistances, and Special Defense boost in sand allow it to check most special attackers even without much investment.</p> <p>Tyranitar's main issues come from its typing and relatively slow Speed. While its Rock / Dark typing gives Tyranitar excellent offensive prowess, it also has prominent weaknesses to common types such as Water, Ground, and especially Fighting. The popularity of Pokemon like Jirachi, Infernape, Breloom, Metagross, Lucario, Swampert, Flygon, and Bronzong can undermine its great bulk. Tyranitar is also rather slow even when boosted and has maximum investment; Choice Scarf versions typically need additional methods to handle sweepers that boost their Speed such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite, as they will outspeed Tyranitar. Bulkier sets often must choose between being outsped by the majority of the metagame or sacrificing some bulk to outspeed foes such as slower versions of Breloom, Metagross, and Rotom-A. Tyranitar also is quite vulnerable to status; it is weak to Toxic Spikes and can get crippled by a burn from Rotom-A or Heatran.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyranitar can also run a faster mixed set with maximum Speed and no defensive investment with options such as Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Superpower, and a host of other options such as Hidden Power Grass, Surf, Stone Edge, Pursuit, and Crunch with an Expert Belt. Such a set can also lead to take advantage of its coverage and set up Stealth Rock with a Focus Sash. Rock Slide has more accuracy than Stone Edge but 25% less power, often making it a less effective option. A set revolving around Curse can be used as a late-game wincon alongside Rest, Sleep Talk, and Crunch, but it isn't very consistent compared to other Curse users due to Tyranitar's many common weaknesses and its crippling weakness to Fighting-type attacks in particular. Dragon Dance is a much more consistent sweeping set on Tyranitar because it better compensates for Tyranitar's middling Speed tier and also circumvents some of the problems that its defensive typing presents. For supportive sets, Tyranitar can also make use of its fairly solid utility movepool, which includes Roar, Toxic, and Thunder Wave, but struggles to fit them on its all purpose or defensive set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most Ground-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Quagsire, and Donphan take Tyranitar's hits well and can retaliate with a super effective Earthquake. Swampert and Hippowdon are the most notable, only getting 3HKOed at best by Crunch and 2HKOing back with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Flygon can outspeed even +2 Tyranitar and can revenge kill it with Earthquake, while even without investment, it can survive any non Ice-type attack. All should be careful, as Tyranitar can use any of Surf, Ice Beam, or, rarely, Hidden Power Grass to surprise them, while Crunch’s Defense drops can help it get through them. Additionally, none of these enjoy Shuca Berry allowing Tyranitar to live their attacks more easily.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Machamp, Breloom, Lucario, Gallade, Heracross, and Infernape almost always OHKO Tyranitar with Fighting-type attacks. Machamp is especially noteworthy, as it can even take on boosted Tyranitar's attacks and always KO back with Dynamic Punch, while Breloom and Infernape can KO even a Tyranitar with multiple boosts with Mach Punch. Lucario is especially threatening, as it can set up Swords Dance on resisted Choice-locked attacks and threaten to sweep the whole team. With Bullet Punch, it KOes Choice Scarf Tyranitar after Stealth Rock at +2 even if it tries to revenge kill Lucario. Lucario's own Choice Scarf set can switch in as Tyranitar uses Dragon Dance and threaten to OHKO it even through a Chople Berry with Close Combat. Breloom is probably one of the best counters to Tyranitar in the game. It resists all of Tyranitar's Dark- and Rock-type moves, and it can use Tyranitar as setup fodder. However, all of these threats can fall if Tyranitar hits them on the switch with the correct attack, such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam in Breloom's case or Earthquake in Lucario case. None of them enjoy taking Superpower from the Choice Band set after some residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Jirachi, Scizor, Metagross, and Bronzong are good initial checks to Tyranitar, as Tyranitar has a difficult time OHKOing them while they can retaliate super effectively. Jirachi's Iron Head is especially devastating to slower sets, as it 2HKOes bulkless sets even without any Attack EVs and has a high chance to flinch. Scizor only fears Fire-type attacks or a boosted Stone Edge and at least 2HKOes back with Bullet Punch or OHKOes with U-turn. Metagross OHKOes with Meteor Mash after Stealth Rock and can survive at least one boosted hit. Choice Scarf Metagross sets outspeed even +1 Tyranitar. Bronzong’s Gyro Ball at least 2HKOes most fast Tyranitar and can take at least one hit as well. Skarmory is one of the best physical Tyranitar checks in the game, as it can phaze it or use Counter on its attacks, but it must watch out for Taunt or switching into a Choice Band Stone Edge. All of these must watch out for Fire Blast from the mixed set or boosted attacks from the Dragon Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types can at least take a hit or two and retaliate with strong Water-type attacks. Suicune, Gyarados, Kingdra, Ludicolo, Qwilfish, and Empoleon hit Tyranitar hard. However, all need to be careful. Suicune, Gyarados, and Kingdra do not enjoy sand, while offensive sets can only take so many hits from Tyranitar. Gyarados and Empoleon need to watch out for Stone Edge and Superpower or Earthquake, respectively. Tyranitar's Special Defense boost in sand and potential Passho Berry can stymie attempts to break through with special Water-type attacks, but should Kingdra or Ludicolo change the weather, it can break through Tyranitar even with a Passho Berry.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Tyranitar has many weaknesses, and most Pokemon can hit it super effectively. Notably, Gengar and Latias can be trapped by Tyranitar, but Gengar outspeeds and can OHKO all but the bulkiest sets with Focus Blast, while Latias hits it hard with Surf or Grass Knot. Flygon, Zapdos, and Infernape all can gain momentum with U-turn. Jirachi without Iron Head typically has Grass Knot to hit Tyranitar hard with, while Celebi can OHKO it with a boosted Leaf Storm or 2HKO with Grass Knot. Opposing Tyranitar can OHKO it with Superpower; Rotom-A can hit hard with Hidden Power Fighting, Hydro Pump, and Leaf Storm; and Heatran can 3HKO it with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tyranitar typically can't afford Rest and thus is very vulnerable to status, especially burn. Slower sets without Lum Berry can get burned by Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-A and Heatran. Paralysis from Clefable, Latias, Blissey, and Jirachi can ruin Choice Scarf and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Zapdos and defensive Latias also sometimes carry Toxic that heavily weakens Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Tyranitar rarely carries Leftovers and is vulnerable to all three entry hazards. Spikes hamper Tyranitar, as it can be put in range of attacks like Starmie's Hydro Pump and Latias's Draco Meteor. Toxic Spikes are particularly debilitating for Tyranitar, as it typically can only cure poison with a Lum Berry.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>It may seem odd to use a Choice Scarf on such a slow Pokemon, but Tyranitar's great stat spread makes it a superior user of Choice Scarf. Base 61 Speed gives it the ability to outspeed Pokemon with base 115 Speed and below, even with a positive nature, which allows it to outspeed notable foes such as Starmie, Azelf, Latias, and Gengar.</p> <p>Crunch and Pursuit form the core of Tyranitar's niche, as with the additional Speed, it can checkmate frail Dark-weak foes such as Gengar and Starmie and eliminate them without fail. For example, Pursuit eliminates Gengar guaranteed after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage before it can OHKO Tyranitar with Focus Blast. Tyranitar can also take advantage of weaker special attackers even if it is slower; Choice Scarf Rotom-A only 4HKOes bulkless Tyranitar with Thunderbolt and gets 2HKOed with Pursuit or OHKOed if it switches out. Crunch is Tyranitar's strongest option and exploits bulkier Dark-weak Pokemon trying to stay in and damage Tyranitar, such as defensive Rotom-A, Latias, Starmie, and Celebi. Superpower and Earthquake complete its coverage, hitting Steel-types such as Lucario and Empoleon hard. Superpower OHKOes opposing Tyranitar and 2HKOes Clefable and Blissey, while Earthquake OHKOes Heatran more reliably and 2HKOes most Jirachi.</p> <p>The last moveslot is Tyranitar's main utility option. Stone Edge heavily damages prominent Flying-weak foes such as Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite, OHKOing even bulky versions after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam provides crucial coverage on Gliscor and Breloom while still OHKOing Dragonite. Ice Punch can also be used, but since both Gliscor and Breloom are more physically bulky, Ice Beam often can do more damage. Tyranitar can also drop the last attack altogether and use a variety of non-attacking moves. Stealth Rock is the most prominent option, as Tyranitar can set up the entry hazard quickly on predicted switches to maximize residual damage. Should Tyranitar lead, it can uniquely set up Stealth Rock on Azelf and other anti-entry hazard leads besides Aerodactyl without worrying about being hit by Taunt. Other option include status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic or even Taunt itself. Note that Tyranitar only needs Crunch and Pursuit to function, so bluffing the threat of Superpower and Earthquake can be enough to have two utility options in the last two moveslots.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are required to outspeed positive-natured base 115 Speed Pokemon and are crucial to this set's performance. Should Tyranitar use Ice Beam, it should use a Hasty nature. 60 Special Attack EVs are enough to OHKO maximum HP Gliscor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar typically tries to come in early in the game to remove prominent threats and set up sand. Should Tyranitar lead, it can try to get Stealth Rock immediately, but it should be done cautiously, as this can be predictable and forces Tyranitar to switch. Tyranitar has the unique niche of being a bulkier revenge killer; it can survive a boosted special hit or two to take down threats such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Choice Specs Latias, and Starmie. However, Tyranitar prefers to switch in with relative safety and force the foe into a potential Pursuit trap, as it can be overwhelmed if needed to trap multiple threats. This Tyranitar is easy to set up on, especially if it is locked into Pursuit. Beware of Pursuit trapping around dangerous setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Substitute Breloom, and Substitute Machamp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a staple of DPP OU and has many viable partners, as it is one of the best checks to fast Dark-weak attackers. On more defensive teams, Tyranitar is often the fastest Pokemon on the team, sets up sand, and helps limit Gengar and offensive Latias. Tyranitar is part of the prominent big five archetype with Clefable, defensive Latias, Skarmory, and offensive Jirachi alongside a bulky Ground-type such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Quagsire, or Donphan. Clefable is a fantastic partner for Tyranitar, as alongside defensive Latias, they check most of the special threats in the tier. Clefable's Knock Off combined with sand helps wear down everything not immune to it, especially Suicune, Latias, and Starmie. Tyranitar can also absorb Heatran's Explosion in a pinch and Trick from Latias and Rotom-A. Latias resists everything Tyranitar is weak to besides Bug- and Steel-type moves and is an excellent check to Breloom and Water-types trying to take advantage of Tyranitar. Skarmory and its Spikes are great partners to Tyranitar, as they heighten residual damage. Tyranitar's Pursuit traps Starmie trying to spin away entry hazards, while it answers Fire- and Electric-types such as Heatran, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Skarmory provides an answer to physical setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Tyranitar that outspeed, or Speed tie in Dragon Dance Tyranitar's case, and OHKO Tyranitar. Offensive Jirachi takes advantage of its Speed, sand, and Spikes to wear down the opponent with Iron Head and its coverage. Ground-types provide backup to strong physical attackers and Electric-types. Hippowdon helps Skarmory with Dragon Dance sweepers and sets up Stealth Rock; specially defensive Gliscor can help with mixed Flygon and Fighting-types such as Lucario and Breloom and enjoys fast offensive special types eliminated; Quagsire's access to Water Absorb, anti-setup moves such as Encore and Haze, and bulk allow it to uniquely answer both rain sweepers and physical attackers; and Donphan can use Rapid Spin on the hazards that wear down Tyranitar and also helps with Dragon Dance sweepers. Other defensive teammates can take advantage of what Tyranitar provides. Forretress sets up Spikes and appreciates Pursuit trapping support to spin more easily. Defensive Jirachi enjoys sand helping it use Iron Head to wear down foes, appreciates Tyranitar answering Rotom-A and Gengar that like to burn it, and provides a strong answer to offensive Latias. Rotom-A itself assists against Fighting-types such as Machamp and helps to block Rapid Spin. Rotom-A enjoys not having to worry about Gengar or Choice Scarf Rotom-A hitting it with Shadow Ball. Blissey is another option to absorb special attacks and set up Stealth Rock. Other common defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong, Nidoqueen, Starmie, Cresselia, physically defensive Zapdos, and defensive Swampert can fit well with Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p> <p>Tyranitar also can fit on more offensive teams trying to bypass frail Ghost-types. As Tyranitar is easy to wall with many Steel-types should it lock into Crunch or Pursuit, Magnezone is a nice partner to trap Skarmory, Jirachi, Scizor, and Forretress. Swords Dance Gliscor and Mamoswine also appreciate the dual trapping that Tyranitar and Magnezone can provide while giving important defensive utility. Many Pokemon can take advantage of Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Latias, Starmie, Rotom-A, and Gengar. Fighting-types such as Infernape, Breloom, and Machamp, setup sweepers such as Gyarados and especially Lucario, and attackers that appreciate entry hazards such as mixed Flygon and Gengar enjoy Choice Scarf Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Dragon Dance, Tyranitar has the potential to sweep teams after just a single turn of setup, which is easy to obtain due to Tyranitar's ability to force out many foes and its overall bulk. Tyranitar's main option is Crunch, which has good neutral coverage on the tier and is very strong at +1. Crunch also allows Tyranitar to fulfill its roles if it can't sweep, such as combating defensive Rotom-A and Latias. Stone Edge is another option, as it is Tyranitar's strongest attack and hits common Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Clefable. Earthquake is an important move on this set because it allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, Empoleon, and Heatran for super effective damage while also having great neutral coverage with Crunch and Stone Edge. Aqua Tail is another option to effectively hit Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gliscor, as they typically take Crunch well and can 2HKO back with Earthquake. It also provides a super effective option on Heatran and opposing Tyranitar.</p> <p>Fire Punch is best alongside Crunch and Earthquake or Aqua Tail to best hit Skarmory, Breloom, and Bronzong. Ice Punch is another option, as it OHKOes Gliscor at +1 and hits Breloom very hard. Typically, Ice Punch is used alongside Stone Edge and Earthquake to give the best coverage. Taunt is a fantastic option alongside Earthquake and Crunch or Stone Edge, as Tyranitar gets good coverage in two moves and can use Taunt to take advantage of Skarmory and status-inducing walls such as Rotom-A and Clefable. Unless it has Taunt or Magnezone support, Tyranitar needs one of Fire Punch or Stone Edge to combat Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature and maximum Speed is recommended to outspeed Pokemon with base 115 Speed, like Starmie and Raikou, after a single turn of setup. The choice of item will depend both on Tyranitar's teammates and its moveset. Lum Berry is often the best choice, as it guarantees that Tyranitar's sweep won't be ended by status effects such as paralysis and burn and makes setting up safer against Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Blissey, Clefable, and Heatran. Another great choice is Chople Berry, which prevents Breloom and Infernape from reliably revenge killing Tyranitar with Mach Punch. Tyranitar can also use Chople Berry to soft check Gengar by switching into Shadow Ball and then taking a Focus Blast with relative ease. Shuca Berry is an excellent option for sets with Ice Punch as the last move, as it reduces the number of Pokemon that can revenge kill this set. For example, Flygon's Earthquake will do negligible damage, and Tyranitar will be able to hit it with an Ice Punch and continue its sweep. Shuca Berry will also allow Tyranitar to set up on a defensive Gliscor's Earthquake and other weaker Ground-type attacks. As a bonus, it can serve as a soft check to Dragon Dance Pokemon like opposing Tyranitar and Dragonite that opt to use Earthquake.</p> <p>Tyranitar has some more niche items it can use as well. On teams that can reliably prevent Stealth Rock such as those with lead Aerodactyl, Focus Sash is another option to survive any one hit from difficult foes such as Choice Scarf Lucario and KO back. Life Orb is destructively powerful and can break the bulkiest of walls, but watch out for residual damage adding up. On the other hand, Leftovers helps to mitigate the residual damage Tyranitar faces. Tyranitar can also use slightly more bulk at the expense of Attack EVs, such as up to around 80 HP EVs, to better withstand attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar should try to use its bulk to set up on foes it threatens, such as defensive Latias, Heatran, and Rotom-A, especially with a Lum Berry. As it has good coverage and is difficult to OHKO outside of Fighting-type attacks, Tyranitar excels at weakening walls such as Skarmory or Hippowdon both for itself or to allow a teammate to sweep. As Skarmory otherwise can't damage Tyranitar unless it phazes or uses Counter, Taunt can sometimes end the game immediately if it gets more than one Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Tyranitar baits predictable ways to take it down, such as Choice-locked attacks, Trick from Latias or Rotom-A, and priority from Scizor, Infernape, and Breloom. Take advantage of this to set up something else or get a free switch. Tyranitar also does not always have to sweep if it needs to answer a threat, such as offensive Zapdos, Heatran, or Choice Scarf Rotom-A.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Tyranitar is a mainstay of the hyper offensive playstyle, as it not only is a massive threat alongside other sweepers but also provides important defensive utility against special attackers that is hard to find elsewhere. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite are prominent partners, as they synergistically take advantage of each other breaking apart defensive cores and weakening Skarmory. Both also resist the Fighting-types that check Tyranitar, such as Choice Scarf Lucario, Breloom, and Machamp. Gyarados can set up on prominent Tyranitar checks such as Swampert and Scizor, while Tyranitar can take down defensive Latias, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. Dragonite, with both mixed and Dragon Dance sets, is one of the best Pokemon in the tier for weakening the Steel- and Water-types that check Tyranitar such as Metagross, Bronzong, Suicune, and Swampert while also setting up on Breloom. Other powerful sweepers such as Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, offensive Empoleon, offensive Jirachi, and Swords Dance Scizor are strong partners. Mixed or offensive Calm Mind Jirachi is an especially good partner, as it can lure in and KO Hippowdon and Swampert with Grass Knot while also answering Breloom and Skarmory with its coverage. Tyranitar enjoys anti-setup leads to help prevent entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Azelf and Aerodactyl are excellent choices to immediately start with Stealth Rock, but other leads such as Choice Scarf Breloom and Choice Scarf Roserade can disable opposing leads with sleep and keep hazards off the field. Should the lead not have Stealth Rock, Metagross with Thunder Punch or Trick + Iron Ball and Heatran are excellent choices to help fend off Skarmory. Both can potentially use Explosion on Ground-types.</p> <p>Most of Tyranitar's main checks are grounded, and it appreciates Spikes to help wear them down. It is one of the more prominent sweepers for Spikes offense teams, as it takes advantage of Starmie trying to use Rapid Spin to KO it or set up on it. Skarmory is the primary setter, as it provides important defensive coverage against prominent checks such as Bronzong and Metagross while also potentially preventing entry hazards with Taunt. Tyranitar can then switch into Fire- and Electric-type attacks and set up Dragon Dance. Mixed Flygon alongside these hazards is another great choice to wear down opposing walls. Rotom-A can help keep hazards up while being one of the best switch-ins to Fighting-types in the game. Lastly, this set performs exceptionally well on teams that use a dual screens lead, because it makes setting up multiple Dragon Dances easier, and with all those boosts, stopping a Tyranitar sweep is nearly impossible.</p>"
      },
      "All Purpose": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tyranitar's impeccable stats, unique typing, monstrous Special Defense in sand, and vast movepool enable it to fulfill many different roles simultaneously. Crunch is a reliable STAB attack that maims Pokemon like Starmie, Rotom-A, Celebi, and Latias for tremendous super effective damage. Most foes that it hits neutrally, like Flygon and offensive Suicune, will still sustain quite a bit of damage. Its chance to lower a foe's Defense is also crucial for breaking defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Clefable. Payback is an alternative to Crunch on much slower variants, as it usually becomes more powerful, but it has fewer PP and forgoes the chance of a Defense drop. Dark Pulse is another interesting alternative to hit Rotom-A hard even in case of a burn, and it also hits Reflect Starmie for more damage; however, Crunch is almost always better.</p> <p>From there, Tyranitar can use many different moves to accommodate its team's needs. Fire Blast is a fantastic option to hit Skarmory, Breloom, Scizor, and Bronzong for massive damage. In particular, 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory makes Tyranitar a potent threat against stall builds. As alternatives, Stealth Rock and Ice Beam are great moves. Tyranitar makes fantastic use of Stealth Rock, as its insanely high Special Defense and solid HP actually make it a check to Starmie, despite its weakness to Water-type attacks. In addition, it can put up sand to disrupt Water-types like Suicune and Kingdra, and with Passho Berry, it can serve as a soft check to them. Having the ability to keep Stealth Rock up versus Starmie is an incredibly desirable trait, as Starmie is terrifying offensively and also OU's most consistent spinner by far. Ice Beam surprises foes like Gliscor, Flygon, and Dragon Dance Dragonite with an OHKO; it can also hit physically defensive Zapdos for solid super effective damage.</p> <p>Tyranitar is the best Pursuit trapper in OU thanks to its high Attack. Instead of outspeeding foes like the Choice Scarf set does, this set aims to Pursuit trap using Tyranitar's tremendous bulk, decimating Psychic- and Ghost-types like Starmie, Rotom-A, Latias, and Gengar on the switch. Tyranitar can also use Pursuit to wear down foes as they switch out, like Clefable, Zapdos, and even Jolteon, Suicune, and Draco Meteor-locked Kingdra. For some teams, however, the threat of Pursuit is enough, and Tyranitar can use moves like Fire Blast and Ice Beam in its place to form more dedicated mixed attacking sets.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Tyranitar's most powerful STAB attack, which hits Gyarados, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Togekiss super effectively. It can also be used to fish for a critical hit against bulkier Pokemon like Clefable, Suicune, and Blissey. Earthquake is a great alternative to reliably cover Nidoqueen, Heatran, Magnezone, Infernape, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Lucario. As a bonus, it can hit Zapdos as it uses Roost, which surprisingly makes a large difference in the matchup. It may be just as effective to use a combination of moves like Crunch + Earthquake versus Zapdos as it is to use Stone Edge, as the latter only has an effective four PP due to Zapdos's ability Pressure. This means that Zapdos may be able to use Roost in succession to reduce Stone Edge's PP. Superpower hits Heatran, opposing Tyranitar, and Lucario for massive damage; it also hits Clefable and Blissey super effectively, often OHKOing the former and coming very close to OHKOing the latter. Using Superpower will make Tyranitar worse off versus Zapdos, however, so it may want to run Ice Beam alongside it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>It's extremely important to note that this Tyranitar set can run a large number of viable EV spreads. Depending on the moveset, it may want more or less Special Attack investment, more Special Defense investment, or even more Speed. The above EV spread has an emphasis on Special Defense, which Tyranitar uses to even further strengthen its effectiveness versus a large variety of special attackers, like Zapdos, Rotom-A, Latias, Starmie, Heatran, Kingdra, and Suicune. 52 Special Attack EVs allow Fire Blast to OHKO uninvested Breloom and significantly improves the move's damage output versus Skarmory. 80 Speed EVs enable Tyranitar to outpace uninvested Skarmory; however, if you use Fire Blast, you may want to invest more Speed at the expense of Attack or Special Defense to let Tyranitar outpace faster Skarmory, Breloom, and Scizor, including taking the Attack EVs and investing into maximizing Speed. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack to maximize it given the constraints. If you use Ice Beam and Fire Blast, you may want to invest a bit more EVs in Special Attack to allow Tyranitar to shut down Skarmory and Gliscor more effectively.</p> <p>Passho Berry is what largely enables Tyranitar to turn the tide on all Water-types. There is not a single unboosted Water-type move that OHKOes Tyranitar—not even +1 Gyarados's Waterfall or Choice Band Swampert's Torrent-boosted Waterfall with the Defense drop from a Lonely nature. This item is especially effective versus Rain Dance sweepers like Kingdra and Ludicolo, as Tyranitar can come in on a Hydro Pump, set up sand, and still be relatively healthy. Alternatively, Custap Berry takes advantage of Tyranitar's tremendous bulk, which often enables it to survive two attacks and be within Custap Berry's activation range. This can give it an extra chance to attack or set up Stealth Rock, which Passho Berry often doesn't do. Alternative items like Lum Berry and Chople Berry can be used as well. Lum Berry can help Tyranitar to beat Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A, especially with Speed investment to outspeed slower defensive Rotom-A, and Chople Berry can be used for Mach Punch Breloom and, more importantly, Focus Blast Gengar. It can often be difficult to justify these options over Passho Berry and Custap Berry, however, as Rotom-A can miss with Will-O-Wisp and often still loses to Tyranitar, and Tyranitar is more reliable versus Gengar with a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>The choice between a Lonely, Adamant, and Brave nature is mostly set-dependent. If you're using Fire Blast without Ice Beam, you may want to invest more Speed without lowering Tyranitar's Special Attack with an Adamant nature, so a Lonely nature fits best in these situations. An Adamant nature is best when you don't opt for any special attacks, such as with a moveset like Stealth Rock / Pursuit / Crunch / Earthquake. A Brave nature is a decent alternative to Lonely, reducing Tyranitar's Speed rather than Defense, which is often a good choice; however, a Lonely nature allows Tyranitar to just barely outspeed Clefable, which can be quite significant depending on the team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Tyranitar in on special attackers like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias. When facing Water-type special attackers like Starmie, Kingdra, and Suicune, try to pivot into a Water-resistant teammate before switching into Tyranitar so there's less likelihood of Tyranitar sustaining a Water-type attack as it switches in. If you're using a less expected move like Ice Beam or Fire Blast, keep it concealed until Tyranitar lures the right target in, like Skarmory or Gliscor. If you notice that Rotom-A has Leftovers, it almost certainly has Will-O-Wisp, so try to play around that by switching into a Fire-type Pokemon or a burn absorber like Clefable, Blissey, or Roserade. When you are sure your foe will switch out, Pursuit is very often a great option to wear it down, even against Dark-resistant Pokemon like Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <p>If you're using a Custap Berry, pay close attention to Tyranitar's HP as it gets lower. Be cognizant of entry hazards and how much HP Tyranitar will have after sustaining damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Doing so potentially enables Tyranitar to use its Custap Berry after switching in when it wasn't able to prior. Try to familiarize yourself with how much damage Tyranitar takes from an opposing Pokemon's attack to open up the potential for long-term planning with Custap Berry's activation in mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is the quintessential Pokemon that supports all of its teammates rather than the other way around, and it fits on almost any team. However, there are a few Pokemon that work well to support any set this Tyranitar can run. Infernape and Heatran can switch into Will-O-Wisp. Their devastating Fire-type attacks melt Steel-types like Metagross, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Lucario, which all give Tyranitar trouble. Both can also use Grass-type coverage to wear down bulky Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Suicune. Choice Band Infernape can lure in Starmie, Rotom-A, and Latias and use U-turn to get Tyranitar in freely. Heatran can use Magma Storm to trap, cripple, and even remove foes like Swampert, Milotic, and Zapdos. Gyarados often switches into Infernape and Heatran and sustains significant damage from powerful Fire-type attacks, which helps Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar can trap and remove Starmie, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Latias for Infernape and Heatran, as well as wearing down Zapdos and Flygon. Its ability Sand Stream also helps keep Suicune, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Milotic in check by interfering with their Leftovers recovery, which Infernape and Heatran appreciate. Gyarados is a great teammate for Tyranitar as well, as it can switch into Earthquake from the likes of Swampert and Flygon and boost its Attack and Speed with Dragon Dance, setting up for a sweep. Tyranitar wears down Zapdos and checks Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Latias, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Starmie for Gyarados. A Starmie of your own can spin entry hazards away to help keep Tyranitar and Flying-types healthy. Starmie also checks Infernape, Water-types, and Ground-types. Zapdos can spread paralysis with Discharge, switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, and threaten bulky Water-types, all of which makes Tyranitar more threatening. Tyranitar's 4x Fighting-type weakness means that Fighting-immune Pokemon like Gengar and Rotom-A pair quite well to ward off most Fighting-types. Latias resists Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks, while Tyranitar resists Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. Magnezone's ability to trap Skarmory and Scizor enables Tyranitar to drop Fire Blast for Stealth Rock more easily. Jirachi can support Tyranitar in various ways, whether it paralyzes foes with Body Slam, lures in Tyranitar's checks and removes them with coverage moves like Grass Knot and Thunderbolt, or wears down the opposing team with an Iron Head barrage.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Choice Band, Tyranitar's attacks come off of a massive 604 Attack that can break through even the toughest of the tier's defensive Pokemon. Stone Edge is one of the keys to this set's success. It powers through even frailer Rock-resistant foes such as Breloom and can OHKO a significant portion of the metagame. It also packs enough power to easily 2HKO walls such as Skarmory and Forretress. Crunch serves as an accurate secondary attack and provides neutral coverage on Pokemon that resist Stone Edge, such as Swampert, Bronzong, and Metagross. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and Pursuit combination does significantly more damage to special walls and frail offensive Pokemon alike such as Zapdos, Starmie, Latias, Rotom-A, Blissey, and Clefable. Should Tyranitar make the correct read on switching versus staying in, many of these Pokemon are either OHKOed or are so low on health that they struggle to heal up properly.</p> <p>The final slot provides Tyranitar with much-needed type coverage. Superpower hits Blissey, Clefable, opposing Tyranitar, and various Steel-types super effectively; it also hits Breloom and Machamp very hard. Earthquake hits Metagross, Jirachi, and opposing Tyranitar but is a dangerous move to be locked into. Finally, Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to OHKO Scizor and Forretress, as well as reliably 2HKOing Skarmory and Bronzong. Aqua Tail hits Hippowdon, Gliscor, and opposing Tyranitar hard, as well as providing neutral coverage and a reliable attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 76 Speed EVs lets Tyranitar outpace Skarmory without any Speed EVs, allowing Tyranitar to 2HKO them with Stone Edge without being impeded by Roost. However, it is somewhat common for Skarmory to run Speed EVs to avoid this exact situation, so it may be beneficial to boost Tyranitar's Speed investment as well. After maximizing Attack, the remaining EVs are placed into HP for maximum bulk.</p> <p>Tyranitar has many other viable EV spreads. Tyranitar can run maximum Speed EVs with no bulk investment to outspeed as much as it can, but it's rather frail and still not very fast. Should Tyranitar want to be used in Trick Room, it can use no investment at all and use a spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD. Tyranitar also can use a Brave nature and minimum Speed IVs or can run a few additional Speed EVs to outspeed Clefable and Empoleon. Tyranitar can use nearly maximum special bulk to better survive Modest Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor and Gengar's Focus Blast. An example of such a spread is 64 HP / 184 Atk / 252 SpD that lets it take two Draco Meteors after Stealth Rock and non-Life Orb Gengar's Focus Blast and Pursuit trap them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Tyranitar in on special attackers like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Latias and special walls such as Blissey. Beware of switching directly into Clefable and losing the Choice Band to Knock Off. As Pursuit is much stronger than it is on the Choice Scarf set, it potentially checkmates Pokemon at higher health. It even does good damage to Pokemon that resist it, such as Magnezone and Heatran. If Tyranitar outspeeds a lot of the opposing team, Stone Edge can often rip through multiple Pokemon due to its power. Tyranitar has similar issues to the Choice Scarf set in that it often allows free setup from foes that resist Pursuit, so watch out for setup sweepers such as Lucario.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar fits well on offenses built around Trick Room Bronzong, balanced teams with paralysis support needing an offensive threat, and defensive teams with Rapid Spin to more easily remove Dark-weak foes and facilitate spinning. Offensive Trick Room Bronzong provides Tyranitar with a critical ability to go first and break faster Pokemon. If Bronzong uses Explosion after setting up Trick Room, Tyranitar can often get multiple KOes with Stone Edge, especially against more frail offenses that cannot survive the power of a Choice Band Stone Edge or Crunch. Magnezone can be helpful here, as it traps Steel-types that resists Stone Edge and Crunch while also removing Skarmory and potentially defensive Jirachi. Other strong partners such as Dragonite, Swampert, Gengar, Gyarados, and Choice Specs Latias can switch into attacks Tyranitar is weak to and appreciate Magnezone's support. Tyranitar also helps support special attackers, as with Pursuit, it can remove Latias, Blissey, and Clefable from play. Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, Starmie, and offensive Empoleon are especially nice partners. As Choice Band Tyranitar and Trick Room Bronzong are fairly self-sufficient, they can fit alongside many offensive threats, such as Breloom, Metagross, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, mixed Dragonite, Heatran, and even Heracross.</p> <p>Due to Tyranitar's power against slower foes, it can fit effectively alongside extensive paralysis support. Defensive Jirachi, Starmie, defensive Breloom, and defensive Zapdos are quite effective defensive support for Tyranitar. Starmie is especially helpful, as it can safely spin away hazards to help keep Tyranitar alive. As Tyranitar itself can struggle to break through bulky Pokemon even with paralysis, it is commonly paired with other slow synergetic offensive Pokemon such as Machamp, Curse Swampert, and Rhyperior. Choice Band Tyranitar also helps to break through difficult threats for defensive teams, such as Calm Mind Clefable and offensive Latias. Good defensive partners such as Bronzong, defensive Celebi, Gliscor, defensive Heatran, specially defensive Empoleon, and Clefable can be valuable. Defensive Celebi is especially useful, as it can spread paralysis and withstand strong Water-types such as Gyarados, Swampert, and rain sweepers such as Kingdra that threaten Tyranitar.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tyranitar's massive defenses make it extraordinarily bulky with maximum investment and Leftovers. This makes it a natural user of Stealth Rock, as it can survive almost any special attack and set up the entry hazard. As Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery, Protect helps to minimize residual damage and more easily heal. It also scouts attacks and stacks sand damage on vulnerable Pokemon such as Latias, Gyarados, Infernape, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Crunch and Payback give Tyranitar a strong offensive option against Dark-weak foes such as Latias, Gengar, Starmie, and Rotom-A. Crunch has more PP and has a chance to drop Defense, while Payback is stronger if Tyranitar moves last. Crunch is more reliable, but Payback helps to make up for Tyranitar's lack of Attack investment. Earthquake lets Tyranitar prevent setup from foes such as opposing Tyranitar, Jirachi, Heatran, and Empoleon. Tyranitar is bulky enough to survive their attacks; +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar fails to OHKO with Earthquake, while maximum Special Attack Empoleon fails to 2HKO Tyranitar with Hydro Pump. Low Kick is another option to OHKO Tyranitar and still hit Heatran and Empoleon hard. Note that Low Kick does the same amount of damage to Clefable and Blissey as Crunch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and maximum Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature make Tyranitar as bulky as possible. It notably allows it to survive powerful super effective special attacks such as Life Orb Gengar's Focus Blast and Choice Specs Kingdra's Hydro Pump. Another option is to maximize physical bulk with 252 Defense EVs and an Impish nature instead, as Tyranitar's base 110 Defense allows it to survive even +1 Gyarados's Waterfall after Stealth Rock and respond accordingly. It is still quite bulky even with no Special Defense EVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar should lead or come in the game early and get sand and Stealth Rock up. Especially in the lead, there are many different types of Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf or otherwise offensive variants, meaning foes are unlikely to  prevent its setup with Taunt. Tyranitar can also use Protect to scout what the foe will do. From here, Tyranitar should use its huge bulk to answer foes, such as Latias and Zapdos. Unlike Choice Scarf Tyranitar, defensive Tyranitar survives against frail special attackers such as Gengar and Latias rather than outspeeding and Pursuit trapping them. Don't be afraid to take huge damage from Gengar's Focus Blast or Empoleon's Hydro Pump to remove them, especially since Tyranitar can often heal effectively with Protect if entry hazards are not up. Try to keep Tyranitar away from setup sweepers its coverage cannot hit super effectively; not only can they take advantage of Protect, Tyranitar cannot do anything to bulky hazard users such as Skarmory and Forretress; Substitute attackers that threaten it such as Breloom, Machamp, and Jirachi; and setup sweepers that threaten it, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Swords Dance Lucario. Tyranitar also should beware of Knock Off from Clefable and Empoleon, as they take away its primary way of healing: Leftovers. It also cannot really threaten them effectively. Tyranitar is also really hampered by poison or burn; getting paralyzed or otherwise staying away from status users helps keep it healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar is commonly used on bulkier offenses and teams built around Fighting-types. Stall teams typically prefer the Speed and ability to checkmate Gengar and Latias that Choice Scarf Tyranitar provides instead of the raw bulk this set has. Defensive Tyranitar can be a stopgap against multiple offensive Pokemon that balanced teams enjoy. Some common defensive partners include defensive Empoleon and Gliscor. Empoleon can survive the Water-type attacks Tyranitar only wants to take in an emergency, while Tyranitar is a fantastic answer to Electric-types such as Zapdos that Empoleon struggles with. Gliscor takes on Ground- and Fighting-types that Tyranitar loathes such as Breloom and Flygon, while Tyranitar can beat Gengar and Rotom-A and sets up sand. Both of these Pokemon can set up Stealth Rock, which allows Tyranitar to potentially fit other moves such as Pursuit or Toxic. Having this defensive flexibility allows more offensive teammates alongside these Pokemon. Some examples include Breloom, Infernape, and offensive Heatran. Breloom in particular is a fantastic choice, as it enjoys Tyranitar taking on frail Dark-weak foes after it uses Spore and can take on the defensive teams this set struggles with due to it absorbing Knock Off once the Toxic Orb activates. Infernape can additionally break down defensive teams should Tyranitar beat Starmie and Latias. Torment or otherwise offensive Heatran appreciates Tyranitar taking on some of its defensive roles so that it can keep its health high to make Substitutes. This Tyranitar appreciates Rapid Spin support due to both how easily it lets entry hazards get set up and how weak it is to them. Both offensive and defensive choices work; Choice Specs Starmie can blast through the offensive Pokemon Tyranitar struggles with while potentially getting rid of hazards, while Tentacruel absorbs Toxic Spikes and can more easily spin hazards away.</p> <p>Tyranitar also enjoys help against setup sweepers, as although it can survive a hit, it severely compromises its bulk to do so. Both Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias can help here. Additionally, other strong defensive teammates such as defensive Latias, Bronzong, Milotic, Clefable, and RestTalk Rotom-A can help Tyranitar handle its weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "TyraniBoah (SubPunch)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The principle of this set is pretty simple: thanks to its natural bulk, Tyranitar can switch in on a plethora of Pokemon that don't threaten it like Latias, Zapdos without Toxic or Thunder Wave, and Choice-locked Rotom and then set a Substitute. Tyranitar simultaneously doesn't worry about Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, since it can use Substitute before they have an opportunity to status it. Behind Substitute, Tyranitar becomes an enormous threat for bulkier teams. While many of these more defensive teams can usually deal with mixed Tyranitar via smart pivots to faster threats, Substitute totally invalidates this strategy and gives SubPunch Tyranitar an important advantage.</p> <p>Focus Punch, even without STAB, will always do respectable damage thanks to its high Base Power combined with Tyranitar's high Attack. It allows Tyranitar to hit Clefable, Blissey, and Steel-types like Heatran, Scizor, Jirachi, Magnezone, Bronzong, and even Skarmory for great damage. Ice Beam threatens the usual Tyranitar checks like Gliscor, Breloom, and Hippowdon but also hits Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite and Zapdos. Finally, Crunch gives Tyranitar a powerful STAB attack that enables it to deal with all Latias variants more effectively and hit Psychic- and Ghost-types like Rotom-A, Starmie, Celebi, and Gengar. Flamethrower is an option too if you want to deal with Scizor, Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP allows Tyranitar to create a 101-HP Substitute, which means it can't be broken by Clefable's or Blissey's Seismic Toss. 100 Special Attack EVs guarantee Tyranitar will always OHKO Gliscor, 252 HP Dragonite after Stealth Rock, and Breloom after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes with Ice Beam, as well as improving its chances against Hippowdon. The rest of the EVs are put in Attack to maximize Tyranitar's power. A Lonely nature is preferred to both preserve Special Attack and Speed and maximize Attack. The Speed is especially important so that Tyranitar can create a Substitute before Blissey and Clefable can cripple it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using this set is pretty simple; use Tyranitar's bulk to set up a Substitute on Pokemon like Rotom, Clefable, and Blissey, and then utilize its wide coverage to threaten a large portion of the metagame. However, Tyranitar needs to be preserved from status, and it's better if it switches on a Soft-Boiled from Clefable and Blissey, since being paralyzed or hit with Knock Off will reduce its utility. For the same reason, Tyranitar can only be brought in on non-Will-O-Wisp Rotom. If you can predict a switch-in by such a Rotom, it can highly reward you by allowing Tyranitar to create some holes in the opposing team, especially due to Focus Punch's high power and spammable nature thanks to the Substitute and the rest of Tyranitar's coverage. However, preserving Tyranitar's HP is really important, and you need to set a Substitute only when Tyranitar can safely do enough damage to make it profitable to you. For the same reason, you need to play this Tyranitar set very safely around entry hazards, especially if you do not have any spinners on your team. When Tyranitar is under a Substitute, you don't need to make predictions because your opponent can't afford to do multiple switches before breaking the Substitute. However, making a good prediction (versus an important wincon or a U-turn user, for example) can give you a huge advantage in the game. Finally, use Crunch as much as possible early-game, as this keeps Tyranitar's remaining moves a secret, which is useful to better surprise Pokemon like Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Breloom with Ice Beam or set up Substitute more effectively once the team has been scouted out a bit more.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best way to support SubPunch Tyranitar is to give it some opportunities to switch in and set up a Substitute. Powerful special attackers like Heatran, Starmie, Zapdos, Latias, and Calm Mind Jirachi are perfect for this job thanks to their ability to lure Blissey and Clefable onto the field so that Tyranitar can set up a Substitute. Magma Storm + Taunt Heatran is particularly effective thanks to its ability to trap Blissey and Clefable and prevent them from inducing status, giving a free Substitute opportunity to Tyranitar. Entry hazard support is also super appreciated for wearing down Tyranitar checks like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Swampert. In addition, Tyranitar forces a ton of switches to capitalize on hazards thanks to its great coverage and ability to gain momentum. Moreover, by weakening Swampert, Skarmory, Zapdos, and Hippowdon, TyraniBoah gives opportunities to some sweepers like Swords Dance Lucario, Agility Metagross, and Trick Room Bronzong. However, keeping hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, away from your side is super important, so a spinner (or at least a grounded Poison-type Pokemon) is really useful. Finally, Pokemon like Zapdos, Rotom, and Celebi are always nice to wear down bulky Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, and Vaporeon.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi is one of the better utility Pokemon in the DPP OU metagame. Celebi’s access to reliable recovery, wide range of support moves, and Grass / Psychic typing gives it a unique list of Pokemon it counters. It is notably the best counter in the game to Breloom due to Natural Cure, resistances, and huge bulk and checks most offensive Water-types such as Dragon Dance Gyarados lacking Bounce, Swampert, Empoleon, and Suicune. These openings allow Celebi to take advantage of its wide support movepool with choices such as Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Heal Bell, U-Turn, and Perish Song. Celebi also can go on the offensive with boosting moves such as Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, allowing it to set up and take on defensive threats such as Clefable, Jirachi, Heatran, and Skarmory that invalidate defensive Celebi. Celebi also is unique in that nothing in the tier shuts down builds that don't have the tools to deal with it like it does—hyper offensive teams can really struggle against Celebi spreading paralysis and walling everything due to its huge bulk, while some slower defensive teams give Nasty Plot Celebi openings to break down the team with boosted attacks.</p> <p>Celebi, however, is reduced to being niche in DPP OU due to the severe flaws from its typing and competition from Latias. Celebi is grounded and has seven weaknesses—of these, the five of Bug, Dark, Fire, Ice, and Ghost are the most critical. Celebi is 4x weak to U-Turn, meaning Flygon, Jirachi, Infernape, Zapdos, and Scizor can come in and freely gain momentum on Celebi, as even physically bulky Celebi is at least 2HKOed by most U-turn. Celebi's Psychic-typing means it is vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar, as it can’t OHKO Tyranitar without a boost. Celebi's other weaknesses open it up to Heatran, boosting Water-types with Ice-type coverage such as Empoleon and Gyarados, Rotom-A, and Gengar. Defensive Celebi also struggles broadly against bulkier teams, as it cannot hurt Clefable and its weak coverage options are otherwise easy to wall. Celebi struggles mightily with entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, but Spikes also neuter its great bulk. Celebi often cannot prevent Skarmory from setting up Spikes, either. Offensive Celebi is both easy to wear down and easy to force out, as it is forced to use Leaf Storm for power due to Clefable, Rotom-A, and other defensive Pokemon not being hit hard by Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Offensive Celebi gives up a lot of its defensive utility, as it relies on its Speed and power to check offensive Water-types and Breloom rather than numerical bulk. Celebi additionally struggles to differentiate itself from Latias, as Latias is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, has much greater offensive prowess, and does not have as many weaknesses as Celebi does while having a similar set of resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Celebi has a ton of other options not especially viable in the DPP OU metagame. One of the more prominent of these is a Calm Mind set with Recover and defensive EVs to act as a win condition. Such a set often struggles to stay on the field, due to being easily forced out by weaknesses and status. Other previous sets such as offensive Life Orb support with Thunder Wave, Leaf Storm, Recover, and another coverage move, any Leech Seed sets, Choice Scarf, and Occa Berry + Stealth Rock leads are not very effective in the modern DPP OU metagame. Celebi generally needs to be either very bulky or fast, as Celebi doesn’t have enough numerical bulk when uninvested to handle boosted Water-types while also struggling against Tyranitar, Toxic Spikes, and various U-Turn users. Offensive Celebi is walled by many dangerous threats with only one coverage move. Leech Seed sets are largely invalidated by Clefable, as Celebi can’t damage it effectively outside of a boosted Leaf Storm. Leech Seed also doesn’t help against U-Turn users that will switch out immediately. Celebi has a good Speed tier and access to Trick and U-Turn, but Celebi’s offensive choices have little utility as well as Leaf Storm forcing Celebi out immediately. Celebi also is vulnerable to Tyranitar’s Pursuit. Celebi in the lead position is very weak to common U-turn leads such as Azelf, Uxie, Gliscor, and Flygon, while the Occa Berry will not save it against Choice Specs Heatran. Celebi without Leftovers struggles with longevity, while Celebi generally needs defensive investment to repeatedly set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Other than these, Celebi has a humongous support movepool—options such as Heal Bell, Perish Song, Rain Dance, Healing Wish, Light Screen, Reflect, Trick Room, Heal Block, and Toxic are all possible either as their own set or in the last slot of the utility set. Celebi has base 100 Attack, access to Swords Dance, and a unique physical movepool including Seed Bomb, Sucker Punch, and Zen Headbutt; however, it is exceedingly weak and can struggle to break through Steel-types even when boosted.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>U-turn Revenge Killers</strong>: Flygon, Scizor, Zapdos, Jirachi, Infernape, Azelf, and Gliscor can freely generate momentum off of Celebi with U-turn due to its 4x weakness to Bug. This debilitating weakness prevents defensive Celebi from staying on the field too long and revenge kills offensive Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Bad Luck</strong>: Defensive Celebi can be a magnet for critical hits and secondary status effects. Celebi is very bulky, but does not do a lot of damage, especially if it is not hitting super effectively. Celebi barely avoids 2HKOes from strong attacks such as offensive Empoleon's Ice Beam or Gyarados +1 Ice Fang, and continuously using Recover to get at serviceable health can put Celebi at risk of being frozen or taken out by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Celebi is weak to Toxic Spikes and easily allows foes such as Skarmory to set up Spikes. The extra residual damage makes it difficult for Celebi to repeatedly switch and wall opponents or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Despite being able to OHKO Tyranitar with offensive sets or paralyze and 2HKO it with defensive sets, Tyranitar’s Crunch and Pursuit heavily damage Celebi, OHKOing offensive sets without a Colbur Berry after Stealth Rock in sand and 2HKOing defensive sets. Lum Berry Dragon Dance Tyranitar can absorb Thunder Wave and at least 2HKO back with Crunch, while Choice Scarf sets outspeed and checkmate Celebi. Weavile, while being less common, threats Celebi the same way.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Celebi often has to choose between hitting Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Scizor and hitting Dragon-types. All of these threats take advantage of Celebi: Skarmory 2HKOes offensive Celebi with Brave Bird and sets up Spikes, Bronzong walls Celebi easily, and Scizor OHKOs Celebi with U-Turn. Should Celebi lack either Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Lucario easily take advantage of Celebi especially if it lacks Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Without Hidden Power Ice, Celebi is set up fodder for Latias and Dragonite, although they do not enjoy being paralyzed. Latias can even take one boosted Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with strong attacks. Flygon is particularly dangerous even if it does not take Celebi's attacks well, as U-turn from Choiced sets forces it out and Fire Blast from mixed sets heavily damages it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Despite fearing Earth Power and Thunder Wave, Heatran and Infernape easily OHKO Celebi with Fire-type coverage. Should Celebi lack these moves, they can come in repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom-A and Gengar at least 2HKO Celebi with Shadow Ball and will often outspeed it. Gengar resists Grass-type coverage, while Rotom-A takes little damage from Grass Knot due to its low weight. Neither enjoy paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong> Zapdos, Gyarados with Bounce, and Togekiss can 2HKO Celebi easily with their Flying-type attacks or Heat Wave in Zapdos’s case. All of them do not enjoy Thunder Wave, however.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable doesn’t care about anything defensive Celebi does with the exception of Heal Block and uses Knock Off. It has to be careful of a Meadow Plate +2 Leaf Storm OHKOing it, however.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Water-Types such as Gyarados and Suicune often carry Ice-Type moves. While these are usually not powerful enough to KO Celebi outright, they can leave it unable to handle the next threats the opponent may carry.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebi's many resistances and bulk allow it to be an effective wall. Beyond obligatory recovery, Celebi is able to support its team, spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave or setting up Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave helps Celebi wall threats effectively, as Grass Knot and Leaf Storm dissuade Ground-types immune to Thunder Wave from switching in. If this is not needed, Celebi is a superb user of Stealth Rock, as it threatens the most common spinner in Starmie. As the main offensive option, Grass Knot is the preferred choice, as it reliably hits many threats hard, such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, Suicune, and Swampert. However, as some threats such as Clefable, Rotom-A, and Gliscor take comparatively little from Grass Knot, Leaf Storm is a powerful alternative, as it doesn't care about weight and provides a strong first hit. Beware of the stat drops forcing Celebi out, however. A much stronger Grass-type attack distinguishes Celebi from Latias, as while Latias's Grass Knot is fairly weak, Celebi's Grass Knot easily OHKOes Swampert, 2HKOes Tyranitar and Suicune, and 3HKOes Gyarados, giving them less time to threaten Celebi offensively.</p> <p>The last slot determines additional coverage and potentially other support moves. The most prominent option is Hidden Power Fire, as it damages Skarmory, Scizor, Forretress, and Roserade and prevents them from setting up with impunity. Hidden Power Ice is another option for 2HKOing Dragonite and Gliscor while also hitting Latias. Both of these options hit Breloom, but Psychic is the best of these, OHKOing frail Breloom and being the best option for Gengar and Machamp. Beware of the poor coverage other with Psychic, however. Another option is to make Celebi a bulky pivot with U-turn, as being able to absorb a hit and then keep momentum with U-turn is another niche it has over Latias. Unfortunately, unlike Baton Pass, U-turn is affected by Pursuit if Celebi is faster than the user, so it should be used on the switch in to chip Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Celebi is required to run a physically defensive set. The Speed investment given outspeeds Tyranitar with the 30 Speed IV from Hidden Power Fire while the remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense. Celebi's niche is its increased physical bulk over Latias, and needs to have nearly maximum investment to have a noticeable impact. With this investment, Celebi is extraordinarily bulky—unlike Latias, it survives 2 Ice Fang from +1 Gyarados, +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar Crunch after Stealth Rock, and +2 Lucario Crunch 50% of the time after Stealth Rock. The bulk also lets Celebi survive U-turn more comfortably and continuously absorb Breloom's attacks, even while asleep. It thus needs to Recover less often, making it less vulnerable to critical hits as it tries to heal.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Celebi should generally only switch into threats it walls, such as Gyarados lacking Bounce, Swampert, and Breloom, and use its utility move such as Thunder Wave or Stealth Rock if the team needs to set it up. Celebi can more reliably switch into Gyarados and Swampert than Latias, as it has Natural Cure to shrug off a potential freeze from Ice-type attacks. Celebi can also switch in an emergency, such as against boosted Lucario and Tyranitar to live the boosted hit and mitigate the threat. Keep Celebi away from Pokemon setting up entry hazards, Clefable, and offensive Pokemon with U-turn. However, against more offensive teams that lack these options, Celebi is restrictive to play against, as it can come in repeatedly to wall even boosted threats and spread paralysis. With U-turn, Celebi can come in more often, as it generates momentum on its checks and counters. Celebi can also take Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, or Toxic and then U-turn rid itself of status with Natural Cure.</p> <p>Avoid trying to use Recover too much, as continuous healing on an attack such as Empoleon's Ice Beam can lead to Celebi getting frozen or faint to a critical hit. Celebi is not as weak to Pursuit Tyranitar as other Psychic-types due to its bulk and ability to 2HKO Tyranitar with Grass Knot, but still should be careful against Tyranitar, as Crunch 2HKOes without a boost and Choice Band Crunch will put Celebi at very low health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Celebi requires extensive support to function without being outclassed by defensive Latias, as Celebi generally occupies the same niche. Celebi only fits on defensive teams, as its lack of offensive pressure and exploitable weaknesses force a large support network. To counteract Toxic Spikes, Celebi needs either a spinner such as Forretress, Starmie, and Tentacruel or a grounded Poison-type to absorb Toxic Spikes, such as Nidoqueen and Tentacruel due to Roserade’s poor fit. Forretress is especially helpful, as it can set up Spikes and Celebi assists against sweepers trying to take advantage of it. Celebi also supports Leftovers Heatran well, as they resist a huge number of types in the game between the two of them including all of their respective weaknesses. Heatran also threatens entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Forretress while being a strong Jirachi counter. Heatran and Starmie fit well together in a Fire-Water-Grass core by Rapid Spinning away Spikes and also spreading paralysis. Celebi appreciates back up answers to special threats, as offensive Water-types can score a critical hit or freeze as it tries to heal off their attacks. Clefable and Blissey help in this regard. Celebi also enjoys help against opposing Clefable, as it switches into every option it has and uses Knock Off or sets up with Calm Mind. Choice Band Tyranitar and one’s own Clefable are sufficient for this.</p> <p>Celebi does appreciate Magnezone support, however, it is often difficult to fit all of the pieces needed to support Celebi alongside Magnezone without being vulnerable to Roserade. Generally, Latias fits better alongside Magnezone. Other stall stalwarts such as Wish + Protect Jirachi, RestTalk Gyarados, Gliscor, Leftovers Bronzong, Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Skarmory work as teammates, as they provide additional defensive support and appreciate the back up against strong physical sweepers Celebi provides.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebi has a unique niche as a boosting Grass-type with Nasty Plot, allowing it to take advantage of its resistances to go on the offensive. Nasty Plot compliments it well, as it doesn't have a lot of longevity and needs as much power as it can get. The STAB move typically comes down to the rest of the team. Leaf Storm is the preferred move with Nasty Plot; despite resetting Nasty Plot, the power is needed to have a chance to OHKO Clefable. Leaf Storm also can break through utility and defensive Tyranitar, while even soft resists such as offensive Latias take a lot of damage from a +2 Leaf Storm. Grass Knot and Psychic are more reliable options, but Grass Knot does not damage Clefable and Rotom-A effectively, while Psychic is resisted by much of the tier and gives Tyranitar free entry.</p> <p>Earth Power is critical for offensive Celebi, as it OHKOes Heatran after a boost and heavily damages prominent Ground-weak Pokemon such as Jirachi, Metagross, Tyranitar (should Celebi have Psychic), and Lucario. The final move completes Celebi’s coverage: Hidden Power Ice is the main option as it has perfect coverage outside of Bronzong and hits Latias and Dragonite hard while OHKOing Flygon without reducing its Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire is also helpful for hitting Steel-types neutral to Ground hard, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong. However, beware of the lower Speed IV needed, causing it to tie with maximum Speed Rotom-A and always be outsped by maximum Speed Zapdos, Jirachi, and Flygon. Celebi can also run Recover over the Hidden Power slot. Celebi loses super effective coverage on Breloom unless it uses Psychic should it go down this route, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Celebi generally needs all the power it can get, and a simple maximum Special Attack, maximum Speed Modest EV spread emphasizes this. This gives Celebi a desirably speed tier—as offensive Celebi checks threats with its Speed and power, outspeeding all variants of Suicune, Heatran, Rotom-A, and Gyarados allows it to hit hard before taking damage. The Modest nature also gives Celebi the best chance to OHKO Clefable at +2, OHKO Dragon Dance Gyarados after Stealth Rock and Suicune after a Calm Mind at +0, and OHKO maximum HP Heatran with Earth Power at +0. Timid is also possible to outspeed as much as possible, including Gliscor before it can U-Turn, at least tie with maximum Speed Zapdos, Jirachi, and Flygon, and outspeed Roserade and Lucario. Celebi can invest around 88 HP EVs to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Crunch after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>There are many different possible item choices for this Celebi. As Celebi is vulnerable to many types of residual damage, Leftovers gives it the maximum amount of chances to fire off strong attacks. This is especially important against defensive teams, as once Celebi sets up a Nasty Plot, the opponent can pivot around to wear it down. If Celebi uses Leaf Storm into a Latias or Jirachi, it may be too weak to set up another Nasty Plot. However, Celebi has no chance to OHKO Clefable without a boosting item at +2, while Meadow Plate gives it an 87.5% chance to do so. It also maximizes the chance to OHKO utility Tyranitar after Stealth Rock at +0, while even resists such as specially defensive Jirachi and defensive Latias can be 2HKOed by +4 into +2 Leaf Storm with Meadow Plate. However, Celebi is quite vulnerable to Choice Scarf Tyranitar on defensive teams; Colbur Berry variants easily absorb its Crunch and OHKOes back with +0 Leaf Storm after two rounds Stealth Rock. Other resistance berries such as Occa Berry for Heatran and Infernape as well as Kasib Berry for Rotom-A and Gengar are possible, but are more niche.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How this Celebi is used depends on the match-up; against offensive teams, Celebi rarely gets to set up and checks offensive Water-types, Breloom, and Lucario. Celebi needs to be close to full HP to check these, however, so keeping it healthy before this purpose is critical. It also is easily forced out both after it uses Leaf Storm and by super effective coverage such as from Flygon, Rotom-A, and Heatran or U-turn from various revenge killers.</p> <p>Against more defensive teams, leverage the expectation that Celebi is defensive to set up a Nasty Plot. Due to Celebi’s weakness to entry hazards and especially Toxic Spikes, it should be brought in early against walls that don’t threaten it like Milotic and defensive Breloom. Opponents will often send in Clefable or Skarmory to set up hazards or use Knock Off on Celebi due the defensive set’s passivity, giving an opportunity to set up and attack. Be careful about when to use Leaf Storm, as Celebi’s coverage hits many common Leaf Storm answers such as Latias, Skarmory, and Jirachi very hard and more importantly doesn’t lower its stats. Against sturdier special walls such as Blissey, Celebi should set up to +4 or +6 before attacking—a +4 into +2 Leaf Storm KOes Blissey after Stealth Rock with a Meadow Plate while +6 OHKOes outright. With Recover, Celebi can be more flexible when to come in, but beware of Clefable’s Encore as Psychic only OHKOes at +6.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Celebi generally is used with on teams with weak answers to offensive Water-types that can afford Celebi’s flaws. The more prominent of these is on Magnezone offenses, as Magnezone can trap Bronzong and Skarmory, allowing Celebi to freely run Hidden Power Ice. Celebi also appreciates other common choices on these teams; offensive Trick Room Bronzong teams typically struggle against Water-types and Breloom, giving Celebi an easy switch-in. Gengar gives another answer to Breloom, as this Celebi doesn’t absorb its hits as well and can be 2HKOed by Focus Punch. Choice Scarf Flygon can revenge kill threats that set up on a -2 Celebi, such as Dragonite. In return, Choice Scarf revenge killers with U-turn such as opposing Flygon struggle with Trick Room Bronzong while Choice Band Tyranitar can help break through defensive teams. Offensive Heatran is an excellent partner, as it break through bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Jirachi while Celebi resists all of its weakness. Swampert also appreciates Magnezone and supports Celebi, as it can tank hits from Tyranitar and Jirachi as well as resist Heatran’s Fire-type coverage. Heatran and Swampert can potentially form a Fire-Water-Grass core alongside Celebi.</p> <p>Celebi fits on hyper offense teams due to these teams struggling against offensive Calm Mind Suicune and Dragon Dance Gyarados, but Leaf Storm can be a huge momentum sink. With Recover, Celebi appreciates partners that maximize its longevity, such as Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Nidoqueen and counters to Choice Scarf Flygon such as Milotic and Skarmory.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a very dangerous Pokemon to face in the rain. It has solid Special Attack, allowing it to be a fearsome sweeper. It also has very good special bulk, allowing it to take special hits well. Even its Attack is decent, meaning it can surprise many of its counters with either Focus Punch on a special set, or by going all out with a Swords Dance set. Being able to handle almost all Water-types is not something many Pokemon can boast, so Ludicolo makes a great option for any Rain Dance team.</p> <p>Ludicolo can't cover everything in one set and so will always have problems with some Pokemon; however, with adequate support, it can get past these barriers and be a menace to your opponent's team. Its ability Swift Swim means almost no Pokemon, barring Choice Scarf users, can outspeed it, helping it sweep even more easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ludicolo could run a Choice Specs set; however, in the rain, where every rain turn is precious, this is not the best idea. Thunder Punch could be used for a powerful hit on Gyarados on the Swords Dance set; however, losing Ice Punch would make you weak to Dragon- and Grass-types, and not running Swords Dance is not an option, due to Ludicolo's low Attack stat. Giga Drain is another option for a Grass-type attack which can also recover some of your health, but the loss of Base Power makes it a much lesser option. Ludicolo could use Zen Headbutt to hit Toxicroak, but it is very rarely seen in OU. Focus Blast hits some Steel-types hard, but Surf hits most hard enough and if you want a Fighting-type attack, you're better off with Focus Punch, as that can deal with Blissey. Ludicolo can use Fake Out, but this has limited use.</p> <p>Ludicolo has access to recovery in Synthesis, but it only heals 1/4 in rain so it isn't a good option. Ludicolo can use Substitute to ease prediction or in combination with Focus Punch; however, this takes up a valuable moveslot, which there are better options for.</p> <p>209 Speed (132 Speed EVs) should be a minimum on offensive sets to outspeed +1 positive natured Heatran in the rain. 225 Speed (196 Speed EVs) is usually best to outrun +1 neutral natured base 100s, but maxing Speed is also fine to Speed tie with other base 70 Speed Pokemon outside of rain, such as Breloom and Metagross (although they rarely run maximum Speed).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey easily handles special attacking Ludicolo without Focus Punch, thanks to its enormous HP stat and high Special Defense. Snorlax similarly does very well if Ludicolo lacks Focus Punch, but needs Rest if it wants to continuously switch in. Tentacruel laughs at all sets except Swords Dance thanks to its high Special Defense and STAB Poison-type attacks to take care of Ludicolo. Unlike other special walls, it actually resists Focus Punch, which helps it counter Ludicolo even more. Celebi is 2HKOed by Ice Beam, but as long as it doesn't switch in on that, it can handle any Ludicolo without the very rare Hidden Power Bug. Thunder Wave will make the sweeping Ludicolo sets practically useless. Cresselia can take its attacks well and effectively stop its sweep with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Abomasnow laughs at almost anything Ludicolo can throw at it, while clearing the rain. Ludicolo can Focus Punch it on the switch or 2HKO most variations with Hidden Power Bug, but these aren't used that often, especially the latter being very rare. Abomasnow's Grass-typing means it's unaffected by Leech Seed, while its high Special Defense lets it take Ludicolo's attacks well.</p> <p>For the Swords Dance set, Skarmory can easily take it on by either Whirlwinding any Swords Dances it has netted or just killing it off with Brave Bird. Cresselia can wear it down with Ice Beam and sponge its hits by setting up a Reflect. Bulky Gyarados can take it on thanks to Intimidate. If it runs Bounce, it will easily OHKO Ludicolo or can just finish off a weakened one with Stone Edge. It can also cripple it with Thunder Wave. Dusknoir and Spiritomb are bulky enough to handle a Swords Danced Waterfall and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Toxicroak may be UU and so rare in OU, but it can do very well since it is immune to Water-type attacks, due to its Dry Skin ability, and is also resistant to Grass-type attacks. It can also take an Ice Beam and OHKO with STAB Poison-type attacks or often with its STAB Life Orb Cross Chop, with Stealth Rock in play.</p>",

      "Rain Dance Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Ludicolo is an amazing special sweeper in the rain, not having trouble with the bulky Water-types that populate OU, unlike most other special Swift Swim sweepers. Surf is your main STAB attack in the rain and a truly terrifying one at that, always OHKOing the standard 248 HP / min SpD Scizor with Stealth Rock in play and hitting almost everything that doesn't resist it for at least a 2HKO. A Grass-type STAB helps deal with most bulky Water-types; the choice of Grass Knot or Energy Ball comes down to how much trouble you have with Vaporeon. If you don't have much trouble with it, Grass Knot is preferred as it hits almost all other bulky Water-types harder than Energy Ball and manages a 2HKO on bulky Gyarados, even without Stealth Rock. However, if you have a lot of trouble with Vaporeon, then Energy Ball is preferred as it still hits most bulky Water-types hard enough, but unlike Grass Knot, it does enough damage to Vaporeon so that it can't stall you out by using Wish + Protect as Life Orb recoil slowly weakens you. Ice Beam hits the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist the Water- and Grass-type combination super effectively. It also hits Flying-types super effectively, but it must be noted that a neutral Surf in the rain is stronger than a 2x super effective Ice Beam.</p> <p>The last slot is the most arguable when it comes to what to use. Rain Dance is usually the preferred option as you can never have too many Pokemon with Rain Dance on a Rain Dance team, and Ludicolo has the special bulk to set it up. Focus Punch is a great alternative, though, since with a Rash nature and 60 Atk EVs, Focus Punch + Surf in the rain and Stealth Rock damage will always take out 24 HP / 232 SpD Calm Blissey, relieving Ludicolo of what is usually the biggest problem this set faces. Other useful options for this slot are Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Bug. Hidden Power Electric always OHKOes 4 HP versions of Gyarados, and with Stealth Rock, the same goes for bulky versions, making it particularly useful if running Energy Ball rather than Grass Knot. Hidden Power Bug has a high chance to OHKO the standard 252 HP Celebi with Stealth Rock support, whereas Ice Beam can only muster a 2HKO. When running Hidden Power Bug, use 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe since the Speed drop from running Hidden Power Bug would otherwise mean you wouldn't outrun +1 neutral natured base 100s. Hydro Pump can be used over Surf since the extra power secures OHKOs on 252 HP Togekiss, 252 HP Metagross, specially defensive Forretress, and specially defensive Skarmory for example (all with Stealth Rock support). However, the accuracy loss makes it less appealing than Surf, which still has a lot of power in the rain.</p> <p>If you're having trouble choosing between Grass Knot and Energy Ball, here are some damage calculations to help you:</p> <ul> <li>Grass Knot vs. maximum HP Suicune: 79.2% - 94.1%</li> <li>Grass Knot vs. 188 HP Vaporeon: 51.3% - 60.7%</li> <li>Grass Knot vs. 156 HP Gyarados: 58.6% - 69.2%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. maximum HP Suicune: 63.9% - 75.7%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. 188 HP Vaporeon: 67.4% - 79.5%</li> <li>Energy Ball vs. 156 HP Gyarados: 39.2% - 46.5%</li> </ul> <p>A Modest nature and 196 Speed EVs reaches 225 Speed which means that in the rain, Ludicolo will outspeed neutral natured +1 base 100s. You could just max your Speed as this will at worst result in a Speed tie with neutral Breloom and Metagross outside the rain. When it is raining, however, you will outspeed 176 Speed EV +1 positive base 100s, but the extra bulk is usually more useful. Timid nature can be used since when it is raining, it allows Ludicolo to outspeed +1 positive base 100s and +1 +Speed Infernape, while outside of rain, Ludicolo will outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, neutral natured Mamoswine and Togekiss, and neutral natured Gyarados (or +2 Gyarados in rain). However, the loss of power will make it a lot harder for Ludicolo to deal with some of the bulkier Pokemon. Swift Swim is the obvious ability since this set aims to sweep in the rain where Swift Swim doubles its Speed. Life Orb is used since the extra power it provides helps against a multitude of Pokemon, getting OHKOs and 2HKOs it otherwise wouldn't get, but Damp Rock can be used if you have Rain Dance and want more Rain Dance turns.</p> <p>Since this set aims to sweep in the rain, its teammates should either set up Rain Dance to support it or also try and sweep in the rain. Kingdra is a great partner to Ludicolo since the mixed set can 2HKO both Blissey and Snorlax (with a rain boosted Waterfall) who this set can't deal with if it lacks Focus Punch. Kingdra can also use Hidden Power Electric or Signal Beam in place of Rain Dance for Gyarados and Celebi, respectively, since both of them can trouble Ludicolo. Faster Kingdra sets can also aid Ludicolo by taking out some of the faster Choice Scarf users which trouble Ludicolo, such as Gengar. Kabutops and Qwilfish are both very effective partners to Ludicolo since they both OHKO Blissey and Snorlax with a +2 Waterfall in the rain. A few other things they can do to help Ludicolo are dealing with Celebi with X-Scissor and Poison Jab respectively, and hitting Tentacruel hard with Stone Edge in Kabutops' case or Exploding on it if need be in Qwilfish's case. Also, their secondary STAB attacks are very helpful for taking care of Abomasnow who walls Ludicolo to no end, unless Ludicolo can predict the switch in and Focus Punch. Qwilfish's high Speed also allows it to deal with Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, who Ludicolo can't outspeed, OHKOing it 100% of the time with a rain boosted Waterfall. Both Gorebyss and Omastar can make decent partners, especially if this set has Focus Punch, since although they are both slow, they have a lot more power than Ludicolo, and therefore with Blissey out of the way, they can proceed to tear into the opposing team.</p> <p>The Rain Dance supporters who support Ludicolo best are simply those who can set it up most reliably and also get rid of Abomasnow and Tyranitar whose weather changing abilities disrupt Ludicolo. Hippowdon also changes the weather, but Ludicolo can use Surf or Grass Knot to kill it. Scizor is very effective since it has a STAB Bullet Punch to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon, can take care of Celebi with U-turn, and can also carry Brick Break or Superpower if need be for Blissey and Snorlax. Its many useful resistances allow it to set up Rain Dance for Ludicolo with relative ease. Although they are not common, Scizor is immune to the Poison-type moves that Ludicolo is weak to. Bronzong is probably the most reliable bulky Rain Dance set-upper there is so it makes a great partner to Ludicolo. It also has access to Explosion, which could help Ludicolo if Bronzong manages to Explode on one of the Pokemon who trouble Ludicolo. As a bonus, it also resists Ludicolo's Flying-type weakness and is immune to its Poison-type one, which may come in useful at times. Swampert is an effective partner since it is a great counter to Tyranitar and is also very reliable at setting up Rain Dance. It is also immune to Electric-type attacks, which while Ludicolo isn't weak to them, are still commonly aimed at it. Jirachi can also make an effective partner since it has many useful resistances and above average Speed, which allows it to set up Rain Dance quite easily and it also has a STAB Iron Head, which can take care of both Abomasnow and Tyranitar, assuming you get the 60% of a flinch. In the rain, Jirachi can also use 100% accurate Thunders with a 60% paralysis chance to slow down Choice Scarf users.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ludicolo may only have a base 70 Attack stat, but since the last thing your opponent will expect is a physical Ludicolo, this set can do some major damage. The idea is to switch into something like Swampert, who will almost certainly switch, and then Swords Dance on the switch. You may even be able to get two Swords Dances in if your opponent switches to Blissey. Waterfall is a powerful STAB attack, having 180 Base Power in the rain; it will easily OHKO Blissey after a Swords Dance in the rain, and with Stealth Rock up, 168 HP / 120 Def Snorlax always falls too. Seed Bomb is your other STAB, which hits Water-types hard, always OHKOing even the most defensive of Vaporeon at +2, and offensive Suicune too. It also does 80.2% - 95% to 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Suicune and 86.9% - 102.9% to 12 HP / 12 Def Empoleon, meaning you can sometimes OHKO them at +2 too. Ice Punch takes up the last slot to hit the Dragon- and Grass-types, which resist the Water- and Grass-type combination, hard.</p> <p>Adamant with maximum Attack is needed, since with only a base 70 Attack stat, Ludicolo needs all the investment it can get. Similar to the OU Offensive Rain (Special) set, 196 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 neutral base 100s in the rain with the rest put in HP to take hits better, but you can just use maximum Speed should you want to, at worst, Speed tie with neutral Breloom and Metagross outside the rain, and when it is raining, outspeeding 176 Speed EVs +1 positive base 100s, but the extra bulk is usually preferred. A Jolly nature is not a good option since although the extra Speed may come in handy at times, the loss of Attack badly hurts. Swift Swim is the chosen ability since this set aims to sweep in the rain. Life Orb is the best item since this set needs all the power it can get, and although Leftovers for extra recovery or Lum Berry to take status may be useful on rare occasions, they are nowhere near as useful as the extra power of Life Orb.</p> <p>Since this set aims to sweep in the rain, the best partners are either those who set up Rain Dance or can take advantage of it. For Swift Swim sweepers, special attacking ones are the best options for partners since this set can OHKO Blissey at +2 and with the best special wall out of the way, Kingdra, Omastar, and Gorebyss will have a much easier time sweeping. They can also help Ludicolo out by taking care of some of the physical walls which trouble Swords Dance Ludicolo, such as Skarmory. Special Kingdra is the best option out of those three since its higher Speed means it can't so easily be revenged by Choice Scarf users and opposing Swift Swim Kingdra. All three of the aforementioned Pokemon can run Hidden Power Electric to take care of Gyarados, who annoys this Ludicolo set by lowering its Attack through Intimidate. Swords Dance Kabutops and Qwilfish are also both great partners since Ludicolo is great at getting rid of bulky Water-types which trouble Qwilfish and also Kabutops if it can't get off a Swords Dance. Also, using two Swords Dance Pokemon can easily carve a gaping hole into your opponent's team for another Swift Swim sweeper to take advantage of.</p> <p>The best Rain Dance supporters to Ludicolo are those which can set it up reliably and also take care of some of the weather changing Pokemon who stop Ludicolo's sweep. Jirachi and Scizor both offer useful resistances and have STAB Steel-type moves in Iron Head and Bullet Punch, respectively, which will deal with both Abomasnow and Tyranitar. Jirachi can also use Thunder to OHKO Gyarados, whose Intimidate ability annoys Ludicolo. Bronzong is one of the most reliable Pokemon to set up Rain Dance mid-game so it makes an amazing partner to Ludicolo. Its Explosion may also help Ludicolo if it can Explode on a troublesome Pokemon, such as Gyarados. Starmie can make a nice partner since it has the Defense to take on most Gyarados and can then take it out with Thunder. It can also run Rapid Spin as Toxic Spikes will badly hinder Ludicolo's ability to sweep. Electric-types with Rain Dance, such as Jolteon, Magnezone, Rotom-A, and Zapdos, are also useful partners as they all destroy Gyarados and add some useful resistances to help Ludicolo out, such as to Electric-type attacks (except for Zapdos).</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom stands as one of the more difficult threats to cover in the tier thanks to its unique blend of survivability and power. Breloom’s access to Spore, Poison Heal ability as well as Toxic Orb's easy activation, and powerful Grass- and Fighting-type attacks make it one of the premier stallbreakers in the tier. Spore warps the tier: only a few Pokemon such as defensive Latias, Zapdos, and Celebi can stomach repeated attacks while asleep. Offensive teams are forced to sacrifice a key Pokemon to Spore, run a Sleep Talk user, or never give Breloom a chance to gain momentum with multiple fast Pokemon or Lum Berry. Defensive teams must typically carry two strong Breloom checks: one to absorb Spore and the other to beat it. Once Toxic Orb activates, Breloom prominently is immune to both status and Knock Off, making it difficult to wear down despite its poor defensive stats. Breloom's typing grants it key access to strong Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Seed Bomb, Superpower, and Focus Punch, allowing it to threaten prominent Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, Blissey, and Swampert.</p> <p>Breloom’s attributes allows it to feature on a wide variety of teams and different roles: the most offensive teams use Breloom early in the game to prevent Stealth Rock via sleep and gain momentum while more defensive teams can take advantage of disabling a threat with sleep, Leech Seed, and a strong Clefable answer. Mach Punch allows Breloom to keep most Tyranitar sets in check, crucial for supporting a Choice Scarf Latias or Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Defensive sets are fantastic status absorbers for opposing Breloom, Rotom-A, and Clefable while generally threatening much of the tier with Leech Seed and paralysis with Force Palm. Swords Dance sets with paralysis support can slice through even multiple bulky checks such as Skarmory, Nidoqueen, and Latias. Substitute sets easily punish teams with poor Breloom checks with repeated Focus Punch without having to worry about revenge killing.</p> <p>Breloom’s flaws lie in its relatively low Speed and defensive stats, making it hard to fulfill all of its niches at once. Breloom is often stuck in a conundrum of needing to invest in its bulk to survive strong attacks such as +1 Tyranitar’s Fire Punch, +1 Gyarados’s Ice Fang, utility Tyranitar's Fire Blast, and Swampert’s Ice Beam, while still needing enough heavy Speed investment to outpace max Speed Swampert, Tyranitar, and slower version of Zapdos and Jirachi if Breloom has a Jolly nature. This makes Breloom vulnerable to offensive pressure from faster Pokemon such as Flygon, Heatran, Latias, Gengar, Dragonite, and Jirachi. Breloom’s survivability comes more from its resilience due to Poison Heal rather than numerical bulk even when invested; it can be overwhelmed by strong neutral attacks such as Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball and even resisted hits such as Choice Band Tyranitar’s Stone Edge. Although Breloom can be devastating if underprepared for, common cores are built to limit its impact. Hyper offensive teams often have multiple faster Pokemon with Lum Berry such as Dragonite and Metagross that can OHKO Breloom. Defensive Breloom is deathly afraid of Skarmory—Spikes heavily limit how often Breloom can come in and break common defensive cores, especially since defensive teams often have multiple Breloom counters. Even though Poison Heal heals Breloom in sand, it chips away at its resilience and makes it more difficult to function.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The most prominent other options for Breloom often involve dropping Spore. One of these is Bulk Up + Drain Punch, as a specially defensive EV spread can make Breloom a very bulky stallbreaker with Seed Bomb and Protect. However, such as set can struggle against strong attackers such as Latias and Gengar forcing it out. Breloom also has access to Stone Edge and Thunder Punch for specific targets; however, these are almost always outclassed by Seed Bomb and Facade as offensive options. Lead versions of Breloom especially should not use Thunder Punch, as it doesnt OHKO Gyarados after Intimidate. Defensive Breloom also can act as a weather clear for defensive Pokemon such as Suicune with Sunny Day, as it enjoys maximizing Poison Heal and easily forces out Tyranitar. Breloom can spread paralysis after it uses Spore with Stun Spore but watch out for its low accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Breloom is one of the most frustrating Pokemon to answer in DPP OU, as it can be a pest and survive due to Poison Heal's constant recovery while also putting to sleep a prominent answer. It often is checked throughout the game with offensive pressure on more faster pace teams and multiple walls on slower teams.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Celebi, Cresselia, Uxie, and Latias are the most prominent Breloom answers in the tier. They can all absorb its attacks in the short term and KO back with Psychic or Ice Beam. However, while Celebi has Natural Cure, another Pokemon is needed to absorb the Spore, or Breloom will switch to a powerful teammate or generate momentum off of a sleeping Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Zapdos, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Dragonite are all effective ways to scout out Breloom’s set. Of these, Zapdos is the best due to commonly outspeeding it and taking little from its attacks besides a boosted Facade. Gliscor and Skarmory can OHKO with Flying-type attacks, while Dragonite easily OHKOs with its powerful attacks and can even absorb Spore with Choice Band and Sleep Talk. However, Gliscor and Skarmory both become vulnerable to Breloom’s coverage upon using Roost, while Zapdos and Dragonite do not enjoy Stealth Rock and Breloom’s strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nidoqueen, Gengar, Roserade, and Crobat all can absorb Breloom’s attacks and hit hard in return. Roserade even can run a physically bulky set with Sleep Talk to set up Spikes while asleep and hit Breloom hard, while it commonly uses Poison Point over Natural Cure to absorb Spore. However, the others are all neutralized by Spore, while Nidoqueen and Gengar will eventually fall to repeated Seed Bomb. Crobat doesn’t enjoy Facade and struggles with longevity due to its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk</strong>: Latias, Dragonite, Zapdos, Yanmega, and Heracross can switch into Spore effectively while still functioning or threaten Breloom with strong attacks. However, care should be taken to only switch them in on Spore, as Breloom with Protect and especially Substitute can take advantage of the switch and generate momentum.</p> <p><strong>Powerful attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Heatran, and Infernape, while they can’t always switch in, will easily outspeed and OHKO Breloom if they can get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Slower versions of Breloom can be checked by having its normal entry points on offensive teams—Tyranitar, Swampert, and generally slower Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp—either carry a Lum Berry to absorb Spore or run a lot of speed and hit Breloom hard. An example of this is max Speed Swampert OHKOing Breloom with Ice Beam, Zen Headbutt or Explosion + Lum Berry Metagross, and even opposing Breloom switching into Spore and hitting hard back with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Physically bulky Pokemon</strong>: While Jirachi, Skarmory, and Rotom-A do not enjoy repeated attacks from Breloom, they avoid being 2HKOed and heal off the attack while threatening Breloom out. Rotom-A can even take Spore while still functioning, even KOing Breloom should it have Shadow Ball over Thunderbolt.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Breloom’s Spore is one of its strongest qualities, immediately disabling an opposing Pokemon by putting them to sleep. Superpower is Breloom’s strongest attack bar Focus Punch and heavily threats much of the tier, OHKOing many prominent Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, Heatran, and Magnezone while hitting neutral threats such as Scizor, Bronzong, Metagross, and Machamp very hard. Focus Punch can be used after Spore or on a predicted switch, even 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory. It also does not lower Breloom's stats like Superpower does. Seed Bomb pairs well with both Superpower and Focus Punch, as many prominent walls are Grass-weak such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune. Others are immune or resist Fighting but not Grass such as Nidoqueen, Rotom-A, Uxie, Gliscor, and Gyarados. Seed Bomb is also strong enough to damage Gengar despite resisting it.</p> <p>Mach Punch provides a failsafe against Tyranitar, Agility Empoleon, and forces Lucario to use Extreme Speed rather than Close Combat. Mach Punch can OHKO bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and easily 2HKOs bulkless Empoleon and Lucario. As another option, Protect emphasizes Breloom's survivability, as Breloom will always heal even in sand due to Poison Heal. For teams lacking good Breloom checks, a common way to deal with Breloom is to switch in a Sleep Talk user such as Choice Specs Latias or Choice Band Dragonite. As Sleep Talk can only be selected once while choice locked, Protect forces these Pokemon out. Should it be paired with Magnezone, Breloom can take advantage of Skarmory's removal and run Toxic to cripple secondary checks such as defensive Latias, defensive Zapdos and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Due to Breloom not needing much Attack to pose a threat, there are many possible EV spreads. This specific EV spread gives Breloom near maximum Attack while also outspeeding neutral nature Tyranitar and Swampert with the rest of the EVs in HP to hit a Poison Heal number. With almost maximum Attack EVs, Breloom can be as threatening as possible while still having a touch of survivability against survive prominent attacks such as utility Tyranitar’s Fire Blast, Swampert Ice Beam, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and defensive Latias’s Ice Beam. Other possibilities include maximizing Speed using an EV spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. This allows Breloom to reach a Poison Heal number and outspeed Adamant Gyarados. Jolly variants are particularly difficult to deal with for defensive teams, as Breloom’s can outspeed slower versions of Jirachi and Zapdos and use Spore before they can respond. Breloom without investment is very frail, however. Should Speed not be important, Breloom can also just run a simple spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def, but beware of offensive pressure from faster variants of Swampert and Tyranitar.</p> <p>As Breloom's defensive stats are quite low, sparing some EVs in either of its defenses improves its survivability greatly. Breloom can run more physical bulk, such as an EV spread of 248 HP / 116 Atk / 144 Def that survives +1 Tyranitar’s Ice Punch and Gyarados’s +1 Ice Fang after sand damage. With special bulk, such as 108 HP / 176 Atk / 40 SpD / 184 Spe, Breloom can survive max Special Attack Swampert's Ice Beam without entry hazards and defensive Latias's Ice Beam after one layer of Spikes. Breloom can also use additional Speed, such as around 60 EVs to outspeed minimum speed Heatran, 136 to outspeed Machamp and minimum speed Rotom-A and Suicune, and 176 with a Jolly nature to outspeed Tyranitar. Generally, sets with Mach Punch run more attack to maximize damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Breloom often switches in early into prominent Pokemon such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Clefable to exert pressure. However, these switches could be dangerous: Breloom can be OHKOed by super-effective coverage and is effectively useless should it take Knock Off or Thunder Wave. Once Breloom has activated Toxic Orb, it can freely switch into many status and Knock Off users such as RestTalk Rotom-A and Clefable. Delaying the timing of Breloom’s Spore can often net a more valuable target; opponents will often switch to a sleep absorber or leave their Swampert for example in to absorb the Spore. Delaying additionally avoids using Spore on a Lum Berry target such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Should Breloom have Focus Punch over Superpower, predicting bulky neutral threats switching in after something absorbs Spore such as Skarmory and Jirachi can maximize damage. Breloom can even stay in on Skarmory as it uses Roost and OHKO it with Focus Punch. Should Breloom have Protect, beware of being too predictable to give opponents free switches due to the amount of offensive pressure Breloom typically exerts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Breloom has many viable partners as a stable of DPP OU. One of the best partners for Breloom is Pursuit Tyranitar, as some of the most prominent Breloom checks such as Latias, Rotom-A, and Gengar, are Dark-weak and can be Pursuit trapped. Tyranitar is also helpful in other ways; Dragon Dance Tyranitar appreciates Breloom’s Spore to help break through bulky checks such as Skarmory, Jirachi, and Nidoqueen. Choice Band Tyranitar can break through Breloom checks with its powerful attacks, while Breloom can absorb Clefable’s Knock Off once the Toxic Orb is activated. Other prominent Breloom partners include Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Latias, as Mach Punch allows Breloom to check the one boosted threat they cannot handle well: Dragon Dance Tyranitar. As Breloom takes advantage of both Clefable and Tyranitar, it is a great partner to many strong special attackers, such as Heatran, Empoleon, Latias, Zapdos, and Suicune. Heatran is uniquely valuable, as it can potentially trap and KO Latias with Magma Storm and either Dragon Pulse or Explosion while OHKOing Skarmory and Jirachi. Breloom also pressure defensive Water- and Ground-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Suicune, potentially helping offensive Steel-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, Scizor, and Metagross.</p> <p>Breloom also benefits from Magnezone support, as it removes a prominent check in Skarmory, allowing to use Spore on something else. Breloom also heavily pressures Shed Shell Skarmory, as Skarmory can no longer passively heal after it takes a Focus Punch or Superpower. Both defensive and offensive partners with Magnezone work well, as Starmie, Clefable, and physically defensive Zapdos appreciate Breloom's power and ability to check Swampert and Tyranitar while more aggressive partners such as offensive Trick Room Bronzong, Gengar, and Metagross enjoy Breloom's ability to break open defensive teams should Skarmory be trapped. Starmie greatly improves Breloom's survivability by spinning away Spikes, while Breloom takes advantage of Pursuit Tyranitar trying to remove Starmie. Breloom’s ability to absorb Spore from opposing Breloom and its relatively slow speed allow it to fit well with Trick Room Bronzong, as the teams it is featured on typically struggle with opposing Breloom. In a similar vein to Magnezone, Trick + Iron Ball Metagross opens up Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos by slowing them down and removing their Leftovers.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defensive Breloom takes a much different approach and focuses on shoring the team against status and Knock Off while being a strong answer to Tyranitar and Clefable. The primary weapon of defensive Breloom is Leech Seed, damaging all non Grass-types and Clefable while maximizing Breloom’s longevity. Force Palm OHKOs bulkless Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and 2HKOs Clefable. However, the primary advantage of Force Palm is its paralysis chance. Breloom's Force Palm is a fantastic way to paralyze Latias, Gliscor, and Jirachi, targets that are typically difficult to paralyze and lose a lot of efficacy once statused. Superpower provides Breloom with a much stronger option; Force Palm fails to 2HKO Bold Clefable and has to rely on paralysis to stop Chople Berry Dragon Dance Tyranitar. A more midground option that doesn't drop Breloom's stats is Sky Uppercut; however, beware of its imperfect accuracy. Breloom can also forgo a Fighting-type option to use Facade, as it nets a strong neutral hit on much of the tier.</p> <p>Protect synergizes well with Leech Seed: scouting the opponent, gaining additional recovery easily, and racking up Leech Seed damage. The most prominent last option is Spore, as it instantly neutralizes a threat. It also works well with Leech Seed to gain additional health. However, Seed Bomb is also an excellent option, as it allows Breloom to hit Ghost-types and remain threatening against Swampert and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This Breloom generally can go in two directions: physically or specially bulky. Physical bulk is preferred, as Breloom is often one of the primary checks for opposing Breloom, Tyranitar, and Swampert and needs a lot of physical bulk to withstand their attacks continuously. Physical bulk also helps Breloom check Hippowdon, Gliscor without a Flying-type attack, and Gyarados. Breloom can run some Speed investment, such as around 60 EVs, to outspeed minimum speed Heatran while also outspeeding slower versions of Skarmory, Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross. Due to Breloom’s very low Special Defense stat, some of this Speed investment can be put into Special Defense to help against defensive Latias's Ice Beam, utility Tyranitar’s Fire Blast, and Swampert’s Ice Beam.</p> <p>Another route to go is to invest in Breloom’s Special Defense with a Careful nature and full bulk investment with a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD. Specially defensive Breloom is a fantastic answer to Calm Mind Clefable while also takes special coverage much better. Specially defensive Breloom can survive many super-effective special attacks such as +1 Suicune Ice Beam, defensive Zapdos’s Heat Wave, Jirachi’s Psychic, Choice Scarf Rotom-A’s Shadow Ball, and defensive Heatran’s Lava Plume. Breloom loses the ability to switch into opposing Breloom’s Spore while surviving Superpower and is commonly OHKOed by +1 Tyranitar’s Fire Punch by going down this path, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Breloom generally wants to activate its Toxic Orb as soon as possible, as it is useless without Poison Heal. Switch into opposing Breloom’s Spore sparingly, as opposing Breloom’s Fighting-type coverage 2HKOs on even physically bulky Breloom. This Breloom is particularly annoying for offensive teams to deal with, as it commonly stalls out any momentum from choiced attackers such as Latias, Rotom-A, Swampert, Tyranitar, and Gyarados while chipping them with Leech Seed. As such, take advantage of Breloom’s bulk and recovery throughout the game to choke out the opponent. Breloom often can recover from very low health quite easily with Leech Seed, Protect, and Poison Heal, allowing it to tank strong hits and eventually come out healthy.</p> <p>Keep Breloom away from entry hazard setters, Spikes, and Substitute users, as its offensive options are weak and easy to set up on. Once Breloom uses Spore, it should be trying to use Force Palm to spread paralysis on its checks as much as it can, as for example, Gliscor cannot use Taunt before Breloom uses Leech Seed, Latias cannot use Reflect on a potential Tyranitar switch, and Jirachi cannot use Iron Head to flinch Breloom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Breloom generally belongs on stall teams that can afford its lack of offensive pressure, absorb the strong hits it can’t take, and benefit from its ability to neutralize Clefable. However, because Breloom is setup fodder for Skarmory and forced out by mixed Flygon, defensive partners need to account for offensive Spikes teams well. Tyranitar is particularly effective, as choiced sets can take advantage of a paralyzed Latias, while defensive sets easily stomach the strong special attackers that eliminate Breloom, like offensive Heatran and Latias. However, sand can sometimes be detrimental to Breloom’s constant passive recovery. Specially defensive walls with Knock Off, such as Clefable and Empoleon, are especially effective to help wear down opponents with Leech Seed. Breloom also saves Clefable from having to trade Knock Off with opposing Clefable. Anti Spikes measures are extremely important with Breloom due to the ubiquity of Skarmory. Breloom fits quite well with Magnezone to trap Skarmory and Forretress, while Shed Shell Skarmory doesn’t enjoy repeated residual damage and paralysis this set inflicts. Other choices that fit alongside Magnezone, such as Latias, defensive Wish + Protect Jirachi, Toxic + Protect Metagross, and Swampert are helpful. Hippowdon can also be effective, but like Tyranitar, sand can sometimes be detrimental. Choice Scarf Magneton can also be effective to help against the hyper offensive teams that can take advantage of defensive Breloom, as it outspeeds and revenge kills Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. Breloom fits quite well on bulkier paralysis spamming teams due to spreading paralysis to Latias and Gliscor effectively. Potential partners include Starmie, physically defensive Zapdos, Jirachi, and Rhyperior. Starmie is especially helpful to Rapid Spin the hazards that the opponent sets up on Breloom. In return, Breloom counters Tyranitar and Clefable, two common Stealth Rock users and checks to Zapdos, and helps Jirachi out against Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>Breloom fits well alongside bulky special sweepers that are vulnerable to Encore Clefable, such as Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune, Calm Mind Latias, and Calm Mind + Wish or Substitute Jirachi, as it can take the Knock Off once Toxic Orb activates and 2HKO Clefable. Breloom enjoys easy entry for its Toxic Orb activation, meaning Uxie, RestTalk Rotom-A, and Latias are good partners to bait in Tyranitar. Uxie can even use U-turn to bring in Breloom easily. These Pokemon also ease Breloom’s commitment to absorbing opposing Breloom’s Spore by surviving strong Fighting-type coverage and forcing opposing Breloom out.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Breloom is one of the best options to immediately get momentum as a lead on hyper offensive teams, as any foe without a Lum Berry or a faster Taunt is put to sleep. Spore is an excellent tool to prevent Stealth Rock and simplify game plans, as the pace of the team makes it difficult for the opposing Pokemon to wake up. The choice between Superpower and Focus Punch is item dependent—with a Choice Scarf, Breloom has to use Superpower because it can function as a revenge killer. However, with a Focus Sash, Breloom can leverage the more common Choice Scarf set to Focus Punch foes trying to wake up or switch. Seed Bomb threatens Grass-weak leads such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Starmie as well as provides a reliable attack should it use Focus Punch. Stone Edge rounds out Breloom's coverage against Flying-types, hitting Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite hard. However, since it doesn't OHKO them, Stun Spore is another option, especially with Focus Sash, to spread paralysis on Breloom checks such as Latias, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>To outspeed common leads, Breloom needs to be as fast as possible. Since Breloom can't use a Toxic Orb, Effect Spore provides an additional chance to status contact attacks, such as Flygon and Uxie using U-turn to scout Breloom.</p> <p>The choice between Choice Scarf and Focus Sash depends on how weak to Stealth Rock the rest of the team is. Breloom has a Speed stat of 393 with a Choice Scarf, enough to outspeed common fast Stealth Rock leads such as Azelf and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, putting them to sleep (should Azelf lack a Lum Berry) before they can set up Stealth Rock. It also helps against powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Latias, Heatran, and Dragonite. Breloom can also act as speed control for typically frail hyper offense teams, letting it revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar and neutral speed nature Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. On teams not as weak to Stealth Rock or have other revenge killers, Focus Sash allows Breloom to survive one hit and get off a Spore or powerful attack. Having a Focus Sash also prevents Breloom from being forced out immediately once it uses Spore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Breloom should lead and almost always use Spore, as it has no bulk and aims to immediately get momentum. Exceptions tend to be if the opposing lead common carries a Lum Berry, such as Metagross and Gyarados; is faster than Breloom and will Taunt, such as Aerodactyl; or could be KOed by an attack and are thus likely to try to absorb Spore, such as Tyranitar and Swampert. Once Breloom uses Spore, Choice Scarf leads are forced out and can be used later as fodder or to revenge kill. Focus Sash leads instead try to do as much damage as possible before Breloom faints—Breloom fainting gives a free switch to another threat. As such, try to leverage the fact that Choice Scarf Breloom is forced out after using Spore on something slow to Focus Punch possible switches or foes trying to wake up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Breloom is a staple of aggressive hyper offense teams. With Choice Scarf, Breloom should be used with threats that do not like Stealth Rock, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. Mixed Dragonite is especially threatening with Breloom, as it enjoys coming in for free without Stealth Rock up and immediately threatens common Breloom answers. As using lead Breloom means forgoing early Stealth Rock, common synergistic users such as Heatran, Metagross, and Camerupt are good partners. Other hyper offense mainstays such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Empoleon, and Swords Dance Lucario are other strong partners with Breloom. Swords Dance Scizor with Pursuit is an especially strong partner, as it helps to defeat Latias trying to come in after Breloom uses Spore. Scizor can even use an Occa Berry to better protect against Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>With Focus Sash, Breloom's partners do not have to be as aggressive, since Breloom can't prevent Stealth Rock from faster leads such as Azelf or Aerodactyl. However, it can immediately weaken prominent Breloom checks such as Skarmory, especially if the opponent tries to switch it in after Breloom uses Spore expecting the Choice Scarf set. With Stun Spore, Breloom can unexpectedly paralyze Latias, Gliscor, and Zapdos, helping Jirachi, Mamoswine, and Machamp break through them. Breloom also appreciates other forms of speed control, such as Choice Scarf Latias, as it's setup fodder for Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite if they can mitigate status.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Breloom can become a full-blown sweeper with Swords Dance. Even walls that resist one or both of Seed Bomb and Superpower such as Nidoqueen, Latias, and Skarmory can be 2HKOed easily after a Swords Dance boost. Milotic and Hippowdon, prominent answers to physical sweepers, are both OHKOed by Seed Bomb after one Swords Dance, while Superpower OHKOs all non-physically bulky Jirachi.</p> <p>Facade rounds out the coverage, as it hits Zapdos, Latias, and Dragonite hard. Due to Toxic Orb, Facade will always be at 140 base power, doing more damage than Seed Bomb against neutral targets. It may seem odd to use Breloom without Spore, but the additional coverage is often worth it, especially since Latias outspeeds and walls Breloom even while asleep. Other options include Spore, which neutralizes a threat and eases set-up. Mach Punch helps to alleviate Breloom’s low speed against faster Pokemon weak to Fighting, such as Heatran and Lucario. Breloom can also be a bulky win condition with Protect in the last slot as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread given maximizes Breloom’s sweeping abilities while also hitting a Poison Heal number—both Jolly and Adamant natures work here. Many other EV spreads works too; the most prominent of these is run max HP and hit another Speed benchmark, such as around 60 EVs for minimum Speed Heatran, 136 for Machamp, minimum Speed Rotom-A, and minimum Speed Suicune, and 184 EVs for max speed neutral Tyranitar and Swampert while putting the rest in attack and HP. This route gives Breloom some more breathing room to set up. An additional route is to run further bulk by making Breloom Impish—this allows Breloom to fulfill its defensive obligations against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and opposing Breloom once the Toxic Orb has activated while still being a threat with Swords Dance. An example EV spread is 248 HP / 4 Atk / 120 Def / 136 Spe that survives Dragon Dance Tyranitar’s +1 Ice Punch, Dragon Dance Gyarados’s +1 Ice Fang while still outspeeding the Machamp, Rotom-A, and Suicune benchmark. As an Impish non-Attack invested +0 Superpower can leave standard Clefable and Chople Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar alive, another option is to run less Speed and use 248 HP / 76 Atk / 184 Def with an Adamant nature, as this still survives the bulk thresholds while strengthening Breloom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Breloom, especially if it drops Spore and has no defensive investment, must be more careful when it comes in. Breloom appreciates its checks such as Latias to be either KOed or paralyzed before it uses Swords Dance. Against more defensive teams, due to Breloom’s longevity, it can come in more often, activate its Toxic Orb, and threaten Clefable and Tyranitar. As most opponents will expect Spore, leverage likely Sleep sacrifices to get a free Swords Dance or to switch to an appropriate counter. On more defensive teams, Breloom’s role changes as a wall that can sweep, so trading lots of Breloom’s health for eliminating +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar is valuable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Breloom is most commonly featured on teams with extensive paralysis support, as paralyzing walls such as Latias and Skarmory can open up opponents to a Breloom sweep. In return, Breloom provides these teams with a strong answer to Ground-types such as Swampert and Hippowdon that are immune to Thunder Wave and can be difficult to deal with, Knock Off Clefable, and Tyranitar. Common teammates for this style include Blissey, Bold Clefable, defensive Zapdos, Jirachi, and Starmie. These Pokemon, all help Breloom with its flaws: Starmie can make up for Breloom’s weakness to Spikes, while Blissey, Zapdos, Clefable, and Jirachi help take strong attackers such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, and Lucario that Breloom struggles with. Breloom also appreciates additional support for breaking down walls—the most prominent choice is Machamp, as it also takes advantage of paralysis support. Other Pokemon that take advantage of paralysis, such as Togekiss and Rhyperior, can also be supported by Breloom. More offensive paralysis teams can also support Breloom, such as with Azelf, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Dragon Dance + Thunder Wave Gyarados. Tyranitar is particularly helpful, as it can Pursuit trap Dark-weak Breloom answers and can even spread paralysis on difficult to paralyze threats like Latias.</p> <p>An additional route to using Swords Dance Breloom is with Magnezone support, as it traps Skarmory and other bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Scizor that can interfere with sweeping. Common partners in this style include Tyranitar, Jirachi, Skarmory, Clefable, and defensive Latias. Other ways to open up walls, including Trick + Iron Ball or Choice Scarf Metagross and mixed threats such as Jirachi and Flygon are generally helpful.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The threat of Spore and powerful attacks is generally enough to get Breloom a Substitute on something it forces out. Substitute provides Breloom with a number of advantages. The first is that Breloom can more easily choose what to use Spore on, as sleep sacrifices only give Breloom momentum to attack rather than waste Spore. Additionally, Substitute counters switching in a choiced Sleep Talk user to absorb Spore, as they must break the Substitute before locking into Sleep Talk. Second, the Substitute allows Breloom to use the more powerful Focus Punch without worrying about being hit; with investment, it can even 2HKO resists like bulkless Latias. Third, the Substitute helps prevent revenge killing on the typically slow Breloom. With defensive investment, Substitute can survive weaker attacks, such as Choice Scarf Flygon’s U-turn, opposing Breloom’s Seed Bomb, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar’s Crunch. As such, this Breloom is one of the best punishers of teams lacking multiple good Breloom checks.</p> <p>Seed Bomb rounds out Breloom’s coverage, giving Breloom a no drawbacks attack while also threatening Pokemon that resist Fighting. Another option, however, is to run Leech Seed, as Breloom has the unique advantage of Poison Heal over other SubSeed users, meaning it can potentially heal more HP than a Substitute requires. This will leave Breloom without a no drawbacks offensive move, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread given allows Breloom’s Substitute to survive Choice Scarf Flygon’s U-turn. This counters a common way to get around Substitute: continually using U-turn into a threat that survives the Focus Punch. It also survives Dragon Dance Tyranitar's +1 Fire Punch after Stealth Rock and sand damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to power up Seed Bomb and Focus Punch. Breloom can also put some of the Attack investment into Speed to keep up a Substitute on foes such as Skarmory, Metagross, and defensive Heatran. However, Breloom can also go fully offensive and run 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Speed with a Jolly or Adamant nature. For SubSeed sets, the Jolly max Speed spread is particularly threatening to slower teams, as Breloom will continually be able to set up a Substitute + Poison Heal while throwing out strong Focus Punch. Breloom can also maximize its defensive bulk with a SubSeed set, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Breloom’s Focus Punch has to be predicted, Breloom typically should be brought in more carefully on something it threatens, such as Swampert, slower Tyranitar, Blissey, and Clefable and then Substitute on the switch out. This puts the opponent in a difficult situation of dealing with a Breloom behind a Substitute that still can put something to sleep. Beware of opponents that deal with Breloom with offensive pressure, as fast Swampert hitting Breloom with Ice Beam or Tyranitar using Fire Blast is one of the best ways to prevent Breloom from getting that Substitute. Once Breloom has a Substitute, Breloom can use Focus Punch and Leech Seed with impunity, as it can just attack sleep sacrifices without using Spore or set up repeated Leech Seed on slower targets. Once Breloom has used Spore and is forced out, coming in on Fighting-weak targets such as Clefable and Tyranitar again is more difficult, as they will continue to attack Breloom instead of switch out. Should Breloom be Jolly, using Spore is more forgiving on a threat such as defensive Jirachi, as Breloom can continuously sleep and set up a Substitute without being punished.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, Substitute Breloom has similar partners to the offensive set; however Breloom doesn't have as much utility due to being forced to use a Fighting-type attack with drawbacks. As such, it enjoys being used alongside other checks to Tyranitar, such as Metagross and Jirachi. Trick Metagross can lure in and give prominent Breloom checks like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos an Iron Ball or Choice Scarf to allow Breloom to more easily defeat them. Pursuit Tyranitar is again an excellent partner, as it can Pursuit prominent Sleep absorbers such as Rotom-A and Latias to allow Breloom to use Spore again. Breloom’s strong Focus Punch and Spore combination often soften up opposing teams for fast sweepers such as Calm Mind Jirachi and Dragon Dance Tyranitar to take advantage of. Many Pokemon enjoy Breloom’s ability to bust up defensive core involving Clefable, such as Heatran, Latias, Calm Mind Jirachi, Suicune, and Empoleon. A particularly potent pairing is Will-o-Wisp Heatran + Choice Specs Latias, as opponents will be less likely to switch in Clefable knowing Breloom can easily take advantage of it. This can force burn on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, opening up Choice Specs Latias. Breloom also appreciates entry hazard users, as some of its more prominent sleep absorbers are weak to Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Skarmory are useful. Skarmory also sets up Spikes, which can be helpful due to other prominent Breloom checks such as Celebi, Nidoqueen, and Jirachi giving free set up. With Spikes, SubSeed Breloom especially becomes very difficult to deal with.</p>"

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>With the full ban on Baton Pass, Ninjask is a shell of what it was. Its incredibly crippling Stealth Rock weakness combined with low power and bad STAB moves make it an overall terrible choice. While it still has access to Speed Boost and Swords Dance, it is already the fastest Pokemon in the metagame even without increased speed, making this ability not useful enough to justify its presence on a team. One may think that its Bug / Flying typing may give it some niche, but Yanmega is a far superior option due to its much better defensive stats and its stronger power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance + Power Herb": {
        "description": "<p>This set is awful, but it may very well be the best option for Ninjask. Swords Dance boosts its weak Attack to a moderately acceptable level. X-Scissor is its best STAB move available. Night Slash hits Ghost-types like Gengar and, more importantly, Rotom-A for decent damage. Dig is a surprise move to catch grounded Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, and, most notably, Heatran. After a Swords Dance, Dig should do significant damage to non-bulky Jirachi while OHKOing Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment are both absolutely mandatory to mitigate Ninjask's poor power as much as possible. The Speed investment allows Ninjask to outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Outspeeding Weavile is unnecessary, as Ninjask gets maimed by Ice Shard regardless. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to give Ninjask a greater chance of actually surviving an attacking move from any other OU Pokemon. 4 EVs are taken out of HP so it can survive Stealth Rock twice.</p> <p>Save Ninjask as a late-game cleaner in hopes that you can actually get a KO with it. It can safely set up Swords Dance versus a Pokemon Choice locked into a Ground- or Fighting-type move, but otherwise it probably won't get a chance to do much.</p> <p>If you must use Ninjask, Magnezone is a mandatory partner to trap pesky Steel-types like Skarmory and Bronzong that may get in the way of a Ninjask sweep. Starmie is also mandatory to provide Rapid Spin support so that Ninjask doesn't enter the field at 50% health.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama is a victim of circumstances, and rightfully so. It's a tough world for Hariyama in OU when there is Machamp lurking about with STAB No Guard Dynamic Punch at its disposal. Hariyama may seem outclassed in every possible way, but there are a few useful niches that Hariyama can claim and therefore edge out his four-armed rival in some way. Most of these niches stem from useful movepool options such as Fake Out, which can give Hariyama the free turn necessary to activate a status Orb and break Focus Sashes. Generally speaking, in OU you will want to use Machamp, but you may occasionally find Hariyama's features more useful for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Punch is a more reliable option to take out Gyarados, but if you want to deal with Gyarados, Stone Edge is usually the superior option, thanks to its ability to hit other Flying-types for more damage. Facade is a powerful attack that hits most Pokemon for neutral damage, but Close Combat and Payback cover everything else and provide more useful coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gyarados is the best counter to Hariyama sets that lack Stone Edge or Thunder Punch. It can easily come in, Intimidate Hariyama, and proceed to Dragon Dance. Skarmory is faster and can nail Hariyama with Brave Bird, though be wary of using Roost as Close Combat will be super effective against Skarmory on that turn. Once Hariyama is weakened, a strong Psychic-type attack such as Psychic from Azelf can easily dispatch Hariyama, especially after any defense drops from Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hariyama is a Pokemon with lots of attacking power and bulk; its movepool is wide enough to cover the majority of common leads, while its superb HP allows it to emerge victorious from the exchange. Thanks to Fake Out, Hariyama can break the opposing lead's Focus Sash while activating Guts and blocking status from leads like Smeargle and Roserade. Hariyama can then proceed to use one of its other three powerful moves to defeat the opponent.</p> <p>Close Combat is your main STAB attack, dealing heavy blows to almost every lead. Low Kick is a good alternative, allowing Hariyama to hit most leads for the same amount of damage without the side-effect of lowering its defenses, although the drop in power is noticeable against leads such as Swampert and Machamp. Payback allows you to hit Azelf and Uxie super effectively while Ice Punch rounds out the coverage, annihilating leads such as Gliscor and Dragonite. Stone Edge is an alternative, allowing Hariyama to knock Flying-types out of the sky later in the game, but the ability to OHKO Gliscor with a Guts-boosted Ice Punch is usually too good to give up. However, Stone Edge allows it to take on Gyarados, one of Hariyama's biggest counters, later in the game, dealing 55% - 65.3% after Intimidate (assuming Guts has been activated).</p> <p>The main reason to use Hariyama over Machamp is because of its natural bulk. Hariyama has much more HP than Machamp, allowing Hariyama to invest EVs in its defenses and Speed, one thing Machamp misses out on. Hariyama has access to Fake Out, something that Machamp does not have, which allows Hariyama to break the opposing lead's Focus Sash before the pummeling begins, which is definitely a big bonus. Machamp, on the other hand, must bring the opponent's lead down to its Focus Sash before it can Bullet Punch, leaving it vulnerable to a counter switching in. With Hariyama as a lead, you can now utilize Machamp late game; Substitute Machamp makes a great partner to Hariyama. Machamp is usually checked by faster or bulky Pokemon such as Azelf, Heatran, and Gliscor; Hariyama can take them out at the start of the battle, thereby easing Machamp's sweep.</p> <p>The item Hariyama holds is up to the user's preference. Flame Orb should be used if Hariyama is planning to stay on the field for a while, otherwise Toxic Orb is the item of choice. The EVs are chosen so that Hariyama hits as hard as possible and takes special attacks superbly. 92 EVs are invested into Speed so that Hariyama can outpace minimum Speed Tyranitar, although more can be invested to adjust for Speed creep on Tyranitar's part.</p> <p>Metagross and Infernape are troublesome leads. Metagross has enough bulk to survive a Fake Out followed by a Close Combat, therefore Close Combat should not be so hastily used, as after the Defense drop Hariyama has a good chance of getting OHKOed by Meteor Mash. The best course of action against Metagross would be to Payback first, followed by a Close Combat to take it out. It should be noted however, that Metagross can beat Hariyama if it chooses to attack outright instead of setting up Stealth Rock. The same strategy applies to Infernape. Due to Infernape's faster Fake Out, Hariyama cannot break Infernape's Focus Sash; Hariyama must resort to using Payback on the second turn to break Infernape's Focus Sash, and then finish it off with Close Combat.</p> <p>Starmie is a great partner to Hariyama as it checks Infernape and Metagross well. It can switch in on Infernape's Fake Out, Hydro Pump Infernape down its Focus Sash as Infernape sets up Stealth Rock, and then proceed to outspeed and kill Infernape with Rapid Spin while clearing the rocks. Starmie can also switch into Metagross as it uses Stealth Rock, then Hydro Pump for a 2HKO while Metagross fails to knock out Starmie with Earthquake. Starmie can then perform its spinner duties regardless.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>In the past, Aggron had largely been ignored in favor of the bulkier yet more powerful Rhyperior. The addition of Head Smash to Aggron's movepool, though, allows him to pose a real offensive threat; Aggron has so much raw power that many teams will be forced to sacrifice a Pokemon to deal with him. However, Aggron is plagued with several common weaknesses, and his low Speed means that he will often have to switch out of common threats. Nevertheless, with his many resistances and his sheer power, Aggron can easily punch holes in the opposing team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aggron can run a defensive set if given sandstorm support, as his many resistances let him set up Stealth Rock and tank hits. However, his three weaknesses are extremely commonly seen, and his low HP lets him down defensively. Metal Burst is viable as Aggron has the defenses to be able to survive a hit, but outright attacking is usually more reliable and lets Aggron live for a longer period of time. Iron Tail is an option for secondary STAB, but the accuracy is a letdown. Thunder Wave can be helpful for team support, but Aggron can usually KO opponents with Head Smash, and the Ground-type Pokemon that resist Head Smash are also immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground- and Steel-types, Hippowdon, Swampert, Metagross, and Bronzong in particular, can take a Head Smash and retaliate with Earthquake, while bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon can take a hit and KO with Surf. However, few other Pokemon can switch into repeated Choice Band Head Smash. Gliscor, Flygon, Gengar, and Starmie all don't like taking Head Smash, but they can all outspeed Aggron and KO him with their super effective moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With the power of Head Smash further boosted by a Choice Band, Aggron is capable of literally smashing through the opposing team. To put this in perspective, Choice Band Aggron's Head Smash is 9% stronger than Choice Band Groudon's Earthquake. The remaining three moves provide coverage on the Pokemon that resist Aggron's Rock-type STAB: Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi, Aqua Tail destroys Ground-types such as Hippowdon, and Ice Punch takes out Flygon and Breloom, both of whom can take one Head Smash and retaliate.</p> <p>To show the sheer power of Head Smash, here are some calculations against Pokemon that either resist Head Smash or are extremely defensive. These calculations all assume a Jolly nature.</p> <ul> <li>Head Smash vs. 12/0 Breloom 74.2% - 87.5%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 0/0 Jirachi 47.8% - 56.3%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/220+ Celebi 59.7% - 70.5%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/4 Gliscor 75.7% - 89.3%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Suicune 52.7% - 62.4%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/176+ Skarmory 58.1% - 68.9%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/0 Metagross 35.7% - 42%</li> </ul> <p>The listed EVs provide Aggron with maximum power while still letting him outspeed Pokemon such as uninvested Rotom-A, Suicune, Cresselia, and Gyarados; slower stall teams will therefore have even more problems taking out Aggron. If you want more power, feel free to use an Adamant nature along with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Skarmory. 164 Speed EVs let Aggron outrun uninvested Skarmory, but bear in mind that some do invest in Speed. Additionally, Toxic can be used over Ice Punch to cripple Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Swampert on the switch.</p> <p>Due to Aggron's three common weaknesses in Ground, Fighting, and Water, teammates who resist these moves are appreciated. Celebi is a great partner for Aggron because it resists all three of the aforementioned types; it can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, which compensates for Aggron's low Speed. Gengar is a good partner as well, as he is immune to Ground- and Fighting-type moves and can lure in Blissey, whom Aggron can easily switch in on. Additionally, Aggron resists Ghost and Dark, which the aforementioned Pokemon are weak to. Sandstorm support is appreciated as it boosts Aggron's Special Defense; Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock and tank Flygon's Earthquake, while Tyranitar can use a Choice Band set to help wear down the opposing team, or use Flamethrower and Ice Beam to take care of Breloom and Flygon. As Aggron will be switching in and out a lot, Rapid Spin support is helpful; Starmie is a great choice because it not only resists Water and Fighting, but can break down physical walls with its STAB Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Aggron has trouble with defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross. Celebi can handle all three with Grass Knot, Leaf Storm, and Earth Power, respectively. After Aggron KOes a foe, he can easily be revenge killed by faster Pokemon. Flygon can be handled with Gengar, who is immune to Earthquake, and by Hippowdon, who can tank any hit that Flygon throws at him. Hippowdon can also tank Bronzong and Metagross's hits as well as provide sandstorm to boost Aggron's Special Defense. Specially defensive Zapdos can take care of Starmie, Heatran, and Shaymin by tanking their hits and threatening them with its powerful attacks; furthermore, Zapdos has good synergy with Aggron.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Aggron can run a Rock Polish set in order to make up for his mediocre speed. Unlike Rhyperior, +2 Aggron can outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran and OHKO it with Earthquake. Head Smash still does obscene amounts of damage even with only a Life Orb boost, while Earthquake hits the Steel-type Pokemon that threaten Aggron with super effective hits. Ice Punch KOes Gliscor and Breloom, and also takes down Choice Scarf Flygon should Aggron get more than one Rock Polish boost. Aqua Tail dents Hippowdon and can 2HKO him if he's below 75% health.</p> <p>Aggron can run an Adamant nature for more power, but he will fail to outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran and positive-natured base 130s after a Rock Polish boost. As these are Aggron's greatest advantages over Rhyperior, running an Adamant nature is therefore not recommended.</p> <p>As this Aggron is a setup sweeper, sandstorm support is more of a necessity to help him take a hit when he has to. Hippowdon is a good partner because he can take Choice Scarf Flygon's Earthquakes and KO with Ice Fang, while Tyranitar can lure in and KO Flygon with Ice Beam. Due to Aggron's decreased damage output, entry hazard support is helpful to assist in his sweep. Roserade is a good partner because he not only resists Water and Fighting, but can also can scare away bulky Water-types with his Grass-type STAB moves while setting up Spikes in the process. Alternatively, Skarmory is immune to the Ground-type moves that plague Aggron and can Roost off any damage it takes.</p> <p>Pokemon who can cover Aggron's weaknesses, such as Gengar, make good partners; Celebi can also take out bulky Water-types that can take a Head Smash. Aggron has trouble with Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross. Roserade and Celebi can take care of the latter two; Celebi can also eliminate Metagross with Earth Power. In addition, even after a boost, Aggron is outsped by base 100 Choice Scarf users. As previously mentioned, both Hippowdon and Tyranitar have ways of beating Flygon, while Choice Scarf Gengar and Starmie can be removed by Pursuit from either Scizor or Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Camerupt is a solid utility Pokemon in the DPP OU metagame due to its unique typing and good movepool. Camerupt’s Fire / Ground typing and Solid Rock ability give it great durability despite its poor defensive stats. This durability, along with its neutrality to Stealth Rock; immunity to Electric, sand, and Will-O-Wisp; access to Explosion; and prowess against defensive Jirachi make Camerupt a great choice as a Stealth Rock user on hyper offensive teams. Unlike the other most common check to Electric-types on these builds, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Camerupt has significantly more longevity and can’t be worn down by repeated Thunderbolt. Camerupt also has underrated raw bulk—with investment, it can survive attacks such as mixed Flygon’s Earthquake and Starmie’s unboosted Surf and retaliate with Explosion.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Camerupt is a flawed Pokemon and limited to its niche, as it is extremely slow and is OHKOed by all offensive Water-types such as Gyarados, Kingdra, Swampert, Empoleon, and offensive Starmie. Being weak to Ground also means many sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Dragonite OHKO it through Solid Rock with a boosted Earthquake. Tyranitar is also a much better Pokemon; whereas Camerupt is more specialized, Tyranitar can fulfill many more potential roles from sweeping to wallbreaking in addition to checking Electric-types. Lacking sand makes match-ups against builds that use multiple offensive Water-types such as rain teams almost unwinnable, as Camerupt will get OHKOed as soon as it comes in and everything else on the team is at least 2HKOed by rain boosted attacks. Camerupt is also weak to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes and, despite its good longevity, can be worn down fairly easily by especially poison. Camerupt relies heavily on Explosion to prevent set-up and deal with faster foes who expect to OHKO it but don’t; it is quite vulnerable to baiting it to use Explosion and then switching out to something that can absorb the Explosion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Camerupt’s high offensive stats and low Speed make options such as Rock Polish or Trick Room support attractive. However, it does not have the raw coverage or power to break through walls such as Latias or Gyarados without using Explosion, which it can already do with a utility set and provide more to its team. If Jirachi is not as important to cover, Camerupt has wide variety of items it can use, such as Custap Berry, Passho Berry, Lum Berry, and Quick Claw to better pull off Explosion. Leftovers is by far the most reliable option, however. On its utility set, Camerupt’s best options involve either dropping Stealth Rock if another Pokemon can set it up or dropping Earthquake, but beware of Heatran. Roar is often the best choice, as Camerupt can very effectively spread entry hazard damage and can threaten every Rapid Spinner with coverage, a burn, or Explosion. Other options such as Yawn or Hidden Power Grass or Electric are options, but Camerupt often has better things to do.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Camerupt is outsped and OHKOed by every single offensive Water-type in the tier, such as Gyarados, Kingdra, Empoleon, Starmie, Swampert, and Suicune. Even more defensive ones such as Milotic and defensive Starmie will leave Camerupt barely alive. Rain teams are particularly dangerous, as Camerupt typically cannot even get on the field without getting KOed. All of these do not like taking Explosion or Camerupt’s coverage, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Despite Solid Rock, Camerupt is at least 2HKOed by most STAB-boosted Earthquake. Gliscor, Flygon, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Quagsire can all hit Camerupt hard. While only strong ones such as Flygon or Mamoswine can OHKO it, many other at least spook it into using Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Strong Water- and Ground-type moves, such as Choice Specs Latias’s Surf and +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar’s Earthquake, can KO Camerupt through Solid Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Camerupt cannot damage Latias, Flygon, and Dragonite well without using Explosion. Camerupt will often survive one of their unboosted attacks and use Explosion, but defensive Latias will survive while Flygon and Dragonite can potentially KO it if they hold a Choice Band.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Camerupt is extremely slow and is not that bulky even with heavy investment. Even foes it threatens such as defensive Roserade can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock with Grass Knot. Neutral attackers such as Lucario, Gengar, Machamp, and Breloom can outspeed and at least 2HKO it. Machamp and Breloom can even status it or set-up Substitute to prevent Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Camerupt is resilient to residual damage for a Fire-type, it can be easily worn down by entry hazards and especially poison. This eats away at its ability to unexpectedly survive one strong attack and forces it to use Explosion more quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Camerupt is reliable Stealth Rock user, as it can easily set it up on most foes and threatens common Rapid Spinners such as Forretress. Despite Starmie easily being able to switch in and use Rapid Spin, it cannot do so without Camerupt threatening it to OHKO it with Explosion. Camerupt is additionally an excellent user of Explosion, as it naturally threatens Steel-types and Rock-types, while Camerupt completely walls defensive Rotom-A with Thunderbolt and can 2HKO Gengar. Explosion also helps keep momentum and prevent dangerous foes such as Gyarados and Dragonite from setting up on it.</p> <p>Lava Plume is the best option against defensive Jirachi and spreads burns. Lava Plume burns help Camerupt prevent set-up without sacrificing itself, as offensive teams hate dealing with burns and Jirachi can no heal off Camerupt’s attacks if it’s burned. Earthquake rounds out Camerupt’s coverage, OHKOing Heatran, 2HKOing Tyranitar, most Steel-types, and 3HKOing Clefable. Having STAB boosted physical and special  moves helps Camerupt threaten every Steel-type in the tier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Camerupt’s lopsided stat distribution and Solid Rock reward heavy bulk investment, as it doesn’t need much offensive investment to remain a threat. However, with maximum HP and 176 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature, Camerupt can survive up to defensive Starmie’s Surf from full health. As Camerupt’s typing is neutral to common options Electric-types use against Ground-types, such as Zapdos’s Hidden Power Flying, Hidden Power Ice, and Hidden Power Grass and Rotom-A’s Shadow Ball, a specially defensive slant is preferred. The Defense EVs allow Camerupt to survive mixed Flygon’s Earthquake, while the remaining EVs are put into Attack to power up Explosion and Earthquake. Camerupt is already slower than almost everything, so using a Sassy nature allows it’s offenses to stay in tact.</p> <p>Camerupt can more heavily focus on its offenses as well to hit harder, or even invest heavily in Speed to outspeed slower Pokemon such as Skarmory. However, these choices generally are not as effective in fulfilling its niche as a Stealth Rock user, as Camerupt is very frail without investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt should switch in early and get Stealth Rock up. From here, figure out how important Camerupt is against what the opponent is using. Most commonly, Camerupt uses Explosion shortly afterward to open up a wall and let a teammate in for free. If Camerupt’s prowess against defensive Steel-types and offensive Electric-types is valuable, it’s wise to not immediately use Explosion. However, Camerupt can often KO Pokemon such as Starmie, Clefable, and Zapdos with a surprise Explosion, so it can be an effective lure. Latias and Clefable especially often switch into Camerupt on more defensive teams due to ability to spread burns. Do not underestimate Camerupt’s ability to pull off an Explosion, as with bulk and Solid Rock, it’ll typically live most non Water-type attacks from full health. Using Explosion on Starmie trying to keep Stealth Rock off or Flygon trying to force it out is hugely valuable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Camerupt mainly fits on very aggressive hyper offense builds as an early game Stealth Rock user and Electric immunity. It is typically used alongside leads that cannot get Stealth Rock up and have good synergy with it so it gets in early in the game. Some examples include Breloom, Gallade, Machamp, Dragonite, and Gyarados. These Pokemon can potentially lure in Skarmory, giving Camerupt a switch-in to set up Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Breloom is a particularly good choice, as it can prevent opposing set-up with a fast Spore and the sleeping foe gives Camerupt a free switch. Otherwise,  very offensive teammates fit well with it. One of the best partners for it offensive Calm Mind Jirachi, as Camerupt can often bait in and use Explosion on Clefable and Latias, opening it up to sweep. Camerupt can also use Explosion on Ground-types such as Gliscor and Flygon that think they can OHKO it but cannot, preventing them from revenge killing Jirachi. Swords Dance Scizor is another excellent partner, as it can potentially remove Latias with Pursuit and can help out against Dragon Dance boosted foes, such as Tyranitar and Dragonite, that can OHKO Camerupt with a boosted Earthquake. Dragon Dance Gyarados and both mixed and Dragon Dance Dragonite outside of the lead position are also great, as they resist all of its weaknesses and can potentially open up walls. Other offensive teammates such as Agility Empoleon, Swords Dance Lucario, and Rock Polish Metagross are all effective teammates. All of these Pokemon can be revenge killed by Choice Scarf Rotom-A using Thunderbolt, giving Camerupt a free switch-in.</p>"

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol, once one of the most prominent support Pokemon around, now lies overshadowed by many of the newer faces and older rivals that it has only a few advantages over. Bronzong, with a superior defensive typing and slightly higher stats, is more popular as a supporter, and Claydol's only advantages from a support point of view are its much higher Speed, which allows it to outpace most Scizor and some Tyranitar, as well as its access to Rapid Spin. Even in the spinning department, however, it is overshadowed by Forretress, who has a superior defensive typing, an equally good support movepool, and the ability to take out spinblocking Ghost-types. Claydol's many weaknesses to common attacking types do not help its case either. However, Claydol's balanced offensive and defensive stats as well as its Ground-type STAB still make it worth using in certain situations.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Claydol has a whole host of other support options that can easily replace Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock, and can hence be specialized for different teams. Chief among these are Reflect and Light Screen, which have great merit on offensive teams that rely heavily on setup sweepers. As Claydol also learns Stealth Rock, it can mimic pure support Uxie in this way, by using Stealth Rock alongside dual screens with Explosion in place of Memento. Claydol can set up Gravity as well; although it is slightly overshadowed by Bronzong and Forretress in this role, it can make use of Gravity with a perfectly accurate Stone Edge, and unlike Bronzong, it isn't weak to Ground-type attacks under Gravity. Alternatively, Claydol learns Trick Room too. Lastly, Trick can be used alongside a Choice item to hopefully cripple an incoming wall or counter.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is another decent option that allows Claydol to hit spinblocking Ghost-types; this is particularly important as two of the three OU Ghost-types, namely Rotom-A and Gengar, are immune to Earth Power by virtue of their Levitate ability. Toxic is a very interesting option as it can cripple bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and Vaporeon, who are common switch-ins to Claydol. Grass Knot always 2HKOes 252/0 Swampert through Leftovers, but it deals pitiful damage to Suicune and Vaporeon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types are perhaps the best counters to Claydol. Gyarados is probably the best choice as it is immune to Earthquake, takes little from Ice Beam, and can easily set up with Dragon Dance or use Taunt to stop Claydol from using its support moves. The same is more or less true for Suicune and Vaporeon, who both dislike Toxic but have strong Water-type STAB moves that will KO Claydol. Starmie has no such problem as Natural Cure heals it of poison; it also has access to Recover to offset any damage that Claydol can do. Swampert does worse, as it is 2HKOed by the rare Grass Knot and dislikes Toxic, but it can threaten Claydol in much the same fashion. Lastly, while most Dragon-types cannot take Ice Beam, Kingdra is neutral to Ice-type attacks and can take almost anything Claydol throws at it while destroying Claydol with its Water-type STAB moves or setting up with Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Ghost-types are an issue for Claydol. The common Gengar and Rotom-A are both immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate and can defeat Claydol with their STAB moves. However, Gengar cannot switch into Shadow Ball or Psychic twice, while defensive Rotom-A dislikes Toxic. Dusknoir is an issue too, but does not have any strong Ghost-type STAB attacks nor an immunity to Ground-type moves. Bug- and Dark-types are problematic for Claydol, especially as the users of these moves, namely Scizor and Tyranitar, tend to have access to Pursuit as well. Scizor can take anything Claydol throws its way barring Hidden Power Fire, and, in addition to Pursuit, can use U-turn too, which KOes Claydol if it stays in and allows Scizor to scout the incoming Pokemon if Claydol switches. Tyranitar is much the same, but it has a more powerful STAB Pursuit and can also use STAB Crunch against Claydol that stay in. Heracross is noteworthy for its powerful STAB Megahorn, ability to absorb Toxic for a Guts boost, and access to Pursuit. Furthermore, it is the only one of the above that resists Earth Power, but conversely, it is weak to Psychic. Grass-types can be a nuisance as well. The biggest problem of the bunch is Celebi, who resists both of Claydol's STAB moves, doesn't take much damage from Ice Beam and Shadow Ball, and can hit Claydol hard with Grass Knot. Breloom does well too, despite weaknesses to Psychic and Ice Beam, and can use Spore or Seed Bomb to defeat Claydol. Roserade lacks the Ground-type resistance of its peers and is weak to Ice Beam and Psychic as well, but has a high Special Defense stat to shrug off super effective attacks, along with access to STAB Grass Knot and Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Lastly, Bronzong and Skarmory can take just about anything from Claydol, but they cannot immediately pose a threat. Bronzong must have Grass Knot to cause any real damage, and can only really hurt Claydol by putting it to sleep with Hypnosis. Skarmory can whittle it down with Brave Bird, but it must be wary of being caught by Earth Power when it uses Roost against a slower Claydol. Blissey can take any special hit and is not terribly bothered by most of Claydol's physical attacks, but it should be mindful of Explosion.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rapid Spin is the most important move on the set, as it removes entry hazards that can be crippling for the rest of the Pokemon on your team; vice versa, Claydol can also cut opponents' lifespans short with its own Stealth Rock. Attacking moves are recommended in the last two slots as many OU Pokemon can cause Claydol trouble. The first of these should be a Ground-type STAB move, as Ground is an excellent attacking type and helps Claydol greatly against common Steel-types. Earthquake is usually the superior choice as it has a chance to OHKO Lucario and Infernape, as well as 2HKO Tyranitar and Jirachi, which Earth Power cannot do. However, Earth Power provides a guaranteed 2HKO on standard Choice Band Metagross, is not affected by Intimidate, and prevents the need for splitting EVs if you wish to run Ice Beam.</p> <p>There are a number of viable options in the last slot, but it is generally best to avoid splitting EVs as this reduces Claydol's already low offensive power. Thus, if using Earth Power, go for Ice Beam, and if running Earthquake, use Explosion. In general, Ice Beam is the best coverage option as it gives Claydol super effective coverage on not only the Grass- and Flying-types that resist or are immune to Ground, but also Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon. However, it lacks power against foes it hits for neutral damage, such as Rotom-A. On the physical side, the option that most merits a mention is Explosion. This might seem ridiculous considering the fact that your opponent's first switch-in to Claydol is usually a Ghost-type, but it is by far Claydol's best way to deal significant damage. Explosion can create an important gap in the opponent's team, especially if it hits a bulky Water- or Grass-type, and also grants a free switch that could give you the opportunity to set up a sweep or regain momentum.</p> <p>Claydol is difficult to EV given its multiple traits and talents, and you will very rarely find Claydol that carry the same exact EVs. The 252 HP EVs grant Claydol optimum defenses, while the 144 Defense EVs ensure that it survives the 2HKO from Jolly Life Orb Mamoswine's Ice Shard as well as the OHKO from +2 Infernape's Fire Punch and Choice Band Machamp's Payback. 112 Attack EVs will let Earthquake OHKO Lucario and Infernape after Stealth Rock, 2HKO non-bulky Jirachi and Tyranitar, and add more sting to Explosion. If running a special set, 112 Special Attack EVs should be run instead to enable Claydol to always 2HKO 252/0 Metagross with Earth Power, and give Ice Beam a reasonable chance to OHKO 4/0 Flygon, as well as non-bulky Dragonite and 252/0 Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Cradily might seem handicapped as a Curse sweeper due to its relatively large number of weaknesses and only average stats. While Cradily's Rock typing might trouble it to some extent, it does increase Cradily's Special Defense stat by 50% in a sandstorm. Combined with its access to Recover, a move that other Curse users, such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Regirock, wish they had, Cradily can become quite a formidable threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb is by far the best move not mentioned above. It can replace Earthquake to provide Cradily with a secondary STAB attack that also nails common physical walls, namely Swampert and Hippowdon. Cradily can make use of a set consisting of Stockpile and Swords Dance, but it has limited coverage as it only has room for two attacks; one if it opts for a healing move. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rock Slide that trades accuracy for power, but it is not recommended due to Stone Edge's low PP. Mirror Coat reflects special attacks for double the damage, but also reduces Cradily's coverage. Toxic cripples bulky opponents, but is generally not worth a moveslot. Finally, Pain Split can be used over Recover to heal Cradily while damaging the opponent, but if the opponent does not have relatively high HP, Recover will be the more effective move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most of Cradily's counters are Pokemon that pack a super effective attack. Scizor is the number one threat to Cradily, as three of its common moves hit Cradily for super effective damage, while Swords Dance lets Scizor boost its Attack faster than Cradily can boost its Defense with Curse. Metagross is another counter thanks to its powerful Meteor Mash, which hurts Cradily a lot even after one or two Defense boosts. Similarly, Infernape has a powerful STAB super effective Close Combat with which to dispose of Cradily; however, it can be taken out by a well-timed Earthquake. Jirachi can often flinch Cradily to death with STAB Iron Head, or Trick it a Choice Scarf to render it useless for the rest of the match. Finally, Breloom not only resists anything Cradily can throw at it, but can also use Spore to incapacitate it, set up a Substitute, and knock it out with Focus Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Cradily is an effective Curse user that has several advantages over Tyranitar and Regirock, namely Suction Cups, which prevents it from being phazed, and a Grass typing, which eliminates its weaknesses to Water and Grass. Curse is a great move that boosts Cradily's average Attack and Defense stats and enables it to both hit harder and take hits more easily. Rock Slide is Cradily's main attack as it gains STAB and hits most Pokemon that don't resist it quite hard after a few boosts. Recover allows Cradily to heal without going to sleep and becoming setup bait; however, Rest completely heals Cradily and cures it of status as well, especially Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake is the recommended move if using Recover as it gives Cradily better coverage, while Sleep Talk is the preferred option if Cradily carries Rest; it allows Cradily to attack or set up while asleep.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature maximizes Cradily's HP and Special Defense stats to let it take most special attacks with ease, especially when sandstorm is in play. Special Defense investment is preferred to physical bulk because Cradily will be boosting its latter defense with Curse. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to enable Cradily to hit a bit harder.</p> <p>A Sand Stream Pokemon is needed for Cradily to reach its full potential. Tyranitar and Hippowdon are both great options; both can provide Stealth Rock support as well. A teammate that can switch into Bug-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, such as Gyarados or Zapdos, is also appreciated as Cradily will often attract attacks of these types.</p>"

  "Walrein": {
    "overview": "<p>As usual, the Ice-type is very much a mixed blessing. Ice-type attacks are always useful on a team, but the STAB boost on them comes with an unfortunate list of weaknesses. Stealth Rock hinders Walrein's ability to tank attacks, as taking 25% damage each time it comes in will wear it down fast. Even with these drawbacks considered, Walrein is a fine tank in OU play with handy resistances to Ice- and Water-type attacks and respectable offensive stats for a predominantly defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Back in ADV, the sight of Walrein in OU matches was rare, to say the least. However, with its cool new Ice Body ability, it can be a very useful--often integral--part of a hail-based team with support from Abomasnow. Walrein's stalling abilities with hail support are impressive and with Toxic or Toxic Spikes it can be surprisingly difficult to take down. Overall, Walrein got some very useful boosts in the transition from ADV to DPP, making it suitable for use in the OU environment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Walrein has a few options worth noting from its respectably diverse movepool. Stockpile is available if you wish to boost both of Walrein's defenses, although Walrein has better things to be doing. Hidden Power Electric works okay alongside Blizzard, hitting Water-types for reasonable damage, especially Gyarados. Walrein can run a RestTalk set with Thick Fat, but its poor defensive typing and weakness to Stealth Rock make the set's viability questionable. Walrein can also run a Curse set to further boost its decent Attack and Defense, but Snorlax and Swampert do this job better. The only distinct advantage Walrein has over the former two is that nothing is immune to Avalanche. Lastly, Encore can be used to force switches and set up on the opponent's Pokemon. Roar is probably the better option, though, since it has more PP and can bring out something Walrein fares well against. Thick Fat can replace Ice Body pretty much anywhere, but then you're better off using other bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon or Suicune. Brine is also a nice attacking move in tandem with Super Fang.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since Walrein relies on poison to deal damage, most Steel-types will cause problems. Jirachi and Metagross have the defenses to take a few hits even from Earthquake and strike back with powerful attacks of their own; however, unless they carry Leftovers, both of these lose in the long run against Walrein. Empoleon can also Roar away Walrein's Substitute, but rarely has enough Speed EVs to ensure it will phaze Walrein before being phazed itself. If they come in before Walrein sets up a Substitute, Lucario and Machamp can scare away Walrein with their high-powered STAB moves.</p> <p>Tyranitar screws up Walrein's Leftovers recovery and replaces hail with sandstorm, making Ice Body useless. Gyarados can sponge hits from Ice- and Water-type attacks and set up with Dragon Dance before KOing Walrein with Stone Edge. Like Tyranitar, Gyarados also has access to Taunt. Suicune is faster than Walrein, can easily Roar it out, and takes minimal damage from any of the Walrein's attacks. Clefable is immune to the effects of hail and poison and can Encore Walrein's attacks, making it particularly problematic despite being rare in OU. Breloom is another issue if you don't have Blizzard, since it, like Clefable, is still able to recover HP during hail and can't be worn down by poison, thanks to its Poison Heal ability.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallrein (Toxic Stall)": {
        "description": "<p>This set is based around taking advantage of Walrein's Ice Body ability and using it to stall turns.This set needs to be partnered with Abomasnow to get a constant stream of hail going. With Ice Body activated and Leftovers equipped, Walrein can alternate between Substitute and Protect, without losing any health, forcing the opponent to suffer up to 32 turns of hail and other residual damage.</p> <p>Poisoning the opponent is key to this set's success. Once Walrein has afflicted an opponent with Toxic, the stalling can commence. Simply alternate between Protect and Substitute (there is no net change in your health), healing yourself and intensifying the poison damage each turn, draining your opponent of its HP. This is the direct approach. There is another way to do this, however, but it requires some additional support. Adding a Toxic Spikes user such as Forretress or Tentacruel into the mix can really add to this set's effectiveness. Bear in mind that if you are unable to get both layers of Toxic Spikes in play, you will be inflicting the weaker variety of poison, making stalling the opponent out a slightly slower process.</p> <p>With Toxic Spikes support, Walrein can afford to drop Toxic from its moveset. However, if you keep it, Walrein will be able to poison Flying-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Levitate. Other than Toxic, you have a couple of options to use in its place. Roar works if your team is in need of a phazer and also has applications more specific to this set. First of all, you can shuffle opponents around to let Toxic Spikes take effect. Secondly, you can prevent Swampert from Roaring your Substitute away by Roaring it out first. Having Roar also means that Gyarados cannot simply Dragon Dance in Walrein's face and forces it to take even more residual damage upon re-entry. Earthquake is a great choice to hit Poison-types like Tentacruel that like to ruin your set-up by coming in to absorb Toxic Spikes. It also helps to wear down Steel-types, which are immune to poison. Super Fang can also be used to slice the opponent's HP in half. This ultimately makes the stalling process much faster with Toxic Spikes down. Finally, you have your choice of STAB move so Walrein's respectable Special Attack doesn't go to waste. Surf helps to wear down Tyranitar, whose ability to change the weather is a real pain. Surf also hits Steel-types for neutral damage and has the potential to 2HKO Forretress, whose immunity to Toxic and access to Rapid Spin can ruin Walrein's strategy. It also has a lot more PP than Blizzard, meaning that Walrein won't be quite so vulnerable to Taunt. Blizzard is still a worthy option, however, as it provides Walrein with good attacking coverage and smacks around most Flying-, Grass-, and Poison-types many of whom are immune to Toxic Spikes or the poison status altogether.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Abomasnow is absolutely required in order to take full advantage of Walrein's ability. Since Walrein is normally used with hail, Abomasnow could support the entire team as a whole. Toxic Spikes will allow Walrein to more effectively stall out the opponent, so partnering Walrein with a user of them is a good strategy. Tentacruel and Forretress can reliably place down Toxic Spikes while also providing Rapid Spin support. Rapid Spin removes Stealth Rock from the field, allowing Walrein to come in without taking a quarter of its HP in damage.</p> <p>232 HP EVs ensure that Walrein's HP stat leaves the same remainder when divided by 16 and 4, which guarantees that all of the damage it takes from using Substitute is restored in two turns. Bearing this in mind, the EVs give Walrein the best possible overall defenses. Speed EVs can be used on Walrein in order to foil some common phazers such as Skarmory and Vaporeon. However, this might reduce Walrein's overall physical tanking abilities, albeit not by too much. More importantly, though, not investing in Speed ensures that Walrein is slower than standard Choice Band Scizor, which would otherwise break Walrein's Substitute while switching out to a faster Pokemon, thus breaking the stall.</p> <p>Tyranitar gives Walrein a world of trouble by removing hail and packing high-powered Rock-type attacks. Swampert can keep Tyranitar at bay, and can also set up Stealth Rock for added residual damage. Walrein's typing gives it an undesirable weakness to a number of commonly used attacks. Fighting-types who are immune to poison, such as RestTalk Machamp, can beat Walrein with their STAB attacks. Gyarados can also be a problem with Taunt, an immunity to Toxic Spikes, and the ability to then set up on Walrein. Having a Rotom-A on your team will compensate for these issues extremely well. Rotom-A can check and beat Gyarados, take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Walrein, and also block Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon like Forretress.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross returns to DPP OU as perhaps the best glue Pokemon in the tier. Metagross's fantastic stat spread, excellent Steel / Psychic typing, versatile movepool, and item flexibility lets it fulfill almost any role, be that as a utility Pokemon, sweeper, or speed control with a Choice Scarf. Metagross is one of the best Stealth Rock users in the tier, as it has the bulk to set up the entry hazard in front of almost all foes and can punish spinners such as Starmie, Forretress, and Donphan with Explosion and Earthquake. With just 252 HP EVs, Metagross also is one of the best utility checks in the tier, as by customizing its item and moves, it can check everything from Dragon Dance sweepers such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Gyarados with a Shuca Berry; Breloom, Gengar, Machamp, and Jirachi with a Lum Berry; and Infernape, Heatran, and mixed Dragonite with an Occa Berry. This item flexibility makes it by far the best user of Trick + Iron Ball in the tier, as it lures in premier answers such as Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos and neuters them with an Iron Ball while opening them up to Earthquake. Even if Trick doesn’t connect with these prime targets, most offensive Pokemon do not enjoy losing their item and Speed, while defensive Pokemon often give Metagross Leftovers, making it a fantastic defensive Jirachi check.</p> <p>More offensive Metagross sets are also excellent choices. Agility Metagross is one of the hardest foes to cover for offensive teams, as its bulk makes it hard to KO while in return it outspeeds and KOes frailer, faster Pokemon including most Choice Scarf users. Its ability Clear Body makes Metagross immune to Intimidate weakening it, preventing Gyarados from mitigating its offensive prowess. In addition, it can customize its coverage, including options such as Ice Punch to always OHKO Choice Scarf Flygon and hit Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos hard and Zen Headbutt to OHKO Breloom and hit bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Swampert as hard as possible. Choice Scarf also makes Metagross an excellent revenge killer, as it outspeeds neutral-natured +1 Gyarados and +1 Dragonite and can KO them with the proper coverage or Explosion. It can even use Pursuit to make it a great check to Gengar and Choice-locked Latias, especially after Latias uses Draco Meteor, as it outspeeds them and threatens to KO or heavily damage them.</p> <p>Metagross's main issues in DPP OU are due to it being a jack-of-all-trades: its relatively slow Speed, poor offensive typing, and common weaknesses make it not as specialized as many other Steel-types in the tier. While Metagross is faster than many defensive Pokemon with full investment, doing so is often at the expense of crucial bulk. Choice Scarf Metagross also must be careful about Jolly Gyarados and Dragonite, as they outspeed it and can potentially KO it. Without bulk investment, Metagross struggles to fulfill defensive responsibilities of a Steel-type such as switching into Latias’s Choice Specs Draco Meteor and taking on defensive Jirachi. However, with bulk investment and especially before it uses Trick to lose its Iron Ball, Metagross is very slow, often having to take a hit before retaliating. Its attributes combine to make Metagross a fantastic utility check; however, because it lacks recovery and is easily chipped, it doesn’t work as a long-term counter to anything. Metagross’s typing also is rather poor offensively, as it often needs the threat of Explosion or Trick to scare Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Zapdos, Suicune, and especially Rotom-A and Skarmory due to the bad coverage of Meteor Mash. Metagross cannot pick all the options—items, moves, and EV spreads—it needs to handle every threat, forcing it to either bluff having an option or sacrifice itself to take out a foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As Metagross often only needs Earthquake to be effective, it has many additional options. A prominent one is to drop Explosion for Toxic and Protect with Leftovers on defensive teams alongside Magnezone or Magneton. Metagross is highly effective without Skarmory and Forretress in the picture, is a fantastic Jirachi and Clefable check with Leftovers, and can spread Toxic on defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Zapdos, and Swampert. There are many other options in the last slot alongside Meteor Mash and Explosion: some prominent ones include Pursuit with a lot special bulk to trap Latias; Endure alongside Custap Berry to always survive a hit and revenge kill sweepers without priority; Zen Headbutt to surprise Breloom, Machamp, and Rotom-A; Refresh to heal off paralysis or burns from Jirachi and Gengar; and Rest with a Chesto Berry to heal off residual damage and give Metagross a second chance. Metagross can also use an effective mixed set with options such as Hidden Power Fire for Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress; Grass Knot for Swampert, Hippowdon, and Slowbro; and Psychic for Rotom-A, Breloom, Gengar, and Machamp. Expert Belt on such a set lets Metagross hit its targets very hard, 2HKOing Hippowdon and Skarmory and OHKOing Swampert, Scizor, and Forretress with their respective moves. Grass Knot also is good on physical sets to 2HKO Swampert and potentially physically defensive Hippowdon. Metagross can also use Hammer Arm to heavily damage Clefable and Tyranitar while also hitting Magnet Rise Magnezone and Heatran.</p> <p>Choice Band seems like it would be a fantastic choice on such a strong Pokemon, but all of Metagross's attacks have drawbacks when it locks into them. Heatran, Skarmory, and physically defensive Jirachi can punish Metagross hard for using Meteor Mash, and Metagross isn't fast enough or bulky enough to get enough advantage for locking into one attack. While Explosion can now KO almost anything not immune to it, it still can’t OHKO physically defensive Skarmory. It simply doesn’t have enough utility compared to other sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rotom-A</strong>: Rotom-A is the classic Metagross counter, as it resists Meteor Mash, is immune to Earthquake and Explosion, and can either burn it with Will-O-Wisp or roast it with Overheat. Even though Agility Metagross outspeeds Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Metagross still typically loses to it if both are at full health and Metagross doesn’t have Zen Headbutt. Metagross can win the matchup if it gives Rotom-A an Iron Ball, as Earthquake 2HKOes it, but Metagross still hates being burned.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types</strong>: Skarmory, Zapdos, and Gyarados resist Meteor Mash and are immune to Earthquake. Despite not resisting Meteor Mash, Gliscor is bulky enough to take it fairly well. Of these, physically defensive Skarmory is perhaps the best answer, as it fears almost nothing Metagross can do, heals off even Thunder Punch and Explosion, and isn’t 2HKOed by Earthquake if it is Tricked an Iron Ball. Zapdos and Gyarados can 2HKO Metagross with Heat Wave and Earthquake, respectively, while physically defensive versions of both can take repeated punishment from Meteor Mash. However, neither enjoy an Iron Ball, both are OHKOed by Explosion, and Gyarados is also OHKOed by Thunder Punch. Gliscor needs a lot of Defense investment to continually endure Metagross’s attacks, is OHKOed by Explosion, and additionally hates Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Swampert, Suicune, Starmie, Milotic, Ludicolo, Quagsire, and Slowbro are all good answers to Metagross unless it packs Thunder Punch or Grass Knot depending on the Pokemon. Even then, they often can survive these attacks and heavily weaken Metagross or force it to use Explosion. Special Water-types like Kingdra and offensive Empoleon can overpower Metagross with Hydro Pump, especially if boosted by rain or Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Both offensive and defensive Ground-types threaten Metagross. Offensive Ground-types such as Mamoswine, Flygon, Swampert, and Gliscor can hit Metagross very hard with Earthquake, especially Mamoswine, which OHKOes maximum HP Metagross with a Choice Band Earthquake. Defensive Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Donphan 2HKO Metagross with Earthquake and force it to use Explosion unless it has Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While they can’t switch in freely, Infernape and Heatran outspeed Metagross and devastate it with Fire-type attacks unless it has an Occa Berry. Choice Specs Heatran is notable in that it OHKOes Metagross through the Occa Berry.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, especially if they aren’t hit super effectively by Earthquake, are good answers to Metagross because they resist Explosion and Meteor Mash. Bronzong is immune to Earthquake and hits it hard with Earthquake. Scizor and Forretress either set up on Metagross or hit it hard in Scizor's case. Magnezone is notable in that it often outspeeds Metagross and can trap it with Magnet Rise or KO it if it is weakened, but it needs to watch out for Iron Ball or faster Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Metagross doesn’t have access to reliable recovery and is vulnerable to Spikes and burn. Metagross easily lets Skarmory and Forretress set up Spikes and detests getting burned. Both Gengar and Rotom-A outspeed Metagross and burn it. Any additional damage makes it harder for Metagross to be a utility counter, as many Pokemon can hit it super effectively to KO it once it’s sufficiently chipped.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong> While not as susceptible to trapping as Skarmory, Metagross is often slower than Magneton and Magnezone and is prone to be revenge killed by STAB Thunderbolt. Faster Magnezone variants in particular can use Magnet Rise to suppress their Earthquake weakness, forcing Metagross to use Explosion. Although risky, Magneton and Choice Scarf Magnezone can also switch into a predicted Trick, locking Metagross into a non-damaging move and 2HKOing it.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Metagross's primary attack, heavily damaging foes such as Latias, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and Azelf while potentially boosting its Attack. Especially if Metagross leads, it often needs Meteor Mash to threaten the common leads mentioned above. Earthquake fills out Metagross’s coverage by hitting Steel-types hard and notably allows it to 2HKO Jirachi, Empoleon, and opposing Metagross. Earthquake also gives Metagross an accurate move to finish off weakened foes.</p> <p>Explosion is extremely strong, OHKOing almost everything that doesn't resist it and heavily damaging anything not immune to it. It gives Metagross an option against walls that it otherwise can’t damage effectively, such as Hippowdon, which is almost always OHKOed, Swampert, and Gliscor, and it can even be used when it is low on health and needs to trade with an foe, such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Suicune, and Zapdos. Metagross can comfortably set up Stealth Rock especially early in the game due to its bulk and power. However, if something else can set up Stealth Rock, there are several other options. Thunder Punch is a great choice especially if it doesn’t lead, as it OHKOes Gyarados and pressures Pokemon Metagross usually has to use Explosion on such as Starmie, Suicune, and Skarmory. A more aggressive approach is to use Bullet Punch. Metagross’s Bullet Punch hits fairly hard and is most useful to take down Pokemon who survived Meteor Mash or Earthquake with a Focus Sash such as Aerodactyl, frailer Azelf, and Heatran. However, Bullet Punch is also nice to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Note that some versions of lead Metagross want both Stealth Rock and Bullet Punch, so it can drop any of Meteor Mash, Earthquake, or Explosion depending on the rest of the team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum HP and Attack, Metagross is both bulky enough and strong enough to survive almost any attack and retaliate as hard as possible. However, Metagross has almost unrivaled flexibility in its EV spread; especially with a Focus Sash, it can drop HP for Speed to be more threatening, possibly outspeeding Pokemon such as Magnet Rise Magnezone that expect to outspeed Metagross. Bulkier spreads with Leftovers are free to invest some of the Attack EVs into Special Defense; even a little investment helps Metagross avoid 2HKOes from attacks such as Magnezone’s Thunderbolt and Starmie's Hydro Pump. Metagross can also use maximum special bulk with a Careful nature; doing this makes Metagross absurdly bulky, letting it survive attacks such as Timid Heatran’s Fire Blast from full and KO it back with Earthquake. Metagross can also invest in its Defense; an EV spread of 252 HP / 64 Attack / 192 Def with an Adamant nature allows it to survive +2 Tyranitar’s Earthquake and OHKO it back after Stealth Rock. However, beware taking too many EVs from Metagross’s Attack; some scenarios to watch out for are not OHKOing Dragon Dance Tyranitar after Stealth Rock, failing to 2HKO defensive Jirachi, and failing to break Suicune’s Substitute with Earthquake.</p> <p>Metagross has a wide variety of items it can use. What to use largely depends on when Metagross is used and what it is trying to do. If Metagross leads, the most common items are Lum Berry to avoid status such as Breloom’s Spore, Roserade’s Sleep Powder, and Machamp’s Dynamic Punch and Focus Sash to take extremely strong attacks such as Heatran’s Fire Blast, mixed Dragonite’s Fire Blast, and Azelf’s Choice Band Explosion and either trade with Explosion, set up Stealth Rock, or KO back. If Metagross does not lead, the most common items are Shuca Berry to survive almost any Ground-type attack, Leftovers to stave off residual damage and Jirachi’s Iron Head, and Lum Berry to avoid being burned by Jirachi’s Fire Punch and Gengar’s Will-O-Wisp. Some other choices include Custap Berry to get one last strong hit off or use Explosion on an unsuspecting target and Occa Berry to survive one strong Fire-type attack from attackers such as Infernape and non Choice Specs Heatran and KO back.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metagross most commonly either leads or gets in the game early and sets up Stealth Rock if it has it. Metagross is unique among leads in that it is bulky enough to survive many attacks in the lead spot without a Focus Sash, can set up Stealth Rock, and threaten almost all other leads with either Explosion or strong attacks. Leverage this to your advantage: Aerodactyl and frailer Azelf will faint to Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, making them more hesitant to use Taunt on Metagross out of fear they won't be able to get Stealth Rock up. Especially if Metagross does not have Stealth Rock or another teammate has it, using Explosion immediately against bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Swampert can be very advantageous. As a lead, Metagross is typically very liberal with its health; as it commonly either just needs to set up Stealth Rock or be a strong anti-lead, sacrificing a lot of its health to weaken or take out a foe is often advisable.</p> <p>If Metagross does not lead, try to avoid taking too much chip damage when it comes in. In the back, Metagross is often trying to plug defensive holes such as handling defensive Jirachi or being a backup check to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Dragonite alongside setting up Stealth Rock. Try to take advantage of Metagross's unique customizability to surprise the opponent; surviving an attack such as Life Orb Flygon's Fire Blast and KOing it back, absorbing Breloom's Spore and hitting it with Meteor Mash, or surprising Starmie or Suicune with Thunder Punch or Explosion are game swinging plays that Metagross very often makes as long as it stays relatively healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross most commonly features on offensive teams trying to get momentum early and have redundancy in their Steel-types. Metagross should not be the only check to Dragon-types on the team; it takes too much damage early in the game to reliably handle Latias, Dragonite, and Jirachi more than once. As such, Metagross is often paired with Pokemon like Tyranitar, Jirachi, Heatran, and Empoleon. These Pokemon have the additional advantage of being able to set up Stealth Rock, letting Metagross be more aggressive in forgoing Stealth Rock should they set it up. As Metagross does a relatively poor job against defensive teams, it appreciates strong wallbreakers that in turn enjoy Metagross's ability to soft check many foes. A prime example for a good partner is Breloom, but Gyarados, Choice Specs Latias, and mixed Dragonite can also make good partners. Magnezone is also a good choice alongside these Pokemon, as it can trap Skarmory, Forretress, and Scizor, prime checks that Metagross often lures in. More utility Metagross sets are fantastic choices on bulkier offenses in general. Some prime partners are Water-types such as Swampert, Choice Specs Kingdra, Starmie, and offensive Suicune. These Pokemon enjoy using their bulk to aid in sweeping; Metagross not only is good to check dangerous anti-leads and Dragon Dance sweepers, but it also gives these Pokemon a free switch in via Fire-type attacks. However, Metagross also appreciates a failsafe against offensive threats, as if it gets chipped it can get overwhelmed. Prominent Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-A, Flygon, and Latias are excellent options.</p> <p>Metagross also is a premier Stealth Rock user on very offensive teams built around disabling leads or other anti-leads that can't set up Stealth Rock. Lead Breloom is a fantastic partner, as it can use Spore and its strong attacks, and then fall back to Metagross to get Stealth Rock up. Other examples of leads like this include Zapdos, Roserade, Choice Specs Latias, and Dragonite. Other common teammates on this style include Dragon Dance users such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar; strong offensive Pokemon that enjoy Spikes such as mixed Jirachi, offensive Latias, offensive Rotom-A, and Gengar; as well as Pursuit users such as Scizor and Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility patches Metagross’s Speed woes and lets it clean up frailer foes with its power and coverage. Earthquake is critical for Steel-types such as Heatran, Magnezone, and Empoleon and gives Metagross a niche on more offensive teams as a Jirachi check. Meteor Mash is an excellent move for Metagross, as an Attack raise can potentially allow Metagross to sweep. Metagross typically does around 70% to prominent faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Latias and Flygon with Meteor Mash and often fails to OHKO offensive Pokemon if it can’t hit them super effectively. However, another option is Zen Headbutt, as it crucially OHKOes Breloom and other Fighting-types, 2HKOes Choice-locked Rotom-A sets, and potentially gives Metagross a way to flinch pass bulkier targets such as offensive Suicune, Zapdos, and Swampert. Explosion immediately removes almost everything in the tier and takes advantage of Metagross’s increased Speed, as it resists most priority and there are few foes faster than it. Thunder Punch is another great option, as it instantly OHKOes Gyarados and is Metagross’s best option for Skarmory. However, when using Zen Headbutt, Metagross needs the additional coverage of Ice Punch to hit Pokemon such as Gliscor, Latias, and Flygon hard. Metagross can also opt for Zen Headbutt in its last slot for a double STAB combination, it will struggle against physical walls such as Skarmory if it does this.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Metagross maximizes its Attack and Speed to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Lucario, Rotom-A, and Heatran after it uses Agility. As Metagross only need 216 EVs to outspeed these Pokemon at +2, 40 EVs can be put into HP for general bulk, but they only have a marginal impact. Maximum Speed EVs help against Pokemon such as Breloom and Magnet Rise Magnezone before Metagross uses Agility. Metagross can also use a Jolly nature with 196 Speed EVs to outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon, but it fails to outspeed Latias even with maximum investment. Jolly is especially a good option alongside Ice Punch, as Flygon commonly can survive one attack and heavily weaken Metagross.</p> <p>Lum Berry lets Metagross switch into Breloom’s Spore, outspeeding and KOing it afterwards, while buffering against status moves such as Thunder Wave from Choice Scarf Latias, Jirachi’s Body Slam, and Will-O-Wisp from Gengar and Rotom-A. Alternatively, Shuca Berry makes Metagross a great anti-offense tool that absorbs powerful Earthquakes from Flygon, Gliscor, Swampert, and opposing Dragon Dance users like Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Dragonite. However, other items such as Life Orb to KO frailer Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Latias after Stealth Rock and Occa Berry to withstand Fire-type moves from Heatran and Infernape are also very helpful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How Metagross is played depends on the matchup. Against more offensive teams, Metagross typically comes into the game fairly late to clean up weakened teams or on Breloom’s Spore, should it have a Lum Berry to reverse momentum. Offensive teams often cover Metagross with Choice Scarf Rotom-A or generic bulky Pokemon such as offensive Suicune, Swampert, Bronzong, and opposing Metagross. If these Pokemon are weakened, Metagross can easily set up using its bulk and sweep or trade two-for-one via its power and potentially Explosion. Against more defensive teams, Metagross often is walled and either tries to trade with Explosion against a wall such as Hippowdon or Zapdos or stays hidden to give a stopgap against defensive Jirachi and Clefable, depending on the flow of the game. Even against foes that wall Metagross and resist Explosion, such as Skarmory and Bronzong, using Explosion on them can weaken them for other sweepers. Beware of Skarmory predicting Explosion and using Roost or the opponent switching in Rotom-A and nullifying Explosion. Note that Metagross’s coverage moves such as Zen Headbutt and Ice Punch are often surprising and can nab unsuspecting KOs, especially against Rotom-A and Flygon, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Agility Metagross is most often used alongside other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Swords Dance Lucario. These Pokemon soften up walls and bulky Pokemon so Metagross can clean up the rest. Of these, Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar is an excellent partner, as it can potentially defeat defensive teams by itself if Metagross uses Explosion on Hippowdon as well as check Rotom-A and Latias, while Metagross can handle Jirachi and Breloom for Tyranitar. Dragonite also can break open walls for Metagross either with a mixed set, a Dragon Dance set, or even an Agility set. These Pokemon also are commonly alongside very aggressive leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl to prevent Stealth Rock, with Azelf often paralyzing and/or using Explosion on bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, Metagross, and Heatran that can potentially survive Metagross's Earthquake and retaliate. Agility Metagross is also fantastic alongside good Rotom-A checks, as even if it has Zen Headbutt, bulkier Rotom-A sets are only 3HKOed by it after Stealth Rock. Some good examples are faster Pursuit Tyranitar sets and Swords Dance Scizor. Metagross enjoys backup from Steel-types to handle Latias and Dragonite, as very strong Dragon-type moves such as Modest Choice Specs Latias and Dragonite's +1 Outrage 2HKO it after Stealth Rock. Thus, Choice Band Scizor, Jirachi, offensive Empoleon, and Heatran are good partners. Metagross is also strong alongside Magnezone, as it can trap Skarmory, Bronzong, and Scizor so that Metagross can sweep. Some good partners for this pairing include Gengar, Choice Band Dragonite, Dragon Dance Kingdra, and Swords Dance Gliscor. Other strong offensive teammates such as Infernape and offensive Zapdos also can be nice to soften up offensive Water-types for Metagross.</p>"
      },
      "Trick + Iron Ball": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick is one of Metagross’s best weapons to disable bulky Pokemon such as defensive Rotom-A, Skarmory, and Zapdos. Nothing in the game enjoys losing its item for an Iron Ball: Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate despise being hit by Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, offensive Pokemon are outsped by most of the metagame and gain a useless item, while defensive Pokemon lose their Leftovers. Earthquake pairs fantastically with Trick, as Metagross pressures many of its walls by outspeeding them and potentially 2HKOing them with a now super effective Earthquake. It also makes Metagross an excellent Jirachi check, as, if Metagross hits defensive Jirachi with Trick, it now outspeeds it and, even if it does get paralyzed, passively heals itself for most of the damage Iron Head does.</p> <p>Meteor Mash is a great option to pressure Pokemon such as Latias, Tyranitar, and Gengar, as Metagross can only disable one Pokemon with an Iron Ball and still needs to pressure foes not hit hard enough by Earthquake. Explosion is another great option to take out bulkier Pokemon not hampered as much by Trick such as Hippowdon and Swampert, but Metagross can maximize its utility by setting up Stealth Rock as well, as it often can both disable a Pokemon with Trick and set it up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Metagross uses maximum HP EVs to survive various attackers such as Latias, Tyranitar, and Jirachi before it uses Trick and almost maximum Attack EVs to 2HKO Zapdos and Rotom-A and potentially 2HKO Skarmory with Earthquake after it uses Trick on them. The Speed investment allows Metagross to outspeed Starmie and Azelf after it uses Trick on them. Metagross typically uses at least 136 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature to 2HKO Zapdos and always break Suicune’s Substitute with Earthquake, but it can also invest in its bulk to survive more attacks. Some examples include 40 Defense EVs to survive Dragon Dance Gyarados' +1 Earthquake after two rounds of Stealth Rock and 56 Special Defense EVs to live Flygon’s Life Orb Fire Blast after a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock. Should Metagross be required for pivoting purposes, a spread of 252 HP / 64 Atk / 20 Def / 152 SpeD / 20 Spe offers a comfortable switch-in to Latias's Draco Meteor and check to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as it survives +1 Tyranitar Earthquake and OHKOes Tyranitar back after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Metagross can also use Trick with other detrimental items. Some examples include Flame Orb to ruin most physical attackers and chip defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Hippowdon (alongside Refresh to heal the burn if it can’t use Trick), Toxic Orb to poison bulky Ground- and Water-types, and Lagging Tail to make even the most boosted of Pokemon move second. However, none of these items are quite as effective as the Iron Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metagross typically tries to use Trick as soon as possible, as it is slower than the entire tier before it gives away its Iron Ball. While Metagross can wait for a better target, the advantage of neutering any foe and potentially gaining a useful item often outweighs the benefit. Opponents often switch their best Metagross check into it first anyways, while Metagross enjoys regaining its Speed so it can pressure Pokemon such as Clefable and slower Tyranitar. Metagross also should avoid Knock Off at all costs before it uses Trick; in DPP, Trick fails if either the user or the target is affected by Knock Off.</p> <p>Before it uses Trick, Metagross should try to bluff having a more useful item. This is especially important against slower foes it threatens out such as Tyranitar, as it may try to absorb the Iron Ball and hit Metagross hard instead of switching to a good target. Metagross should also try to avoid taking too much damage switching in, as it often acts as a utility check and needs as much health as possible to survive strong attacks. If Metagross gains a detrimental item after it uses Trick, such as Black Sludge or a Choice item, it may be best to hold onto it so it can Trick it away later to a better target. Finally, note that Iron Ball disables Magnet Rise, meaning Magnezone cannot trap Metagross as long as it is at decent health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick + Iron Ball Metagross is fantastic on both bulkier teams as a way to open up bulky Pokemon and on more aggressive teams as a utility check. One of its best partners is Choice Scarf Flygon, as not only is it a great failsafe but also really enjoys being able to hit bulky Flying-types with Earthquake, often 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory. Other synergetic partners include offensive Suicune, Swampert, and Latias, as these Pokemon all resist Fire, enjoy Skarmory being disabled, and Suicune and Swampert additionally enjoy Metagross disabling Electric-types like Rotom-A and Zapdos. Metagross is also an excellent teammate for Spikes users such as offensive Skarmory and Roserade, as Trick forces Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon to take Spikes damage. It also provides a utility check against offensive threats such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Flygon locked into Outrage, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar for these often frail Pokemon. Other than these, Metagross generally acts as a support on more bulky offense style teams—it enjoys backup against offensive Dragon-types like Choice Specs Latias, so Steel-types such as offensive Empoleon, Jirachi, Scizor, and Tyranitar are great teammates. Jirachi and Tyranitar can even have a Lum Berry to more easily switch into Breloom's Spore and Rotom-A's Will-O-Wisp, respectively. It enjoys partners such as Gengar and Latias to switch into Ground-type moves; Gengar is especially a good partner because it enjoys Skarmory and other Steel-types neutral to Focus Blast such as Scizor and Forretress being disabled.</p> <p>Trick + Iron Ball Metagross is also a good choice on hyper offensive teams with a bulkier set to enable sweepers that need luck to get past Skarmory. The additional bulk lets these teams get a stronger answer to Latias using Draco Meteor, as Tyranitar is often frail on these teams. The most prominent of these are Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Swords Dance Gliscor. Swords Dance Gliscor in particular is a good partner, as it can drop the otherwise less useful Thunder Fang for the more generally powerful Sky Attack or Night Slash. Tyranitar can use a Pursuit set to take advantage of Rotom-A instead of using a Dragon Dance set. Other good teammates include Scizor, Azelf to get Stealth Rock up immediately, and Dragonite.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Metagross turns into a great revenge killer. Meteor Mash makes Metagross a fantastic Dragon Dance Tyranitar check, outspeeding and OHKOing it after Stealth Rock. If Metagross gets an Attack boost from Meteor Mash, it can potentially clean up weakened teams, as it outspeeds the unboosted metagame except for the uncommon Jolteon and Aerodactyl. Earthquake gives Metagross great coverage against Steel-types and lets it OHKO Pokemon such as Infernape, Lucario, and Heatran that normally outspeed Metagross.</p> <p>Thunder Punch makes Metagross a great Gyarados check, as the move always OHKOes it and has a good chance to OHKO Wacan Berry variants after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch also does good damage to other Water-types such as Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic. Another option is Ice Punch, as it allows Metagross to always OHKO Dragonite and Flygon while hitting Gliscor and Latias very hard. Explosion is most commonly the best option in the last slot, as it allows Metagross to trade with a sweeper it doesn’t have the coverage for or KO almost any wall. More specialized moves include Pursuit, which is fantastic at trapping frail Pokemon threatened out by a fast Metagross such as Gengar and Choice-locked Latias, and Trick, which neuters walls with a Choice Scarf and can prevent foes such as Suicune and Calm Mind Clefable from setting up on it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Metagross needs absolute maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature to outspeed neutral-natured +1 Dragon Dance Gyarados, as Metagross outspeeds neutral-natured Gyarados by one point. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Metagross should try to get in on predicted switches, setup moves, and revenge kills, as it is quite frail without bulk investment. As an example, it is 2HKOed by Modest Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor and, if it has Pursuit, must wait for Latias to use Draco Meteor or Trick before trying to trap it. Note that Choice Scarf Metagross can successfully bluff bulkier sets; neutral-natured Dragon Dance Gyarados must guess whether Metagross has a Shuca Berry to survive Earthquake or has a Choice Scarf, often leaving it to faint to Thunder Punch. Swords Dance Lucario is under the same predicament, as Metagross resists most priority moves. If Metagross has Trick or Explosion, be careful about using them until it is no longer needed to revenge kill threats. Also note that Choice Scarf Metagross isn't the most powerful set; it often needs the element of surprise to KO foes, and once it is revealed, it is easier to play around.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross is a great revenge killer on frailer teams, as it still poses the threat of Explosion or Trick and handles dangerous threats for offensive teams such as Lucario, Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Gyarados. One of its best partners, especially if it has Pursuit, is Breloom. Breloom can use Spore on Latias, as it commonly has Sleep Talk, and then Metagross can come in and use Pursuit. If Stealth Rock is up, Latias without bulk investment can potentially faint on its next switch in. This potentially gives Tyranitar the freedom to use more offensive sets such as Dragon Dance. Choice Scarf Metagross is also fantastic alongside Magnezone, as it can remove Steel-types that switch into Metagross as well as potentially trap opposing Magnezone or Magneton with a Shuca Berry equipped. Some good partners on this style are other Steel-types such as Bronzong and Jirachi and strong attackers such as Dragonite and Gengar. Choice Scarf Metagross also allows other Pokemon more commonly tasked with holding a Choice Scarf to use more offensive sets. As an example, Latias can use Choice Specs and Rotom-A can use a Substitute set. Metagross enjoys having an additional Steel-type to help handle defensive responsibilities such as switching into Latias and handling Jirachi. Passho Berry Heatran is an excellent partner, as it can take on that defensive responsibility while also luring in and using Explosion against bulky Water-types that wall Metagross.</p> <p>Metagross is also a good revenge killer on more offensive Spikes teams using offensive Skarmory, as either its checks are weakened by Spikes or its teammates can remove the Spikes-immune Pokemon that check it. Mixed Dragonite is perhaps Metagross's best partner here, as it can switch into Skarmory trying to wall Metagross and unleash its strong attacks. Other good partners include Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Gengar.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias is the only Dragon / Psychic type in the tier, which means that it's an answer to Fighting-, Fire-, Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Psychic-types. The combination of all these resistances is unique to only Latias and allows it to answer potent wallbreakers like Infernape and Breloom, which very few Pokemon can do. Furthermore, it's completely immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate, and it's also not weak to Stealth Rock, which means it's more resistant to all entry hazards than most Pokemon. Latias has such a vast array of move options that it can perform many different roles. With all these traits, Latias boasts near-unparalleled role compression, allowing it to fit wonderfully on almost any team and pair well with almost every Pokemon individually. Its stats are also nothing to scoff at, with monstrous Special Defense as well as impressive Special Attack and Speed.</p> <p>The main thing that holds Latias back is its susceptibility to Tyranitar, which can switch in, take Latias's Draco Meteor or even Surf, and trap it with Pursuit while threatening a powerful STAB-boosted Crunch. Latias's presence means Tyranitar is often equipped with increased Special Defense investment, which can allow it to take even a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor when healthy and still survive another one. Latias can also have a very hard time versus many Steel-types like Jirachi, Bronzong, Metagross, Empoleon, and even Magnezone, which can take a Draco Meteor or Surf decently well provided that Latias doesn't hold Choice Specs. Even if Latias forces a KO with its strong Draco Meteor, Tyranitar can easily revenge kill it, or another Pokemon can take advantage of Latias's lowered Special Attack. Besides Tyranitar and Steel-types, bulky special walls like Blissey and Clefable can take any attack and have high potential to force Latias out with the threat of a status move or chip damage from Seismic Toss and Ice Beam.</p> <p>It's not all black and white, however, because Latias's astronomical movepool enables creativity and counterplay to its common checks with moves like Trick and Thunder Wave. While Latias cannot avoid its biggest flaw, which is its susceptibility to some of the top threats in the OU metagame compared to other Pokemon, it has so many positive attributes that it's a fantastic fit on almost any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latias has one of the largest movepools in the tier, and combined with its incredible typing and stats, it has the potential to utilize a tremendous number of different strategies. A Trick + Flame Orb set can be extremely effective in the lead slot for its longevity, good lead matchups versus Pokemon like Machamp and Metagross, and its unexpected first-turn Trick that will often cripple a foe from the get-go. A Calm Mind + 3 Attacks set can be used with Dragon Pulse, Surf, and Hidden Power Fire, but the lack of recovery and utility is tough and makes this set hard to use. Latias is a great option for setting up Rain Dance thanks to its great role compression and typing. It can utilize Thunder alongside Rain Dance to do as much damage to Skarmory as possible. Latias can also use Sunny Day, but it won't be able to run Surf or Thunder alongside it, and other Pokemon are probably better at using it. Latias can be a dedicated support slot by opting for a Light Screen + Reflect set to support setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar, as well as Calm Mind users like Suicune and Jirachi. Psychic is an alternative STAB move, but this will probably require additional support from Magnezone because Steel-types resist it and other coverage moves are usually better. A Safeguard + Calm Mind set has some potential with support from Magnezone, but it's unreliable because it still has issues beating Jirachi and Clefable. Toxic can be used to inflict a surprise status ailment on Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Milotic, and Zapdos, but it's usually not worth the slot. Charge Beam is a possible alternative to Calm Mind to make room for additional coverage, but it's not guaranteed to increase Latias's Special Attack, making it inferior to Calm Mind. Dragon Breath is an interesting choice on a bulky set to compress both Thunder Wave and Dragon Pulse together while also granting additional PP, but it's significantly weaker than Dragon Pulse and also only has a 30% chance to inflict paralysis. Protect can be used, potentially alongside Wish, to scout Choice item Pokemon like Tyranitar, Flygon, and Rotom.</p> <p>Some of the crazier options available are quite interesting. Sucker Punch can be used as a surprise priority move that hits Choice Scarf Rotom-A, offensive Starmie, and Gengar; using this move with Hidden Power Fire can actually make the opponent believe Gengar will always outspeed Latias, so it can work as an interesting bait. Whirlpool can be used to trap Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Heatran for a few turns, which may enable Latias to pivot out to a trapper like Magnezone, but this move is extremely gimmicky. Mist Ball is an alternative to Psychic that has a 50% chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack, but it only has 8 PP, which makes it significantly less viable. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Rotom-A as hard as possible without reducing Latias's Special Attack, but it's inferior to stronger coverage moves. Latias can opt for some physical moves like Earthquake and Outrage to catch Heatran and Clefable by surprise, but every other Dragon-type is better at doing this. Psycho Shift can be used on Sleep Talk sets to pass its status to another Pokemon, but Latias usually prefers a more consistent option, since Sleep Talk can only be used once while holding a Choice item. Finally, Role Play is a bizarre option that copies a foe's ability, which is best used on Pokemon like Clefable, Suicune, Zapdos, and Heatran to copy either Magic Guard, Pressure, or Flash Fire, but it's very difficult to fit onto a moveset in favor of other utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar has tremendous special bulk that it can use to take any of Latias's attacks most of the time and can threaten Latias with Pursuit and Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, Bronzong, Magnezone, and Empoleon can all take a Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse quite well and threaten Latias with a variety of attacks. Hidden Power Fire and Surf are Latias's best overall weapons to hit Steel-types consistently, so usually Latias will have trouble versus teams with multiple Steel-types. However, it can still use a variety of moves that may harm these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Clefable</strong>: Blissey and Clefable have tremendous special bulk and can take even a Draco Meteor quite well and potentially cripple Latias with Thunder Wave. Blissey may also use Toxic, and Clefable can remove Latias's item with Knock Off or hinder its setup with Encore. Both of these Pokemon have to be cautious about Trick, since receiving a Choice item completely cripples them. Clefable will be extremely unreliable versus Modest Latias, which has a much more powerful Draco Meteor that is likely to 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Choice Scarf Flygon, Gengar, Starmie, and even Weavile can give Latias some issues by outspeeding and threatening it with powerful, super effective moves. Starmie won't be able to OHKO Latias but can cripple it with Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf Rotom-A usually wants some chip damage before it uses Shadow Ball on Latias and also needs to be careful of Tyranitar.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Latias's Draco Meteor is the strongest in DPP OU, and the Choice Specs set takes advantage of this by powering it up as much as possible without having to set up with Calm Mind. Anything that doesn't resist the move, excluding Blissey, will take a large chunk of damage; even some of the frailer Pokemon that resist it like Lucario can take upwards of 75% from just one.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is nice for taking advantage of Latias's devastating Dragon-type STAB without lowering its Special Attack with each use. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to super effectively hit meddling Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong for as much damage as possible. On the other hand, Thunderbolt is also an option, as it hits Empoleon and Skarmory hard. Also, when opting for Sleep Talk, Dragon Pulse should always be used instead of Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt because Sleep Talk fails after one use with a Choice item on hand in DPP, and it wants to use Dragon-type attacks as consistently as possible.</p> <p>Surf hits most Steel-types with neutral damage, hits Heatran super effectively, and hits hard enough with Choice Specs to do decent damage to all offensive Jirachi variants, Metagross, and even Bronzong. Water- and Dragon-type attacks boast nearly perfect coverage; Empoleon is the only Pokemon that resists both types, and it will still take a ton of damage from Draco Meteor or even Dragon Pulse unless it is a specially defensive variant.</p> <p>Trick is a wonderful option to cripple opposing Blissey and Clefable on the switch. It can also cripple threats like specially defensive Jirachi and bulkier variants of Bronzong. Alternatively, if you don't have a sleep absorber, Sleep Talk fits wonderfully on Latias, as it resists the typical attacks from the most common sleep inducers in the metagame, Breloom and Roserade. This comes with a risk, however, of Breloom using Substitute before Spore or Roserade using Stun Spore; rarely, Roserade can use moves like Hidden Power Ice or even Sludge Bomb, which deal a decent amount of damage to Latias. Because Latias has such potent coverage via its Dragon-type attacks and Surf alone, it is still difficult to switch into even while it's asleep. Sleep Talk + Trick is actually a nice combination because it allows Latias to use Sleep Talk again if it uses Trick during its first turn of sleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make Latias as powerful and as fast as possible, which maximizes its effectiveness as a Choice Specs user. A Timid nature is recommended to outspeed crucial threats like Infernape, Jirachi, Shaymin, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon; it can also let Latias Speed tie with Gengar, which is very significant. However, note that by opting for Hidden Power Fire, Latias will be slower than Gengar.</p> <p>Alternatively, a Modest nature turns Latias into a terrifying powerhouse at the cost of being slower than Infernape, Gengar, and potentially other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Because of this, another strategy with Choice Specs Latias, especially should it lead, is to make it as bulky as possible—with an EV spread of 8 HP / 220 Def / 252 SpA / 28 Spe, it outspeeds Dragonite, Gyarados, and Breloom and survives Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch + sand damage. Latias can also run more Speed EVs and less bulk, as it only needs 8 HP EVs and 188 Defense EVs to survive this threshold. It should always run 252 SpA EVs, as Tyranitar needs to have great investment in bulk to survive two Draco Meteors from Modest Choice Specs Latias, especially after Stealth Rock damage. Clefable also can't switch in nearly as safely, as with a Modest nature, Draco Meteor is quite likely to 2HKO it. The increased damage rolls also are quite favorable versus many variants of Jirachi, so Modest Latias can actually function as a stallbreaker. Dragon Pulse becomes quite strong and can go as far as to 3HKO certain offensive variants of Jirachi. In reality, Infernape is the biggest loss when opting for Modest, so this nature can be fantastic if your team covers Infernape extremely well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to chip Tyranitar as much as possible with supporting teammates so it's more difficult for it to switch in safely and trap Latias with Pursuit. Use Latias's incredible typing to pivot into resisted attacks, and take advantage of double switches early-game to keep it safe from Tyranitar. Try to scout as much as possible before you unleash Draco Meteor, because after a Special Attack drop, Steel-types and even some bulkier sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar can take advantage of Latias. Using Surf early on will allow Latias to hit Steel-types that switch in to eat a Dragon-type attack; this notably will often catch Heatran. When using Trick, you can consider using it early on versus noticeably bulky builds with Pokemon like Hippowdon and Clefable to catch your opponent by surprise and immediately cripple their long-lasting wall, but these builds can also have Choice Scarf Tyranitar, so you'll have to verify that it isn't in the picture if you don't want to risk getting trapped. Hidden Power Fire will often catch Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong off guard, especially early-game. Levitate is extremely useful, so take advantage of it by punishing bad locks like Earthquake from Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Band Swampert. Because of its many resistances, Latias can also punish many locks like Thunderbolt from Choice Scarf Rotom-A and even Fire Punch from Choice Scarf Jirachi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Latias doesn't need too much support, but anything that assists in wearing down Tyranitar and Steel-types will be especially beneficial. Magnezone traps pesky Steel-types, which makes Latias's Draco Meteor that much more threatening. Also, Tyranitar will frequently switch into Magnezone to take its powerful Thunderbolt, which will put it in a good range for Latias to feel more comfortable staying in. Your own Tyranitar can support Latias wonderfully by using Pursuit to trap revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and opposing Choice Scarf Latias. Swampert has strong offensive synergy with Latias, and it can also switch into Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran and threaten them with its STAB Earthquake and Waterfall; Skarmory will also be baited in and pressured by Waterfall and even the occasional Hydro Pump. Latias in turn supports Swampert defensively, as it resists Grass-type attacks aimed at Swampert and can absorb sleep from Breloom and Roserade, two Pokemon that Swampert detests. Pokemon like Bronzong, Zapdos, and Gliscor are very effective versus Flygon, which can give Latias some trouble with its threatening Choice Scarf set. Steel-types pair very well with Latias by switching into Dragon-type attacks aimed at it, while Latias covers their Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type weaknesses. Lucario has incredible offensive synergy with Latias, and the Choice Specs set assists Lucario by wearing down its checks and having Tyranitar lock itself into Pursuit so Lucario can set up Swords Dance freely.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Latias's incredible defensive typing, fantastic movepool, and defensive prowess with moves like Thunder Wave, Roar, and Reflect. Ice Beam is Latias's primary attack, as it hits many threats super effectively such as Dragonite, Flygon, Breloom, and opposing Latias. Dragon Pulse is Latias's most reliable STAB attack on bulkier sets and will dent Dragon-types like Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra while only being resisted by Steel-types. While Dragon Pulse outdamages Ice Beam most of the time, it lacks coverage and the devastating freeze chance that Ice Beam has.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is great for slowing down many offensive threats like Jirachi, Metagross, Infernape, Rotom-A, and Zapdos. It can also support slower stallbreakers like Breloom, Metagross, Machamp, and Swampert, which compensates for this set's overall weakness to defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Skarmory. Another option is to improve Latias's coverage to better answer Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Thunderbolt is a great option alongside Ice Beam, as it especially helps against Dragon Dance Gyarados trying to beat down Latias with a boosted Ice Fang. It also 2HKOes Skarmory, Starmie, and offensive Empoleon. Grass Knot grants Latias effective coverage against Tyranitar, 3HKOing bulkless versions trying to Pursuit trap it. It also prominently 2HKOes Swampert, preventing it from surviving a long time and aiming to freeze Latias. For a more defensive choice, Wish is an alternative option on some balanced cores to keep teammates healthy and help them pivot in more easily.</p> <p>Roar is a fantastic option, as Latias's excellent defensive prowess makes it the best specially defensive phazer in the metagame. It not only spreads entry hazard damage, but also prevents a diverse assortment of sweepers such as Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Suicune, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Swords Dance Lucario, Substitute Heatran, and Substitute + Petaya Berry Empoleon from breaking through. Latias is also fast for a defensive Pokemon, making it harder for these Pokemon to prevent its Roar by using a faster phazing move. Reflect is also a great option to support your team against powerful physical attackers like Lucario, Infernape, Flygon, and Tyranitar. By using Reflect, Latias has much more counterplay against Tyranitar, allowing it to potentially paralyze Tyranitar and have an easier time escaping, thus allowing itself to take advantage of its wonderful typing longer.</p> <p>Another option is to use Earthquake alongside Ice Beam and Thunder Wave. Despite coming off of Latias's mediocre Attack stat, Earthquake prominently 2HKOes Heatran and Lucario, prevents Jirachi and Empoleon from setting up, and 4HKOes Tyranitar.</p> <p>Recover is a staple to this set to keep Latias healthy for as long as possible via instant recovery. In tandem with Wish, Latias can recover massive amounts of health in a single turn; when used in combination with Thunder Wave, Latias can fish for full paralysis, which can allow it to get its health back a bit more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Latias wants as much HP as possible to give it maximum general bulk. 96 Speed EVs are used to outpace Heatran and Adamant Lucario, allowing Latias to cripple two crucial threats with Thunder Wave. The remaining EVs are poured into Defense with a Bold nature, which helps Latias take Close Combat from Infernape and Lucario as well as Tyranitar's attacks as well as possible. Another option is to run even more Defense EVs use an EV spread of 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 Spe that outspeeds Kingdra; these extra Defense EVs are especially helpful without Reflect, as they are useful against Dragon Dance Gyarados, Tyranitar trying to Pursuit trap Latias, and attackers such as Swampert and Breloom trying to break down Latias with repeated attacks. With Earthquake, Latias should use a Relaxed nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 40 Atk / 216 Def that outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Scizor, as Speed is its least important stat and any extra Attack EVs help damage Tyranitar, Empoleon, and Jirachi. If opting for Wish, Latias should use Reflect versus Lucario first, but Thunder Wave is significantly more effective against it. Leftovers is used to grant Latias passive recovery to stay healthy for as long as possible. A spread of 252 HP / 188 Def / 68 Spe with a Timid nature is an option that sacrifices considerable physical bulk for outspeeding Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Impish Gliscor, neutral-natured Flygon and Zapdos, and potentially other bulky Latias. Latias can also use an EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe with a Timid nature that outspeeds maximum Speed mixed Flygon, Jirachi, and Zapdos. These EV spread sacrifice considerable physical bulk, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Latias can be extremely effective early-game by spreading status and forcing unexpected switches, which enables great scouting and facilitates opportunities to gain momentum. With Roar, it also is a fantastic stop to many set-up sweepers. Paralyzing Tyranitar will be helpful if possible to increase Latias's survivability. You are nearly required to use Reflect if Tyranitar is in to give Latias the highest chance of successfully escaping; however, Latias does survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch without Reflect, so it can use Recover at full health, scout the attack, and then switch out or attack back appropriately. Try to target Metagross and Jirachi with Thunder Wave, but be careful with using it on Bronzong, as it makes Gyro Ball more powerful. Beware of Explosion, however. Use Recover throughout the game to stay healthy. If opting for Wish, alternating between Wish and Recover is an effective way to keep Latias as healthy as possible. Use smart switches to take advantage of Wish support. Latias's coverage moves such as Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and Earthquake can often be unexpected. For example, you can bring Latias in on Swampert very easily, but you should be careful of an incoming Ice Punch or even Ice Beam. However, Grass Knot turns this on its head by easily 2HKOing a Swampert trying to break through Latias.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Latias appreciates teammates that can help compensate for its weakness to defensive teams, Steel-types, and Tyranitar. Breloom is a great teammate that does well versus Tyranitar and can take advantage of Latias's paralysis support with its potent Superpower and Seed Bomb. Substitute + Focus Punch variants of Breloom can fish for paralysis and gain a positional advantage. Swampert is another fantastic teammate for its wonderful typing synergy and great offensive pressure with its STAB Water- and Ground-type attacks, as well as taking huge advantage of paralyzed foes. Gengar provides a nice Fighting-type immunity and an additional countermeasure to Infernape, and Substitute variants can fish for paralysis, much like Breloom. Metagross is a great pairing with Latias, as it has solid matchups versus Jirachi and Magnezone; in addition, Choice Scarf sets can threaten Lucario, many variants of Heatran, and even Skarmory with Trick. After using Trick, Metagross can still take advantage of Latias's paralysis support. Your own Lucario can opt for Ice Punch and take advantage of paralyzed targets like Zapdos and Jirachi. Latias and Lucario have immaculate synergy, and Latias really appreciates Lucario's support as a powerful end-game cleaner. Your own Tyranitar, particularly slower and bulkier variants like Choice Band and Custap Berry, will be very beneficial for trapping troublesome threats like Rotom-A and Starmie.</p> <p>This Latias is a fantastic choice on defensive teams, as its defensive profile is unparalleled in the tier. Latias is a member of the big five archetype, built around Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Skarmory, Clefable, offensive Jirachi, and a bulky Ground-type such as Quagsire, Hippowdon, specially defensive Gliscor, or Donphan. Latias's superior ability as a phazer and role compression make it a wonderful choice to augment Tyranitar and Clefable as a core against specially offensive Pokemon including Zapdos, Empoleon, and Heatran, while Skarmory and the Ground-type enjoy Latias taking on offensive Water-types and other prominent Pokemon such as Lucario, Breloom, and Infernape. With Spikes, Latias can also limit Pokemon who can potentially beat it, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Latias is also immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes without being weak to Stealth Rock, meaning it does not need Rapid Spin support and can function with all kinds of defensive teammates. It is a great partner for other defensive stalwarts such as RestTalk Rotom-A, defensive Gyarados, Forretress, defensive Jirachi, Gastrodon, and defensive Empoleon. It can customize its coverage and even its stats to cover all kinds of problem threats for defensive teams, such as running Earthquake for Heatran, Empoleon, and Calm Mind Jirachi; Thunderbolt for Dragon Dance Gyarados; and Grass Knot for Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a high Speed tier, excellent Special Attack, decent bulk, and great typing, Latias can function as a solid revenge killer. Draco Meteor is Latias's most powerful attack, which it needs in order to hit as hard as possible and to revenge kill Pokemon like Flygon, Dragonite, Kingdra, and even Gengar. Even without Choice Specs or Life Orb, Latias's Draco Meteor is still extremely powerful, and almost nothing will enjoy switching into it.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is preferred in the second slot to revenge kill Dragon Dance Gyarados, and it makes for more consistency against Skarmory and Water-types like Suicune and Milotic. Be aware, however, that Thunderbolt can be an exploitable lock because Ground-types can come in and force Latias out. Alternatively, after using Trick to give up its Choice Scarf, Latias can take advantage of Thunder Wave to cripple foes like Jirachi, Heatran, and Metagross, as well as Recover, which can be a cool option to improve its overall longevity.</p> <p>Trick is a great choice on Choice Scarf Latias to cripple threats that otherwise completely wall it. Blissey, Clefable, bulkier Tyranitar variants, and even specially defensive Jirachi will all despise receiving a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Healing Wish is a fantastic option on Latias, especially for more offensive teams, to restore a weakened teammate. Since Choice Scarf Latias forces many switches, it can effectively use Healing Wish on the switch, allowing its teammate to come in safely. Alternatively, Surf combines very well with Latias's Dragon-type STAB attack to give it almost completely unresisted offensive coverage that is resisted only by Empoleon. Surf also hits Heatran super effectively, which would otherwise come in on Choice Scarf Latias quite easily. Even then, Surf shouldn't do a large amount of damage to Heatran, especially bulkier ones, but it's Latias's best practical weapon against it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Latias's Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make it as powerful and as fast as possible with Choice Scarf, even outspeeding threats as fast as +2 Agility Metagross and +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar; note, however, that Latias cannot properly revenge kill Tyranitar unless it's significantly weakened. If not using Trick, Latias can opt for some arbitrary bulk with a spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe, but it may lose out on outspeeding +2 Agility Metagross. Although this isn't too big of a deal, since Latias cannot deal that much damage to it regardless, it's advised to not forego Trick on teams that may have difficulty with Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to conserve Choice Scarf Latias for as long as possible so that it's around to revenge kill late-game Dragon Dance sweepers or even shut down other setup sweepers like Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Clefable with Trick. Use double switches to your advantage to try to avoid Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Latias. Be particularly careful when using Draco Meteor, because after a Special Attack drop, Latias will be very weak and can be exploited by a large portion of the metagame. Try to wear down Steel-types with teammates so that it's harder for the opponent to play around Latias.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Choice Scarf Latias cannot revenge kill Swords Dance Lucario and Dragon Dance Tyranitar and is susceptible to Dragon Dance Dragonite's Extreme Speed, some additional support to check these sweepers is very beneficial. Shuca Berry Jirachi can check all three with Fire Punch, Iron Head, and Ice Punch; it can even serve as a secondary check to Gyarados with Thunderbolt, allowing Latias to opt for a different move like Sleep Talk or Recover. Infernape with Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave can revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Swords Dance Lucario and has nice offensive synergy with Latias. Lucario with Bullet Punch can function as a revenge killer for Dragon Dance Tyranitar and even use its Extreme Speed to give Dragonite trouble. Latias and Lucario are a wonderful offensive pair in general with immaculate type synergy, and they each give each other opportunities very well via locking a Tyranitar into Pursuit for Lucario and taking advantage of Tyranitar and chipping Jirachi for Latias. Anything that assists in wearing down Tyranitar will give Latias significantly more freedom to come in and revenge kill opposing Pokemon with less risk. Magnezone can both chip down Tyranitar with its Thunderbolt and trap Steel-types that check Latias, especially Scizor, which can come in and threaten to trap it with Pursuit or do massive damage with its powerful Bullet Punch. Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp to bait and cripple Tyranitar with a burn. Heatran can also do the same thing with Will-O-Wisp or even Toxic. Roserade and Nidoqueen can provide Toxic Spikes support, which can poison Tyranitar on the switch, giving Latias a bit more breathing room.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Latias's natural bulk, incredible defensive typing, near-unresisted Dragon-type STAB coverage, and astronomical Special Defense allow it to effectively fill the niche of a defensive Calm Mind Pokemon. By increasing its Special Attack and Special Defense, Latias can better take attacks like Ice Beam and Shadow Ball from a myriad of Pokemon as well as more effectively shut down Zapdos and Water-types. Its Dragon Pulse, although not so strong with minimal Special Attack investment, will sting Pokemon that don't resist the attack, especially with a few boosts under its belt. Another downside to this move is its limited PP; however, it's the strongest choice for the set.</p> <p>Roar is extremely effective at phazing Steel-types and Tyranitar that try to come in and give Latias trouble, forcing them to take damage from entry hazards. Also, opposing Calm Mind users like Clefable, Suicune, and Jirachi will have a much tougher time against Latias due to being phazed as they try to set up. Refresh is an interesting alternative that allows Latias to cure status like poison from Toxic and burns from Will-O-Wisp, but it may struggle to cure paralysis because of Pokemon that take advantage of paralysis like Jirachi that will switch in and counter this set if they pack Iron Head.</p> <p>Substitute may be an interesting alternative to Refresh that directly blocks status moves from Pokemon like Heatran and slower variants of Celebi. Some Calm Mind boosts can also be enough to prevent Ice Beam from breaking Latias's Substitute, which reduces the threat of freeze. That said, Seismic Toss from Blissey and Clefable breaks Latias's Substitute, unlike other Substitute + Calm Mind users like Suicune and Jirachi. Although Substitute is better at blocking paralysis from slower Pokemon like bulky variants of Jirachi, Refresh does just as good of a job against a status-inducing Heatran, has more PP, and doesn't force Latias to use Recover as often. Recover is essential to keep it healthy and secure as many opportunities to set up and inflict pressure on the opposing team as possible.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Latias wants as much HP as possible for its overall bulk. Significant Defense investment and a Bold nature combined with this will give Latias the ability to take physical hits decently well while it boosts with Calm Mind. 56 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Kingdra and Modest Calm Mind + Roar Suicune, allowing Latias to strike Kingdra with a Dragon Pulse first, as well as using Roar on Suicune first before it potentially is phazed. Leftovers is used to grant Latias passive recovery and prevent it from constantly losing health in sand or hail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind can be revealed early because it will likely be at the top of an opponent's suspicions if they notice that Latias has Leftovers. Latias can use it throughout the battle to consistently put pressure on the opponent with a strong Dragon Pulse or meddlesome Roar that can rack up entry hazard damage and allow you to scout the opposing team. Tyranitar will often switch into the battlefield, and chipping it with hazard damage will make it harder for it to safely enter, especially if Latias uses Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack. Although this Latias set has significant defensive investment, it will still be checked handily by Tyranitar via its powerful Crunch and Pursuit. Try to be somewhat conservative with Dragon Pulse's PP if you think you will need to enter a Calm Mind war later on. If you opt for Refresh, try to avoid paralysis, but feel free to stay in on moves like Toxic from Zapdos and Heatran. Use Recover throughout the battle to stay healthy so Latias can better utilize Calm Mind without the threat of being KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With Roar, Latias will love additional entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Skarmory and Nidoqueen have excellent defensive synergy with Latias, and they can lay down their respective entry hazards for Latias to take advantage of. Blissey and Clefable also pair great defensively with Latias, and they can slow down opposing threats with Thunder Wave; Clefable can also use Knock Off to remove a foe's item, adding on to chip damage from entry hazards. Magnezone can be used to trap Steel-types like Bronzong and Choice Scarf Jirachi, which will also give Latias trouble. Rotom-A can be used to block Rapid Spin from Starmie or Forretress and can potentially bait in Tyranitar and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can revenge kill setup sweepers like offensive Calm Mind Suicune and Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados. Heatran can thwart Scizor's attempt to damage Latias with Bullet Punch and set up Stealth Rock or cripple an opposing wall or Tyranitar with Toxic, which it does extremely effectively because its Fire-type attacks usually scare off opposing Steel-types. Roar variants can also take advantage of Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside Latias, which assists in chipping Latias's checks.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + 2 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind + 2 Attacks Latias opts for an additional attacking move to give it better coverage. Calm Mind will boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, which makes it significantly harder for special attackers to take down with their super effective attacks. Dragon Pulse is recommended as the overall more consistent Dragon-type STAB attack, but Draco Meteor can be used for more immediate power to break threats like Rotom-A and Starmie. Draco Meteor has lower PP, however, and will require additional Calm Mind usage to compensate for the Special Attack drop.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is recommended to super effectively hit Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, Skarmory, and Metagross for large chunks of damage after Calm Mind has been used, but Surf is a nice alternative for overall better coverage and super effective damage against Heatran. Recover keeps Latias healthy via instant healing and allows it to maximize its effectiveness as a Calm Mind user.</p> <p>An alternate set with Thunderbolt + Ice Beam as attacking moves is also quite strong. BoltBeam coverage targets threats like Skarmory, Starmie, Gyarados, Gliscor, Dragon-types, and additional Water-types like Suicune and Milotic super effectively, which can be terrifying on the proper team. This set usually requires a bit more support, as it will not have as much power without a Dragon-type STAB attack, and it will be worse versus other Steel-types that are more likely to come in like Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Calm Mind + 2 Attacks Latias opts for maximum HP investment for overall bulk while maximizing Speed with a Timid nature to take advantage of its additional coverage and outspeed threats like Jirachi and Heatran. It can also drop its Speed investment to 176 Speed EVs to outspeed mixed Flygon. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and to offset sand damage, but Colbur Berry is a great alternative to take one Dark-type attack from Tyranitar or even a boosted Pursuit on the switch, which alleviates the pressure that Tyranitar puts on Latias only once.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to conceal the coverage move of choice when using this Latias, because it won't be expected, and you can consistently bait in Steel-type foes. If holding a Colbur Berry, you can bluff a Choice item and conceal Latias's identity as a Calm Mind sweeper. Alternate between Calm Mind and Recover to gradually boost Latias's stats while keeping it healthy. Try to use Calm Mind at least once, if opting for Draco Meteor, before you unleash an attack. If using a Colbur Berry and you predict a Pursuit from Tyranitar, you can use the switch to send a Pokemon in unscathed, but this can be risky. If using Surf, try to use it on a predicted Tyranitar switch to burn its Passho Berry or deal a decent chunk of damage, which can allow more comfort in potentially winning the one-on-one matchup with your Colbur Berry still intact. Use Calm Mind throughout the battle if holding Leftovers to consistently put pressure on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory does an effective job at providing entry hazards for Latias to take advantage of, and it has nice defensive synergy with Latias with its ability to enter on Dark-, Dragon-, and Bug-type attacks aimed at Latias, while Latias comes in on Fire- and Electric-type attacks with ease. Tyranitar can deal with Choice Scarf Rotom-A and even trap it with Pursuit. Ground-immune Pokemon like Bronzong and Gliscor can do quite well versus Choice Scarf Flygon, which threatens to revenge kill Latias. Abomasnow provides coverage versus bulky Water-types like Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune, and it summons hail to negate passive Leftovers recovery from Steel-types, which will assist Latias in chipping them down with Hidden Power Fire or Surf. Zapdos also does a nice job at pressuring bulky Water-types and is a great answer to Flygon. Heatran can threaten Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type moves and has nice defensive synergy with Latias; Toxic variants can help cripple bulky Water-types and other bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon and opposing Latias.</p>"
      },
      "Expert Belt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Expert Belt allows Latias to bait in common checks, switch between its attacks, and use Grass Knot to take a huge chunk out of threats like the prevalent Swampert and the heavy Tyranitar. Draco Meteor is Latias's strongest attack, but it can be replaced with Dragon Pulse to give Latias more staying power. Draco Meteor, however, will be more effective versus Pokemon like Rotom-A, Celebi, and even more uncommon threats like Weavile.</p> <p>Grass Knot is what makes Expert Belt a unique set because Choice item sets don't have the room to properly accommodate the move. Grass Knot will do significantly more damage to Tyranitar and also accounts for the common possibility of Passho Berry, which will heavily reduce Surf's damage output once. With some chip damage, Latias can even use two Grass Knots—one as Tyranitar comes in—to take out Tyranitar on its own. Swampert can usually take one of Latias's attacks, but Grass Knot will destroy it. Grass Knot is also helpful for bulky Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, and Starmie.</p> <p>Surf goes incredibly well with Latias's Dragon-type STAB attack, and it's the best practical weapon versus Heatran, Infernape, and Gliscor. Water- and Dragon-type coverage is resisted only by Empoleon, which further supports Surf as a potent offensive option.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a nasty surprise to catch Scizor on the switch, and it also deals significant damage to other Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, Lucario, Metagross, and Bronzong. Sleep Talk can be used over Hidden Power Fire to make Latias a sleep absorber that can use Sleep Talk more than once, but missing out on the additional coverage to hit Steel-types is unfortunate and fails to maximize Expert Belt Latias's effectiveness.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make this offensive Latias as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is used so that it outspeeds crucial threats like Jirachi, Shaymin, Infernape, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, all of which Latias hits super effectively. Expert Belt takes advantage of the immaculate coverage from this four attack set and boosts damage for each super effective hit. Note that by opting for Hidden Power Fire, Latias will not Speed tie with Gengar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to conceal Latias's moves for as long as possible. Use Expert Belt to your advantage to bluff a Choice item. This Latias isn't as afraid of Tyranitar as Choice item variants because it can sting Tyranitar harder with Grass Knot, effectively wearing it down. Like touched on before, Latias can even come out on top if it catches Tyranitar switching in with Grass Knot, especially with Stealth Rock support wearing Tyranitar down each time it enters. By bluffing a Choice item, Latias will be able to more consistently remove threats like Scizor and heavily damage foes like Heatran, Jirachi, Metagross, Bronzong, Magnezone, and Tyranitar with powerful, super effective moves. Use Latias's great typing to your advantage by pivoting it into the many attacks it resists. This Latias can especially take advantage of bad locks like Earthquake from Choice Scarf Flygon and Thunderbolt from Choice Scarf Rotom-A with its incredible coverage, staying power, and ability to alternate between super effective moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Expert Belt Latias misses out on hitting a few Pokemon super effectively: Empoleon, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Rotom-A. Even though Latias can still do quite decently versus all these Pokemon, a little bit of extra support will assist it in wearing these threats down. Strong Electric-type attacks from Magnezone, Zapdos, and your own Rotom-A will do well versus all four of these Pokemon; your own Rotom-A in particular will appreciate Expert Belt Latias's ability to bait in and sting opposing Tyranitar with Grass Knot. Tyranitar's support is appreciated for removing threats like fast offensive Starmie and revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-A or even sometimes a Choice Scarf Flygon locked into the wrong move, which all give Latias trouble. Magnezone can assist in wearing down Jirachi and can even trap Bronzong, which Latias will appreciate even with its Hidden Power Fire. Lucario makes for a potent teammate that takes huge advantage of Latias's great coverage. Hidden Power Fire will wear down Jirachi and Choice Scarf Metagross, which both outspeed Lucario and resist its priority moves. Metagross appreciates Latias wearing down bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic through its Grass Knot, and the Electric-types that go well with Latias also make for great Metagross support. Overall, Expert Belt Latias is more of a team supporter than a Pokemon that requires support from its other teammates. It fits well with almost every Pokemon in the metagame.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Life Orb Latias takes a different approach as an offensive variant and seeks to use its nice coverage and Recover to be a longer-lasting sweeper capable of destroying an opposing team with its powerful Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor, which it uses to hit everything as hard as possible.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire with Life Orb will assist in wearing down Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, Magnezone, and Bronzong, and it denies momentum from Scizor by baiting it in and removing it in one hit. Alternatively, Thunder Wave is a solid option to paralyze Steel-types, notably Jirachi, that come in to take Draco Meteor, which will further assist in stunting offense. Healing Wish is another creative option that can be used in a pinch if Latias is low on HP and there isn't a reliable way to recover its health.</p> <p>Surf is a given, forming near-perfect coverage with Latias's powerful Dragon-type STAB Draco Meteor and devastating Heatran, Infernape, and Gliscor. Because this Latias may not opt for another attacking move alongside Draco Meteor, Surf is even more important.</p> <p>Recover directly supports Life Orb Latias by allowing it to have more staying power and to survive as long as possible, making it a more oppressive presence for offensive teams to overcome. As it loses HP each time it uses an attack via Life Orb, and likely even more from sand damage, Recover can be used in a pinch to compensate for this set's health loss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make this Latias as fast and as powerful as possible. Life Orb is used as more of a general powerup for each attack, and the recoil is offset by Recover. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed threats like Jirachi, Shaymin, Infernape, and non-Choice Scarf Flygon, but a Modest nature can be used if your team has these threats sufficiently covered, which will boost Latias's power to a new level and allow it to do significantly more damage to offensive variants of Pokemon like Jirachi, Bronzong, and Tyranitar. Note that when using Hidden Power Fire, Latias will not Speed tie with Gengar; however, by opting for Thunder Wave or even Healing Wish, it can maintain its ability to Speed tie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even with Life Orb, Passho Berry Tyranitar still needs to be played around, so use double switching to your advantage to keep Latias safe. If Latias sustains chip damage, try to scout out opposing movesets to plan opportunities to come in and heal up with Recover. You can also use Recover to scout Choice item Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran and, though this is much riskier, even Choice Band Swampert if you predict it to not use Ice Punch. If using Thunder Wave, wait until Jirachi enters the field, and make sure it's not holding a Choice Scarf before you attempt to cripple it. If you opt for Hidden Power Fire instead, however, you can try to nail Jirachi on the predicted switch if you're sure a Tyranitar won't switch in. Use Healing Wish in a pinch if you determine that it would be more beneficial to restore a teammate's health than attempt to preserve or heal Latias, but beware that the incoming teammate has to survive Stealth Rock damage first and will also potentially sustain damage from an enemy attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Latias requires a bit more support and wants to stay around for as long as possible, so it especially appreciates support to deal with Tyranitar, which is easily its largest threat. Magnezone can assist Life Orb Latias by removing Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor like Bronzong, some variants of Metagross, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Skarmory. A Skarmory of your own can lay down Spikes to support Latias as well as provide more insurance versus threats like Choice Band and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as well as Scizor, making it a strong teammate. Your own Jirachi can also force Scizor out with the threat of Fire Punch and can serve as a Lucario check if it's a faster variant. Jirachi also serves as a nice pivot versus opposing Latias, and specially defensive variants can deal with threats like Gengar, Starmie, and Rotom-A as well. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can effectively trap and remove Gengar, Starmie, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, which can all threaten Life Orb Latias by outspeeding it and dealing massive damage with their super effective attacks.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi is arguably the best Pokemon in DPP OU. Jirachi's fantastic typing, great movepool, and excellent stats give it limitless versatility. Jirachi is the fastest defensive Steel-type; it has the bulk, Speed, recovery, and resistances such as a crucial one to Dragon and an immunity to Toxic to fulfill almost any defensive role. However, the main source of Jirachi's prowess in DPP OU is STAB Iron Head and its 60% flinch chance due to Serene Grace. Chaining Iron Head flinches can slowly wear down even bulky foes in conjunction with sand and Knock Off while passively healing Jirachi with Leftovers. Combine this with many ways to paralyze the foe such as Body Slam, Thunder, and Thunder Wave to facilitate paraflinching, and Jirachi becomes one of the central threats in the tier all teams must be aware of.</p> <p>Physical Jirachi can run a dizzying amount of viable EV spreads to take advantage of this, from focusing on HP and Speed as a fantastic utility Pokemon with options such as Stealth Rock and Substitute, fully investing in its defenses to be perhaps the best general wall in the tier with Wish and Protect, or being a great cleaner or Choice Scarf user with Attack and Speed investment and options such as Fire Punch, Ice Punch, U-turn, and Trick. Serene Grace also helps with coverage moves, as Jirachi has passive opportunities to get devastating burns and freezes from Fire Punch and Ice Punch that can bail it out of tough situations.</p> <p>Jirachi also is one of the best special and mixed threats in the tier with access to Calm Mind and its great special movepool. Jirachi can customize its coverage and utility moves to handle most threats in the tier: Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, Hidden Power Ground, Psychic, and Hidden Power Fire are all options to take on foes such as Skarmory, Swampert, Hippowdon, Heatran, Magnezone, Gengar, and Scizor that can cause problems for physical Jirachi. Even with Calm Mind or an otherwise fully special moveset, Jirachi can use Iron Head to create free turns, 2HKO Tyranitar, and 4HKO specially defensive Clefable. Jirachi can also lean into its support movepool with options such as Wish, Refresh, and Substitute or even different items like Shuca Berry, Lum Berry, and Occa Berry to make its Calm Mind sets more devastating.</p> <p>Jirachi has an enormous influence on the DPP OU metagame, such as being one of the best switch-ins to Choice Specs Latias while also handling all three major Dragon Dance Pokemon in Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar with a simple Wish + Protect set. Jirachi is almost singled-handedly responsible for making bulkier threats resistant to Steel such as Heatran, Swampert, and Metagross more often use Leftovers, as without it, Jirachi can eventually beat them with Iron Head and its coverage moves. Jirachi can even stop Magnezone trying to trap it by either OHKOing it with Hidden Power Ground, outdamaging it with Fire Punch, or PP stalling it out of Thunderbolt with Wish and Protect. Jirachi is also a potent stallbreaker with Iron Head, as, if Skarmory or other bulky Steel-resistant foes are incapacitated with a burn or KOed, few Pokemon on defensive teams enjoy taking it on with entry hazards up.</p> <p>Jirachi primarily fears two things: strong attackers such as Heatran and Swampert that can break through its defenses and status if it isn't running Refresh. Physical Jirachi sets struggle to beat bulky Steel-resistant foes that have Leftovers, such as Heatran, Swampert, Suicune, Magnezone, Zapdos, Bronzong, Metagross, and Empoleon. Bulky Steel-types such as Heatran, Empoleon, Magnezone, Bronzong, and Metagross are particularly effective against Jirachi, as their bulk allows them to potentially outheal Iron Head with Leftovers, while Zapdos and Suicune are especially dangerous due Pressure depleting Iron Head PP. Gyarados, Swampert, and Hippowdon all can take multiple hits from physical Jirachi and hit it hard in return. Ghost-types are also annoying to Jirachi, as it can't paralyze them if it has Body Slam. Both Gengar and Rotom-A can burn Jirachi; Gengar also naturally outspeeds it, and Rotom-A is resistant to Iron Head and very bulky. Special Jirachi struggles with Roar Latias, Blissey, Tyranitar, and Encore Clefable, as it doesn't have the proper coverage or power to break through them, especially if it doesn't have Iron Head. Without Refresh or Heal Bell support, Jirachi is ruined by status. Paralysis from foes such as Magnezone, Azelf, or opposing Jirachi both makes it hard to cause other Pokemon to flinch and potentially prevents it from using Wish, while burn completely ruins its ability to do damage and slowly wears it down. While defensive Jirachi is really bulky, it can be broken down by very strong attacks such as Breloom's Focus Punch and mixed Dragonite's Fire Blast, especially with Spikes support. Jirachi can theoretically deal with all of these threats with its huge movepool and versatile stats; however, it is limited to four moveslots and can't handle everything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi's options are nigh limitless, and it is able to make use of most of its movepool. A set consisting of Substitute, Calm Mind, Psychic and Thunderbolt with maximized HP and Speed EVs used to see use on teams based around Toxic Spikes. However, the prominence of Thunder Wave + Roar Latias, Encore Clefable, and Toxic Spikes-immune Pokemon have made this set somewhat obsolete. Jirachi has a lot of options to support its team: most notably, any support set is free to run Healing Wish to bring a wounded teammate back to full health. Similarly, Jirachi makes for a great support on teams built around moves such as Rain Dance, Trick Room, or Gravity. With a set of Iron Head, U-turn, and two supporting options to chose from, Jirachi is able to pivot into opposing Draco Meteor and Outrage and regain momentum for its team. Rain Dance in particular is a great option, as Jirachi can punish Tyranitar trying to come in and cancel rain. A Choice Band set can work due to its obscurity, hitting Psychic-types such as Starmie, Latias and Celebi hard with U-turn. However, not being able to switch moves on such a versatile pokemon is often detrimental. Instead of paralysis, Jirachi can also build around Toxic, as flinching alongside poison wears down foes such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Zapdos, Suicune, and Gliscor much faster. An example set is Toxic, Substitute, Iron Head, and Fire Punch with HP and Speed investment, but it needs help with bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Metagross. Jirachi is also free to use Rest and Sleep Talk instead of Wish and Protect on defensive sets alongside Iron Head and either Body Slam or Fire Punch. This heals status, helps absorb Breloom's Spore, and gives Jirachi a lot more PP. Zen Headbutt hits Steel-resistant foes such as Rotom-A and Water-types, but it suffers from a middling 90% accuracy, a lower flinch rate of 40%, and overall poor synergistic coverage alongside Iron Head. Jirachi could theoretically run a mid-game dual screens set, but there are better suited Pokemon for this role. Jirachi also has access to Doom Desire, Water Pulse, and Ancient Power; however, these options are almost never worth the moveslot. Doom Desire suffers from a subpar 85% accuracy and a two-turn delay, while Water Pulse and Ancient Power are too weak to make their unreliable secondary effects appealing. Jirachi could try to use Cosmic Power to gain impenetrable bulk and Charge Beam to increase its Special Attack with Serene Grace. However, these options require Jirachi to sit passively on the field for too many turns to be effective, leaving it susceptible to critical hits, Trick, phazing, and opposing setup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jirachi is one of the key threats to deal with in DPP OU, and is typically checked throughout the game with multiple Pokemon. It is so threatening that even teams with multiple checks can still be soft against it; physical sets are often one freeze or burn away from breaking through bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon with Iron Head, while special sets and mixed sets take advantage of these Pokemon with super effective coverage. Keep note that while Jirachi can theoretically deal with all of its checks with the appropriate move or EV spreads, it can only carry four moves and its unboosted moves typically don't OHKO foes.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Jirachi is reliant on its Speed and gradual damage to beat its foe. Without Refresh, Heal Bell support, or Rest, Thunder Wave from Magnezone, opposing Jirachi, Clefable, Azelf, and Latias prevents Jirachi from taking advantage of Iron Head flinches. Burns from Will-O-Wisp Gengar and Rotom-A also put a dent in physical versions of Jirachi by reducing Iron Head damage and canceling Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Leftovers Heatran is perhaps the best Jirachi counter in the tier. Heatran 4x resists Iron Head so that Leftovers outheals it, can outspeed defensive sets, and OHKOes it with Fire-type attacks. Other Fire-types threaten Jirachi in different ways: faster ones such as Infernape can OHKO Jirachi with a boosting item and will almost always force it out, while slower ones such as Camerupt can survive multiple attacks from both special and physical Jirachi and 2HKO it in return. Note that Jirachi can beat all of these Pokemon; Heatran without a Shuca Berry is OHKOed by +1 Hidden Power Ground after Stealth Rock without heavy Special Defense investment, while non-Leftovers sets can be statused and worn down over the course of the game. Infernape and Camerupt fare similarly; as neither of these Pokemon punish Jirachi for using Iron Head, it can switch out and try to take them on once they are paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While most Ground-types don't resist Iron Head and do not like paralysis or super effective coverage moves such as Ice Punch and Grass Knot, they are often bulky enough to take several hits, forcing Jirachi to get lucky lest it be 2HKOed. Swampert, Hippowdon, Flygon, Gliscor, and Nidoqueen can all take a few hits and retaliate with Earthquake. While it is often outsped and 2HKOed by Iron Head, Mamoswine is prominent for being the only one of these that can OHKO physically defensive Jirachi with a Choice Band Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Metagross, Magnezone, Skarmory, Empoleon, and Bronzong are all bulky enough to at least scout Jirachi's set as they resist Iron Head. Metagross is perhaps the best overall check to Jirachi, as Jirachi cannot 2HKO it without a Calm Mind boost, it 2HKOes all but the most physically defensive Jirachi sets with Earthquake, either Tricks Jirachi an Iron Ball to shut Jirachi down or sets up on Jirachi with Agility and a Lum Berry. Leftovers Magnezone is another excellent  answer if Jirachi lacks Hidden Power Ground, Fire Punch, or U-turn, as it can heal off Iron Head damage, paralyze Jirachi, and eventually set up on or beat it. Skarmory can survive any unboosted attack Jirachi throws at it and set up Spikes. While it can't 2HKO physically defensive Jirachi, Bronzong is a fantastic check, as it even can heal off a Fire Punch burn so it can PP stall Jirachi. Empoleon is another excellent answer, as it 4x resists Iron Head and can hit it hard in return. Note that none of these Pokemon like getting burned by Fire Punch if they don't have a Lum Berry or RestTalk, which neuters their offenses and makes them vulnerable to being flinched down by Iron Head, as none of them outspeed Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gyarados, Quagsire, Milotic, Suicune, and Starmie all resist Iron Head and can take multiple attacks from physical Jirachi. Note that sand + Iron Head can eventually wear most Water-types besides Quagsire and Swampert down, and they are also particularly vulnerable to Jirachi's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Other Sturdy Steel resists</strong>: Among those not already mentioned, Zapdos and Suicune are particularly strong against Jirachi, as they have Pressure to further waste Iron Head PP. Both do not enjoy being paralyzed or worn down by sandstorm damage. Rotom-A is another good choice, as mixed sets struggle to hit it hard without Psychic, while, if Jirachi fails to flinch it, it will often burn it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special sets and mixed sets without Iron Head will often struggle against Blissey, Encore Clefable, Tyranitar, defensive Celebi, and Roar Latias. These Pokemon either take negligible damage from Jirachi's boosted options and can status it or disable it via phazing or Encore. None of these Pokemon besides Tyranitar enjoy being hit by Trick or most of Jirachi's physical moves, while Tyranitar is always afraid of Iron Head.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi provides excellent utility with just Iron Head, allowing it to use a diverse array of support moves. Body Slam is not very strong, but it offers a 60% chance to paralyze and can crucially paralyze Ground-types. Paralysis gives foes only a 30% chance to hit through Iron Head and helps incapacitate faster Pokemon trying to set up on Jirachi, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Agility Empoleon. Body Slam also outdamages Iron Head against foes such as Swampert, Starmie, Zapdos, and Infernape, allowing Jirachi to finish them off at low health. Thunder is another option, as despite only having a 42% chance to paralyze foes factoring in accuracy and Serene Grace, it hits Ghost-types, OHKOes Gyarados after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes Starmie and Skarmory. Thunder Wave gives Jirachi a 100% chance to paralyze foes but does not do damage, making it vulnerable to Taunt and Substitute.</p> <p>Fire Punch gives Jirachi coverage against Steel-types such as opposing Jirachi, Magnezone, Skarmory, Scizor, Bronzong, and Metagross. The 20% burn chance not only lets Jirachi wear down targets quicker with Iron Head but also helps it survive various Ground-type attacks from Metagross and Bronzong. Another option is U-turn, as it makes Jirachi an excellent pivot, as well as allowing it to escape Magnezone. When paired with Wish, Jirachi can survive the hit from faster Pokemon so that the teammate receiving the Wish switches in unscathed.</p> <p>Protect helps Jirachi passively heal itself and scouts the foe. Jirachi can often heal a lot of HP by alternating between causing the foe to flinch with Iron Head and using Protect. Another option is Stealth Rock, as Jirachi can set it up against many different Pokemon while fending off spinners such as Starmie and Forretress with the threat of status or super effective coverage. Jirachi can maximize its ability to take advantage of paralysis with Substitute. Substitute blocks status, Knock Off, and weaker attacks, forcing the foe to try to hit through paralysis and Iron Head flinching multiple times to beat Jirachi. Jirachi can often passively heal the HP needed to make a Substitute with Iron Head and paralysis. Note that Jirachi only needs Iron Head to be effective and can mix and match these moves effectively, such as forgoing the status move to set up Stealth Rock and having U-turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With three attacks and a utility move, Jirachi can use numerous EV spreads; this EV spread has maximum HP, has enough Speed EVs to outspeed Lucario and Roserade, and has enough Attack EVs to KO Lucario at -1 Defense after one round of Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage 75% of the time. Jirachi needs 156 Attack EVs to KO Lucario after Life Orb recoil at -1 Defense outright. Even with Thunder, Jirachi should run a hindering Special Attack nature, as it is still strong enough against Gyarados, Skarmory, and Starmie. 252 HP EVs give Jirachi a 101-HP Substitute unbroken by one Seismic Toss and great general bulk. Should Lucario not be as important, Jirachi can also run maximum Speed EVs with a spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe to at least Speed tie with Flygon, opposing Jirachi, and Zapdos; more Attack EVs to power up Fire Punch and Iron Head; and more bulk to better pass Wish with U-turn.</p> <p>If Jirachi has Fire Punch, it should use at least 176 Speed EVs with a neutral nature to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran. Some example EV spreads Jirachi can use include 252 HP / 80 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature and 252 HP / 108 Atk / 148 Spe with a Jolly nature. These EV spreads do more damage to Magnezone and opposing Jirachi with Fire Punch and require fewer Iron Head flinches to break through foes. With Wish, Jirachi is free to invest more in its bulk. Some example EV spreads that outspeed Tyranitar include 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe with an Impish nature and 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe with a Careful nature. Jirachi can also minimize its Speed to take the hit before Wish passing via U-turn with an EV spread of 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 SpD with an Impish or Relaxed nature and potentially fewer than 31 Speed IVs. Beware that lowering Speed makes it harder to cause foes to flinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi should lead or switch in on a target it threatens, such as Tyranitar or offensive Latias, and start spreading paralysis or set up Stealth Rock if it has it. The main exception is if Jirachi has Fire Punch and would rather burn the foe, such as against Skarmory, Bronzong, and Metagross. Once Jirachi has statused its checks, it should typically switch out and come in again on the many foes it threatens. Once the check is in again and statused, Jirachi can then start wearing it down with Iron Head, Stealth Rock, and its coverage moves. This is a highly effective strategy; Jirachi is naturally fast and quite bulky, so it takes multiple hits through Iron Head and paralysis to beat. While Jirachi can chain many flinches to take down almost any foe, such as offensive Heatran and Swampert, only try to do this in desperate situations, as not getting the flinch can lead to Jirachi getting KOed much earlier than it should have. With Protect, don't allow foes to take advantage with setup by being too predictable with it.</p> <p>With Wish and U-turn, Jirachi can pass Wish, but be careful to keep its health high enough, as it will often take a hit doing so and doesn't have Protect to back it up. U-turn can also be effective as an early-game pivot. Jirachi can get Stealth Rock up against almost any foe, but be careful, as it can take a lot of damage doing so. Note that Thunder is often unexpected from Jirachi, so it can get a lot of damage against Gyarados and Skarmory in particular. Especially without recovery or a Lum Berry, Jirachi should try to avoid status at all costs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Utility Jirachi is a valuable partner for a lot of offensive teams without Spikes that love support against Lucario and Choice Specs Latias, appreciate status, and potentially need a Stealth Rock user. For this reason, one of its most common partners is Tyranitar, as all sets enjoy additional backup against Latias and appreciate a stopgap against Lucario as well as speed control. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also helps with Gengar, as Jirachi does not like dealing with Gengar potentially burning it or overwhelming it with Life Orb-boosted attacks, while Choice Band Tyranitar appreciates the paralysis support and Jirachi potentially getting it in with U-turn. Sand also helps wear down checks like Zapdos and Suicune more effectively. Jirachi, particularly with Substitute, also is a premier Pokemon on more offensive paralysis teams; it enjoys teammates such as Azelf, Machamp, offensive or Swords Dance Breloom, and Thunder Wave + Dragon Dance Gyarados that can potentially help spread paralysis and take advantage of the foes Jirachi wears down. Azelf's Explosion can potentially both give Jirachi a chance to start spreading status and weaken a Steel-type check such as Heatran or Metagross. Breloom and Machamp have similar checks to Jirachi, so if they defeat or heavily weaken Skarmory, Gyarados, or Metagross, Jirachi can clean up the rest. Gyarados is also an effective teammate, as it has great type synergy with Jirachi's weakness while also opening up holes with either a Choice Band or Dragon Dance set. While Jirachi can be effective if it is lucky against defensive teams, it does enjoy some additional assistance against them. Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Heatran are fantastic, while Infernape can potentially join Breloom as a dual Fighting-type core. Offensive Starmie sets can potentially get rid of the entry hazards that Jirachi can often let up trying to burn Skarmory. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Gengar, Choice item Latias, Zapdos, and mixed Flygon are great options alongside Jirachi, as they can pivot nicely into predicted Earthquakes and hit hard in return. Additionally, each of them can force substantial damage on Heatran, paving the way for an Iron Head sweep later.</p> <p>As Jirachi can be weak to setup sweepers with a Lum Berry, it does appreciate an additional backstop to them, such as Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Latias. While Jirachi does appreciate Magnezone support, it is more commonly paired with Choice Scarf Magneton due to the role compression Jirachi provides as a Stealth Rock user and the fact Magneton helps against neutral nature Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Jirachi is also particularly effective alongside Knock Off support, as removing Leftovers makes Iron Head highly effective in wearing down foes that resist Iron Head. Partners such as specially defensive Empoleon and Clefable can work. Additionally, Trick + Iron Ball Metagross can remove Leftovers from mutual checks like Skarmory and Zapdos so that Jirachi can break through them.</p>"
      },
      "Wish + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi can pair Wish with Protect to get reliable recovery. While it loses a moveslot, it becomes a fantastic wall, as few foes can 2HKO it. With Wish, it also becomes excellent at healing its teammates. Jirachi can easily heal itself, so it is not forced to receive the Wish to stay healthy and can switch to a teammate.</p> <p>Iron Head makes Jirachi oppressive to deal with, as it can help Jirachi receive Wish by causing the foe to flinch on the turn after it uses Wish. Jirachi has a lot more longevity with Wish and Protect, so it can slowly wear down its answers over the course of the game so that it only needs a few Iron Head flinches to break through. It also allows it to remain threatening without any Attack EVs, 2HKOing Tyranitar without bulk investment and often at least 4HKOing slower foes neutral to it such as Machamp, most Breloom, and specially defensive Clefable. U-turn is also another option to maximize its ability to pass Wish and to escape Magnezone trying to trap it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Jirachi has two possible approaches: physically defensive and specially defensive. Physically defensive with the spread given is preferred, as Jirachi can avoid the 2HKO from an unboosted Earthquake from foes such as Metagross, Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Bronzong. This makes Jirachi extraordinarily difficult to KO without a boosted Earthquake or strong super effective Fire-type coverage. The Speed EVs given outspeed Tyranitar. Jirachi can spare some Defense EVs for some additional Special Defense EVs to take attacks such as Gengar's Life Orb Shadow Ball more easily. An example EV spread would be 252 HP / 164 Def / 60 SpD / 32 Spe that avoids the 2HKO from Empoleon's Hydro Pump and can survive attacks such as Infernape's unboosted Fire Blast and mixed Dragonite's Fire Blast after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Another option is to fully invest in Jirachi's Special Defense with an EV spread of 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe. This makes Jirachi remarkably specially bulky, easily surviving attacks such as Kingdra's Choice Specs Hydro Pump in the rain, Heatran's unboosted Fire Blast, and Suicune's boosted Hydro Pump. The spread also is more effective at absorbing resisted attacks such as Latias's Choice Specs Draco Meteor and mixed Dragonite's Draco Meteor. This spread prevents Jirachi from taking on Dragon Dance sweepers as easily but lets it spread paralysis to offensive Suicune and rain sweepers like Kingdra and Ludicolo well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>There are two strategies for playing Jirachi; the first involves using it as an early-game option to spread paralysis as a lead, while the second entails keeping it hidden as either a potential wincon or a backup wall against almost any threat in the tier. If played early, Jirachi should be careful against Magnezone. Without U-turn, Jirachi gets PP stalled and defeated by Leftovers Magnezone, while Choice Scarf Magnezone wins most of the time through Thunderbolt eventually paralyzing it and getting multiple full paralysis turns, critical hits, or PP stalling Jirachi's recovery moves. Once in, Jirachi should aim to paralyze as much of the opposing team as it can while keeping itself healthy with Wish and Protect. Do not be afraid to trade lots of HP for status on a crucial threat—Jirachi has a remarkable ability to passively heal after taking a huge hit and eventually end up healthy, such as against Machamp's Dynamic Punch, Infernape's unboosted Fire Blast, and Gyarados's +1 Earthquake. Jirachi should try to stay away from entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Forretress, bulky Substitute users such as opposing Jirachi, and status moves such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Jirachi can be an excellent cleaner against frailer, paralyzed teams once Steel-resistant foes are eliminated, despite its defensively leaning stats. With bulkier teams, be prepared to play the long game and conserve Iron Head PP. Don't be too overzealous to wear down threats through flinching such as Swampert and Heatran unless it's absolutely needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish + Protect Jirachi is perhaps the gatekeeper of DPP OU; it just sits on teams that cannot deal with it, so teammates should be able to help Jirachi with its answers such as Skarmory, Heatran, Metagross, Empoleon, and Swampert. The most common archetypes it is used on are alongside Magnezone on bulkier trap teams, a general wall on more defensive teams, and on paralysis-spamming defensive teams built around defensive Zapdos and Blissey or Clefable. If used alongside Blissey or Clefable, Heal Bell is highly valuable, as it can help Jirachi stave off status. Choice Scarf Magnezone or Magneton is one of Wish + Protect Jirachi's best partners, as it removes Skarmory without Shed Shell with certainty, provides speed control against dangerous foes like Gengar and Infernape, and can potentially trap weakened Steel-types that can threaten Jirachi such as Heatran, Lucario, and opposing Jirachi. Jirachi also is prominent on the Magnezone bait style, where Skarmory is used as a sacrifice for the opposing Magnezone so one's own Magnezone traps the other one with Hidden Power Ground, freeing up Jirachi from being trapped or statused. Skarmory's Spikes are suffocating alongside Jirachi, as most of its checks are either Spikes vulnerable or weak to Stealth Rock. Other Pokemon common on this style are partners that can keep up entry hazards, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and defensive Rotom-A; bulky teammates that can handle Heatran such as defensive Latias, Milotic, and Clefable; and a bulky late-game sweeper such as Swords Dance + Roost Gliscor, Calm Mind Clefable, or Curse Quagsire.</p> <p>Jirachi is also a mainstay on defensive teams as a general wall and Wish passer. Some strong teammates include Hippowdon, RestTalk Gyarados, Skarmory, defensive Latias, defensive Celebi, Gliscor, Clefable, and Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune. These Pokemon help shore Jirachi up against Ground- and Fire-types while also appreciating the support Jirachi gives against Dragon-types and Dragon Dance sweepers as well as potential Wish passes to keep them healthy. Forretress is especially synergetic, as Jirachi absorbs its defensive responsibilities, so it can focus on using Rapid Spin and setting up entry hazards without being the only Dragon-resistant Pokemon. Other Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Donphan are also effective. Jirachi is especially devastating with Knock Off from Clefable and hazard support, so using it on this style of team can easily set it up to potentially sweep.</p> <p>Jirachi also features prominently on more defensive paralysis-based teams built around Starmie, defensive Zapdos, Blissey or Clefable, and Breloom. All of these are synergetic partners; Starmie helps spread paralysis, answer Fire-types such as Heatran and Infernape, and can use Rapid Spin to remove Spikes. Zapdos provides additional backup against Pokemon Jirachi doesn't enjoy facing, such as Lum Berry sweepers and powerful Fighting-types such as Machamp and Breloom. Blissey is extremely bulky and can absorb Heatran's attacks, while Clefable helps spread Knock Off and also can assist against strong special coverage. Both offensive Breloom, especially with Swords Dance, and defensive Breloom enjoy paralysis support, take on Ground-types, and are potent stallbreakers for Jirachi. Some other common partners include Machamp, Substitute + Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Bold Clefable should one use Blissey. Magnezone is also a valuable teammate on these styles, and it can assist with teammates such as Swampert, Rhyperior, Choice Band Tyranitar, and even uncommon choices such as Shaymin and Registeel.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi's Iron Head is an excellent tool to sweep with—with full Attack investment and maximum Speed, it only needs a few flinches to beat down even Pokemon relatively resistant to Jirachi like Flygon and Gliscor as well as now 3HKOing Clefable and other fairly bulky threats such as Machamp. Iron Head also makes up for Jirachi's lack of a physical boosting move. Like Iron Head, the additional investment helps Jirachi 3HKO frail attackers such as offensive Starmie and Infernape. Fire Punch 2HKOes Scizor and Magnezone without bulk investment if either hit burns them and 3HKOes maximum HP Jirachi, Bronzong, specially defensive Skarmory, and Metagross after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Protect maximizes Jirachi's longevity, as alternating them to restore HP helps make up for its lack of bulk. However, Refresh is a fantastic option to stave off status.  Refresh also helps Jirachi spread status to opposing defensive Jirachi, as it can fish for burns and then heal off paralysis with Refresh. Jirachi can forgo the utility move for additional coverage such as Ice Punch and Grass Knot. Ice Punch is another great option to maximize its coverage and give it a 20% chance to freeze the foe. It OHKOes Dragonite and Flygon after Stealth Rock and is Jirachi's best option against Gliscor, Zapdos, and Latias. Jirachi can also run Grass Knot in the last spot, as it 2HKOes Swampert even with a hindering Special Attack nature.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple EV spread of 252 Attack / 252 Speed with a Jolly nature helps maximize the damage of Jirachi's Iron Head and its coverage moves. Jirachi should always maximize Speed EVs to at least Speed tie with Flygon, Jirachi, and Zapdos, but it can spare some Attack EVs to run bulk, such as 48 HP / 208 Atk / 252 Spe that hits a Leftovers number.</p> <p>While Leftovers is the most common option, Jirachi can also use a Lum Berry. Lum Berry helps Jirachi switch into Breloom, spread paralysis to other Jirachi, and combat Gengar more easily on more aggressive teams that can struggle with these Pokemon. Jirachi can use some other items, such as Iron Plate to power up Iron Head and Salac Berry paired with Substitute to take advantage of its additional coverage. All of these items help bluff a Choice Scarf set or otherwise don't hold Leftovers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi can come in earlier in the game to spread status, as getting a burn on Skarmory, Metagross, or opposing Jirachi can immediately open up the game. Otherwise, Jirachi typically comes into the game fairly late or on something it needs to revenge kill, such as Lucario or Tyranitar, as it does not have a lot of bulk and can get worn down. On the other hand, it is uniquely excellent at sweeping weakened, statused foes due to Iron Head, as much of the tier that doesn't resist it are at least 3HKOed. Jirachi is typically played patiently, waiting for its checks to be worn down by entry hazards and weaker attacks so that Jirachi needs fewer flinches to break through them. Keeping Jirachi hidden also has the benefit of scouting the opposing team, so it doesn't get trapped or statused by Magnezone. With Refresh, don't be afraid to go for extra damage to weaken status-inducing threats. Jirachi is fairly bulky for an offensive Pokemon, and opponents will often be very willing to status Jirachi in exchange for HP on other Pokemon. Coverage moves such as Ice Punch with investment and Grass Knot can be unexpected from Jirachi, so luring in Gliscor, Flygon, and Swampert trying to KO Jirachi can be valuable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi is one of the best Spikes partners in the tier, as they wear down its answers very effectively. It is a staple of the big five style built around Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Clefable, Skarmory, defensive Latias, and a Ground-type such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, specially defensive Gliscor, or Donphan. It is highly effective as a cleaner and Lucario check on these teams. Tyranitar sets sand, appreciates backup in taking on Choice item Latias, and Pursuit traps frail Dark-weak foes like Gengar, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Starmie that can status Jirachi or otherwise outspeed it and give it trouble. Clefable removes items with Knock Off, greatly increasing Jirachi's effectiveness, and takes on bulkier threats resistant to Iron Head such as Zapdos and Suicune. Skarmory is the best Spiker in the tier. Defensive Latias and the Ground-type give much-needed defensive flexibility with Jirachi. Jirachi also works well alongside other offensive Spikes partners, such as Gengar, Swampert, and specially defensive Empoleon. Gengar and Swampert appreciate if Jirachi burns specially defensive Skarmory, while both provide the residual damage on defensive teams Jirachi enjoys.</p> <p>Jirachi can also fit with more offensive teammates, especially if it forgoes Leftovers. It can fit alongside Magnezone offenses that lack Knock Off alongside teammates like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Choice Specs Latias, and Swords Dance Gliscor, as it enjoys Leftovers Skarmory being eliminated and pressures Shed Shell Skarmory with status and Iron Head flinches. Jirachi can even use a Lum Berry to help these teammates deal with Breloom. Gengar is a stellar partner due to its ability to counter Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Swampert by switching in on predicted Earthquakes and inflicting burn damage with Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Gengar can heavily damage Heatran with Focus Blast, a common counter to Jirachi's physical attacks. Meanwhile, Jirachi can retaliate against Latias and Tyranitar, which may try to exploit Gengar's frailty. Jirachi's ability to pressure Lucario and Scizor make it a good teammate for other Spikers that can struggle with them such as Roserade. Some good teammates for these include Choice Specs Latias, Calm Mind Suicune, offensive Heatran, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A.</p>"

      "Offensive Calm Mind (Superachi)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind is an excellent option to take advantage of Jirachi's coverage. Psychic is Jirachi's strongest option, OHKOing Breloom and 2HKOing Machamp. It also is fantastic at dealing with bulky neutral targets such as Clefable, Flygon, and Rotom-A. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados and 2HKOes most Skarmory, while Grass Knot OHKOes Swampert and Quagsire. Draco Meteor is another option to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock at +1. Grass Knot notably hits Water-type targets such as Milotic and Suicune harder than Thunderbolt and is the best option for Tyranitar and Hippowdon. However, giving up coverage against Skarmory to use either of these moves is a big loss.</p> <p>The last slot is typically dedicated to Hidden Power Ground, as Jirachi has no hope to break past Heatran otherwise. After a Calm Mind, it OHKOes offensive variants after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOes specially defensive variants. As an alternative, Hidden Power Fire is a fair option alongside Grass Knot or Draco Meteor to threaten Skarmory. Hidden Power Fire also comes with the benefit of OHKOing Scizor and Forretress after Stealth Rock. Both options are important to threaten Lucario, as they OHKO it after a Special Defense drop.</p> <p>If hitting Steel-types is not necessary, Jirachi can try to circumvent its other shortcomings with Iron Head. Since Jirachi does not have the same firepower as other special attackers such as Latias and Heatran, special walls such as Clefable and defensive Latias are common roadblocks that Jirachi can potentially get through with flinching. Finally, if you're running this Jirachi alongside Toxic Spikes, Protect is a possible option to accumulate poison damage on bulky Water-types and Tyranitar as well as getting additional rounds of Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Speed and Special Attack are maximized to get the most out of this set's sweeping capabilities, as Jirachi is not particularly strong and wants to Speed tie with opposing Jirachi and mixed Flygon. However, Jirachi can afford to lower its Speed investment to increase its bulk, especially if it uses Hidden Power Fire due to the required 30 Speed IV. Example benchmarks include 320 Speed to outspeed Gliscor and Modest Latias and 308 Speed to outspeed Lucario, with the remaining EVs going into HP to better take on offensive Water-types such as Suicune and Empoleon after a Calm Mind. When using Iron Head, a Hasty nature is advised alongside Attack investment. A spread of 4 HP / 32 Atk / 252 SpA / 220 Spe lets it outspeed Modest Latias and gives Jirachi great odds of 2HKOing bulkless Tyranitar. It is possible to run heavier Attack investment such as 80 Atk / 208 SpA / 220 Spe to guarantee a 2HKO on Dragon Dance Tyranitar and 96 Atk / 236 SpA / 176 Spe to 4HKO defensive Latias with Stealth Rock and sand damage.</p> <p>While Leftovers is often the item of choice, other possible items include Lum Berry to better withstand status and Shuca Berry to better hold off Earthquake from Metagross and Dragon Dance users. Lum Berry in particular allows Jirachi to switch into and threaten out Breloom, while Leftovers is highly helpful in giving Jirachi longevity throughout the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Jirachi generally lacks power, it struggles to break past bulkier Pokemon; Metagross, Swampert, Tyranitar, Dragonite, opposing Jirachi, Latias, and Clefable are all able to check it if they have not been weakened properly. Therefore, Jirachi should generally be brought out late-game unless it needs to check threats such as Lucario, Gyarados, and Skarmory with its Speed and coverage. Once revealed, Jirachi should use Calm Mind on something it threatens out such as Breloom or Choice Scarf Flygon using Outrage. Jirachi can also set up on some special attackers such as Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Suicune, as it outspeeds them and can boost its Special Defense to check them. As Jirachi is commonly targeted by Trick once it starts setting up, avoid locking it into a bad move such as Calm Mind or Psychic against Tyranitar. Jirachi's versatility also makes it hard to guess what the set is, especially if it doesn't have Leftovers. Take advantage of this to hit targets such as Gyarados with Thunderbolt, Tyranitar with Iron Head after using Calm Mind, Swampert with Grass Knot, and Scizor with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Jirachi fits best alongside teammates that can weaken bulkier Pokemon and special walls while also needing something to check Swords Dance Lucario. One of its best partners is Heatran, which baits in Tyranitar, Ground-types such as Swampert, Flygon, and Hippowdon, and special walls such as Clefable, Latias, and Blissey to either burn them in the case of Tyranitar and the Ground-types, hit them hard, or use Explosion. Other ways to weaken special walls such as additional Explosion lures such as Gengar and offensive Knock Off users such as Empoleon are also effective. Breloom is another great partner, as its Spore provides setup opportunities and can heavily threaten special walls. Alongside these Pokemon, Tyranitar is an excellent choice, as it can both Pursuit trap Trick users or potentially set up with Dragon Dance and weaken Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross should Jirachi lack the coverage for them. Trick users such as Latias, Rotom-A, and Metagross can also be useful alongside Calm Mind Jirachi, as they can give setup opportunities and limit special walls. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias can also further backs up Jirachi against Dragon Dance sweepers, as it isn't strong enough to stop them at full health, while Trick + Iron Ball Metagross opens up bulky Pokemon such as Zapdos and Rotom-A and can potentially use Explosion on Swampert and Hippowdon. Jirachi, especially with Iron Head, can also fit alongside more offensive options such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Machamp, as it is very fast, threatens Skarmory, and enjoys these Pokemon weakening bulkier foes.</p> <p>Calm Mind Jirachi also fits well on Spikes offense teams as a fast, strong boosting threat. Spikes help weaken foes such as Metagross, Blissey, and Swampert, allowing Jirachi to power through them. Skarmory is the most synergistic Spiker with Jirachi, but Roserade can also work. Other good Spikes partners such as Swampert, mixed Flygon, Latias, and Choice Scarf Lucario are good teammates. Draco Meteor Jirachi is an especially great teammate for Swampert, as it can lure in and KO defensive Latias, opening up the way for Swampert.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi makes for a fantastic mixed attacker with its expansive movepool, resilience to passive damage, and excellent Speed. Iron Head is the only necessary move, as it creates free turns, pressures Tyranitar, and disables more physically frail special walls such as Clefable and Blissey with its 60% flinch chance. The remainder of the set is more flexible, depending on the rest of the team.</p> <p>Ice Punch and Icy Wind take care of the Flying- and Dragon-types; Ice Punch OHKOes Dragonite and Flygon and 2HKOes Gliscor and offensive Latias. Icy Wind is a fine alternative to put more pressure on more physically bulky Pokemon weak to Ice such as Gliscor. The Speed drop also lets Jirachi hit first with Iron Head and prevents Pokemon such as Agility Empoleon and Dragon Dance Gyarados from setting up on Jirachi with impunity should it lack the necessary coverage. Fire Punch hits Steel-types such as Skarmory, Magnezone, Bronzong, and other Jirachi for super effective damage and allows Jirachi fulfull its defensive niche against Scizor and Lucario, as it OHKOes both after Stealth Rock damage. Should Heatran and Magnezone be a concern, Hidden Power Ground is an another option to 2HKO Heatran and OHKO Magnezone without bulk investment after Stealth Rock. Grass Knot hits Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrondon very hard, at least 2HKOing them while also pressuring Milotic and Suicune. On the other hand, Thunderbolt and Thunder OHKO Gyarados after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Starmie and Skarmory.</p> <p>Mixed attacking Jirachi has several other options worth considering. Psychic with Special Attack investment OHKOes Gengar and Breloom and 2HKOes Machamp. It also 3HKOes RestTalk Rotom-A, something Jirachi is unable to achieve with any of its other moves. Hidden Power Fire hits Metagross, physically defensive Skarmory, and Breloom harder than Fire Punch. However, Jirachi loses the option to burn its foes and cannot Speed tie with mixed Flygon and opposing Jirachi due to the 30 Speed IV required for Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mixed attacking Jirachi typically runs close to or maximum Speed EVs to Speed tie with other Jirachi and Flygon then invests in one of its offensive stats. However, Jirachi can also opt to lower its Speed investment to hit harder. Useful Speed benchmarks are 320 Speed to outspeed Modest Latias and Gliscor; 308 Speed to outspeed Lucario and Roserade; 300 Speed to outspeed Suicune, Rotom-A, and neutral-natured Zapdos and Flygon, and 280 Speed to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Heatran. For more specially oriented Jirachi, alternative EV spreads include 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, 36 Atk / 252 SpA / 220 Spe to outspeed Modest Latias, and 116 Atk / 192 SpA / 200 Spe with a Special Attack-boosting nature to OHKO offensive Swampert with Grass Knot and an Expert Belt. While Jirachi can use both Defense- and Special Defense-hindering natures, Naive is more common, as Jirachi simply isn't bulky enough without investment to be a long-term pivot into Latias, and keeping its Defense intact allows it to answer threats such as itself, Gyarados, Tyranitar, Breloom, and Dragonite better. Jirachi has a small chance to be OHKOed by Tyranitar's +1 Fire Punch after Stealth Rock with a Defense-reducing nature.</p> <p>The most common item Jirachi uses is Shuca Berry, as it lets Jirachi survive Earthquake from various Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Flygon, Metagross, Hippowdon, and Swampert and hit them hard with the appropriate coverage move. Even with a Defense-reducing nature, these Pokemon will fail to OHKO Jirachi with a boosted Earthquake. Another option is Expert Belt, which notably guarantees special coverage moves, such as Hidden Power Ground and Grass Knot, OHKO targets such as Magnezone and Swampert. Leftovers is common to help feign Jirachi not having special coverage moves such as Grass Knot, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ground and gives it the longevity to survive on more defensive teams as a wincon. Lum Berry allows Jirachi to absorb Breloom's Spore and avoid paralysis from Magnezone and opposing Jirachi. In conjunction with Hidden Power Ground, Occa Berry is a decent item to take Fire-types moves from Heatran and Infernape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi has a lot of flexibility and can be brought in at almost any stage of the game. It can lead and hit most leads in the tier hard, come in mid-game to threaten targets such as Swampert, Skarmory, and Heatran with coverage, or wait until late in the game to revenge kill dangerous Pokemon such as Lucario and clean up weakened foes with its Speed. Despite this, it struggles to fulfill the defensive roles bulkier sets can, as boosted Dragon-type moves such as Latias's Choice Specs Draco Meteor and Dragonite's Outrage will 2HKO it. Once it hits the field, Jirachi is straightforward to play: hit the foe with the appropriate move.</p> <p>Especially if Jirachi isn't holding Leftovers, different item choices can dictate how it should be played. Items such as Expert Belt and Occa Berry can unexpectedly break open holes earlier in the game, while Lum Berry and Shuca Berry are valuable tools to be held hidden to cover specific situations. Shuca Berry variants in particular are often part of the team's backbone against setup sweepers and should be kept healthy for the later stages of the game. Take advantage of how Jirachi can often bluff coverage attacks in desperate situations: for example, switching into Swords Dance Scizor can represent Jirachi having Fire Punch or Hidden Power Fire even if it doesn't have either and can force Scizor out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Jirachi most often fits on two types of teams: as a late-game wincon and fail-safe against Swords Dance Lucario for both offensive and stall teams based around Spikes, and as an offensive threat and backup answer to Dragon Dance sweepers on faster teams without Spikes. For both offensive and defensive Spikes-based teams, the most common Spiker is Skarmory. Defensive Skarmory can take on Jirachi's defensive roles such as switching into Latias's Draco Meteor, while offensive Skarmory sets can immediately set up entry hazards to put Jirachi's answers in range of its coverage moves. Jirachi can even heavily weaken or KO Magnezone trying to trap Skarmory. On more offensive teams, Roserade can work as well, but it lacks the reliability of Skarmory. On more offensive Spikes-based teams, common teammates include offensive Swampert, Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, Tyranitar, and offensive or Choice Scarf Rotom-A. All of these Pokemon either provide critical defensive utility, take advantage of Spikes themselves, or help keep Spikes up against spinners such as Starmie, Donphan, and Forretress.</p> <p>For more defensive Spikes-based teams, mixed Jirachi is common on the big 5 style built around Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Skarmory, defensive Latias, Clefable, and either RestTalk Rotom-A or a Ground-type such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, Gliscor, or Donphan. Jirachi provides a more immediate answer to Skarmory with Thunderbolt instead of burning it with Fire Punch and uses its additional coverage to take on threats such as Swampert and Gliscor. More defensive teammates help make up for Jirachi's lack of bulk—whereas more offensive teams are likely to use Jirachi to take on offensive Water-types such as Calm Mind Suicune, Gyarados, and Starmie, defensive partners such as Latias and Clefable can instead, allowing Jirachi to preserve its health for late in the game. These teammates also help Jirachi against difficult foes such as Rotom-A and Zapdos that Jirachi struggles to beat. Note that using such a frail Jirachi forces these Pokemon into particular sets; for example, Skarmory often should be specially defensive, and Latias often needs to have Roar to make up for Jirachi's shortcomings.</p> <p>On teams without Spikes, Jirachi plays a more supportive role in checking threats such as Dragonite, Swampert, Gyarados, Lucario, and Gliscor with its Speed, item choice, and coverage. As such, it more likely molds its moveset towards its teammates to cover the holes they may lead to. However, it should be used alongside sturdier checks to Latias and Dragonite such as Metagross. Staples of offensive teams such as mixed or Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, Azelf, offensive Heatran, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Empoleon, Swords Dance Lucario, Agility Metagross, and Swords Dance Scizor are all good partners. Dragonite and Dragon Dance Tyranitar appreciate Jirachi heavily weakening Swampert and Hippowdon with Grass Knot; Azelf and Gyarados can potentially spread paralysis for Jirachi to take advantage of with Iron Head; Heatran and Empoleon appreciate backup with Dragon Dance sweepers due to Jirachi's Shuca Berry and Jirachi potentially weakening special walls with Iron Head; and Lucario, Metagross, and Scizor appreciate Jirachi targeting Flying-types such as Gyarados, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Skarmory with super effective coverage. Breloom is another great partner alongside versions without Grass Knot, as it can switch into Ground-types trying to target Jirachi with Earthquake. Gengar is another good option, as it can weaken Heatran so that Jirachi can eventually break through.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi's excellent Speed, ability to deal with most Speed-boosting threats, and great coverage make it a solid Choice Scarf user. 492 is a desirable Speed tier, letting it outspeed +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar and other fast threats such as Gengar and Latias and proceed to wear them down with Iron Head flinches. This combined with status and entry hazards makes Choice Scarf Jirachi able to break through faster Pokemon once they've been sufficiently weakened.</p> <p>The remainder of the set is flexible and will mostly depend on the user's needs. Fire Punch is a popular option to hit Steel-types such as Scizor, Lucario, Metagross, Skarmory, and opposing Jirachi. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch are good choices to improve its coverage and revenge kill Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite. However, these attacks tend to give setup opportunities, which is why Trick and U-turn are other attractive options. Trick makes Jirachi a legitimate threat against stall teams, crippling a wall, locking a setup sweeper into one attack, and potentially gaining valuable Leftovers recovery. On the other hand, U-turn keeps up momentum on Pokemon Jirachi can't hurt effectively such as Heatran.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi also makes for a surprisingly good lead. With a set of Iron Head, Trick, and two of Fire Punch, Body Slam, U-turn, and Stealth Rock, Jirachi can use its Speed to make frailer leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl flinch to prevent Stealth Rock, lock the opposing lead into a move, potentially set up Stealth Rock, or pivot out to the appropriate counter with U-turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Speed and Attack are maximized to make Jirachi as offensively threatening as possible. Jirachi needs a Jolly nature to Speed tie with Flygon and outspeed +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar. However, engaging in Speed ties with Flygon is uncommon and not recommended without Ice Punch; hence, it is possible to use an Adamant nature to help Iron Head hit as hard as possible. Another path is to run additional bulk to improve Jirachi's ability to survive attacks such as Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor, Dragonite's boosted Outrage, and Tyranitar's +1 Earthquake should Iron Head fail to make them flinch. A spread of 56 HP / 252 Atk / 200 Spe with an Adamant nature is a common spread, as it allows Jirachi to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine once Choice Scarf has been passed on with Trick. When running Thunder Punch, a spread of 160 HP / 140 Atk / 208 Spe with an Adamant nature OHKOes bulkless non-Wacan Berry Dragon Dance Gyarados, while the Speed beats Jolly Mamoswine and most defensive Latias. Similarly, a Fire Punch Jirachi can run a spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 148 Spe with a Jolly nature to maximize its usefulness as a bulky pivot. Ice Punch Jirachi should stick with maximum Speed, as the ability to at least Speed tie with Flygon and OHKO it is one of its perks. Jirachi can also use a spread of 252 HP / 108 Atk / 148 Spe with a Jolly nature to maximize its bulk and still outspeed what it needs to.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jirachi can be played in two ways: it can lead like mentioned above and try to get immediate momentum against hyper offensive leads such as Azelf and Aerodactyl, as well as scouting the opposing team with U-turn, or it can be played cautiously, only being brought in on threats it needs to revenge kill, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Lucario. Although bringing in Jirachi as threats such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragon Dance Dragonite set up or on a revenge kill could force them out, the ubiquity of defensive Jirachi might incline them to stay in and attack. When revealing Jirachi has a Choice Scarf, beware of Magnezone trying to switch in, as Jirachi will be trapped by a healthy Magnezone if it isn't locked into Fire Punch. Unlike other Choice Scarf users with Trick such as Latias and Rotom-A, Jirachi is not weak to Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit, meaning it can use Trick more aggressively against defensive teams. Make sure Jirachi's Speed is no longer needed before doing this, however. Jirachi, especially with more bulk, also has strong potential as a pivot, taking resisted hits and swinging momentum back in its favor with U-turn, but beware that doing this might compromise its ability to revenge kill threats. A final thing to note with Choice Scarf Jirachi is its potential as a late-game cleaner: its high Speed and the power of Iron Head flinching can clean up teams weakened by sand and entry hazards as their Steel-resistant Pokemon are chipped. Even frailer Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Starmie that normally are not vulnerable to Jirachi can fall, but Jirachi should only do this in desperate situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is most common on more defensive teams as speed control if they already have strong defensive Steel-types, but it can also fit on more offensive teams as a bulky revenge killer not weak to Pursuit or sand. On defensive teams, Choice Scarf Jirachi primarily competes with Choice Scarf Tyranitar as a revenge killer and has the opportunity cost of not running bulkier variants of Jirachi. Because of this, teammates need to be able to handle frail Dark-weak attackers such as Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, Starmie, and Rotom-A. As such, the most common special wall used alongside it is Blissey, although Clefable can be effective with support against attackers such as Choice Specs Latias. Other good teammates such as physically defensive Zapdos and Starmie to mitigate entry hazard weaknesses are also effective, as they can keep Jirachi healthy against Spikes. As Jirachi tends to give setup opportunities when it is locked into an attack, Zapdos, Hippowdon, defensive Latias, Milotic, and Gliscor also make for strong teammates. Choice Scarf Jirachi's Speed allows for more flexible move set options for defensive Pokemon; for example, Latias can potentially use Trick + Flame Orb to help cripple Steel-types for Jirachi instead of being forced to always check Gyarados, while Hippowdon can run more specially defensive sets as Jirachi answers Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Skarmory can set up Spikes to help weaken Steel-resistant foes that can absorb multiple Iron Heads. Additionally, defensive teams built around a bulky wincon such as Calm Mind Clefable, Torment Heatran, or Calm Mind + Rest Suicune appreciate Jirachi's ability to both absorb Trick and use Trick itself on walls to help set up. Breloom is also a useful teammate to take advantage of the defensive Pokemon that wall Jirachi and fits well alongside Starmie and Zapdos, while offensive Heatran can open up holes for Jirachi to take advantage of.</p> <p>On more offensive teams, teammates generally tend to already handle Choice Specs Latias well and need the general revenge killing that Choice Scarf Jirachi provides. Bulkier Tyranitar sets and Steel-types such as Empoleon, Heatran, and Metagross are strong teammates to handle Jirachi's defensive duties. Heatran can even use Substitute to take advantage of Jirachi's Trick. More aggressive Spikes Pokemon such as offensive Skarmory and Roserade appreciate Jirachi's ability to back them up against dangerous threats while Spikes wear down Steel-resistant foes over the course of the game. Bulky offensive Pokemon such as Suicune, Swampert, and Gyarados all help against Pokemon that take advantage of Jirachi locked into one move. They also additionally handle Heatran, which is a major threat to Jirachi.</p>"
      },
      "Wish + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jirachi's immunity to sand and great defensive profile make it a fine choice for a defensive Calm Mind user. Wish makes Jirachi unique as a supporter that can sweep, allowing it to provide longevity for its team throughout the game. Calm Mind forces the use of offensive answers to Jirachi, as its great typing, its physical bulk, and the Special Defense boost cover for the extra turn Wish needs to heal it. Once answers are removed, weaker Pokemon are unable to break through Jirachi barring a critical hit.</p> <p>Psychic is Jirachi's most reliable attack, OHKOing Breloom and Gengar after Stealth Rock, 2HKOing Machamp, and providing good neutral coverage against Pokemon such as Clefable, Rotom-A, and Ground-types. Flash Cannon is another option to more heavily pressure Tyranitar and Latias, as it 2HKOes offensive versions of Tyranitar and 3HKOes Latias after a Calm Mind. Thunderbolt provides good coverage with both moves, as it prevents Skarmory from phazing Jirachi, has good neutral coverage on Steel-types such as Scizor, and hits Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados, Empoleon, and Starmie hard. Should these options be handled by other teammates, Hidden Power Ground is another solid option to better answer Steel-types such as Heatran, Metagross, and other Jirachi, as well as weakened Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Jirachi's EVs emphasize physical bulk, as Jirachi can shore up its Special Defense with Calm Mind. Maximum HP investment also allows it outheal Seismic Toss from Clefable and Blissey. The Speed investment outspeeds Jolly Tyranitar and uninvested base 100s such as Zapdos and opposing defensive Jirachi. The remaining Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow it to take strong attacks such as Gyarados's +1 Earthquake, Tyranitar's +1 Earthquake, and two Breloom Superpowers, either attacking back or healing up. Jirachi can also spare some Defense EVs for Special Attack EVs to, as an example, more reliably OHKO Breloom with a +0 Psychic, but generally it should have as much Defense EVs as possible to survive Wish turns against physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Jirachi cannot heal itself immediately with Wish and there are many ways to neutralize it, such as status, Knock Off, Trick, phazing, and strong super effective attacks, Jirachi should avoid setting up early in the game. Early-game, Jirachi usually stays back and provides Wish support for its team. Jirachi should avoid taking strong attacks, such as Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor and Explosion, as it needs as much of its health as possible to set up later. Note that special moves such as Psychic and Thunderbolt are generally unexpected from defensive Jirachi—a set Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi can bluff with Wish—so take advantage of this to check Gengar, Breloom, and Gyarados if needed. Note that taking these Pokemon on often means Jirachi will struggle to sweep later in the game. Later on in the game, Jirachi can take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Forretress and Rotom-A and start setting up, healing off their attacks as needed. Note that it is not always optimal to get to +6, as unnecessary Calm Minds only increase the odds of the foe scoring a critical hit.</p> <p>For it to set up and sweep, Jirachi needs a lot of Pokemon removed. Most Pokemon in the tier can either status, phaze, or at least 3HKO Jirachi. Even weaker Pokemon like Starmie and Blissey can potentially paralyze Jirachi, interfering with its recovery. Against more offensive teams, Jirachi generally needs Trick users such as Latias and Rotom-A; bulky Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, Heatran, and Scizor; and strong attackers such as Swampert, Flygon, Tyranitar, and Infernape removed before it can sweep. On more defensive teams, Encore Clefable and Roar Latias are huge problems for Jirachi, as Encore shuts it down completely, and it struggles to do any damage to Latias, even with boosted Flash Cannon. Clefable and Emploeon's Knock Off is also dangerous, making it hard to passively heal off entry hazard damage, especially if statused. Even though other Jirachi sets can struggle to beat this set, offensive Calm Mind sets can break through, and physical sets threaten paralysis, which can potentially hamper its recovery, and especially burn, which ruins Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi. However, in a last Pokemon situation, some of these methods are not as effective, such as Roar Latias, because it can no longer be phazed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi fits on defensive teams that appreciate the compression of a wincon and Wish support. To make a win happen, Jirachi needs a lot of support itself. Entry hazard users such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Roserade help Jirachi wear down and get past its checks in the long run. To secure these entry hazards, Ghost-types such as defensive Rotom-A or a Choice Scarf Tyranitar can help prevent Starmie from spinning; Choice Scarf Tyranitar is also fantastic to trap Latias and potentially Clefable, as well as absorbing Trick from opposing Rotom-A and Latias. Rotom-A assists Jirachi in dealing with Gyarados and spreads burn to physical attackers such as Metagross and Swampert, which can break through Jirachi. As Jirachi cannot reliably heal itself, ways to deal with Spikes are especially valuable. Forretress provides a lot of role compression as a spinner, but Starmie is also helpful in dealing with Skarmory. Magnezone also helps deal with Skarmory, which can help Jirachi run Hidden Power Ground more reliably. Strong defensive teammates in general, especially if they lack reliable recovery themselves, are helpful for Jirachi. Swampert, Milotic, Hippowdon, defensive Heatran, Clefable, and defensive Latias all can help take defensive responsibility away from Jirachi so that it can focus on sweeping. Swampert heavily appreciates Wish support, while Milotic is especially helpful, as Jirachi is highly effective against the defensive teams Milotic struggles with once Roar Latias has been eliminated. Heatran additionally helps deal with Roar Latias and Clefable through Explosion, and it can also burn physical attackers in a similar way to Rotom-A.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon is often seen as outclassed by Swampert, which is the main Water / Ground type in the tier thanks to its access to Stealth Rock, better offensive coverage, and better stats. However, Gastrodon offers some unique assets that Swampert is missing, such as consistent healing via Recover as well as its ability Sticky Hold, which makes Gastrodon immune to Trick and prevents Knock Off from removing its item. Thanks to those two traits, Gastrodon has the luxury of being a truly excellent counter to Clefable. Like with Swampert, Gastrodon's excellent Water / Ground typing only leaves it with a Grass-type weakness while also granting it an Electric immunity, which can make Gastrodon hard to immediately threaten. Gastrodon's main utility is Curse, which in conjunction with its ability makes it a slow setup sweeper that cannot get easily stopped by Trick unlike its competition. Despite its unique attributes, Gastrodon remains very passive and has quite a few flaws; on one hand its coverage consisting of Waterfall and Earthquake means Pokemon like Breloom, Haze Milotic, and defensive Latias completely blank it, and on the other hand its extreme lack of power means it needs several boosts before being actually threatening. Furthermore, status like burn and poison heavily invalidates Gastrodon in the long run, so it's going to require a lot of support to be able to function nicely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used over Earthquake to lure Pokemon like Milotic and Reflect Latias and put them on a timer, both of which are extremely annoying for Curse Gastrodon. Rest is an option over Recover to get rid of eventual status more easily, but it remains inferior because Gastrodon won't heal as consistently without Recover. A set of Ice Beam, Earthquake, and Toxic can be used as a tank in the manner of Swampert that can also heal off damage with Recover. Counter and Mirror Coat are both usable as elements of surprise. The former is aimed at Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Machamp, while the latter targets Pokemon such as Choice Specs Latias, Empoleon, and Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin are a real nuisance for Gastrodon, as they resist both of its STAB attacks and can all easily force it out at any time, without Gastrodon being able to do anything about it. These aforementioned Pokemon in particular can all heal in various ways, which makes it even more impossible for Gastrodon to wear them down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon that resist Water</strong>: Because of Gastrodon's poor coverage, it won't hit Pokemon like Latias, Dragonite, and Gyarados even for neutral damage. Defensive Latias walls Curse Gastrodon for days; even at +6 it only deals about 30% to Latias, or 15% under Reflect, not to mention Latias can use Roar to phaze Gastrodon. While Dragonite and Gyarados aren't as sturdy as Latias, they're way more scary in the sense that they exploit Gastrodon's inability to hit them effectively to set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Gastrodon is really lacking in power; even with several boosts it will hardly be threatening to some of the best physical walls in the tier. Skarmory rules Gastrodon like no one, as it can take advantage of Gastrodon's inability to touch it to easily lay down Spikes and can also prevent Gastrodon from boosting itself by phazing it at any moment with Whirlwind. Milotic in the same way prevents Gastrodon from getting multiple Curse boosts with Haze, which also has way more PP than Curse and thus can win the war in long games. Defensive Rotom can ruin Gastrodon with Will-O-Wisp, while Zapdos can run Toxic, Hidden Power Grass, or even Roar to make Gastrodon look miserable. To a certain extent, Gliscor can prevent Gastrodon from boosting itself with Taunt, wall it, and wear it down with Earthquake, as unboosted Waterfall deals negligible damage against Gliscor's high Defense. Physically defensive Hippowdon has no trouble checking Gastrodon temporarily as well thanks to its huge Defense, as it can phaze it with Roar and make it take entry hazard damage or wear it down in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Threats</strong>: Since Gastrodon is very weak and passive, especially without boosts, it will have a hard time handling fast and powerful Pokemon like Choice Specs Latias, Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Swampert, and Choice Band Gyarados, all of which can deal tremendous damage to it. Other heavy hitters like Machamp, Lucario, and Choice Band Tyranitar deal a ton of damage to it as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse is Gastrodon's main offensive weapon, which lets it set up and effectively beat Clefable as well as sweep. The combination of Waterfall and Earthquake forms the best coverage Gastrodon has to offer and enables it to hit everything for at least neutral damage besides Grass-types such as Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin and Pokemon like Latias, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Recover allows Gastrodon to heal itself at its convenience and grants it several opportunities to set up throughout a game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Invest 252 EVs in HP in order to maximize Gastrodon's bulk overall. Since Gastrodon aims to beef its Defense up with Curse, 240 EVs in Special Defense as well as a Careful nature are the way to go to easily soak up damage from Pokemon like Latias, Starmie, Heatran, Gengar, mixed Dragonite, and even mixed Infernape with Grass Knot. More Defense can be added to set up on Tyranitar more easily and to take Infernape's Close Combat better, although you should keep in mind that Gastrodon should always have a Careful nature. There's no alternative to Gastrodon's Leftovers, as combined with its ability Sticky Hold, it means that it will always be able to passively recover its health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To get a chance to set up with Gastrodon, you'll need to get rid of its main counters. Trappers such as Magnezone can take out Pokemon like Skarmory, which are big thorns in Gastrodon's side. Try to preserve Gastrodon's health as much as possible and avoid status effects like burn and poison, which are extremely unpleasant for it. As soon as you remove Gastrodon's main counters, you can eventually find the opportunity to set up on Pokemon like Clefable, non-Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Choice Scarf Latias. Make use of Gastrodon's ability to switch in endlessly on Clefable, as well as switch into Choice Scarf Rotom-A thanks to its Electric and Trick immunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In terms of good partners, Magnezone is strongly appreciated, as it takes care of pesky Steel-types like Skarmory and Bronzong. Since Gastrodon hates status, having a spinner like Starmie or a Poison-type Pokemon such as Roserade or Nidoqueen that can remove potential Toxic Spikes and spread its own is very much appreciated. In the same vein, Healing Wish support from the likes of Latias, Jirachi, and Shaymin can bring Gastrodon back to full health even if it has taken status during the game. Heatran can deny status like burn and poison and spread its own Toxic on Milotic and Reflect Latias, which puts them on a timer and removes their ability to wall Gastrodon in the long run. Clefable has great synergy with Gastrodon as well, as it can absorb status aimed at Gastrodon, provides Knock Off support against the likes of defensive Latias, Milotic, and even Shed Shell Skarmory so Magnezone can pick it off, and checks some variants of Heatran and Zapdos that Gastrodon cannot handle, whereas on the other hand Gastrodon can cover a potential Trick aimed at Clefable. Alternatively, Calm Mind Clefable can help deal with Dragonite and Gyarados, which are huge threats to Gastrodon, while providing some sort of wincon in scenarios where Gastrodon would have a hard time sweeping the opposing team. Since Gastrodon is very inclined to let Breloom come in on the field for free, defensive Latias and Celebi can make useful sturdy answers to it while also providing great general defensive utility against the likes of Machamp and Swampert. Choice Specs Latias can also use Sleep Talk to absorb Breloom's Spore. Finally, Bronzong's plethora of resistances, solid bulk, access to Stealth Rock, and self-sufficiency make it one of the best Pokemon to patch plenty of weaknesses and play multiple roles in one slot. Bronzong can also bring a very nice aspect to the team and free other slots, which lets you run more specific support that Gastrodon drastically requires.</p>"

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Honchkrow's main advantages come from its powerful mixed offenses and access to the strongest priority move in the tier with Sucker Punch. Honchkrow has a fantastic movepool, as Brave Bird and various coverage moves such as Heat Wave and Superpower make it difficult to switch into. Its ability allows it to absorb sleep moves such as Breloom's Spore and Roserade's Sleep Powder. However, Honchkrow is completely unviable in DPP OU, as it is held back by a huge weakness to residual damage, an awful defensive typing, and slow Speed. While Honchkrow has a solid base HP stat, its terrible defenses, weakness to Stealth Rock, and sand vulnerability compromise its bulk, and it takes huge recoil damage from Brave Bird and Life Orb. Unfortunately, Honchkrow is a slow, frail wallbreaker, and it struggles to deal with faster Pokemon that can OHKO it, such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Heatran, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Scizor using Bullet Punch. On top of this, Honchkrow is heavily reliant on prediction, as it needs Sucker Punch to damage faster Pokemon and mispredictions can easily get it OHKOed or let the opposing Pokemon set up unimpeded. While Honchkrow can switch into sleep moves, Breloom can OHKO it with either Superpower or Focus Punch. Even Breloom's and Roserade's Grass-type moves are dangerous; Breloom 2HKOes Honchkrow with Seed Bomb after Stealth Rock, and Roserade outspeeds and OHKOes it with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock and a round of Life Orb and sand damage. Honchkrow simply cannot reliably perform in DPP OU and should not be considered for a serious team.</p>",

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong sets itself apart from its Steel / Psychic type brethren Jirachi and Metagross with a great ability in Levitate, allowing it to check Ground-types as well as making it immune to Spikes. It also finds its key attributes in having a Stealth Rock resistance and sand immunity, making it quite durable and hard to take down. Its remarkable all-around mixed bulk coupled with a ton of key resistances allows it to act as a pivot that is able to switch into prevalent moves such as Latias's Draco Meteor, Metagross's Meteor Mash, and Flygon's Earthquake. One of Bronzong's biggest selling points is that, especially with Trick Room, it's one of the best checks to a large number of setup sweepers, mainly Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, some variants of Calm Mind Jirachi, and even Suicune. In addition, its ability to fire off powerful assaults makes it a great late-game sweeper and supporter for slow teammates to help them perform better. However, Bronzong does not have large offensive coverage, and its base Attack stat is below average compared to other brutes in the tier. This is remedied by its access to Gyro Ball, which synergizes well with its low Speed, and Explosion, which enables it to pressure a large variety of threats, namely Zapdos, Swampert, Starmie, and even Blissey and Clefable.</p> <p>If not given the opportunity to use Trick Room, Bronzong's incredible slowness remains exploitable by popular threats such as Breloom, Machamp, and Heatran. It also does not resist Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB attacks, is weak to Jirachi's Fire Punch, and takes huge neutral damage from Zapdos's Thunderbolt or Starmie's Hydro Pump, which are incredibly popular. In addition, its lack of reliable recovery moves makes it prone to being worn down, and it will not like switching in repeatedly to take even resisted hits. Moreover, its lack of offensive presence outside of Gyro Ball means that it is setup bait for Skarmory. Generally, Bronzong has trouble beating physical walls and bulky Water-types without the use of Explosion, which can be easily wasted by the ubiquitous Rotom-A, which resists most of the rest of its weaponry as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong has a plethora of other moves if you want its ringing to sound differently. Its defensive capabilities allow it to fit nicely on rain teams as a great pivot with a Damp Rock set. Its movepool is adequate for such a set, since it is capable of setting up Stealth Rock and using Explosion to bring in a teammate freely. However, running all those moves means that you have to be okay with sacrificing Earthquake. Bronzong can pull off an effective dual screens set, since it has a few advantages over other setters, namely its bulk and access to Explosion. Its access to Hypnosis can also be useful for offensive teams to temporarily shut down a threat. However, the low accuracy makes this move somewhat risky to use. Heal Block can surprise defensive threats such as Zapdos and Rotom-A by preventing them from using recovery moves safely against Bronzong. Gravity negates the Ground-type immunities of Rotom-A, Skarmory, and opposing Bronzong, which can allow other teammates to break through them with powerful Earthquakes, as well as Magnezone's Magnet Rise, which can shift the one-on-one matchup in Bronzong's favor in tandem with Earthquake. However, Gravity also removes Bronzong's own Levitate, making it no longer able to check Flygon, Metagross, and such. Bronzong has a great special movepool, featuring moves like Calm Mind, Grass Knot, Psychic, Flash Cannon, and Charge Beam. Although Bronzong can lure and 2HKO some physically defensive Pokemon, its only medicore Special Attack and awful Speed make it more a gimmick than a real threat. Despite the fact that it looks very gimmicky, a maximum Speed lead set with Imprison and a Jolly nature could work, as it outspeeds some slow leads such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Metagross and can prevent them from using Stealth Rock while setting up its own. Last but not least, Skill Swap is an interesting option that makes Bronzong able to cripple Clefable by negating its ability.</p> <p>Trick can be utilized alongside Choice Band or Iron Ball. Choice Band is useful to cripple switch-ins that are not a threat anymore when locked into a move while boosting Bronzong's power at the same time. Iron Ball grants Bronzong the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Rotom-A, Zapdos, and Skarmory by grounding them and halving their Speed, which enables Pokemon like Metagross and Swampert to break through their usual counters. Furthermore, Iron Ball allows Bronzong to run Heatproof as its primary ability since the item already makes it grounded. Heatproof in general is a great alternative to Levitate, as it can be used to fool Heatran or Infernape. However, Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types, which its typing wouldn't normally allow it to do. Also, becoming weak to Spikes is a really unwanted aspect that further reveals the deception. Lastly, Shed Shell is an option that can be used to escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types can switch into offensive or defensive Bronzong and threaten it with their neutral STAB moves. Gyarados has Intimidate, resists Gyro Ball, and can set up Dragon Dance, as it survives Explosion with the Attack drop. Bulky Starmie, especially, is annoying, as it can tank reasonably any of Bronzong's moves bar Payback, spin away its entry hazards, and repeatedly recover from Bronzong's attacks with Recover. Suicune's wonderful Defense allows it to laugh at Bronzong's Earthquake or Gyro Ball while setting up Calm Mind to prepare a sweep. CroCune can cure Toxic, survive Explosion, and stay healthy, while offensive sets will melt Bronzong with a boosted Hydro Pump. Milotic can wear Bronzong down with Surf and heal itself with Recover to win in the long run, although Toxic or Explosion threatens it. Swampert also hates Toxic but takes nothing from Bronzong's attacks bar Explosion even without Defense EVs and can utilize this momentum to set up Stealth Rock or launch some powerful Waterfalls.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory can stand forever in Bronzong's face, sponge any of its attacks, and take this time to set up Spikes thanks to its resistance to Gyro Ball and immunity to Earthquake and Toxic. Its astronomical Defense also enables it to use Roost and regain HP even if Bronzong uses Earthquake on that turn while taking a pittance from Explosion. Similarly, Bronzong is completely walled by opposing Bronzong. Bulky variants of Scizor can shrug off any of Bronzong's attacks, heal the damage with Roost, and proceed to set up Swords Dance to threaten it even more. Wish + Protect bulky Jirachi can beat Bronzong in a one-on-one matchup, but it slightly risks critical hits and also needs to burn quite a bit of PP to do so. Also, more offensive variants of Jirachi can overwhelm Bronzong with Fire Punch and a potential burn, which Bronzong hates. Offensive Empoleon's Water-type moves do a ton to Bronzong, and it can carry a Shuca Berry to shrug off Earthquake's damage, while defensive variants can cripple it with Knock Off and set up entry hazards. Lucario usually does not switch into Bronzong, but a +2 Life Orb-boosted Close Combat obliterates Bronzong, while an unboosted one will still do massive damage. The latter three must be wary of Earthquake, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, in general, are effective against Bronzong, as they resist Gyro Ball and force great damage on it. Even if Magnezone runs the risk of switching into Earthquake, it can easily eliminate Bronzong with Magnet Rise and its STAB Thunderbolt. RestTalk Rotom-A is also a great counter, as it resists Gyro Ball, is immune to Explosion and Earthquake, and can cure Toxic with Rest. Defensive Zapdos causes Bronzong some PP issues with Pressure and Roost while resisting Gyro Ball and being immune to Earthquake. However, it is susceptible to Explosion and Toxic. Other Electric-types like Raikou and Jolteon inflict great damage on Bronzong but hate dealing with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types annoy Levitate Bronzong; Infernape and Heatran can switch in while Bronzong attempts to set up Stealth Rock and deal tremendous damage with their powerful STAB attacks. While Moltres is rare, with Pressure and resistances to Earthquake and Gyro Ball, it's also a major thorn in Bronzong's side. Bronzong can also be chipped pretty quickly by Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage moves like Flygon, Jirachi, and Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types generally take low damage from Gyro Ball thanks to their solid Defense and low Speed; furthermore, they can exploit Bronzong's passivity to either wall it or use it as setup fodder. Unless Bronzong carries Hidden Power Ice, Gliscor is a major thorn in Bronzong's side, as it is able to stall it out with Roost and prevents it from using Toxic or Stealth Rock with Taunt. Even Explosion does not always KO it. Gliscor can also use Knock Off to negate Bronzong's passive recovery or Ice Fang to fish for a freeze. Swampert hates Toxic but takes almost nothing from Bronzong's attacks even without Defense investment and can wear it down with Waterfall or set up Stealth Rock. Nidoqueen is weak to Earthquake but tanks Bronzong's attacks reasonably well, which means that it can set up dual entry hazards against it or even deny the offensive set Trick Room turns with Protect. The same goes for Hippowdon, which walls Bronzong bar Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is meant to capitalize on Bronzong's reasonable base Attack stat and the huge power of Gyro Ball to turn Bronzong's abysmal Speed into an advantage with Trick Room. It is a great late-game cleaner and a massive threat to fragile teams.</p> <p>Its terrible base 33 Speed with 0 IVs and a Brave nature makes it move first against everything in the tier when Trick Room is active. Additionally, its typing prevents it from being worn down by the common sand and provides a welcome resistance to Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch. Consequently, you generally have to stall out its 4-turn assault in order to get rid of it, unless you have a true counter. Also, Gyro Ball reaching up to 150-Base Power makes any fast and frail Pokemon such as Latias or Gengar very vulnerable to it. While the prominent Choice Scarf Rotom-A is not 2HKOed by Gyro Ball, Bronzong is great at forcing it in and wearing it down with Gyro Ball or even forcing it to use Trick, which is very undesirable, since Macho Brace halves its Speed. Trick Room is also great at turning the tides versus powerful setup sweepers, mainly all Dragon Dance users. Bronzong notably can sponge +1 Dragonite's Outrage and set up Trick Room to shift the momentum to your advantage, force Taunt Gyarados into mind games between Explosion and Trick Room, and maim boosted Tyranitar with Gyro Ball. Earthquake provides adequate coverage and lands clean OHKOs against Steel-types such as Magnezone and Heatran, deals heavy damage to foes like Jirachi, Metagross, Lucario, and Empoleon, and can also assist in wearing down bulky Water-types. Explosion works well as a final blow, which allows Bronzong to go for a quick KO when Trick Room is ending or pass the baton to another teammate that could make great use of the twisted dimensions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Bronzong's poor base HP; with its large number of resistances and only one weakness, it becomes a bulky sweeper. 252 Attack EVs power up its attacks and make sweeping possible. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to help Bronzong sponge Latias's Draco Meteor or Gengar's Shadow Ball. Minimum Speed IVs and a Speed-hindering nature maximize Gyro Ball's power and allow Bronzong to move before all other Pokemon during Trick Room. Thanks to Macho Brace, Bronzong's 150-Base Power Gyro Ball hits any Pokemon with at least base 75 Speed hard, which helps it break through slower threats. Additionally, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias may feel compelled to use Trick to reduce Bronzong's options, but receiving a Macho Brace can be incredibly detrimental to each, as for example, it enables Gyarados to outspeed both. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types and gives it a Spikes immunity. Leftovers can be an alternative if you want to rely more on Bronzong setting up Trick Room for another Pokemon than sweeping, since it gives more survivability. However, it considerably hampers Gyro Ball's damage against slow threats and can cause it to miss crucial KOs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The best way to use Bronzong is to bring it in on a resisted move such as Latias's Draco Meteor or Choice-locked Flygon's Earthquake to start setting up a Trick Room freely. Foes like Starmie, Zapdos, and Rotom can stop Bronzong's sweep, which is why dedicated Trick Room sweepers that can handle them and keep up the pressure will make sure you get the most mileage out of Bronzong's utility. While some of your other Pokemon should be able to take decent advantage of Trick Room, they should not all be dedicated Trick Room sweepers because Bronzong cannot repeatedly set up the field effect. Also, if your opponent's team is revealed to be weak to Bronzong, they may have to resort to stalling out Trick Room, so try to play around that and hit a Magnezone aiming to tank Gyro Ball with a powerful Earthquake, for example.</p> <p>Bronzong has great power, but it will much more often 2HKO a foe than OHKO one, especially if it resists Gyro Ball; therefore, it is usually a great idea to weaken its counter before sending it on the field, since it is not exactly bulky to begin with and can end up being worn down quickly or having its sweep stopped by a solid counter. Alternatively, Bronzong can use Explosion to weaken a Skarmory or a Hippowdon, for example, to bring in another offensive threat that will take advantage of the resulting chip damage. Bronzong often needs Explosion to break through specific threats, so make sure you don't need it anymore before giving up its last breath. Also, be careful not to waste Gyro Ball's PP too quickly, since Pokemon with recovery can stall it out, especially those that have Pressure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar is excellent support for Bronzong, as together, they form one of the most recognizable offensive cores for taking down offense while also pressuring stall significantly. Under Trick Room, Tyranitar is able to score many KOs against frail teams that cannot stall out four turns of STAB Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge or Crunch even with adequate resistances, while Tyranitar can also overwhelm bulkier teams thanks to its unmatched power. Stealth Rock is almost required, as the residual damage helps Bronzong's Gyro Ball secure several KOs. Tyranitar is also good at setting up the entry hazard because it not only resists Bronzong's only weakness but also works well under Trick Room if the situation requires it. Additionally, it can take out Rotom-A, which is a big pain for Bronzong, as it can burn it or waste Trick Room turns. Tyranitar is also helpful against defensive Zapdos, which will quickly deplete Bronzong's PP with Pressure and Roost. Additionally, Sand Stream helps at pressuring bulky Water-types as well as the aforementioned threats. Heatran can take advantage of Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-A for a Flash Fire boost and set up Stealth Rock; in return, Bronzong supports Choice Scarf Heatran in particular by shutting down threats that it does not reliably cover such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Tyranitar. Infernape can find opportunities to switch into Will-O-Wisp as well, but it can be a bit risky. That said, while Infernape does not work well under Trick Room, Bronzong supports it very well otherwise by pressuring Latias and Gengar; in return, Infernape can threaten and eliminate Steel-types or some Water-types that resist Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Swampert is an interesting option, as it is a Stealth Rock setter that shares great defensive and offense synergy with Bronzong. A specially offensive Swampert can lure physical walls like Skarmory, Rotom-A, and opposing Swampert and nuke them with a Modest STAB-boosted Hydro Pump while also being able to fire off powerful assaults under Trick Room. Choice Band Swampert and other physical variants are also great, as they form an overwhelming physical core with Bronzong. A core of Swampert + Bronzong + Tyranitar is threatening offensively but requires defensive backup to cover the shared weaknesses against Water-types and Breloom. For that reason, Choice Specs Latias with Sleep Talk is useful, since it pivots into Breloom, provides nice weaponry to deal with bulky Water-types, and also resists Fire-type moves. For similar reasons, Choice Band Dragonite is a great addition. Choice Specs Kingdra is another interesting one thanks to its unique palette of resistances, access to Sleep Talk, and ability to force damage on Water-types. Occasionally, it can also score some KOs under Trick Room. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Kingdra have excellent typing synergy with Bronzong while benefiting from the holes it creates in the opposing team and vice versa.</p> <p>Skarmory is one of the easiest ways to prevent Bronzong from sweeping, and it can also make it fodder to set up Spikes or even heal itself. As a result, Bronzong really wants its teammates to help circumvent a potential Skarmory weakness. Magnezone is the obvious number one option to patch this immediately, but any way to lure or just overwhelm it in general can make the team function nicely. Magnezone can also trap opposing Bronzong, thanks to Magnet Rise, and bulky Swords Dance Scizor, which is definitely helpful.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tank Bronzong is a flagship set in the DPP metagame. This set takes advantage of Bronzong's above-average mixed bulk and wonderful defensive typing in order to sponge as many hits as possible, which in turn allows Bronzong to shut down a vast array of threats, providing it some momentum to set up Stealth Rock. This set is incredibly reliable against offensive archetypes because it's tough to beat and hits frail enemies hard. However, it has some trouble pressuring bulkier teams, which often feature Skarmory and other allies that can sponge its attacks. This includes bulky Starmie with Recover + Rapid Spin that can potentially keep Bronzong's entry hazards away, but a fast 3 Attacks + Rapid Spin set is significantly pressured. Gyro Ball is Bronzong's strongest STAB attack overall, doing great neutral damage to anything bar slow enemies like Clefable. Alternatively, Bronzong can opt for coverage with Hidden Power Ice to avoid PP issues and deal with Gliscor, Dragonite, Flygon, and Breloom at the same time, while Payback is a great offensive tool to pressure foes like Starmie, Gengar, Rotom, and Latias. Earthquake enables Bronzong to hit Infernape and Steel-types like Magnezone and Heatran, which otherwise laugh at it. Toxic horribly cripples Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, Swampert, and Gyarados and other foes that resist its moves like Zapdos and Rotom-A. It can also surprise stallbreaker Gliscor, which doesn't always want to Taunt Bronzong straight away. Protect is a useful alternative to scout Choice item users and pick up additional Leftovers recovery that can also be used with Toxic to rack up additional damage. Another option worth considering is Explosion, which allows Bronzong to check a problematic foe and stops threats like Gyarados and Suicune from setting up on it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mixed bulk is great to let Bronzong handle a wide array of both physically and specially oriented sweepers. 252 HP EVs maximize Bronzong's poor base HP, which is optimal for maximized durability. 128 Special Defense and Defense EVs with a Sassy nature make for a great emphasis on mixed bulk, allowing Bronzong to sponge common special attacks such as Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Hidden Power Fire, Shadow Ball, and Hydro Pump as well as avoid being worn down too quickly by physical attackers like Jirachi, Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Swampert. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types, such as Mamoswine and Flygon, which its typing wouldn't normally allow it to do. Additionally, Bronzong's Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs decrease its Speed to make Gyro Ball stronger, though its nature should be Careful if you do not use it. Leftovers provides a form of passive recovery, which is crucial on such a defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzong should be used as a pivot throughout the match. Take advantage of the great number of Pokemon Bronzong checks and use any given opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. However, keep in mind that it lacks reliable recovery and can get worn down pretty quickly. Similarly, Bronzong does not appreciate losing its Leftovers, so be wary of Knock Off when facing foes like Gliscor, Clefable, and Empoleon. If you are using Protect, be careful to not use it excessively when there are Pokemon on the opposing team that can use Bronzong as setup bait, such as Breloom and Skarmory. If you spot a Choice-locked Pokemon, use Protect to scout it out. Keep Toxic concealed for a bit to increase its surprise value and potentially land it on a foe like Gliscor or Milotic. Be also careful not to waste Gyro Ball's low PP too quickly, since it can be stalled out over the course of a game, especially by Pressure users like Suicune and Zapdos. Use Gyro Ball on more offensive Starmie and Earthquake on more defensive ones, which do not run maximum Speed investment. If you suspect your opponent is running an archetype that could feature Magnezone, try to hit it with Earthquake as it may switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Bronzong set tends to work well on its own and does not requires specific support from its teammates, as its objective is basically to set up Stealth Rock and attack opposing Pokemon with Gyro Ball or cripple them with Toxic. However, Bronzong fits best on balanced teams that can take advantage of its resistances and durability. Water-types such as Suicune and Starmie appreciate Bronzong's ability to switch into almost any variant of Latias as well as Grass-types such as Celebi, while they deal with Bronzong's lone Fire-type weakness. The same goes for Swampert, but you should be careful about not giving Breloom too many opportunities to come in, as it can be relatively annoying to handle for balanced teams. If you're using Water-types alongside Bronzong, Pokemon such as Latias and Zapdos work well alongside the bell, as they are both great counters to Breloom and provide a welcome Fighting resistance. On top of that, Zapdos helps deal with Water-types, which give Bronzong some trouble. Therefore, a core of Bronzong + Zapdos + Starmie provides a great defensive balance with an interesting offensive synergy. More generally, Pokemon that can sponge attacks from Fire-types and force them out are always great teammates to consider. This makes any Dragon-type a great teammate. Dragonite helps deal with Breloom and Fire-type moves, but you should keep in mind that switching into Stealth Rock repeatedly can wear it down quickly.</p> <p>Tyranitar is always a good teammate because it is a solid check for Starmie and Rotom-A, provides support against Zapdos, and resists Fire-type moves while getting up sandstorm, which chips down some of Bronzong's checks, whereas Bronzong is immune to it. As for example, Starmie, Rotom-A, and Breloom are limited in their use by sand. Another support option to consider is Toxic Spikes, since it allows Bronzong to stall out Water-types and cripple foes like Infernape and Tyranitar. With the use of Protect and sand damage, it will be even more effective. Nidoqueen in particular is great at doing this job alongside Bronzong, as it provides a solid Fighting-type resistance and can switch into Zapdos or Tyranitar to put Toxic Spikes up. Heatran works well by its side, as it can sponge Fire-type attacks and take advantage of Toxic Spikes with moves like Substitute, Magma Storm, and Protect while completing a solid defensive core. You should consider covering the Water-type weakness, however. Rotom-A also makes great use of Toxic Spikes, since it can deny Starmie's Rapid Spin and make Tyranitar suffer when it switches into Thunderbolt alongside poison damage. As Bronzong lacks a reliable instant recovery move, Wish users such as Clefable, Jirachi, and even Latias can help improve its longevity.</p> <p>Skarmory is one of Bronzong's bigger threats due to its ability to stack Spikes freely against it. By annihilating Skarmory, Magnezone naturally provides great support. Magnezone also helps at dealing with other Steel-types such as Scizor, Jirachi, Bronzong, and even Swords Dance Lucario if running Choice Scarf. The combination of Magnezone and tank Bronzong works on both offensive and defensive teams. Dragon Dance Dragonite and Choice Specs Latias would make great additions for an offensive approach, while Milotic or defensive Latias would complete a synergistic defensive core. Finally, Starmie is another great teammate to consider for Rapid Spin, especially if you run Dragonite or Zapdos. It also covers Fire-type moves and carries Thunderbolt to weaken Water-types for Bronzong. Your own Electric- and Grass-types in general can also serve well to wear down and threaten bulky Water-types.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bronzong can pull off a great offensive pivot set. This set is designed to benefit the team by using every opportunity to switch in to set up Stealth Rock while remaining as threatening as possible in order not to get walled by defensive archetypes. The combination of great coverage, a strong STAB move in Gyro Ball, Explosion, and being almost impossible to one-shot is what makes Bronzong that reliable. Gyro Ball nails foes such as Gengar, Latias, Tyranitar, and Dragonite that struggle to break through Bronzong's uninvested defenses. Earthquake provides adequate coverage, as it is always a favorable option for nailing Heatran, Infernape, Metagross, and Magnezone. Explosion rounds out the set by allowing a teammate to switch in for free after Bronzong's job is done while possibly KOing an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment with Bronzong's natural base defensive stats gives it great all-around bulk, which lets it tank both physical and special attacks. Maximum Attack EVs, in addition to powering up Explosion, allow Bronzong to deal heavy damage to common switch-ins such as Starmie and Breloom, as well as OHKOing any non-Shuca Berry variant of Heatran and Magnezone and hitting Jirachi for a huge chunk with Earthquake. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to help Bronzong sponge Latias's Draco Meteor or Gengar's Shadow Ball. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs decreases Bronzong's Speed to make Gyro Ball stronger. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types and gives it a Spikes immunity. Occa Berry stops Bronzong from being forced out by Infernape and Heatran while providing more comfort against Dragonite and Jirachi's Fire-type coverage in order to set up Stealth Rock or use Explosion with more ease. Lum Berry can be a great item for a lead set, as it prevents sleep inducers such as Roserade and Breloom from statusing Bronzong and avoids confusion from Machamp. Assuming that no one will use a Ground-type move against Bronzong, Heatproof instead of Levitate is another option on a lead set that provides a free Occa Berry, allowing Bronzong to effectively run both Occa and Lum or Custap Berry. Alternatively, Leftovers is an option for increased longevity, while Custap Berry capitalizes on Bronzong's low Speed to set up Stealth Rock or go for a surprise KO with Explosion when it falls under 25% HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Bronzong into a Pokemon it checks or counters and proceed to set up Stealth Rock. Don't use Bronzong as a tank; it lacks staying power and does not have the required defensive investment to reliably check the threats it should check more than once. Thus, you should limit the number of times Bronzong switches in. If you find that Bronzong is not healthy enough to pivot anymore, using Explosion is a good exit door. Also, be careful about taking a Will-O-Wisp from a Rotom forme or using Explosion on it. Even if Bronzong is not supposed to survive for a long time, be careful not to waste Gyro Ball's PP too quickly. Gyro Ball should be used on more offensive Starmie and Earthquake on more defensive variants, as you do not want to waste your PP on a Pokemon that can Recover stall Gyro Ball. If you suspect your opponent to run an archetype that could feature Magnezone, try to scout potential Magnezone switch-ins with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Bronzong set tends to work well on its own and requires little support from its teammates. However, this set works great on teams that make heavy use of early Stealth Rock and benefit from the holes that Bronzong can potentially create. More precisely, Bronzong's ability to set Stealth Rock reliably against a wide variety of threats and force damage with Explosion makes it a nice fit for physically-based offense. Its ability to attract bulky Water-types and eliminate them provides any Tyranitar set more freedom when it enters the field. For example, Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up more confidently when foes like Suicune or Swampert are gone. Thanks to STAB Pursuit, Tyranitar can eliminate the prevalent Rotom-A and Starmie, which cause Bronzong some trouble. Also, Bronzong's Steel typing makes it immune to Tyranitar's sand, which on the other hand inflicts useful free chip damage on foes like bulky Water-types and Zapdos. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite are great options alongside it, since they both benefit from having bulky Water-, Ground-, and Steel-types being chipped down and a free entry onto the field after Bronzong's Explosion. They also provide a suitable answer to Fire-type moves, while Bronzong helps by tanking Rock-type moves and Draco-Meteor or Outrage from Choice Scarf Latias and Flygon they are vulnerable to. Additional physical attackers such as Metagross, Machamp, Lucario, Swampert, and Scizor are greatly appreciated by its side as they wear down shared counters. Choice Specs Kingdra can be interesting for any team running Bronzong, as it is capable of surprising physical walls, muscle through bulky Water-types such as Milotic or Suicune and check offensive threats that are the like of Heatran, Infernape or Starmie. Mixed Dragonite and Flygon are also both capable of putting high pressure on defensive cores that feature bulky Water-types, Electric-types such as Zapdos or Rest Talk Rotom and even Ground- or Steel-types that all give Bronzong troubles. In terms of managing Steel-types, Magnezone is an obvious teammate option as it instantly deletes Skarmory and provides suitable help against Jirachi, Scizor and opposing Bronzong. Finally, Bronzong's awful Speed tends to be exploited by Breloom which can incapacitate it with Spore, so having a way to deal with it is definitely great. Choice Specs Latias or Choice Band Dragonite with Sleep Talk resist any of Breloom's STAB attacks, can absorb Spore and OHKO it back with Draco Meteor or Outrage, respectively.</p>"

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>Spiritomb often faces stiff competition from the Rotom formes as a spinblocker due to their useful resistances, wide and unique movepools, and Levitate. However, unlike Rotom-A, it doesn't sport a nasty Dark-type weakness which can be exploited by physical behemoths such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Spiritomb is a solid and effective check to major threats such as Rotom-A, Machamp, Azelf, and Lucario, and access to Pressure further sets it apart from other bulky Ghost-types, as Spiritomb can PP stall many Pokemon to death. Spiritomb is also one of the only few true Machamp counters. Overall, Spiritomb has enough to set itself apart from the Rotom formes, and can function as an effective spinblocker even in the Standard environment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch is Spiritomb's strongest priority move, but is unreliable and has low PP, making it a bad choice for a mono-attacking option; Shadow Sneak might be considered for its reliability, but it is too weak to deal significant damage. Pain Split can be used to recover health as well as inflict damage, but Rest is more reliable. Taunt prevents Pokemon from setting up entry hazards and shuts down opposing walls. A Trick + Choice item set can be used to mess up various walls, though several other Pokemon outclass Spiritomb for this role. Finally, Spiritomb has boosting options in Calm Mind and Nasty Plot, but it's sadly too slow to sweep effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Heatran walks all over Spiritomb, as it resists both Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse while taking even Hidden Power Fighting comfortably, gets a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp, and can take it out with its powerful Fire-type attacks. Setup sweepers with Taunt, such as Gyarados, do a great job of checking Spiritomb as well, as they can shut it down completely and proceed to set up on it. Blissey doesn't mind taking a Will-O-Wisp thanks to Natural Cure, and laughs at Spiritomb's other attacks as well, though it can only slap a Toxic back on Spiritomb. Choice Band users such as Metagross, Dragonite, and Scizor can muscle through weakened Spiritomb with their sheer power, though they need to be careful when switching in, as Will-O-Wisp will severely cripple them. Finally, if Spiritomb lacks Taunt, Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress can freely switch in and use it as setup bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb's main attraction over Rotom-A is that it is not Pursuit bait, and this set aims to take advantage of that. Rest allows Spiritomb to recover HP while curing status. Sleep Talk as always, pairs well with Rest; it ensures that Spiritomb isn't a sitting duck for two turns, and if it selects Will-O-Wisp, Spiritomb can actually spread burns even when asleep. Will-O-Wisp shuts down most physical attackers, and the residual damage caused by the burn allows Spiritomb to wear down many threats. Shadow Ball is used as the STAB, mono-attacking option over Dark Pulse for two reasons: Spiritomb is too slow to abuse Dark Pulse's chance to flinch, and the occasional Special Defense drops afforded by Shadow Ball can actually force switches.</p> <p>Taunt can be used over Sleep Talk to prevent Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress from setting up entry hazards, as they are common switch-ins to Spiritomb. Hidden Power Fighting can replace Will-O-Wisp as it gives Spiritomb perfect coverage alongside Shadow Ball, but spreading burns and shutting down physical attackers are too good to pass up. Pursuit can be used over Shadow Ball with a Careful nature to make Spiritomb a better check to Gengar, Starmie, and Azelf. Alternative EV spreads can be used too: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature balances Spiritomb's defenses after inflicting a burn, and 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature to make Spiritomb a better physical wall.</p> <p>Though Spiritomb itself functions as a team player, it will need quite some support to be effective. Tanks such as Heatran and Blissey walk all over Spiritomb, as they can freely switch into Will-O-Wisp or Shadow Ball and wear it down, or in Blissey's case, force it to use Rest by hitting it with Toxic and switch to a counter. A strong Fighting-type thus makes a good teammate, as it can OHKO both of the aforementioned tanks. Infernape in particular also takes down Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress, who commonly use Spiritomb as setup bait, as well as Scizor, who can hurt Spiritomb with a Choice Band U-turn, making it an excellent partner for Spiritomb. Ironically, Blissey and Skarmory too make great teammates; the former sponges powerful special attacks for Spiritomb, while the latter sets up entry hazards that wear Spiritomb's checks down and Skarmory can OHKO Breloom with Brave Bird, who can prove to be troublesome with its immunity to Will-O-Wisp once Toxic Orb activates. Spiritomb also aids in safeguarding Skarmory's entry hazards with its ability to spinblock.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set is a gimmicky one, it works well when used properly. It is particularly useful on a stall team as the main purpose of this set is to wear down Pokemon using Curse and Will-O-Wisp. Since Spiritomb has three immunities and no weaknesses, it forces a lot of switches. Pursuit is therefore the preferred STAB move as its power doubles when the target switches out. This allows Spiritomb to trap various early and late game threats such as Gengar, Starmie, and Azelf, which are all weak to Pursuit. Spiritomb can also take on Pokemon that set-up later in the game, such as Snorlax and Suicune, with this set as it can wear them down very quickly with both Curse and Will-O-Wisp. This is also very helpful to stall teams which are unable to deal with set up Pokemon, especially when they are the last Pokemon left and cannot be phazed. These traits are the reasons to consider using Spiritomb over Rotom-A.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Spiritomb's Special Defense because Will-O-Wisp halves the burnt target's Attack, reducing the need to have a high Defense EVs investment. Shadow Ball with Calm nature can be used over Pursuit with Careful nature. Calm nature also helps in increasing Spiritomb's special bulk. However, Pursuit with a Careful nature is usually the better option.</p> <p>A cleric is highly recommended as this set does not carry Sleep Talk, leaving Spiritomb a setup bait as it sleeps for two turns after using Rest. Since Spiritomb often replaces Rotom-A, most teams do not have a reliable way to take down Skarmory and Gyarados. Therefore a Choice Scarf Jirachi with Thunder Punch helps in solving this problem. Gyarados has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp but it can hold a Lum Berry to cure its burn. A Rapid Spinner helps Spiritomb a lot because for Spiritomb to set up a Curse, it will need to be at a substantial amount of health. As far as teammates go, Blissey is a great option as it can wake Spiritomb from its slumber after the latter uses Rest or pass Wishes to Spiritomb. Several physical walls such as Steelix, Skarmory, and Forretress all make good teammates. They can also sponge physical attacks from foes which are not affected by Will-O-Wisp or have the Guts ability.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Lucario is one of the most dangerous attackers in the tier, ready to sweep at a moment’s notice. Its fantastic typing, incredible movepool including strong priority in Extreme Speed, and excellent offensive stats make it one of the premier Swords Dance users in the tier that every team must be aware of. An immunity to sand and poison and a 4x resistance to Stealth Rock make it resilient to residual damage, allowing it to be one of the few Pokemon able to run Life Orb consistently without a lot of drawbacks. As a Swords Dance sweeper, Lucario can pick and choose its defensive checks with its coverage moves, whether it be Crunch for Rotom-A and bulky Psychic-types like Latias and Celebi; Ice Punch for Gliscor, Dragonite, Latias, and Zapdos; or Bullet Punch for Gengar and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Lucario also is a premier Choice Scarf user due to outspeeding and KOing common Speed-boosting sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Gyarados, and Dragonite with its strong Close Combat and excellent coverage. Lucario also has excellent other sweeping options in Agility and Calm Mind that leave it with very different answers, potentially surprising standard counterplay.</p> <p>However, Lucario is held back by its decent base 90 Speed stat and its inability to run all of its options at once. Lucario is unfortunately both frail and not very fast, meaning many offensive Pokemon such as Rotom-A, Gliscor, Latias, Jirachi, Gengar, and Flygon outspeed and threaten to KO it, especially after it drops its defensive stats with Close Combat. This is made worse by the fact that Lucario often wants the extra power from Adamant to break through Pokemon such as physically Skarmory at +2, meaning even more Pokemon such as offensive Suicune outspeed it. Even with good defensive typing, sweeping Lucario sets are often relegated to very aggressive teams, as it doesn’t provide much defensive utility due to its frailty and common weaknesses. This is exacerbated by Lucario being a Steel-type that doesn't check Latias and is itself checked by the faster Jirachi, typically responsibilities of a Steel-type. Lucario is also a victim of its own success, as defensive teams often have multiple checks, and more offensive teams almost always have multiple Fighting-type answers and a Pokemon resistant to Extreme Speed that can finish off Lucario, such as Fire Punch Jirachi or Scizor. Even with all of this, there are some Pokemon Lucario badly struggles to break unless it has a specific moveset, such as Gliscor, faster Jirachi, Choice Scarf Magnezone or Magneton, and faster priority users like Mach Punch Infernape. Choice Scarf Lucario struggles against defensive teams due to its relatively weak Close Combat and relies heavily on prediction, as its moves can be easily punished if not chosen carefully. Theoretically, Lucario could deal with a lot of these issues; however, it is limited by four moveslots and cannot carry everything it needs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lucario's great offenses mean it could use a wide variety of additional offensive moves, such as Agility, Calm Mind, and other attacks such as Thunder Punch and Stone Edge to maximize its coverage as an all-out attacker. All of these options appreciate entry hazard support to make up for the lack of Swords Dance's power. Agility boosts Lucario's Speed to negate the need for priority, as it gets the jump on all revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Rotom-A, Gliscor, and Choice Scarf Magnezone and can KO them with the appropriate coverage option. Such a set is effective against offensive teams but struggles with power against walls such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, Zapdos, Latias, and Skarmory. Calm Mind surprises these walls with boosted special coverage coming from Lucario's higher Special Attack stat. +1 Lucario is strong enough to have a chance to OHKO Clefable with Aura Sphere and has good coverage with options such as Dragon Pulse, Shadow Ball, Vacuum Wave, and various Hidden Power types. While surprising, such a set still struggles to OHKO various walls and doesn't ameliorate Lucario's issues with Speed. All-out attacking Lucario sets focus on using options to beat Flying-types; Thunder Punch OHKOes Gyarados without a Wacan Berry, Stone Edge hits physically defensive Zapdos very hard, and having the additional coverage move can be very surprising in general. Lucario also has destructively strong Choice Specs and Choice Band sets, as its sand immunity and great movepool allow it disguise itself effectively. Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast can OHKO Pokemon such as Clefable, physically defensive Hippowdon, and offensive Jirachi, while Choice Band Lucario hits hard immediately and can 2HKO offensive Flying-types such as Gyarados. However, Lucario often wants to fully take advantage of its movepool without the restrictions of a Choice item.</p> <p>Lucario has a humongous movepool, and various niche options such as Counter + Focus Sash, Reversal, Me First, and Magnet Rise all have merit on individual sets. However, Lucario struggles to fit all of its options as is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types</strong>: Gliscor, Zapdos, and Gyarados are fantastic general answers to Lucario. Gliscor is typically thought of first as the best Lucario check in the tier, as it is faster, neutral to Stealth Rock, and very physically bulky even without investment and swiftly OHKOes Lucario with Earthquake. Zapdos and Gyarados need a lot of investment to take Lucario's attacks and are typically slower, but they can easily OHKO it with Heat Wave and Earthquake, respectively, and only fear the very rare Stone Edge or Thunder Punch in Gyarados's case. Lucario can get around all of these Pokemon—Shuca Berry or Agility + Ice Punch beats Gliscor, while even physically defensive Zapdos and Gyarados don't enjoy Lucario's attacks + Stealth Rock. These Pokemon also take a lot from +2 Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom-A and Gengar are also excellent checks to Lucario, as they are immune to both Close Combat and Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf Rotom-A is often thought of as the other best Lucario check in the tier, as it outspeeds it, resists Bullet Punch, and OHKOes it with Overheat or Thunderbolt after a Special Defense drop from Close Combat. Defensive Rotom-A walls Lucario if it doesn't have Crunch and burns it. Gengar outspeeds Lucario and OHKOes it with Focus Blast. However, Lucario can deal with both of these Pokemon, as it OHKOes Rotom-A with +2 Crunch and OHKOes Gengar with +2 Bullet Punch or Crunch on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Since Lucario hits so hard, outspeeding and revenge killing it is often the best course of action instead of surviving its attacks. Jirachi, Choice Scarf Magnezone and Magneton, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are all great checks, as they resist Extreme Speed and KO Lucario after it has dropped its defenses with Close Combat. Jirachi is notable in that it naturally outspeeds Lucario, while Choice Scarf Magnezone and Magneton guarantee -1 Lucario's removal as they outspeed and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Other faster Pokemon such as Flygon, Timid Suicune, Latias, and Starmie outspeed Lucario, but they take a lot of damage from +2 Extreme Speed and fall to Agility Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Extremely Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While +2 Lucario is incredibly strong, extraordinarily bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Hippowdon, Celebi, Uxie, Cresselia, and Skarmory can survive a hit and incapacitate Lucario. Physically defensive Hippowdon, Uxie, and Cresselia are notable in that they are the only Pokemon in the tier Lucario has no chance to OHKO with a physical attack at +2 after Stealth Rock. These Pokemon and others such as Swampert, Nidoqueen, Metagross, and Latias can survive multiple unboosted attacks from Lucario and KO it back. Note that Lucario often needs the right coverage move to threaten these Pokemon and falls flat if it doesn't have it: without Crunch, it can't even 2HKO Celebi, Uxie, and Cresselia, while it needs Ice Punch to threaten Nidoqueen, Gliscor, and Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Lucario despises burn and paralysis, as the former completely ruins it and the latter exposes its poor defenses to many more Pokemon. Rotom-A walls Lucario lacking Crunch and burns it, while Latias, Celebi, Jirachi, Uxie, and Cresselia can survive a hit and paralyze it. Even Pokemon Lucario OHKOes such as Clefable and Blissey can use Thunder Wave on a predicted Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Breloom, Infernape, Dragonite, and Scizor are notable in that they force Lucario to use Extreme Speed itself lest they hit it very hard with priority. Infernape is notable in that it naturally outspeeds Lucario and OHKOes it with Mach Punch after a Defense drop, while bulkier Breloom, Dragonite, and Scizor survive Extreme Speed and hit very hard with their priority attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance pushes Lucario's Attack to dangerous heights, with physically defensive Skarmory being OHKOed by a neutral +2 Adamant Close Combat and only extremely bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Hippowdon able to survive it. The Attack boost makes slower counterplay difficult, as Lucario hits incredibly hard and has all of the coverage moves it could want to handle Fighting-type answers. Close Combat is quite effective even without a boost, as it easily OHKOes Clefable, Tyranitar, Heatran, Magnezone, and Empoleon and 3HKOes Flying-types such as offensive Zapdos, Gyarados, and Dragonite, making it difficult for them to continually stomach it with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p>Extreme Speed picks off faster Pokemon, being strong enough to OHKO even bulkier revenge killers such as Flygon and Latias after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost. It is also critical to ward off other slower priority users such as Breloom and weakened Scizor. Bullet Punch is prominent for handling Gengar and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as it OHKOes both after Stealth Rock at +2. Another option is Crunch, as it OHKOes RestTalk Rotom-A and Latias and has a 50% chance to OHKO defensive Celebi after Stealth Rock. Finally, Ice Punch OHKOes Lucario’s most prominent check in Gliscor while also hitting Latias, Zapdos, Celebi, and Dragonite very hard. Note that the only mandatory moves are Swords Dance and Close Combat—feel free to mix and match moves as needed, though Lucario often sorely wants priority.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs is perfect for Lucario, as it doesn’t have much bulk and aims to hit as hard and fast as possible. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it helps OHKO very bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory and defensive Latias with +2 Close Combat and Crunch, respectively. However, Jolly has merit to outspeed Pokemon such as offensive Suicune, most other Lucario, slower Gliscor, and Rotom-A. This is especially relevant when running Ice Punch, as Lucario now outpaces slower Gliscor and Modest Zapdos, threatening to OHKO them after a Swords Dance boost. Note that Lucario should never use Steadfast and instead use Inner Focus, as the Speed boost is nullified by paralysis that flinching is often accompanied with.</p> <p>Lucario has a number of other items it could use, such as Shuca Berry to lure in and KO checks such as Gliscor. It also allows it to barely survive boosted Earthquakes. Salac Berry is an option alongside Endure over the priority move to outspeed many revenge killers, Lum Berry prevents foes such as defensive Latias from statusing it, and Focus Sash can be run either in the lead spot or alongside heavy anti-entry hazard support to survive one strong hit and remove the foe. However, Lucario often sorely misses the raw power of Life Orb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario is effective just wallbreaking with Close Combat and only sweeping with Swords Dance if it has the opportunity. Combined with Stealth Rock, few Pokemon can safely switch into Lucario’s Close Combat, so just using it when it gets the opportunity can get a lot of value. Try to get Lucario in on 4x resisted attacks or on predicted switches, as it is really frail; even strong resisted attacks such as Choice Specs Latias’s Draco Meteor can do upwards to 75% to it. Lucario’s coverage moves can often be unexpected due to the sheer range of options it has, so leverage this to get the KO you need. The perfect time to set up Swords Dance is on predicted switches or on Choice-locked attacks such as Tyranitar’s Pursuit or -2 Choice Scarf Latias's Draco Meteor. As a result, opponents can often be desperate to prevent Lucario from setting up, such as using Encore or Thunder Wave with Clefable rather than letting Lucario get a Swords Dance uncontested. Use this to your advantage to get easy KOs or potentially set up and win the game immediately. Be careful of Choice Scarf Magnezone and Magneton, as they can come in after Lucario uses Close Combat and remove it. Note that a 2x resisted Close Combat outdamages a neutral Extreme Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lucario is commonly paired with a two different types of Pokemon: the first are frail Dark-weak Pokemon such as Gengar, Latias, Starmie, and Rotom-A that bait Choice item Tyranitar into Pursuit so it can get a free Swords Dance. The second are very aggressive teammates that can take advantage of the holes it creates in defensive cores and the predictable ways opponents try to check it. Choice item Latias is one of its best partners, as not only does it bait in Tyranitar to trap it, Trick can also lock a wall into a weak attack that lets Lucario set up. Other common Tyranitar targets such as Gengar and Rotom-A can also burn Jirachi, making it much less effective in answering Lucario. On a similar note, Lucario appreciates Tyranitar itself, especially if Lucario drops Crunch and is walled by bulkier Ghost- and Psychic-types. Tyranitar also helps answer Zapdos and Latias, while sand can put faster Pokemon such as Starmie and Latias in range of Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Lucario also appreciates very aggressive teammates that can take advantage of the holes it generates. Specially offensive teammates such as Heatran and Empoleon often bait in special walls for Lucario to take advantage of, while Dragon Dance Gyarados, Metagross, and Scizor enjoy Lucario's ability to simply OHKO physical walls like Skarmory with a boosted Close Combat. Trick + Iron Ball Metagross is particularly good partner, as Trick commonly targets Lucario checks like Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Jirachi. Lucario also is helpful on Spikes-based offense teams, as the chip damage wears down grounded targets that can commonly take an unboosted Close Combat. Offensive Skarmory is the premier Spiker, and other good teammates such as mixed Flygon are great alongside Lucario. Finally, Lucario also fits alongside extensive paralysis support, as it can mitigate its issue with Speed. Common partners include Uxie, Starmie, Jirachi, and Zapdos.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lucario's resistance to residual damage, fantastic coverage, and good Speed tier make it a strong revenge killer. Close Combat does solid damage to most offensive Pokemon, always OHKOing Tyranitar and pressuring Heatran and Empoleon. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch are solid coverage moves: Thunder Punch OHKOes offensive Gyarados without a Wacan Berry or considerable bulk, and Ice Punch does the same to Dragonite unless it has an Yache Berry as well as hitting Gliscor, Latias, and Zapdos hard.</p> <p>As these three moves have perfect coverage for what it needs to revenge kill, Lucario has a number of options in the last slot. Crunch is the most prominent of these, as it OHKOes Gengar after Stealth Rock and a turn of sand and 2HKOes Rotom-A. Lucario is also the best user of Copycat in the tier, having the speed to use helpful moves such as U-turn, Explosion, and Spikes before the foe can interrupt it. Note that it no longer repeatedly uses the last used move and fails if it copies the same move twice. As Lucario is ineffective against defensive teams, another option is Swords Dance. As Lucario is an excellent switch-in against Knock Off Clefable, it can take advantage of losing its item to set up a Swords Dance and threaten defensive teams with its coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lucario needs near-maximum Speed and Attack EVs and a Jolly nature to always outspeed and threaten +1 Gyarados and +1 Dragonite, Rotom-A, and neutral-natured faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Jirachi and Flygon. It can run an Adamant nature, but being outsped by these Pokemon is not worth the marginal extra attacking power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario should generally avoid switching in on attacks unless it 4x resists them, as it very frail, and taking a lot of damage switching leaves it vulnerable to priority from Scizor, opposing Lucario, and Dragonite. Try to switch Lucario in as a threat such as Tyranitar and Gyarados use Dragon Dance, as it will outspeed and threaten them out. Note that Lucario OHKOes Tyranitar through Chople Berry after Stealth Rock but only OHKOes Wacan Berry Gyarados after two rounds of Stealth Rock. Against more offensive teams, Lucario can make a lot of progress just using Close Combat with Stealth Rock up if the opponent doesn't have a Ghost-type. Typical Fighting-type switch-ins on these teams often don't have recovery and are weak to Stealth Rock. However, against more defensive teams, Lucario doesn't have a lot to do besides switching into Clefable, as it is easily walled. Try to be very aggressive in these scenarios, using its health to weaken walls or potentially using Copycat to copy Explosion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Lucario needs heavy support to be worth it, as its attacks other than Close Combat don't hit very hard. Lucario's teammates need to be strong against defensive teams, as it struggles even more than most Choice Scarf Pokemon. Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar, entry hazards, and stallbreakers such as Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar are helpful to neuter bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Gengar is an especially good partner, as it often forces in Clefable to use Knock Off and get rid of Lucario's Choice Scarf. Other good Spikes partners such as Choice Specs Latias and Jirachi are also welcome. Latias and Gengar also draw in Dark-types, which gives Lucario a chance to switch in.</p> <p>Lucario's prowess against very offensive teams facilitates teammates that invite in opposing setup sweepers. Roserade is a good example, as it struggles to deal with Dragon Dance sweepers and can support Lucario with Spikes. Despite this, Lucario does appreciate some backup against specifically Gyarados, as Wacan Berry variants survive Thunder Punch and KO it back. Defensive Rotom-A, Suicune, and Skarmory and good back up answers to Gyarados. Lucario also enjoys support from Tyranitar in removing Ghost-types to use Close Combat more effectively.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame. With its gargantuan HP and Defense and Ground typing, Hippowdon is one of the best defensive answers to Tyranitar, which can almost never 2HKO Hippowdon without a way to boost its damage output like Choice Band, Expert Belt, or Dragon Dance. In addition, depending on whether it's physically or specially defensive, Hippowdon can wall a large portion of the metagame. Its ability, Sand Stream, is extremely desirable, as it forces constant chip damage on almost all Pokemon that are not Rock-, Ground-, or Steel-types. Thanks to Hippowdon's access to an instant recovery move in Slack Off coupled with its bulk, its longevity is near unrivaled. With access to great utility in Stealth Rock and Roar, Hippowdon functions as a fantastic, consistent support option.</p> <p>However, Hippowdon is extremely slow and can be passive even with its STAB-boosted Earthquake, so it's not difficult to offensively pressure it. Water- and Grass-types give Hippowdon an extremely hard time, especially the latter, which resist its Earthquake. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Calm Mind Suicune can put tremendous pressure on Hippowdon, as staying in to phaze them, whether by choice or by necessity, can result in sustaining a ton of damage. Skarmory can use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, which Hippowdon detests. There are very few Pokemon that despise status more than Hippowdon, as poison and burn make it significantly worse at doing its job.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippowdon can utilize Curse to be a potent defensive setup sweeper alongside Earthquake, Ice Fang, and Slack Off. Crunch can be used to maim Gengar and take it by surprise, as well as perhaps fish for Defense drops on foes like Clefable and Blissey, but its use is quite limited, and it's still risky to stay in versus Gengar and take a Will-O-Wisp. Fire Fang can be used to hit Scizor and Forretress, while Thunder Fang can hit Gyarados, but there are much better checks available for these Pokemon. A more offensive set with Stone Edge can take Zapdos and Gyarados by surprise, but Zapdos can likely survive Stone Edge regardless of how offensive the Hippowdon is. Protect has potential to scout Choice item users and gain health over time, but there isn't usually room to fit this move, and Slack Off is better overall. Superpower can be used to surprise Blissey and Clefable, which can do serious damage with some offensive investment. Hippowdon can create greater than 100 HP Substitutes to set up on Blissey and Clefable, but it usually doesn't gain enough mileage off of Substitute to justify it. Stockpile can make Hippowdon nearly impossible to KO without a critical hit, but sets with this move are so passive that the opponent gets many opportunities to find a critical hit or set up Spikes, Calm Mind, or even Dragon Dance. Yawn can function as a pseudo-phazing move that forces foes out with the threat of sleep, but Roar is generally better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, Starmie, Empoleon, Milotic, and Kingdra can deal devastating damage to any Hippowdon, while Hippowdon doesn't strongly threaten these Pokemon back outside of Earthquake against Empoleon, which it likely won't get an opportunity to use anyway due to Empoleon's powerful Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Celebi, Breloom, Roserade, and Shaymin can use Hippowdon to set up with the threat of their strong STAB or utility moves. Hippowdon can't deal significant damage to these Pokemon outside of Roserade and Breloom with Ice Fang. In Breloom's case, depending on its bulk, the damage may not even be that significant.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Ground-immune Pokemon can often take advantage of Hippowdon's passiveness to set up. Gliscor can use Knock Off or set up Swords Dance without minding Ice Fang that much in many cases. Gengar doesn't take too much from Ice Fang and can fire off Shadow Ball repeatedly, which Hippowdon may have difficulty combating. Gyarados can set up Dragon Dance and fire off a powerful STAB-boosted Waterfall. Dragonite can find its way in and terrorize Hippowdon with Outrage and Draco Meteor depending on how much defensive investment it has. Latias doesn't mind Ice Fang too much and can use Surf to deal significant damage to Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status is especially effective versus Hippowdon, and a large number of Pokemon can take advantage of this to cripple it, often by surprise. Zapdos and Flygon can use Toxic to prevent Hippowdon from walling them. Gengar and Rotom-A can use Will-O-Wisp to put Hippowdon on a timer. Toxic Spikes users like Roserade and Nidoqueen can also force Hippowdon to take poison.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick users</strong>: Clefable and Gliscor can use Knock Off to remove Hippowdon's Leftovers, which dampens its ability to defensively answer Tyranitar, Dragonite, Infernape, and especially Jirachi. Trick can accomplish the same feat but can cripple it even further by giving it a Choice item, which makes it near impossible to defensively answer anything reliably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hippowdon has the most physical bulk of any Pokemon in OU, and this set takes that to its highest potential. With unparalleled Defense, Hippowdon can shrug off attacks from some of the strongest physical attackers in the tier, like Tyranitar, Infernape, Metagross, and Machamp. In addition, it completely shuts down physical variants of Jirachi, taking very little damage even from a fully invested Iron Head. Hippowdon is a great Stealth Rock user, being able to set it up against a large range of Pokemon, like the aforementioned strong physical attackers. Slack Off gives Hippowdon instant recovery that takes its longevity to great heights, enabling it to wall a large portion of the metagame. Earthquake is its strongest STAB move, which is great because Ground-type STAB moves are desirable in the metagame. Roar is a fantastic option because Hippowdon is capable of phazing a large range of Pokemon due to its supreme bulk. Roar can also compensate for Hippowdon's passivity by wearing down foes with chip damage from Stealth Rock and sand, and it can be used in a pinch to stop dangerous setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and even Breloom from setting up. As an alternative, Ice Fang gives Hippowdon great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting important targets like Dragon-types and Gliscor and even doing a decent job at wearing down Gengar as it switches in.</p> <p>If another Pokemon on your team has Stealth Rock, you could opt for both Roar and Ice Fang or even a move like Toxic, which can be extremely useful against foes like opposing Hippowdon, Zapdos, Gyarados, and Milotic. You'll likely find that this is a rare occurrence, however, because even if a Pokemon like Clefable already has Stealth Rock on a defensive team, it can be useful to use Stealth Rock on Hippowdon as well to cover the physical attackers that Clefable cannot set it up on; Clefable in turn can cover the special attackers that prevent Hippowdon from setting Stealth Rock, like Starmie and Empoleon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense are necessary to shut down Tyranitar, Machamp, and Iron Head Jirachi as well as possible. There is definitely potential for some Special Defense EVs, which may improve Hippowdon's durability versus surprise special attacks like Tyranitar's Ice Beam and Jirachi's Grass Knot; however, sacrificing physical bulk will make a significant difference, as in practice, Hippowdon will switch into a large range of physical attackers. Also, with maximum physical bulk, Hippowdon can sometimes survive some of the most devastating physical attacks, like +2 Lucario's Close Combat and even Metagross's Explosion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It can be beneficial to conceal Roar or Ice Fang for as long as possible, as revealing it later can catch a Pokemon like Dragonite, mixed Flygon, or Dragon Dance Gyarados off guard. Many Ground-immune Pokemon can offensively pressure Hippowdon due to its inability to hit them with a strong attack, so keeping it healthy throughout a battle with Slack Off is essential in case of a surprise like a critical hit. Conserve Earthquake PP if possible, as it can be valuable in pressuring Clefable and Jirachi in a matchup against a defensive team. Using Roar aggressively can be very rewarding and compensate for Hippowdon enabling Pokemon to set up on it and even catch aggressive double switches from your opponent. Try to keep Hippowdon unstatused for as long as possible, as a burn from the likes of Gengar and Rotom-A, poison from Toxic Spikes, or Toxic from Zapdos and Bronzong can make Hippowdon significantly less effective.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon definitely requires some support to function well. Counterplay against Spikes and Toxic Spikes is very appreciated. Bulkier variants of Starmie can take on Swampert and Gyarados and also provide crucial Rapid Spin support. Magnezone is great to trap and remove Skarmory, which is one of the Pokemon that can exploit Hippowdon the most. In addition, Magnezone can paralyze Jirachi, which can dampen its ability to potentially take Hippowdon down through flinches, and also remove Bronzong with a Magnet Rise set. Latias has fantastic type synergy with Hippowdon with its Water and Grass resistances and can bring a lot of support to the table. A Sleep Talk set can absorb sleep from Breloom and Roserade, while bulkier utility sets can provide Thunder Wave, Reflect, and even Toxic support. Wish + Protect Jirachi, with a Careful nature in particular, can spread paralysis with Body Slam and take on annoyances like Gengar and special attacking Water-types. Roserade takes on Water-types like Kingdra, Empoleon, and Suicune, can set up entry hazards, clears Toxic Spikes with its Poison typing, and absorbs status. Clefable has fantastic defensive synergy with Hippowdon; it can absorb any Will-O-Wisp or Toxic that is thrown at Hippowdon, which makes the combination of the two incredibly difficult to break. Hippowdon also takes on physical attackers like Tyranitar, Infernape, and even Dragonite, while Clefable handles special attackers like Starmie, Empoleon, and Roserade. Both Hippowdon and Clefable are weak to Breloom, however, so a Breloom check works very well with these two. Zapdos is a great teammate for Hippowdon in general, as its defensive utility to answer Gyarados and Swampert is valuable. Skarmory also combines very well defensively with Hippowdon, helping to handle dangerous setup sweepers like Gyarados and Dragonite. In addition, it can set up Spikes to support Hippowdon wearing down foes with Roar. Gliscor surprisingly works very well with Hippowdon despite compounding Water- and Ice-type weaknesses. It doubles down on Tyranitar, Lucario, and Flygon while providing great utility in Taunt, Knock Off, and even Ice Fang.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Specially defensive Hippowdon is a behemoth capable of shrugging off some of the most powerful special attacks in the metagame, such as Dragonite's Draco Meteor, Gengar's Shadow Ball, and Infernape's Fire Blast. Stealth Rock fits well on Hippowdon, as it can use its monstrous bulk to set it up against a number of Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Infernape. In addition, Hippowdon can use its enhanced Special Defense to wear down bulky Starmie with Earthquake, as an uninvested Surf does not do that much damage. This can be essential in an entry hazard war against a Starmie team. Slack Off enables Hippowdon to maximize its capabilities against Dragonite, Flygon, and Infernape while also maximizing its longevity. Ice Fang is preferred to take advantage of its matchup against mixed Dragon-types while also hitting Gliscor. Roar is a fantastic alternative option; however, it is more risky to use it against a foe like Dragon Dance Gyarados or Dragonite because of this set's lack of investment in Defense.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hippowdon wants as much Special Defense as possible to take Draco Meteor from the likes of Dragonite, Flygon, and Latias as well as possible. In addition, it can take advantage of maximum investment in bulk to take on Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat from the lead position. There is potential to use a bit of Defense with an Impish nature while still heavily investing in Special Defense to improve Hippowdon's matchup versus Dragon Dance Dragonite; however, it will lose out on a significant amount of special bulk by changing from a Careful to an Impish nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible, especially when facing foes like mixed Flygon, Dragonite, and Gengar. Avoid status from the likes of Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Toxic Zapdos, and even Body Slam Jirachi when trying to answer these Pokemon. If your team cannot clear Toxic Spikes, try to send Hippowdon in before two layers have gone up. Although it detests even regular poison, being badly poisoned means Hippowdon is dead weight a large majority of the time. Keep Ice Fang concealed until the right moment to increase your likelihood of confirming a hit on a key target. Once Ice Fang has been revealed, liberally using it in more slow-paced matchups to fish for a freeze can be a good idea.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Skarmory is a great teammate, as these two walls have fantastic synergy, and Spikes support is helpful to compensate for Hippowdon's passiveness against Pokemon with a resistance or immunity to Ground. Gliscor can help with Choice Band Tyranitar, which can be a bit overwhelming for specially defensive Hippowdon; in return, Hippowdon can use its enhanced Special Defense to take on Ice Beam variants of mixed Tyranitar. Calm Mind Clefable can work wonderfully to patch up stall weaknesses that may be incurred with Hippowdon while also checking Dragon Dance Gyarados. Celebi and Roserade are useful teammates to combat Water-types like Swampert and Empoleon. Roserade's ability to lay down entry hazards and absorb Toxic Spikes also greatly benefits Hippowdon. Magnezone's ability to trap and remove Skarmory is great to prevent too many layers of Spikes from making Hippowdon's job more difficult. Latias, especially with some Defense, can support Hippowdon very well. Alternatively, a Sleep Talk set can help to compensate for Hippowdon's Breloom weakness.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow is a unique Pokemon due to its signature ability in Snow Warning allowing it to summon hail upon entry and therefore progressively wear down the wide majority of Pokemon in the metagame, including the omnipresent Steel-types, which can be a huge asset for teams that capitalize on residual damage. Its unique Ice / Grass typing further expands its utility by making it one of the most reliable answers to bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Starmie, Swampert, Milotic, and Empoleon. Furthermore, while Abomasnow's offensive stats are nothing to write home about, it can make up for that thanks to its powerful STAB attack in Wood Hammer, a very useful priority Ice Shard, and a perfectly accurate Blizzard under hail, which can turn it into an offensive threat.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Abomasnow's unimpressive defensive stats and lackluster Speed coupled with its crippling weaknesses to Steel, Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Bug leave it vulnerable to a plethora of metagame staples such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, Heatran, Infernape, and Metagross. The lack of a reliable recovery move and Stealth Rock weakness further cut into Abomasnow's survivability. While hail support can be extremely useful, it is a double-edged sword because it also wears down Abomasnow's teammates over time, since they're unlikely to have an Ice typing themselves to fully take advantage of it. As a result, Abomasnow usually needs a considerable amount of support and therefore is difficult to fit onto a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb is a less powerful but safer alternative to Wood Hammer, but the loss in power is so drastic against Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Clefable that it is not advised. Worry Seed can bother Pokemon that could take advantage of Abomasnow such as Jirachi, Scizor, Bronzong, and especially Clefable by changing their ability. Substitute can be used effectively alongside Leech Seed and hail damage to put the opponent in a very undesirable position, but Abomasnow's poor Speed, bulk, and typing make this strategy very challenging to pull off. Swords Dance can turn Abomasnow into a sweeper, but it is easily revenge killed and walled by a lot of Pokemon and usually requires too much support to be worth the trouble. Choice Scarf makes Abomasnow's Speed less of an issue and allows it to reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Rain Dance Kingdra, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and common priority moves and inability to revenge kill common sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragonite, and Agility Metagross leave it outclassed as a Choice Scarf user. Abomasnow can use Choice Specs to get a very powerful Blizzard alongside coverage moves such as Energy Ball, Earth Power, and Focus Blast, but its poor Speed, lack of Leftovers, and competition with other special wallbreakers mean that it usually isn't worth the trouble.</p> <p>Other moves such as Light Screen, Grass Whistle, Block, and Icy Wind can have some sort of application, but they usually are too situational or unreliable to justify their use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: As they resist Abomasnow's STAB attacks and hit it super effectively, Steel-types are naturally solid answers to it. Scizor fears next to nothing from it and can freely use U-turn, inflict severe damage with a Choice Band-boosted Pursuit upon it switching out, or set up Swords Dance against it, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire. Forretress can also set up several layers of Spikes against it. Bronzong walls Abomasnow entirely and can set up Trick Room or Stealth Rock in front of it. Metagross and Jirachi threaten to OHKO Abomasnow with Meteor Mash or Fire Punch, but they cannot take Earthquake from offensive Abomasnow well. Skarmory can lay Spikes down against Abomasnow without much issue as long as it is not packing Blizzard, and even then, specially defensive variants can heal off the damage and burn its PP. Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind that all of these Pokemon don't appreciate getting their health sapped by hail and Leech Seed, especially the ones that rely on Leftovers to recover.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: As long as they avoid Earthquake on the switch in, Heatran and Infernape threaten Abomasnow with an OHKO. However, a combination of hail and Leech Seed wears them down fairly quickly, and Infernape doesn't like taking Wood Hammer or Blizzard either. While uncommon, Moltres is an interesting check to Abomasnow, as it can avoid Leech Seed with Substitute and stall out Blizzard PP thanks to Pressure or simply force Abomasnow out with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: By removing hail upon entering the field, Tyranitar denies Abomasnow's recovery from Leftovers and can proceed to threaten it with Stone Edge, Fire Blast, or Superpower. Tyranitar can also hit Abomasnow very hard with Pursuit if it tries to switch out. Nonetheless, Wood Hammer can net a potential OHKO on most Tyranitar variants, and if it doesn't, Tyranitar will still be in range of an Ice Shard follow-up.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Lucario can attempt to set up a Swords Dance in front of Abomasnow thanks to its part-Steel typing and proceed to OHKO it with Close Combat, but it should be wary of Earthquake, which can prevent it from doing so. Although it'd rather avoid Ice Shard and needs to stay away from Blizzard, Breloom can put Abomasnow to sleep, hit it hard with Mach Punch before it can retaliate with Ice Shard, or set Substitute. Breloom also doesn't mind hail much due to Poison Heal. Machamp, Heracross, and Gallade can OHKO Abomasnow with their respective STAB attacks, but they take a significant amount from its attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Other Knock Off Users</strong>: As Abomasnow doesn't have a reliable recovery move, Leftovers recovery is key to its longevity, and getting hit by Knock Off is therefore very detrimental. Thanks to Magic Guard, Clefable doesn't care about hail and Leech Seed and thus can switch into Abomasnow and deny its attempt to regain health. From there, Clefable can cripple Abomasnow with Encore, Knock Off, or status effects or start to set up with Calm Mind, but it should be wary of a Wood Hammer from maximum Attack Abomasnow, which 2HKOes non physically-defensive variants. Abomasnow also has to worry about Knock Off when trying to switch into Pokemon such as Gliscor, Empoleon, and Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: While they all have to stay out of Ice Shard range and want to stay away from Blizzard, Heat Wave Zapdos, Gengar, Choice Specs Latias, Stone Edge Gyarados, Hidden Power Fire Shaymin, and Togekiss can all force Abomasnow out with their offensive moves.</p> <p><strong>Status and Entry Hazards</strong>: As a Pokemon that relies on passive recovery to regain health, any form of residual damage greatly bothers Abomasnow. Toxic poison prevents it from stalling anything, burn from Will-O-Wisp outdamages Leftovers recovery and hampers its offensive presence, and entry hazards, mainly Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, make it difficult to bring Abomasnow onto the field safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Leech Seed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This variant of Abomasnow aims to offer as much utility as it can get into a single set. Leech Seed is Abomasnow's main recovery move and provides passive damage in addition to hail, a combination that wears down the opposing Pokemon at a significant rate. The recovery granted by Leech Seed also aids Abomasnow's teammates if it is forced out by a powerful Pokemon such as Infernape. Abomasnow is also a good user of this move because its secondary Ice typing can discourage opposing Grass-types from trying to absorb Leech Seed. Protect pairs nicely with Leech Seed, as it allows Abomasnow to gain additional recovery for free while the opposing Pokemon is slowly losing its health. It also scouts which move a Choice item user will lock into, which is especially useful against strong super effective attackers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor, and can also be a nice tool against Gyarados lacking Stone Edge and Taunt, as it ensures that Abomasnow can't be hit by Bounce.</p> <p>Wood Hammer is the strongest Grass-type STAB attack available to hit Water-types that Abomasnow is supposed to counter. It also threatens Tyranitar with a potential OHKO and 2HKOes maximum HP Clefable, which could be tempted to switch in and deny Abomasnow's Leech Seed. Ice Shard OHKOes Flygon and non-Yache Berry Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage and a round of hail while dealing substantial damage to Pokemon such as Gliscor, Roserade, and Latias and threatening to revenge kill severely weakened Pokemon. Blizzard is an option to punish defensive variants of Zapdos, Skarmory, Togekiss, and Hidden Power Fire Celebi in case they're trying to fight Abomasnow while being a significantly stronger move overall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The recovery provided by Leftovers is invaluable for Abomasnow's survivability. 252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature are needed to get the aforementioned KOs with Wood Hammer and Ice Shard. The remaining EVs are placed into HP and Special Defense to retain sufficient bulk to handle most Water-types. Investing in Speed can be considered to get the jump on uninvested Swampert, Clefable, and Tyranitar. 16 EVs in Speed is usually the minimum if outspeeding those Pokemon is desired, but more EVs can be spent to outspeed Skarmory and Pokemon that sit around the base 70 Speed tier, mainly Tyranitar. Alternatively, if Blizzard is chosen over Ice Shard, Abomasnow can use a more bulky spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Sassy nature to get as much special bulk as possible, which allows Abomasnow to check Rain Dance Kingdra, Choice Scarf Latias, and offensive variants of Rotom-A more effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Abomasnow in on foes it is suited to handle, mainly Water-types such as Starmie, Swampert, Suicune, Empoleon, and Milotic. Abomasnow can also take care of Raikou lacking Aura Sphere, Zapdos without Heat Wave or Hidden Power Flying, and most variants of Gliscor. From there, it can spread Leech Seed and get chip damage on the opposing Pokemon, which, in tandem with hail and Protect, can quickly wear down Steel-types, which are tempted to come in on Abomasnow. Depending on the opposing team, sending Abomasnow out as soon as possible to set up hail early can be a good idea, especially if the opponent hasn't set up Stealth Rock yet and cannot change the weather. The ability to induce hail upon entry can be critical against Pokemon such as Kingdra in an emergency situation. If Abomasnow packs Ice Shard, it can be used as a revenge killer to weakened Pokemon and make sure that Flygon and non-Yache Berry Dragonite locked into Outrage won't cause any more trouble.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Abomasnow has a much easier time coming onto a field cleared of Stealth Rock and any other form of entry hazards. Therefore, Starmie makes for a great teammate due to its access to Rapid Spin and ability to keep Infernape, Heatran, and some Jirachi variants in check. Tentacruel is another notable spinner that pairs nicely with Abomasnow, as it is also able to deal with Fire-types, can set up and absorb Toxic Spikes, and can make use of Knock Off to remove the opposing Pokemon's Leftovers, which, if combined with hail and Leech Seed damage, wears down opposing Pokemon at an extremely fast rate. Nidoqueen is a good partner as well to absorb and set Toxic Spikes while serving as a check to Tyranitar and Fighting-types like Lucario and Infernape. Gliscor also does a good job at handling these threats and benefits from hail damage, as the residual damage enhances its stallbreaking capabilities. Defensive Jirachi is another noteworthy stallbreaker that appreciates hail support when trying to wear down the opposing team with Iron Head, as even opposing Steel-types such as Bronzong have trouble dealing with it if their Leftovers recovery is denied by hail. It also handles dangerous Pokemon such as Gengar and Latias and can support Abomasnow with Wish. Unlike most Pokemon, Clefable isn't bothered by hail at all due to its ability Magic Guard and can make good use of Knock Off, heal its teammates with Wish, and serve as an answer to Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Latias that could force Abomasnow out. Skarmory brings another form of passive damage in Spikes and can check a large number of physical threats, namely Metagross, Scizor, and Gyarados. Since Abomasnow is unable to discourage opposing Skarmory from setting Spikes freely without Blizzard, Magnezone can be considered to circumvent this issue and to deal with other troublesome Steel-types such as Scizor and Jirachi.</p> <p>Other good defensive teammates for Abomasnow include Latias, which serves as a competent answer to Infernape, Breloom, Heatran, and Zapdos while passing Wish. Rotom-A is also a valuable teammate due to its reliability at spinblocking and checking Steel-types such as Metagross, Scizor, physical Jirachi, and Bronzong. Zapdos also deals nicely with the aforementioned Steel-types and Fighting-types like Breloom. Finally, a dedicated hail team featuring Walrein is doable, although stacking Ice-types that share several weakness, mainly to Stealth Rock, comes with synergy issues.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Abomasnow's dual STAB coverage is fit to break through common bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Gliscor, Milotic, Hippowdon, and Celebi, allowing it to act as an efficient wallbreaker that still retains some defensive utility. Wood Hammer pressures bulky Water-types, OHKOes most Tyranitar variants, and 2HKOes maximum HP Clefable and Bold Blissey after Stealth Rock. Blizzard is perfectly accurate under hail, OHKOes Breloom, and heavily cripples the likes of Skarmory, Zapdos, Rotom-A, Gengar, and Celebi. Ice Shard is a very useful priority move, as it allows Abomasnow to finish off Flygon and Dragonite once they have been weakened a bit and does substantial damage to Gliscor, Roserade, Latias, and offensive Zapdos. Earthquake hurts Steel-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Metagross as well as Infernape, which resist Abomasnow's STAB moves. Focus Punch can be used if Clefable and Blissey prove to be real issues, seeing that it spares Abomasnow from taking too much recoil from Wood Hammer when they repeatedly use recovery moves, and it is especially useful against Bold Calm Mind Clefable. It also hits Tyranitar and Heatran extremely hard and does a good amount of damage to Bronzong, Scizor, and Skarmory as it heals with Roost. Its unreliable nature and reliance on prediction should be kept in mind, however. Hidden Power Fire can be considered, as it invalidates Scizor and Forretress as counters and damages Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is recommended because Abomasnow can hardly afford to hamper its longevity with Life Orb and highly benefits from the passive recovery when switching into Ground- and Water-types. Leftovers also alleviates the recoil induced by Wood Hammer. Maximum Attack enables Abomasnow to net an important OHKO with Ice Shard on Flygon and Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage and a round of hail, a 2HKO on Clefable, and an OHKO on most Tyranitar with Wood Hammer. The EVs in Speed allow Abomasnow to outspeed Skarmory without investment. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to enhance Blizzard's damage, 2HKOing maximum HP Rotom-A after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Putting only 16 EVs in Speed is enough to get the edge over uninvested Tyranitar, Swampert, and Clefable. This can also be achieved with 76 Spe and a Brave nature if lowering Defense is deemed to be too bothersome, seeing that Abomasnow wants to take advantage of the likes of Swampert, Gliscor, and Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without investment in defensive stats and Leech Seed, Abomasnow cannot take too many hits and should mostly be switching into defensively oriented Pokemon such as bulky variants of Starmie, Swampert, Hippowdon, non-Flamethrower Nidoqueen, and Milotic. Bringing Abomasnow out early-game to induce hail can be rewarding, especially if Stealth Rock isn't up. Offensive Abomasnow can be difficult to switch into for some teams due to its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. However, be wary of using Wood Hammer too many times, as the recoil can significantly wear Abomasnow down if it's used too recklessly against Pokemon such as Blissey. Since Abomasnow is slow and suffers from a plethora of exploitable weaknesses, its success can be reliant on prediction; it will likely have to catch Steel- and Fire-type switch-ins with Earthquake to get past them, for instance. Abomasnow can also prevent attempts to sweep from Pokemon such as non-Yache Berry and non-Extreme Speed Dragon Dance Dragonite and Rain Dance Kingdra thanks to Ice Shard and hail. In a similar manner, Abomasnow can also serve as an offensive check to Water-types like offensive Calm Mind Suicune, Agility Empoleon, and Starmie thanks to its typing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Abomasnow struggles to get past Steel-types such as Scizor, bulky Jirachi, Bronzong, Forretress, and, to a lesser extent, specially defensive Skarmory. Therefore, Heatran is a partner of choice, as it can keep them in check and can set up Stealth Rock to enhance Abomasnow's wallbreaking capabilities. Choice Scarf variants in particular are effective at revenge killing Lucario and appreciate Abomasnow's Ice Shard to handle Dragon Dance Dragonite. In return, Abomasnow can take on Water-types that cause Heatran trouble. Starmie is a very valuable partner as the most reliable spinner available and can help Abomasnow by getting rid of entry hazards and keeping Fire- and some Steel-type Pokemon in check. Tentacruel is another spinner to consider because it can absorb and set Toxic Spikes while keeping Fire-types in check. Skarmory is another Pokemon suited to take advantage of the aforementioned Steel-types by using them as Spikes fodder. It is also a very solid defensive teammate for Abomasnow due to its ability to check the likes of Metagross and Gyarados. On a more offensive team, Bronzong can help Abomasnow by setting up Trick Room to enhance the matchup against fast-paced teams.</p> <p>Offensive Abomasnow cannot take hits from the offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Suicune, and Empoleon forever. Therefore, specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Jirachi make good partners, especially since they have an easier time crippling the opposing team with hail active. They also bring Wish support that Abomasnow appreciates. Nidoqueen and Gliscor can support Abomasnow by laying down entry hazards and stallbreaking, respectively, while keeping dangerous Pokemon such as Tyranitar and most Fighting-types in check. Due to Abomasnow's Speed and huge number of exploitable weaknesses, Pokemon that have good type synergy with it such as Latias, Zapdos, and Rotom-A are ideal teammates.</p>"

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile’s great offensive stats and typing give a niche as a Pursuit trapper in DPP OU. Unlike its main competitor, Tyranitar, Weavile is really fast—fast enough that it doesn’t need a Choice Scarf to outspeed frailer Dark-weak foes such as Gengar, offensive Rotom-A, Latias, and Starmie. It can instead use more versatile items such as power-boosting items including Expert Belt and Black Glasses to more easily KO them if they don’t switch out or Lum Berry to absorb their status moves. Weavile also is a serviceable revenge killer; its access to a strong Ice Shard allows it to revenge kill prominent Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon, and its Speed allows it to naturally outspeed +1 Tyranitar and easily OHKOes it with Low Kick. These attributes, in addition to not setting up sand like Tyranitar does, makes it particular adapt on very aggressive teams focused on frail attackers such as Infernape.</p> <p>Weavile’s numerous problems in the tier stem from its lack of power and atrocious survivability. Weavile does not learn strong physical Dark- and Ice-type moves and struggles to damage bulky Pokemon as a result. Ice Punch and Night Slash are simply not strong enough to KO neutral targets such as Swampert, Gyarados, and Jirachi, or even very bulky walls weak to them such as Celebi and Hippowdon without a Swords Dance boost. Weavile also struggles to damage most of the Steel-types in the tier neutral to Fighting. Scizor in particular easily OHKOes Weavile with Bullet Punch and isn’t hit too hard by Low Kick, Skarmory and Forretress set up with impunity, and Metagross, Bronzong, and Jirachi can survive even Choice Band or +2 Night Slash without problems and OHKO it back. All of this is exacerbated by Weavile's dreadful defensive stats, bad defensive typing, and weakness to residual damage. In most situations, Weavile is outclassed by Tyranitar as a Pursuit trapper, as while Weavile is both stronger and faster than Choice Scarf Tyranitar, it lacks the bulk and resistances to switch in easily into Latias and Rotom-A to Pursuit trap them. Scizor is also difficult competition, as its far superior bulk and defensive profile are sometimes preferable to Weavile’s Speed and power. Being weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to status and sand means Weavile faints very quickly, as even weak special attacks like Rotom-A’s Thunderbolt and Latias’s Dragon Pulse easily 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Holding a Choice Band or a Life Orb makes this worse, as Weavile has to either switch out when locked on an unfavorable move or take even more residual damage to power up its weak attacks. Weavile also struggles to revenge kill Dragon Dance Dragonite with Extreme Speed, as Dragonite is faster at +1, and boosted Extreme Speed KOes it after Stealth Rock. Weavile also has issues fitting everything it wants onto one set: it needs Pursuit and often wants Low Kick and Swords Dance to help with coverage and make up for its power issues, but this leaves it wanting all of Night Slash, Ice Shard, and Ice Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Weavile has historically been used as an anti-lead, as it has access to options such as Fake Out, Taunt, and Counter. With a Focus Sash, it can both threaten prominent leads such as Azelf with Taunt and Dark-type moves, while other anti-leads risk Counter. However, such a set simply does not provide enough utility to be worth it, as once the set is known, it loses its surprise value when opponents can just switch out. Weavile can use a dedicated Swords Dance set without Pursuit, but even with the extra moveslot, it lacks power and sorely misses its niche as a Pursuit trapper. While Weavile loathes to give up further coverage, it can take advantage of the switches it forces to use Substitute + Focus Punch to have a generally strong attack against lighter targets such as Jirachi. However, Low Kick most often outclasses Focus Punch and Substitute makes Weavile faint even quicker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types neutral to Fighting</strong>: Weavile struggles to damage Steel-types, especially if they are neutral to Low Kick. Scizor is perhaps the best answer in the game to Weavile, as it takes Low Kick well and easily OHKOes Weavile with Bullet Punch and U-turn. Metagross, Jirachi, and Bronzong all OHKO Weavile easily, while Skarmory and Forretress can be overwhelmed only with multiple boosts. Even Steel-types weak to Low Kick, such as Magnezone, Heatran, and Empoleon, can generally survive one Low Kick and KO or heavily damage it back.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Especially since Weavile often forgoes Ice Punch, it severely struggles to damage Fighting-types. Machamp has almost nothing to fear from Weavile and destroys it with DynamicPunch. Breloom and especially Infernape destroy Weavile with Mach Punch. Choice Scarf Lucario outspeeds Weavile and obliterates it with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Being vulnerable to all three entry hazards, sand, all status, and being frail means Weavile often only has one or two opportunities to make an impact. This is made worse because common Weavile targets often carry status moves such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp that neuter it completely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Weavile struggles to damage Pokemon that aren't weak to Dark-, Fighting, or Ice-type attacks, such as Water-types like Swampert, Gyarados, Suicune, and Milotic as well as lighter Normal-types such as Clefable. Very bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Celebi, and physically defensive Zapdos avoid being 2HKOed by Weavile unless it has a Choice Band or Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Weavile really struggles to survive strong priority attacks, as many of them hit it super effectively. Scizor, Metagross, and Lucario's Bullet Punch is the worst, as it will always OHKO after Stealth Rock and they all resist Ice Shard. While Breloom is hit super effectively by Ice Shard, it is only 2HKOed and can OHKO it with Mach Punch. +1 Dragonite is especially dangerous, as it outspeeds Weavile and KOes it with Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock before Weavile can hit it with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: Weavile is very frail and really needs the Speed advantage to fulfill its niche. Choice Scarf Rotom-A and Latias outspeed Weavile and can potentially OHKO it before Weavile KOes them back, especially with entry hazards set. Other Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Heatran, Lucario, Jirachi, and Metagross all outspeed Weavile and easily OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Weavile’s primary niche is Pursuit trapping. It makes for a fantastic user of the move, as it outspeeds and, with the Expert Belt or Black Glasses, OHKOes frailer Dark-weak Pokemon such as Gengar after Stealth Rock even if it doesn’t switch out. Bulkier Dark-weak Pokemon such as Starmie, offensive Latias, and Choice item Rotom-A are OHKOed on the switch out after Stealth Rock. Ice Shard helps Weavile KO faster Ice-weak Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Latias, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Breloom using Mach Punch. As Pursuit and Ice Shard are weak moves that can struggle to damage bulkier Dark- and Ice-weak foes such as physically defensive Rotom-A, Zapdos, Latias, Hippowdon, and Celebi, Swords Dance is another option to power these moves up.</p> <p>Low Kick gives Weavile crucial coverage, OHKOing all variants of Tyranitar without a Chople Berry and hitting Steel-types such as Magnezone, Heatran, and Empoleon very hard. Low Kick is often Weavile’s best option against heavy neutral targets such as Metagross, Scizor, and Suicune. Weavile can use its stronger STAB options in the last slot such as Night Slash and Ice Punch. Night Slash allows Weavile to threaten bulkier Dark-weak Pokemon such as defensive Latias and Rest + Sleep Talk Rotom-A and is notably the best option against Jirachi. Ice Punch is Weavile’s strongest Ice-type move and hits Pokemon such as Zapdos, Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Swampert harder than anything else it can use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Weavile should always run maximum Attack EVs and at least 216 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature. This allows it to outspeed +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Starmie, and slower Dragon Dance Gyarados. However, Weavile mostly runs maximum Speed EVs, as the extra bulk is marginal. Weavile has a couple of item choices: the most common is Expert Belt, as Weavile appreciates the extra boost on Pursuit against Gengar and other frail targets and on Ice Shard against Pokemon such as Breloom using Mach Punch. Black Glasses is excellent for always boosting Weavile’s Dark-type attacks, whether they’re super effective or not. Lum Berry is a specialized option to relieve pressure from Weavile when trapping targets carrying a status infliction such as defensive Latias's and Starmie's Thunder Wave and defensive Rotom-A's Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weavile is at its best when played aggressively, getting in on predicted switches, weaker attacks, or on unexpected revenge kills. While Weavile is frail, it can switch in on resisted attacks such as Life Orb Gengar's and offensive Rotom-A's Shadow Ball, defensive Latias's Ice Beam, and just barely defensive Starmie's Surf with enough HP to switch into Stealth Rock twice—this allows it to switch in, threaten a Pursuit trap, and then be able to switch in one more time if necessary. Knowing the damage ranges against Latias, Rotom-A, and Starmie depending on its respective item is crucial, especially if Weavile has Night Slash or Ice Punch against Latias, as Weavile despises their status moves unless it has a Lum Berry.</p> <p>How to use Weavile once it is in on a target heavily depends on the rest of the team and what it needs to do. Bulkier Dark-weak Pokemon that are not in range of Weavile attacks generally don't want to switch out in fear of being Pursuit trapped. This is a great opportunity to sacrifice Weavile to heavily damage them for other attackers on the team that may struggle with these Pokemon. However, since Weavile also is a critical revenge killer, it may open up the rest of the team to foes such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Flygon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weavile’s best partner is Infernape, as Infernape's best counters are Latias and Starmie, two Pokemon Weavile can Pursuit trap. Gengar and Choice Scarf Rotom-A are faster than Infernape and can switch into Close Combat to force it out—if these Pokemon use Shadow Ball as Weavile switches in, they will be Pursuit trapped by Weavile. Infernape is massively threatening to the bulkier Pokemon Weavile loathes to face, such as most Steel-types. Another fantastic teammate is offensive Calm Mind Suicune. Offensive Suicune is often checked by defensive Latias—if Weavile heavily weakens or traps Latias, defensive teams often need to check it with Clefable, which, if it lacks Thunder Wave or Encore, Suicune can muscle past at +2. Offensive Suicune and Weavile are also fantastic at checking Dragon Dance sweepers; offensive Suicune is a great Gyarados check with Hidden Power Electric and also forces Dragonite to use Outrage, allowing Weavile to revenge kill it with Ice Shard. Weavile checks Dragon Dance Tyranitar with Low Kick, allowing the team to function without Choice Scarf revenge killers. Weavile also appreciates teammates that threaten the bulkier Pokemon it can't handle. Offensive Heatran is a fantastic check to most Steel-types, while Trick + Iron Ball Metagross can hamper Skarmory and Zapdos with an Iron Ball as well as use Explosion on very bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Celebi, and Hippowdon that Weavile struggles with. Other Pokemon such as offensive Latias, offensive Zapdos, and offensive Empoleon are also good teammates, as they can shoulder a lot of defensive responsibility when Weavile is invariably forced out. Suicide leads carrying Taunt such as Azelf and Aerodactyl are great options to help Weavile come onto the field unscathed. These leads also carry Stealth Rock and are effective at securing them early to pressure bulky Flying-types such as Gyarados and defensive Zapdos. Weavile also appreciates Spikes support, as a lot of its checks are grounded. Offensive often provides quick entry hazards for Weavile to take advantage of.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior is a Pokemon of extremes, akin to making a deal with the devil. Rhyperior’s physical stats are only rivaled by Groudon’s in DPP and it has the movepool to back them up. It can 2HKO everything in the tier with a Choice Band with the correct move, while Rock Wrecker is so strong it OHKOes specially defensive Skarmory. Rhyperior gets access to every strong physical coverage move it could want such as Ice Punch, Fire Punch, and Megahorn, while also having Swords Dance to power them up to ludicrous levels. Rhyperior’s Rock / Ground typing is very good offensively while Solid Rock is a fantastic ability to make up for some of its defensive shortcomings, especially physically. Rhyperior can survive Breloom’s Seed Bomb, +1 Tyranitar’s Earthquake, and Gyarados’s +0 Waterfall with minimal investment. Rhyperior is a premier Substitute user alongside paralysis, as very few Pokemon can stomach the correct attack repeatedly, while paralysis lets it outspeed foes.</p> <p>So why isn’t Rhyperior everywhere in DPP OU and much less common than other Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Gliscor, and Flygon? Rhyperior’s Special Defense and Speed are just far too low to make up for the severe defensive flaws from its typing. Rhyperior is one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier; it needs heavy investment even to outspeed minimum Speed Clefable. On top of this, almost all specially offensive Pokemon either can OHKO Rhyperior or put it extremely low on health, even with Solid Rock. Having a 4x weakness to one of the best offensive types in Water as well as Grass alongside weaknesses to Fighting, Steel, Ground, and Ice is debilitating in a tier where these moves are extremely common. Even sand support and Solid Rock are not enough to save Rhyperior from every specially offensive Water-type in the tier, Breloom, Jirachi, Metagross, Latias, and Gengar among many others. While Rhyperior can hit these Pokemon really hard, it is just so slow, to the point even Rock Polish doesn’t let it outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Metagross. Other Ground-types may have lower physical stats, but they have far more balanced defenses and not nearly as many weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhyperior has a huge movepool but struggles to make many of its options work in DPP OU beyond what’s listed. Rhyperior can use Rock Polish to mitigate its Speed troubles, but it needs to Rock Polish twice before it outspeeds most Choice Scarf users and typically gets KOed before it can get that, especially since it needs Life Orb for additional power. Rhyperior can also use Fire Punch on any of its sets, as it is Rhyperior’s best option against Bronzong and Breloom, but struggles to fit it.</p> <p>Rhyperior has excellent physical bulk when fully invested and can set up Stealth Rock against most physical attackers, but its weaknesses, lack of recovery, and low Special Defense are just too difficult to overcome for defensive sets. Offensive sets based around Swords Dance such as with three attacks are too easily revenge killed due to its slow Speed and common weaknesses. Rhyperior has other tricks up its sleeve: it can potentially status foes with Zap Cannon or Toxic and take advantage of its physical bulk with Counter, but struggles to use them properly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types outspeed Rhyperior, are not OHKOed by Earthquake, and KO back. Gyarados, Swampert, Starmie, Suicune, Kingdra, Milotic, and Quagsire all threaten Rhyperior. Rhyperior can survive physical Water-type moves, but often only survive one.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While Rhyperior can OHKO most Grass-types with a Choice Band Megahorn or Ice Punch, it loathes to take them on, as they outspeed and destroy it. Breloom easily generates momentum on Rhyperior with Spore and Seed Bomb, although it doesn’t OHKO. Roserade, Celebi, Shaymin, and Abomasnow destroy Rhyperior, although it can survive defensive Celebi’s Grass Knot with sand and Solid Rock. Abomasnow also changes the weather.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing</strong>: Without a Substitute up, Rhyperior is just too specially frail to survive in DPP OU. Most offensive Pokemon in the tier have a move that can revenge kill Rhyperior, especially if sand is not up. Some examples include Latias’s Surf, Jirachi’s Grass Knot or Iron Head, Gengar’s Focus Blast, and Heatran’s Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While Rhyperior can 2HKO everything in the tier with a Choice Band, it typically can’t afford to switch moves and maintain this level of power. Using a Choice Band Earthquake into a Flying-type for example can force Rhyperior out, making it hard to get back on the field unscathed again. Physically defensive Hippowdon can generally stall out most of Rhyperior’s moves, while Rhyperior needs Rock Wrecker or Stone Edge to hit physically defensive Skarmory hard.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types not weak to Earthquake</strong>: Leftovers Bronzong can generally stop Rhyperior, as Rhyperior rarely carries Fire Punch and it can survive Megahorn. Other Steel-types offensively threaten Rhyperior: Scizor 2HKOes with Choice Band Bullet Punch, as does Metagross with Meteor Mash. While risky, Jirachi can flinch it down with Iron Head. With a Shuca Berry, some Steel-types such as Empoleon and Metagross can survive Earthquake and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Rhyperior is grounded and vulnerable to all status. Rhyperior despises Toxic Spikes, while burn completely ruins it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is absurdly strong, OHKOing physically defensive Jirachi and most Steel-types like Heatran and offensive Metagross through their Shuca Berry. It also generally 2HKOes most Pokemon who don’t resist it such as Swampert, Machamp, and Scizor. Rock Slide is a reliable Rock-type STAB move that 2HKOes specially defensive Skarmory and destroys everything weak to it. Stone Edge hits a lot harder, 2HKOing physically defensive Skarmory and Gliscor.</p> <p>Megahorn is one of Rhyperior’s best attributes as a Choice Band user, as it just destroys the bulky Psychic-types such as Latias, Uxie, and Cresselia that can survive hits from other Choice Band users. Rock Wrecker takes this power to another level, as despite the recharge turn almost certainly meaning that Rhyperior is getting KOed or something else bad happening, it is the hardest hitting physical move in DPP OU besides Explosion. It OHKOes almost everything not resistant to it besides extremely bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Gliscor and Skarmory, and even these are OHKOed after two rounds of Stealth Rock. It does around 55% to Lucario, who 4x resists the move. If this is too risky, Ice Punch is another great choice, as it OHKOes Gliscor easily and has the same power as Earthquake against super effective targets such as Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature, Rhyperior has a 624 Attack stat, letting it hit extremely hard. With maximum Speed EVs it barely outspeeds uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom. It can run some arbitrary HP investment such as 80 HP EVs to help it better survive attacks, but generally shouldn’t run less than 164 Speed EVs so it can outspeed minimum Speed Clefable. If used with Trick Room, it can use maximum HP EVs, as uninvested Rhyperior is already slower than almost everything in the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rhyperior, without investment and especially without sand, is extraordinary specially frail and should try to come in on predicted switches, U-turn, and on sacrifices. However, it has decent physical bulk, and can come in when a threat such as Tyranitar or Dragonite uses Dragon Dance, as it will survive the attack and OHKO back, even through resistance berries, after Stealth Rock. Rhyperior appreciates the majority of the opposing team paralyzed before coming in, but can come in earlier in the game to pressure attackers that can’t OHKO it, such as Heatran without Hidden Power Grass if sand is up. Once Rhyperior is in safely, often the safest move to use is Rock Slide, as it hits very hard, has a prominent flinch chance, and has the best neutral coverage. However, if Rhyperior needs to KO a wall such as specially defensive Skarmory, do not hesitate to use Rock Wrecker, as the defensive backbone alongside it should be able to cover most set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Rhyperior is most commonly used alongside a heavy defensive backbone that spreads paralysis effectively as a wallbreaker and utility check. Physically defensive Zapdos is one of its best partners, as Zapdos spreads paralysis, Rhyperior can handle almost anything Dragon Dance Tyranitar can throw at it, Zapdos can U-turn to it, and can handle most other sweepers should Rhyperior use Rock Wrecker. Other common Zapdos partners such as Starmie, physically defensive Jirachi, and Clefable are also strong teammates. Starmie also Rapid Spins away Toxic Spikes, which Rhyperior despises. Hippowdon is another excellent partner, as not only is it extremely bulky and mitigates set up, but it also sets sand for Rhyperior. Rhyperior can fit alongside other paraspam partners such as Machamp, Blissey, Togekiss, and Swords Dance Breloom, but such partners often force an insufficient defensive backbone to mask the defensive flaws of Rhyperior.</p> <p>Rhyperior can fit on Trick Room offenses, especially if used alongside Gravity. As most Pokemon survive Rhyperior’s Earthquake not by resisting it but with an immunity, Rhyperior can very often get three straight KOs under Trick Room alongside Gravity. Common partners include Uxie, Bronzong, Cresselia, and Jirachi.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is immensely helpful for Rhyperior, as it is often threatening enough at full HP to get a Substitute. From here, Rhyperior can hit whatever comes in very hard without needing prediction while also avoiding revenge killing. Earthquake OHKOes Tyranitar without bulk and generally 2HKOes most offensive Pokemon, while Stone Edge has very good coverage alongside it, OHKOing almost all Flying-types and other Ground immune Pokemon weak to it.</p> <p>The last slot opens up significantly, but the best option is Ice Punch. Ice Punch completes Rhyperior’s coverage against Gliscor, Breloom, and Flygon while giving an accurate move against Ground-immune Pokemon such as Dragonite and Latias. Megahorn still hits Breloom and Flygon hard, but instead also OHKOes Psychic-types and prominently hits Latias and Bronzong really hard. Another option is Swords Dance, as if given a free turn with the Substitute, Rhyperior has decent coverage in two moves and hits insanely hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs given allow Rhyperior to make 101 HP Substitutes, outspeed Clefable, and OHKO Tyranitar without bulk investment with Earthquake. Rhyperior can also maximize its Speed and HP if it is using Swords Dance, as just Adamant is enough if it is boosting its Attack.</p> <p>Rhyperior can also use much less Speed to hit bulk benchmarks; as an example, 192 HP / 100 Atk / 156 SpD / 60 Spe survives Celebi’s Grass Knot and Metagross’s Meteor Mash, while 244 HP EVs and 80 Special Defense EVs mean Heatran never 2HKOes Rhyperior in sand.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rhyperior should try to get in later in the game once paralysis has been spread and/or sand is up and use Substitute. While Rhyperior can struggle to get in, its physical bulk and the status immunity Substitute gives helps it pressure foes such as setting up such as Tyranitar and physical Dragonite, while Pokemon such as Jirachi, defensive Rotom-A without Shadow Ball, and Heatran represent great opportunities if they are paralyzed and Rhyperior can avoid their status moves. From here, Rhyperior should just attack what is in front of it or set up Swords Dance if it has it. Whatever move picked in the last slot typically is effective in hitting its target, whether that be Gliscor and Breloom for Ice Punch, Latias and Celebi for Megahorn, or general threat level for Swords Dance, so leverage this to get the KOs needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rhyperior enjoys two kinds of support: extensive paralysis and sand. While sand is very helpful to help it and the Substitute survive weaker special attacks, sand is not necessary for the set to function. Rhyperior both provides a strong Dragon Dance Tyranitar check that many paralysis based offenses enjoy and is very threatening. Rhyperior competes with Machamp for this role, but its sand immunity and physical bulk is very helpful. Accordingly, strong partners include Jirachi and Thunder Wave Gyarados, as these Pokemon spread paralysis effectively to bulky Steel-types and revenge killers, respectively, allowing Rhyperior to get an opportunity to wreak havoc. Gyarados also baits in Choiced Electric-type moves that give Rhyperior a free Substitute. Choice Scarf Latias and Rotom-A are also excellent teammates, as Rhyperior covers almost all Dragon Dance Tyranitar sets and they checks others set up sweepers. Latias can potentially even Healing Wish Rhyperior back into action. Other strong teammates include offensive lead Breloom, Azelf, and Uxie, while both Empoleon and Heatran can provide pressure against Pokemon like physically defensive Skarmory that gives Rhyperior trouble.</p> <p>Both Tyranitar and Hippowdon are effective in providing sand. Tyranitar fits more offensive paralysis based teammates, as it can leverage its bulk and superior coverage to help Rhyperior against Pokemon like defensive Rotom-A that it struggles with. Hippowdon can fit well with more defensively based partners such as physically defensive Zapdos, Starmie, and Clefable, as they can provide opens for especially Substitute + Swords Dance Rhyperior.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Despite its great coverage hitting nearly every Pokemon in DPP OU super effectively, and its unique ability to gain a Speed boost from Motor Drive, Electivire is unable to make an impact on the metagame. Electivire is too weak and/or strapped for moveslots to threaten common defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Rotom-A, and Swampert. Further, its reliance on getting a Speed boost, and its propensity to get revenge killed with its fragility and Earthquake weakness, make it an unappealing choice. Electivire has many similarities to another mixed attacker, Infernape; however, Electivire struggles to have any utility outside of switching into Electric-type attacks. Infernape, on the other hand, does not need a Speed boost, hits significantly harder, and carries key moves such as U-turn, a STAB Fighting-type attack in Close Combat, Taunt, and Grass Knot. Electivire should never be considered on a serious team, even if said team is carrying Gyarados to bait Electric-type attacks.</p>",

  "Yanmega": {
    "overview": "<p>Yanmega has an excellent Special Attack stat, very respectable Speed, and two of the most powerful abilities in the game at his disposal. With Tinted Lens, Yanmega is capable of 2HKOing even dedicated walls who resist his STAB attacks, an impressive feat. Meanwhile, if he instead chooses to use Speed Boost, he will outspeed the entire metagame, including Choice Scarf users, after a turn or two.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine Yanmega being anything other than top-tier OU after considering his strengths, yet the fact remains that he's not. Yanmega suffers from an utterly crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock that has completely nullified his presence as a standard of the metagame. Weaknesses to common Fire-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks aren't helping Yanmega's position either. These weaknesses, coupled with Yanmega's not-so-stellar defenses, have sealed the dragonfly's fate and unfortunately banished him to the bottom of OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The listed sets already take advantage of Yanmega's most prominent movepool features, but there exist a few more that can be of use. Hidden Power Ice allows the LeadMega set to OHKO Lead Dragonite and can allow the Specs Tinted Lens set to OHKO Flygon switch-ins, but leaves both vulnerable to Heatran. Shadow Ball on the Specs Tinted Lens set will OHKO defensive Rotom-A, but Bug Buzz would do that after Stealth Rock damage anyway. As noted in the LeadMega analysis, Hypnosis can be run to deal with some otherwise troublesome Pokemon, though its accuracy is a letdown.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Outside of Blissey, absolutely nobody perfectly walls Specs Tinted Lens Yanmega. Skarmory and Heatran can come in on a predicted Bug Buzz and force him out to take more deadly Stealth Rock damage, but must be wary of a 2HKO from Air Slash. Snorlax is a good response with his monstrous special bulk, though Bug Buzz will still 3HKO him, an issue made worse by Snorlax's lack of reliable recovery. Anyone faster or with strong priority who can get in on an attack and survive will force Yanmega out. Scizor's Bullet Punch, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Choice Scarf Heatran's Fire Blast immediately come to mind as suitable options for the job.</p> <p>The biggest counter to Yanmega, however, is not any one Pokemon, but rather a battle condition. Stealth Rock completely ruins him, and with its prevalence in the metagame, just maintaining it is enough to keep Yanmega at bay.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Yanmega's unique attributes allow him to function as an excellent anti-lead in the OU metagame. After a single Speed Boost, Yanmega will outspeed every single non-Choice Scarf lead bar Ninjask and hit them all for serious damage. Yanmega can also function excellently as a late-game sweeper if the need arises and he survives his early-game encounter.</p> <p>Protect gives Yanmega the edge against Fake Out or attacks from faster leads, particularly from Infernape and Starmie, who both outspeed him before Speed Boost kicks in. As Protect also guarantees that Speed Boost will activate once and maintains Yanmega's Focus Sash, it enables Yanmega to subsequently beat both Starmie and Infernape. Bug Buzz and Air Slash are Yanmega's STAB attacks, and when used together, provide reasonable coverage against most common leads, only missing at least neutral damage against Heatran, Aerodactyl, and Skarmory. It is for this reason that Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fire are the choices for the fourth slot. Hidden Power Ground is useful for 2HKOing standard Shuca Berry Heatran leads and for a greater likelihood of beating Metagross leads, given the presence of Occa Berry. Hidden Power Fire, however, allows Yanmega to defeat Skarmory, Forretress, and Abomasnow leads at the cost of being walled by Heatran. Hidden Power Fire also serves as a weapon with which to combat Scizor later in the match, who can only 2HKO with Bullet Punch. Hypnosis can be used in the fourth slot over Hidden Power for a better chance at beating Tyranitar who lack Lum Berry and Swampert, but it is terribly unreliable and generally not worth sacrificing the ability to beat other leads reliably.</p> <p>This Yanmega can also be relatively successful outside of the lead position as a late-game sweeper with Speed Boost. With a Life Orb equipped, Yanmega will handily dish out OHKOs and 2HKOs against Pokemon weak to and neutral to his STABs, respectively. In this case, maximizing Speed EVs is necessary to outspeed a Dragon Dance-boosted Jolly Gyarados after a single Speed Boost. The primary issue with using this Yanmega as a sweeper is that he is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and is easily walled by the likes of Skarmory, Blissey, and Zapdos. Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage coupled with the inability to break through defensive Pokemon make Yanmega dead weight without perfect support.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly simple, but has a few quirks that might not be obvious at first glance. 252 Special Attack EVs are obviously chosen to maximize Yanmega's offensive power. The 104 Defense EVs are necessary to soften the blows of physical leads, but particularly serve to prevent Metagross leads from 2HKOing you with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch; this gives you a fighting chance at 2HKOing them back with Bug Buzz. The 152 remaining EVs are placed into Speed to conveniently sit Yanmega at 396 Speed after a single Speed Boost, enough to outpace Jolly Aerodactyl. If Hidden Power Fire is used in the fourth slot, 156 Speed EVs should be used with 100 Defense EVs to reach the same Speed threshold. A Modest nature is particularly viable because Speed Boost will compensate for Yanmega's reduced Speed, and he really needs the Special Attack boost to punch through opposing Pokemon. Focus Sash is chosen as the item so Yanmega can 2HKO Pokemon such as Heatran without being OHKOed first.</p> <p>Yanmega has trouble with Tyranitar, Swampert, Aerodactyl, Smeargle, and Roserade leads. Good partners to this set are Pokemon who can take on a group of those troublesome leads, set up Stealth Rock to support your team, or provide Rapid Spin support so Yanmega can have a chance to sweep later if he survives. For this reason, Life Orb Starmie makes an excellent teammate with its ability to Rapid Spin and scare away some of those leads with its STAB Hydro Pump. Skarmory can set up on Tyranitar and Swampert freely with its monstrous Defense and then just Whirlwind to scout the opponent's team and rack up entry hazard damage. Standard MixPert can do the same, and can set up Stealth Rock very effectively with its ability to switch into the Fire- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Yanmega. A status-absorbing Pokemon such as CroCune or RestTalk Machamp can switch into Sleep Powder or Spore from Roserade and Smeargle, respectively, and then switch to some other Pokemon with Sleep Clause active. Yanmega is excellent at applying offensive pressure immediately, which makes pairing him with other such offensive threats a good plan. Heatran makes a particularly excellent teammate for Yanmega, as he can come in on the Fire-type attacks aimed at Yanmega, gain a Flash Fire boost, and go to town. Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock and threaten Skarmory, a common Yanmega switch-in.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With Tinted Lens, Yanmega's STABs give him perfect type coverage, hitting everyone in the game for at least neutral damage. Coming off of a base 116 Special Attack stat, even Pokemon who normally resist Yanmega's STABs, such as Skarmory, are reliably 2HKOed. There are truly very few safe switch-ins to this Yanmega, as he has the power to punch through practically anyone in the metagame.</p> <p>Bug Buzz and Air Slash are mandatory on this set, giving Yanmega perfect type coverage within his STAB attacks alone. Hidden Power Ground is there to OHKO Pokemon who might try to switch in on Bug Buzz with their 4x resistance, such as Heatran and Lucario. U-turn fills the final slot perfectly, allowing Yanmega to scout the opponent's initial switch-in and bring out the necessary response. Be wary when using U-turn, however, as with Yanmega's Stealth Rock weakness, he cannot switch in haphazardly.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly standard for an offensive sweeper, maximizing Yanmega's Speed and Special Attack. Modest is the preferred nature as Timid allows Yanmega to outspeed very few notable Pokemon, while the added damage output from Modest is welcome.</p> <p>Hands down, the best offensive partners for this set are Gyarados and Metagross. Both of them are countered by Zapdos and Rotom-A, and both of them have a far easier time sweeping when they're removed. Serendipitously, fast Taunt-employing leads such as Aerodactyl and Azelf are also recommended for use alongside offensive Gyarados sets, so you do not have to go out of your way to use such leads just for Yanmega. However, if using Gyarados alongside Yanmega, you should construct your team with resistances to Rock- and Electric-type attacks in mind. It is also crucial to Yanmega's success that your team packs a Rapid Spinner such as Starmie or Forretress. Entry hazard support is also greatly appreciated by Yanmega, particularly Stealth Rock. With Stealth Rock on the field, this Yanmega can OHKO offensive variants of Rotom-A with Bug Buzz. Standard MixPert makes an excellent partner to set up Stealth Rock with his resistance to Fire- and Rock-type attacks. If Spikes are set up, even once-safe switch-ins can be 2HKOed or even OHKOed by Bug Buzz or Air Slash. Finally, make sure that your team can beat Blissey, who walls this set to the ends of the heavens and beyond. Lucario makes a fine choice for this, as he is immune to Toxic and supports Yanmega well with his 4x resistance to Rock-type attacks.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>With a unique typing that's only hit super effectively by Water- and Ice-type attacks, a large movepool, and well-distributed stats, Gliscor has risen to become a behemoth in OU. In fact, there is no Pokemon that can even come close to fulfilling the specific roles that Gliscor can fill. It is one of the most devastating stallbreakers in the tier, and it can utilize a scary Swords Dance set.</p> <p>While Gliscor is an incredible Pokemon, its raw power is comparatively low, and its Special Defense is lackluster. Water-types will laugh at Gliscor's weaker attacks and give it massive trouble. Ice-type attacks are 4x super effective, and Gliscor is rarely able to take one from most opposing Pokemon. That said, Gliscor's shortcomings are very few. It can fit onto a large variety of teams and is an essential Pokemon in OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gliscor has a large movepool, and it can use a surprising number of moves to some degree of effectiveness. It can use a Stealth Rock set with U-turn, which can be a useful lead that uses U-turn to break a potential Focus Sash from Azelf, Empoleon, and Roserade. This set can also work effectively against Starmie by using U-turn as it comes in and following up with Tyranitar to trap and remove it. However, this set should not be used without dedicated support in Tyranitar and a Ghost-type like Rotom-A or Gengar, as a Stealth Rock user that is very weak to Starmie is a risky choice. A Choice Scarf set with Earthquake, Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, and U-turn can be effective, but Choice Scarf Flygon is usually more desirable, since its STAB-boosted Dragon-type attacks make it much more threatening. Fire Fang can be used over Ice Fang to better handle Swords Dance Scizor if your team cannot fit a primary check for it. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, as well as Hippowdon and Rotom-A, but it is difficult to find room for this move without sacrificing a better option like Ice Fang. Stone Edge can be used to hit Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gyarados in only one slot, but its power is quite underwhelming, and other coverage and utility moves are generally preferred. Gliscor could support its team with Rain Dance, but there are almost always better options like Azelf and even Crobat. Night Slash can be used to hit Ghost-types, but it would only work as a surprise option and Gliscor is better off with its standard moves. Brick Break can be used to stunt hyper offense builds that utilize dual screens, but the move is so weak that this would be the only use. Aqua Tail can hit Hippowdon super effectively as well as opposing Gliscor, but so can Ice Fang, which can also threaten to freeze both of those Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Gyarados, Kingdra, Milotic, Starmie, Suicune, and Swampert can all threaten Gliscor massively with their super effective STAB attacks. Besides Kingdra, these Pokemon also commonly use Ice-type attacks, which are 4x super effective against Gliscor.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Gliscor is 4x weak to Ice, so Pokemon that use Ice-type attacks like Jirachi, Hippowdon, Infernape, Heatran, Machamp, and Rotom-A can all be a threat. Ice-types like Abomasnow and Mamoswine can threaten Gliscor with STAB-boosted Ice-type attacks, namely Ice Shard, while simultaneously not taking too much damage from any of Gliscor's attacks⁠, although Mamoswine must watch out for Gliscor's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Zapdos, Latias, Bronzong, Gengar, Cresselia, and Rotom-A are immune to Gliscor's strongest attacking move, can shrug off Ice Fang with ease, and are able to threaten Gliscor with powerful attacks or even status. Bronzong is especially effective versus Swords Dance Gliscor, but has to beware of a potential pairing with Magnezone. Cresselia can pack Ice Beam and Calm Mind simultaneously, which Gliscor cannot handle whatsoever, even with Taunt and Roost. Skarmory can do well versus Gliscor variants without Taunt, but it does not match up well otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Although Gliscor excels in its natural physical bulk, its special bulk is lackluster, so many special attacks from the likes of Gengar, Shaymin, Celebi, mixed Dragonite, Heatran, Infernape, and Latias can be quite troublesome to deal with.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt, in tandem with Earthquake, allows Gliscor to shut down many common stall cores consisting of Pokemon like Tyranitar, Nidoqueen, Clefable, Skarmory, Heatran, and mono-Electric-type attack Rotom-A. Taunt is also crucial versus offensive teams, as it can prevent setup sweepers from boosting their stats. Earthquake is Gliscor's best STAB move, dealing decent damage even without Attack investment and allowing Gliscor to OHKO most Heatran, Magnezone, and Lucario, all of which Gliscor can generally outspeed, as well as hit Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Jirachi super effectively.</p> <p>Ice Fang is the most recommended move in the third slot, as it has many uses on Gliscor. Ice Fang can be used alongside Taunt to wear down Pokemon like Skarmory and Rotom-A, as although the damage is minimal, Gliscor is able to use Ice Fang multiple times against both Pokemon, which adds up over time. Ice Fang also hits Dragonite, Flygon, and opposing Gliscor for massive damage, and it simultaneously hits Grass-types super effectively; this affirms Gliscor's ability to take on Breloom. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to cripple opposing teams, and it works especially effectively for removing items from Skarmory and Clefable, making it extremely strong versus stall. By opting to not use Ice Fang, however, Gliscor becomes worse versus Breloom and Dragon-types. Wing Attack is also a solid option when using a stall build for providing great insurance versus Breloom, consistently OHKOing it with 4x super effective damage. However, Wing Attack is not as good against stall builds compared to Ice Fang because it does not wear down Skarmory and Rotom-A as solidly and cannot threaten a freeze, and Knock Off is much better at dismantling stall builds than Wing Attack is as well.</p> <p>Roost is the last move, allowing Gliscor to keep itself healthy so it can consistently wear down stall and even bulkier offensive teams that can have trouble breaking it. Removing its Flying typing while healing is also a great bonus because Ground typing is actually quite good defensively, and its 4x weakness to Ice-type is reduced to 2x while using the move, which can allow Gliscor to actually sit in on weaker Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like defensive Swampert and Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing HP and Speed is very effective when combined with Gliscor's natural bulk. The Speed investment and Jolly nature are necessary to maximize Taunt's effectiveness, enable Gliscor to function as a check to max Speed Lucario, and outspeed certain Pokemon like some variants of Jirachi, Roserade, non-Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and even offensive Suicune, which it can revenge kill if it is severely weakened. Optionally, Gliscor can use a minimum of 216 EVs in Speed to reach 308 Speed, which still allows it to outspeed Lucario, Roserade, Rotom-A, and offensive Suicune; the 40 EVs can then be transferred into Attack investment to guarantee a 3HKO on Breloom with Ice Fang regardless of Stealth Rock damage and to almost completely guarantee a 2HKO on maximum HP Metagross with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. This comes at the price of being slower than Pokemon that aim to Speed creep Gliscor like Zapdos, offensive Celebi, Jirachi, and opposing Gliscor.</p> <p>An Impish nature is a great alternative that gives Gliscor increased bulk, which makes a significant difference when facing foes like Choice Band Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Flygon, Metagross, and Lucario. With a spread of 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe, Gliscor is still able to outspeed Adamant Lucario and max Speed Heatran, but it will lose out on shutting down fast Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A. It will also be unable to hit Roserade first with a powerful Earthquake, and be potentially unable to use Taunt or Earthquake to either prevent Suicune from using Calm Mind or wear it down with chip damage. Another option is use maximum special bulk to become an excellent check to mixed attackers such as Flygon. With a spread such as 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD and a Careful nature, Gliscor survives weaker Ice-type attacks from Clefable, defensive Swampert, and Zapdos while maintaining its ability to check Lucario without Ice Punch and Breloom. It can even use a Sassy nature and minimum Speed IVs to have a Speed stat of 175, allowing it to underspeed Skarmory and Breloom to pivot effectively with U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of Gliscor's unique typing and bulk, it can come in safely on many Pokemon. Use Gliscor's typing to your advantage by pivoting it into Electric-type, Ground-type, and even Fighting-type attacks. Gliscor can be used to gain momentum by punishing Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A's Earthquake and Thunderbolt. When facing a stall build, try to switch in on Skarmory; stall teams have decent diversity in their move selection, so try to properly scout movesets before comfortably sending Gliscor in on Pokemon like Tyranitar, Clefable, and Rotom-A. Taunt can completely shut down RestTalk and Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A, provided that Gliscor does not switch in on Will-O-Wisp. Using Taunt can sometimes be quite risky against Pokemon like Swampert, Gyarados, and Dragonite, so proceed with caution and try not to use Taunt unsafely unless you deem it necessary. Sending Gliscor in on a double switch can be incredibly effective when facing stall builds, as they often have difficulty switching into Gliscor, which can create opportunities for you to put pressure on your foes. Take advantage of the defensive perks of Ground typing when using Roost with Gliscor to keep it healthy. Ice Fang can be used liberally and can often catch switches into Ground-immune pivots, as it will often hit those pivots super effectively and even occasionally inflict a freeze on them. If Gliscor is your main Lucario check, keeping it healthy is quite important. Try to determine if Lucario is using Ice Punch before sending Gliscor in. If you notice that Lucario isn't holding a Life Orb, then there is a higher likelihood that it packs Ice Punch with either a Choice item or a Shuca Berry; Gliscor needs to watch out for the latter, as Lucario can take an Earthquake with Shuca Berry and take Gliscor out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie can switch into Gliscor very easily when it is healthy, spin away entry hazards, threaten the whole team with a powerful STAB Water-type move, or even recover its health, as Gliscor's Earthquake is simply not strong enough to threaten most healthy Starmie. For this reason, Tyranitar is an excellent teammate that can trap Starmie with Pursuit and threaten it with a powerful STAB Crunch or even Dark Pulse. Gliscor can also switch into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while Tyranitar can come in on Ice-type attacks thanks to its sand-boosted Special Defense. Although both Tyranitar and Gliscor are weak to Water-type attacks, very specially bulky variants of Tyranitar can actually soft check Water-types like Starmie and Rain Dance Kingdra. Choice Scarf Tyranitar gets a special mention, since it can trap Starmie, Latias, Rotom-A, and even Gengar.</p> <p>Electric-type Pokemon can serve well to hit pesky Water-types like Gyarados, Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic super effectively. Zapdos has great defensive synergy with Gliscor, and it can use Hidden Power Grass to shut down Swampert while simultaneously matching up very well versus Gyarados, which is Gliscor's greatest enemy, and other Water-types as well. Zapdos also completely shuts down Swords Dance Scizor, an opponent that can actually give Gliscor trouble sometimes. Rotom-A can spinblock on defensive teams, which supports Gliscor in whittling down the opposition. As an Electric-type, it has similar benefits to Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Rotom-A notably is a fantastic revenge killer for removing Gyarados. Grass-types like Breloom, Celebi, and Shaymin can threaten bulky Water-types like Swampert and Milotic with super effective Grass-type attacks, while Celebi and Gliscor together make for a strong Fighting-resistant core. Although Grass-types serve as great answers to Water-types alongside Gliscor, an Ice-type weakness is compounded, so make sure to compensate for this with either Steel-types or your own Water-type.</p> <p>Magnezone pairs very well with Gliscor, forming a core that is devastating for defensive builds to face. Knock Off Gliscor gets a special mention, as it can remove a Skarmory's Shed Shell, allowing Magnezone to trap it without any issues. Magnezone can also trap Bronzong, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Scizor, which have the potential to give Gliscor some trouble with Explosion, Ice Punch, and potentially boosted Bullet Punch. Gliscor has nice type synergy with Steel-types, as it can come in on Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while Steel-types can come in on Ice-type attacks for it. Skarmory and Gliscor form a fantastic defensive core because Gliscor can switch into Electric-type attacks, especially ones from Choice Scarf Rotom-A. Spikes support from Skarmory can also assist Gliscor in wearing down an opposing team. Water-types resist both Water- and Ice-type attacks, which are the only two types that Gliscor is weak to. Starmie, Milotic, and Suicune all pair nicely with Gliscor. The latter two can combine with Gliscor to form a strong defensive core that does well against Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar; in return, Gliscor can even check Swords Dance Lucario quite well, which Suicune and Milotic can both only soft check. Milotic can be used alongside Gliscor to form a defensive core that offensive teams often find quite difficult to break.</p> <p>Clefable and Blissey can come in on special Water- and Ice-type attacks while Gliscor can take physical attacks well, especially Fighting-type attacks. Because Clefable and Blissey are passive, setup sweepers can often take advantage of them which is where Gliscor's Taunt and defensive utility can be useful for stopping those setup Pokemon in their tracks. Latias resists Water-type attacks and has high Special Defense, which complements Gliscor's high Defense quite well. Choice Scarf Latias can also use Thunderbolt to revenge kill Gyarados. Using Toxic Spikes alongside Gliscor from Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Roserade can be beneficial for wearing down potential Gliscor checks like Celebi, Hippowdon, Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gliscor is a versatile Swords Dance sweeper that can employ either a set with incredible staying power or an all-out offensive set that thrives on perfect coverage. Because of Gliscor's natural bulk and unique typing, it can find many opportunities to use Swords Dance and put pressure on offensive and defensive teams alike. Another great way to use Swords Dance Gliscor is to weaken an opposing team, allowing Gliscor to serve as an effective late-game cleaner. Earthquake is Gliscor's best STAB move, which can deal massive damage after Swords Dance has been used. Even without a Swords Dance boost, Earthquake can hit Heatran, Jirachi, Lucario, Magnezone, and Metagross for super effective damage.</p> <p>Ice Fang is used in the third slot because it hits many of Gliscor's checks super effectively. Although it's a weak attack, it can cleanly OHKO Pokemon like Dragonite and Flygon and come very close to OHKOing opposing Gliscor after a Swords Dance boost. It can even OHKO certain variants of Breloom after just a single Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Roost can be used alongside Swords Dance to give Gliscor more staying power and longevity, maximizing its ability to switch in on and threaten its foes while using Swords Dance over a longer game. However, Thunder Fang can be used to form an all-out offensive set, which can OHKO Gyarados after a Swords Dance and come as a huge surprise to your opponent, while also hitting Skarmory super effectively. Another offensive option is Sky Attack alongside a Power Herb to deal a huge amount of damage to Water- and Grass-types. Taunt is another alternative that, when paired with Swords Dance, can absolutely obliterate opposing stall builds. When using Taunt over Roost, however, Gliscor's staying power is reduced, and you will have to rely on constant passive recovery in order to keep Gliscor healthy and maximize its effectiveness.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gliscor's Attack and Speed are maximized in order to give it as much of an offensive presence as possible. The Speed investment and Jolly nature maintain Gliscor's ability to check Lucario quite well and also let it outspeed some variants of Jirachi, Roserade, and offensive Suicune. Leftovers is the preferred item, which is especially important if opting for Taunt, but Yache Berry can sometimes be used for a more offensive take, as it can allow Gliscor to sponge an Ice-type attack from the likes of Tyranitar, Jirachi, and even Blissey and Clefable. Gliscor can even stay in on Hidden Power Ice from Zapdos and Infernape, which for the latter can enable it to OHKO it with Earthquake. When behind Light Screen and Reflect, Yache Berry can ensure that Gliscor can survive even the strongest of Ice-type attacks. Power Herb is necessary alongside Sky Attack to skip the charge turn once.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor benefits especially from capitalizing off bad locked moves from Choice item Pokemon, so try to detect Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and conceal your Gliscor until you can switch in on an Earthquake from the former or a Thunderbolt from the latter. Swords Dance Gliscor is especially good at playing off its surprise factor, since it's not that common. Moves like Thunder Fang and Swords Dance can be played very effectively with this strategy either by luring in Gyarados or conditioning your opponent to not feel as uncomfortable as they should about giving Gliscor momentum. If you're not using Roost, Gliscor's health and passive recovery are extremely important. If Stealth Rock is not up on your side of the field, try to find instances where you can send Gliscor in simply to restore a bit of HP with Leftovers. If you're using Taunt, Swords Dance will be even less expected, so try to play on that surprise as well; if you're using Roost, you can likely use Swords Dance more frequently during the battle, so take advantage of Gliscor's ability to constantly set up and pressure the opposing team. Ice Fang can be used to catch pivots that come in on an expected Earthquake, and it will often hit them super effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar pairs extremely well with Swords Dance Gliscor because it can trap Starmie, Rotom-A, Latias, and Gengar, all of which can prevent Swords Dance Gliscor from cleaning. Swords Dance Gliscor has no HP investment and maximum Speed, so Bronzong's Gyro Ball can often 2HKO it. Thunder Fang is Gliscor's best option against Bronzong, which does laughable damage even after a Swords Dance boost. On top of that, with its inability to properly run Taunt and Roost at the same time, it has a hard time preventing Bronzong from setting up Trick Room, and some Bronzong variants even pack Hidden Power Ice. For this reason, Magnezone is an excellent pairing, as it can trap Bronzong and remove it by using Magnet Rise and Thunderbolt; it can also trap Scizor and Choice Scarf Jirachi, which can deal significant damage to Swords Dance Gliscor with Bullet Punch and Ice Punch. Skarmory can phaze Gliscor with Whirlwind to give it trouble, but Magnezone can also trap it, aiding in Swords Dance Gliscor's ability to clean late-game. Your own Scizor can pair very well with Gliscor, as it can threaten Gengar and use its U-turn to help Gliscor reliably switch in and set up.</p> <p>Water-types like Starmie, Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert can make things very difficult for Gliscor either by outspeeding and threatening to OHKO it with a Water- or Ice-type move, or by surviving a Swords Dance-boosted attack. If Gliscor doesn't have Thunder Fang, Gyarados can switch in with ease and fearlessly shrug off a +2 Ice Fang. Grass- and Electric-types like Breloom, Celebi, Shaymin, Zapdos, Rotom-A, and Raikou can threaten Water-types and offensively synergize with Gliscor quite well. In particular, Grass-types other than most Breloom can serve as solid switch-ins to Water-type attacks, which can be especially helpful, but they are also weak to Ice-type moves.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi, Rotom-A, and Latias can all revenge kill Gyarados and other setup sweepers. Jirachi also resists Ice-type attacks, and while Latias resists Water-type attacks. In return, Gliscor can come in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Jirachi and Bug-type attacks aimed at Latias.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine’s unique typing, granting it a nearly unresisted STAB combination, a neutrality to Stealth Rock, and an immunity to sand and hail, makes it a potent wallbreaker in DPP OU. Ice / Ground is only resisted by Bronzong, while Mamoswine’s base 130 Attack hits the many common Pokemon weak to these moves such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, Latias, Heatran, and Breloom really hard. Mamoswine also has strong priority in Ice Shard, allowing it to revenge kill Dragonite, Flygon, and Latias effectively. Mamoswine is a potent user of Substitute to make up for its mediocre Speed, as it is just fast enough to outspeed walls such as defensive Jirachi and Heatran, can make 101 HP Subtitutes and 2HKO Clefable, and Ice Shard threatens faster Pokemon weak to Ice enough to get it a free turn. Mamoswine also has an effective support movepool with options such as Knock Off and Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Mamoswine unfortunately has a large list of problems in OU stemming from its lack of strong physical Ice-type moves, its mediocre Speed and the consequences of it, and a metagame very hostile to Ice-types. While Mamoswine has Ice Shard, its best physical Ice-type move otherwise is Ice Fang, which simply isn’t strong enough to threaten bulkier Pokemon immune to Ground such as Gyarados, Bronzong, Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Cresselia or even very bulky Pokemon weak to Ice such as Hippowdon, physically defensive Zapdos, and Celebi. Mamoswine has to rely on Blizzard in hail and its bad base 70 Special Attack to threaten these Pokemon. Mamoswine’s stats give it a conundrum, as its base 80 Speed stat forces heavy investment lest it get outsped by most of the metagame. However, its base 110 HP stat needs a lot of investment to reach 101 HP Substitutes, and Mamoswine always wants more power. Mamoswine is forced into this conundrum because of how hostile DPP OU is to its typing. Mamoswine has extremely common weaknesses to Steel, Fighting, Fire, and Water, and Grass while it is only immune to Electric and resistant to Poison. No amount of investment into Mamoswine’s defenses will save it from Jirachi, Scizor, Bronzong, Lucario, Infernape, Gyarados, Suicune, Swampert, Starmie, Heatran, Breloom, Machamp, and the huge amount of Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Tyranitar, Gengar, Latias, and Zapdos who all either can outspeed it or live one hit and remove it. On top of this, Mamoswine is grounded and despises poison, paralysis, and burn, making it easier to pick off. These flaws make Mamoswine niche in DPP OU, on the cusp of excellence but held back from being a staple of the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mamoswine makes for a decent Stealth Rock user, as with Focus Sash, Endeavor, and Ice Shard, it can threaten slower Pokemon after it sets up Stealth Rock and survives an attack at 1 HP due to Focus Sash. Mamoswine’s immunity to sand and hail means weather can’t pick it off. Unfortunately, such a set badly struggles to deal with Azelf and against other common leads such as Gyarados, Jirachi, and Machamp, and is overall not very effective beyond the lead slot, as it’s a frail Stealth Rock user vulnerable to Starmie. Mamoswine can also use Substitute or Endure alongside Liechi or Salac Berry to reach 1 HP and use Endeavor, but priority and faster Choice Scarf users are way too common for this to be effective. Mamoswine also has a host of other items, such as Muscle Band, Soft Sand, and various resistance berries such as Chople Berry for Gengar, Breloom, and Tyranitar; Passho Berry for Gyarados, Suicune, and Swampert; and Occa Berry for +1 Tyranitar Fire Punch and Heatran. Mamoswine can use a Choice Scarf, but its mediocre Speed stat and lack of strong physical Ice-types moves really hurt it. Mamoswine can also use Curse and Avalanche, but it’s typing simply isn’t meant for taking the hits needed to pull this off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Faster Steel-types or those that aren’t weak to Earthquake are fantastic checks. Levitate Bronzong is the best answer in the game to Mamoswine, as Mamoswine can’t hurt it effectively. Physical Mamoswine also struggles to damage Skarmory, but physically defensive Skarmory is 2HKOed by Never-Melt Ice- boosted Blizzard. Jirachi is faster and 2HKOes with Iron Head, having a 60% of preventing Mamoswine from doing anything. Scizor destroys Mamoswine with Bullet Punch. Beware that none of these Pokemon besides Bronzong want to take on Mamoswine behind a Substitute</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types are not OHKOed by Earthquake and KO Mamoswine back. Gyarados, Swampert, Starmie, Suicune, Kingdra, Milotic, and Quagsire all threaten Mamoswine. Gyarados even potentially sets up on Mamoswine should it lack Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types often either outspeed Mamoswine, have super effective priority, or survive its attacks and OHKO it. Infernape and Lucario, while weak to Earthquake, easily dispatch Mamoswine and even have super effective priority. Breloom has to be careful of Ice Shard and Machamp can’t repeatedly take Earthquake, but they also defeat Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Especially without Blizzard, Mamoswine really struggles to deal with bulky Pokemon not hit super effectively by Earthquake. Skarmory, Bronzong, and Hippowdon are chief among these, but Rotom-A, Celebi, Uxie, Cresselia, and Abomasnow are a challenge for Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Most faster Pokemon, as long as they’re not 4x weak to Ice Shard, can eliminate Mamoswine if they get in safely. Mamoswine struggles to beat Gengar and Azelf with Ice Shard, while most Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Latias, Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, Tyranitar, Lucario, and Rotom-A can either OHKO Mamoswine or outdamage it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mamoswine is grounded and vulnerable to all status. Mamoswine despises Toxic Spikes, while burn completely ruins it.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is extremely strong, OHKOing offensive Jirachi, Shuca Berry Heatran, Tyranitar, and Metagross after Stealth Rock. It also generally 2HKOes most offensive Pokemon who don’t resist it such as offensive Swampert, Machamp, and Scizor. Ice Shard is strong enough to OHKO Dragonite and Flygon and 2HKO offensive Latias, Zapdos, and Breloom. Mamoswine is bulky enough to survive one boosted Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Breloom’s Mach Punch, letting it take on these Pokemon.</p> <p>From here, Mamoswine’s options open up considerably. Ice Fang is Mamoswine’s best option to 2HKO defensive Latias, Zapdos after Stealth Rock, and frailer offensive Pokemon immune to Earthquake such as Gengar. However, Stone Edge is Mamoswine’s best move against Gyarados, who often tries to set up on it. Knock Off is another great choice, as it is Mamoswine’s best option against Skarmory, Bronzong, and defensive Rotom-A because it can’t hurt these Pokemon effectively. Removing their items not only helps Mamoswine wear them down, but also allows Magnezone to trap Skarmory if it has a Shed Shell.</p> <p>Substitute helps Mamoswine take advantage of the free turns it generates, as opponents often switch to a faster Pokemon that can KO Mamoswine when it threatens a foe out. Substitute also helps against bulkier Pokemon such as defensive Rotom-A without Shadow Ball, as it can keep the Substitute and either threaten them out or PP stall it due to Ice Shard’s 48 PP. Another option is Superpower, as Superpower is Mamoswine’s best offensive option against Skarmory and Bronzong, but has redundant coverage with Earthquake. In general, Mamoswine uses Superpower and Stone Edge together on more offensive sets and Knock Off and Substitute with Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>If Mamoswine isn’t using Substitute, it should always run maximum Attack and Speed EVs. With Substitute, Mamoswine can run 172 HP EVs to make 101 HP Substitutes to help against Clefable and Blissey. If it does this, one can run an EV spread of 172 HP / 144 Atk / 192 Spe with an Adamant nature, as this outspeeds Tyranitar and gives Mamoswine as much Attack as possible. However, this often isn’t necessary, as Mamoswine greatly threatens Clefable and Blissey anyway and is easily walled by other defensive Pokemon common alongside them. Mamoswine can run either an Adamant or a Jolly nature, as it both greatly appreciates the additional power on its Ice Shard or the extra Speed for neutral-natured Lucario, Heatran, defensive Latias, and Gyarados.</p> <p>Mamoswine can use a couple of different items, as its sand immunity lets it hide its item effectively. With Substitute, Leftovers is an excellent option to make more Substitutes and potentially PP stall defensive Rotom-A. Mamoswine makes good use of Life Orb, as its immune to weather damage, is relatively frail anyway, and greatly appreciates the power boost especially on Ice Shard and Superpower. The residual damage unfortunately makes it easier for Pokemon like Dragonite and Breloom to pick it off. However, Never-Melt Ice is great offensive option, as it powers up Ice Shard and Ice Fang. Choice Band also can work, as Choice Band Earthquake is insanely strong, OHKOing physically defensive Jirachi, but all of Mamoswine’s attacks either have coverage issues should it lock itself into them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine struggles to get in the game, as it doesn’t have any important resistances besides Electric. Try to get Mamoswine on predicted switches, U-turn, or with a sacrifice on something it heavily threatens or forces out, such as Dragonite, slower Heatran, Tyranitar, or Rotom-A locked into Thunderbolt. Use this opportunity to either set up a Substitute or hit something very hard. Note that Mamoswine’s coverage options such as Stone Edge and Superpower are often unexpected, letting it hit Gyarados and offensive Bronzong respectively quite hard.</p> <p>Mamoswine typically gets in the game fairly late, once defensive options have either been eliminated or worn down enough for Mamoswine to break through. However, with Knock Off, try to hit Skarmory fairly early before potentially revealing Magnezone as once it is revealed, Skarmory will almost never willingly lose its Shed Shell otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of Mamoswine most common partners is Magnezone, as various Steel-types like Jirachi, Skarmory, Scizor, and Bronzong are debilitating for Mamoswine. Magnet Rise Magnezone can trap all of these Pokemon, opening the way for Mamoswine. Another great partner is Choice Specs Latias, as not only does Latias switch into many of Mamoswine’s weaknesses and batter Steel-types to potentially trap with Magnezone, it also appreciates Mamoswine harassing special walls like Clefable and alleviating it in dealing with Electric-types. As Mamoswine really struggles in dealing with Pokemon that resist Earthquake, it appreciates strong offensive partners that can break down Hippowdon, Shed Shell Skarmory, and physically defensive Rotom-A with Shadow Ball. Fighting-types like Breloom, Bulk Up Machamp, and Hariyama are fantastic partners, as they can bust up bulkier Pokemon to the point that if Mamoswine is behind a Substitute, it can clean up effectively with powerful Earthquake and Ice Shard. Mamoswine helps significantly in dealing with Dragon Dance Dragonite and typically can survive one hit from +1 Tyranitar, helping out Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A who potentially struggle with these Pokemon.</p> <p>Mamoswine is also a potent partner to teams heavily built around paralysis, as outspeeding foes and attacking behind a Substitute is very effective against more offensive teams. Jirachi, Azelf, Gyarados, and lead Breloom are highly effective partners, as they can also potentially wear down Skarmory and other Steel-types for Mamoswine. Gyarados is particularly effective, as it often draws in Choiced Electric-type moves and covers most of Mamoswine’s weaknesses, while Mamoswine can alleviate Thunder Wave’s Gyarados’s inability to threaten Steel-types like Metagross once it has paralyzed them. Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran are also highly effective with Explosion, as that typically opens up a wall that Mamoswine struggles to deal with and Ice Shard helps them not have to deal with boosted Dragonite’s Outrage.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard represents Mamoswine’s best Ice-type STAB, as the raw base power makes up for its lower Special Attack stat. It 2HKOes physically defensive Hippowdon, Latias, Zapdos, and Skarmory after hail damage, something no other move it has can do. Earthquake hits very hard, as Mamoswine doesn’t need much investment to get the most out of Blizzard. Ice Shard pairs very well with Blizzard, as the power of Blizzard often forces faster defensive Pokemon such as Latias to Recover, allowing Mamoswine to pick them off.</p> <p>The last move is most commonly Substitute, as not only does Mamoswine’s threat level afford it opportunities to get a Substitute, but having a Substitute helps Mamoswine have another opportunity to use Blizzard should it miss outside of hail. Mamoswine can also set up Hail itself, as sand it ubiquitous in DPP OU and having perfectly accurate Blizzards without Abomasnow is very helpful, but Mamoswine sorely misses the pressure it applies with Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Blizzard needs minimal investment alongside Never-Melt Ice to 2HKO targets such as physically defensive Skarmory and Latias in hail, so Mamoswine is free to invest heavily in Attack and Speed to be as threatening as possible. Mamoswine can also use Leftovers alongside Substitute to make more Substitute, but either most forgo 2HKOing Skarmory or invest heavily in Special Attack.</p> <p>Mamoswine can either lower its Defense or Special Defense. It most often lowers its Special Defense, as Mamoswine has enough physical bulk to survive attacks like Jirachi’s Iron Head after a Substitute and most priority such as Dragonite Extreme Speed, Scizor’s Bullet Punch, and Breloom’s Mach Punch. Both Naughty and Naive are useful, but having the extra power on Earthquake and Ice Shard is slightly more preferable alongside Blizzard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine should generally wait for hail to be active, as Blizzard isn’t consistent enough to be used outside of hail repeatedly. Mamoswine typically picks and chooses its opportunities accordingly: it can come in early in the game to wallbreak if hail is up, but generally waits until fairly late in the game. Once in, try to set up a Substitute to deal with faster Pokemon and just wail away at foes—only very bulky Water-types and Bronzong can withstand Mamoswine repeated attacks behind a Substitute with 100% accurate Blizzard. Mamoswine should only use Blizzard sparingly outside of Hail; not only does Blizzard only have 8 PP and it’s 70% accurate, but Mamoswine typically needs to use it multiple times to take out bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Latias. These Pokemon can potentially PP stall it if Mamoswine isn’t careful.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Mamoswine’s number one teammate is Abomasnow. Permanent hail is crucial to its success, as repeatedly relying on Blizzard’s 70% accuracy is a huge problem against defensive Pokemon it can’t OHKO. Most Abomasnow sets are helpful, as more defensive sets have the longevity to set up hail repeatedly while more offensive sets can help open up Steel-types neutral or immune to Ground such as Scizor, Bronzong, and Skarmory for Mamoswine. As Mamoswine and Abomasnow stack a lot of common weaknesses, the rest of the team must either be very offensive to mask those weakness or have enough defensive flexibilities to handle them.</p> <p>Magnezone or Magneton are still very helpful, as specially defensive Skarmory is problematic, while Shed Shell Skarmory despises Hail and Blizzard. Other ways to punish Shed Shell Skarmory such as Fighting-types like Machamp, Breloom, and Hariyama as well as Substitute Jirachi are also helpful. Additionally, Mamoswine needs help against Steel-types such as Jirachi even if it has Magnezone support. Metagross is a fantastic teammate, as it has the flexibility to answer a lot of offensive Pokemon, handles Jirachi, and can potentially sweep with an Agility set after Mamoswine weakens other Pokemon. Other help against Fire-types and Breloom is highly helpful, so common teammates on Magnezone offense such as Uxie, Gyarados, and Latias are advised.</p> <p>More defensive approaches often revolve around helping Abomasnow stay alive to set up hail repeatedly. Donphan and Starmie are great teammates for this. Earthquake Latias in particular is also an excellent partner to handle Choice Scarf or otherwise faster Heatran, as it can repeatedly use Fire Blast and Mamoswine cannot switch in or is forced out if it doesn’t have a Substitute. Other strong defensive partners such as Jirachi, Zapdos, and Gyarados make good teammates.</p>"

  "Porygon-Z": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon-Z is one of the strongest attackers in the tier, as both of its abilities can potentially boost the power of its moves, and it has a fantastic offensive movepool. Adaptability-boosted Tri Attack hammers many prominent defensive Pokemon such as Latias and Clefable, while its coverage options threaten walls that resist Normal, such as Jirachi and Skarmory. With Nasty Plot, Porygon-Z can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, even Blissey. Unfortunately, Porygon-Z struggles with just about everything else besides attacking, as its typing gives it no resistances besides its immunity to Ghost, and its frailty makes switching it in difficult. Porygon-Z especially struggles against offensive pressure from faster Pokemon such as Latias, Starmie, and Flygon, as it has average Speed and is easily at least 2HKOed by most common attacks. Faster Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Heatran, Jirachi, Gengar, and Scizor using Bullet Punch can switch into even boosted Tri Attack and KO or heavily damage Porygon-Z. Porygon-Z is also very weak to residual damage and status—it is vulnerable to sand and affected by all three entry hazards. Paralysis ruins its Speed, and burn and poison further expose its poor bulk. Porygon-Z can be effective against slower defensive teams as an offensive lead, but it generally is not recommended for use in DPP OU.</p>",

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>With incredible defensive stats and a plentiful amount of supporting moves such as Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Reflect, Light Screen, and Memento, Uxie can take many hits and assist its team with ease. Furthermore, it can utilize Trick in order to cripple the opposing Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, which is great at supporting setup sweepers.</p> <p>Uxie is weak to common attacking types from most standard Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Rotom-A. Additionally, Uxie faces some competition as a utility lead from Azelf, who is much faster and packs moves like Taunt and Explosion. Nevertheless, Uxie is a great addition to any team due to its ability to support its teammates in a variety of effective ways.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Uxie has a wide movepool, which enables it to utilize many different strategies. Uxie can be an effective field effect supporter by using Rain Dance, Trick Room, or even Sunny Day. Since Uxie has tremendous natural bulk and functions as a reliable pivot, it is actually better at doing this than most other Pokemon. Fire Punch can be used to surprise Scizor and even Forretress, but this should only be used if there is a pressing need for a Scizor check. Grass Knot can hit Pokemon like Swampert and Tyranitar, but stronger Pokemon are more effective at using the move. Imprison can be used to prevent foes like Swampert, Hippowdon, and Metagross from setting up Stealth Rock. A Trick + Iron Ball set can surprise a Ground-immune foe like Zapdos, Skarmory, and Rotom, but the item suppresses Uxie's Levitate until Uxie's no longer holding it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Uxie's main purpose is to support its teammates with moves like Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Reflect, so Taunt users like Gliscor, Heatran, Skarmory, and Gyarados can completely stop Uxie in its tracks while also taking advantage of its weak attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar is immune to Psychic, doesn't mind paralysis as much as other Pokemon, and can maim Uxie with a powerful Crunch or trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are immune to Thunder Wave and also shrug off Psychic. Hippowdon needs to watch out for Trick, but if Uxie doesn't have it, Hippowdon can take advantage by setting up Stealth Rock or phazing with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Gengar, Rotom-A, Scizor, and even Heracross can threaten Uxie with their powerful super effective STAB attacks. Gengar and Rotom can utilize Substitute to block status moves and then attack with Shadow Ball, while Scizor and Heracross can hit hard with U-turn and Megahorn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, and Magnezone can at most be crippled by Thunder Wave. Psychic barely does any damage at all, and all these Pokemon can fire back with strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers</strong>: Uxie really dislikes status, mainly poison or a burn, so Pokemon like Heatran, Clefable and Zapdos can be quite annoying. Clefable's doesn't care about status because of its Magic Guard, which means it completely invalidates Uxie unless Uxie uses Trick to give it a Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Wave is a great move for stunting opposing offense and soft checking setup sweepers. Uxie is a very reliable Stealth Rock user due to its immense bulk and Ground immunity, and its decent defensive typing complements these traits. Psychic is Uxie's best STAB move, which it uses against a variety of Pokemon, like Breloom, Machamp, Swampert, and Gliscor. U-turn makes Uxie a fantastic pivot option, as its large bulk combined with minimal Speed investment allows it to take a hit and pivot out to an unscathed teammate. In particular, Uxie can use U-turn against Starmie that spins Stealth Rock away, and then Tyranitar can come in and trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p>Uxie can use Ice Punch to hit Dragonite, Flygon, Gliscor, and even Zapdos harder. It's really weak otherwise, though, so Psychic is generally better. Skarmory can be a thorn in Uxie's side, so Uxie could even use Thunder to hit it super effectively, as well as hit Starmie and Gyarados. Still, Psychic remains the superior choice.</p> <p>If you're using a Relaxed nature, Thunder Wave is not preferred, since it defeats the purpose of going all-in to slow Uxie down. Alternative moves like Knock Off, Yawn, Toxic, and even Heal Bell are suitable. Knock Off allows Uxie to remove a foe's item, which is a rare and extremely useful move in DPP. In particular, removing Bronzong's Macho Brace and Leftovers from the likes of Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Skarmory is fantastic. Yawn can be used in conjunction with U-turn to further strengthen Uxie's role as a pivot, and this pairs very well with Spikes because Yawn consistently forces the opponent to switch their Pokemon. Toxic can be used to more directly cripple foes like Hippowdon and Zapdos, which can ease the matchup versus defensive teams. Heal Bell can be a useful move depending on the team, but this move is more so a decent option because Uxie has some flexibility in its moveset and access to the move is quite rare. The drawback to not using Thunder Wave, however, is Uxie's increased vulnerability to setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Calm Mind Jirachi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs are used to maximize Uxie's general bulk. 24 EVs in Special Defense allow Uxie to always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Modest Latias and also switch into Stealth Rock once. 16 EVs in Speed enable Uxie to outpace maximum Speed Adamant Scizor so it can use U-turn before its Bug Bite or even after its Bullet Punch and allow a teammate to freely switch in. The remaining 216 EVs are poured into Defense, which is useful for taking on Tyranitar and strong Fighting-types with Close Combat as well as possible. Leftovers keeps Uxie healthy, since it doesn't use a recovery move. Lum Berry is an interesting alternative to prevent Roserade and even Smeargle from inducing sleep before Stealth Rock is used; it also can cure confusion from Machamp's Dynamic Punch and paralysis from Jirachi's Body Slam. As an alternative, Uxie can have more Speed investment at the expense of Defense EVs depending on its team's demands. Uxie can hit benchmarks to outspeed Pokemon like Breloom, Modest Kingdra and Suicune, Gyarados, Dragonite, fast Taunt Heatran, and even Modest Zapdos and Timid Rotom-A.</p> <p>Uxie can opt for a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs to take as much advantage of a slower U-turn as possible and even slightly increase U-turn's damage output. With this investment, Uxie's Speed is just 175, barely underspeeding uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon like Skarmory, Metagross, and Breloom; it will notably underspeed Tyranitar much more often, as many Tyranitar sets try to Speed creep Skarmory. This means it can take Metagross's Meteor Mash or Tyranitar's Crunch before it uses U-turn, which can be very helpful for teams with trappers like Dugtrio and Magnezone. With a Colbur Berry equipped, Uxie can reliably take any attack Tyranitar wants to throw at it and use a slower U-turn to get Dugtrio in safely; as an added bonus, U-turn's increased damage output enables it to do just enough damage to guarantee Dugtrio a KO versus Tyranitar. In addition, Machamp's Payback and Bronzong's Gyro Ball are significantly weakened, meaning Uxie can check them quite effectively and force them to either switch or, in Bronzong's case, use Explosion. This does come with some drawbacks, however, as Relaxed Uxie is weaker to Choice Band Swampert and Substitute Breloom. Swampert can threaten to make Uxie flinch with Waterfall, and Breloom can use Substitute before Uxie can hit it, meaning it can catch Uxie on a bad U-turn. If opting for this alternative setup, shift the 16 EVs in Speed back into Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Uxie can do something productive in almost all lead matchups, so try to come up with a plan for each scenario. If facing Azelf, it may be smart to use U-turn on the predicted Taunt. Try to get Stealth Rock up on the first turn as much as possible, especially against Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp, as both may make it difficult via Explosion or Dynamic Punch. Use Thunder Wave to cripple foes like Tyranitar, Rotom, Skarmory, and Jirachi; by doing so, Uxie can actively support Pokemon like Swampert, Breloom, Machamp, and Tyranitar. Take advantage of Uxie's lower Speed by using U-turn to enable teammates to come in safely. Keeping Uxie healthy can allow you to use its utility late-game, which can be useful for taking on Fighting-types or setting up Stealth Rock after Starmie has used Rapid Spin. Although it's usually used as a lead, Uxie can support its team just as effectively while not acting as the lead. It's used as a lead much more often simply because its traits are sought after for a lead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Uxie doesn't require much support and it can fit onto a wide variety of teams. Since Uxie can effectively spread paralysis, teammates that take advantage of this are preferred. Choice Band Swampert can take advantage of paralysis and use Waterfall to deal massive damage and make its foes flinch. Machamp can use Dynamic Punch to create a parafusion combination. Breloom, especially a Substitute variant, can take advantage of paralysis. Choice Band Tyranitar appreciates paralysis support because it can enable it to muscle through Skarmory or outspeed potential checks like Gengar and Lucario. Choice Scarf Rotom-A can function well as a revenge killer and spinblocker; it can check Metagross once, which is quite threatening to teams that typically feature Uxie. Because of this, Skarmory or a bulky Water-type like mixed Swampert and Suicune could pair nicely with Uxie. These Pokemon also appreciate the paralysis support that Uxie provides. Magnezone could be useful to circumvent Uxie's vulnerability to Skarmory and Scizor, trapping and removing both foes. Wish users like Latias, Jirachi, and Clefable can help to increase Uxie's longevity, as Uxie's bulk enables it to receive Wish quite well. If using a Relaxed nature, Dugtrio is a great teammate to take advantage of Uxie's slower U-turn on most Tyranitar variants. Pokemon that appreciate Hippowdon and Bronzong crippled like Flygon, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar pair nicely with Relaxed Uxie.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Due to Uxie's great bulk and decent Speed, it can utilize a Choice Scarf set in order to cripple opposing Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock. Uxie can generally last long enough during a battle to set up Stealth Rock again if it gets removed, while still being capable of weakening the opposing team. Trick cripples the opposing lead by swapping its item with a hindering Choice Scarf, locking it into either Stealth Rock or an attacking move. U-turn lets Uxie switch out and break Aerodactyl's and Azelf's Focus Sash at the same time if they decide to Taunt it, and also enables Uxie to function as a reliable pivot. Uxie can use Thunder Wave to cripple the Tricked Pokemon or an incoming foe. Thunder Wave is also useful to cripple Dragon Dance sweepers like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gyarados, as well as Swords Dance Lucario and Jirachi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed Speed EVs allow Choice Scarf Uxie to outspeed Aerodactyl and Azelf and Trick them before they can Taunt Uxie. The rest of the EVs are poured into HP for maximum general bulk, and Defense to take on Tyranitar as well as possible. An Impish nature enables Uxie to often survive Tyranitar's Pursuit as it switches out, although it needs to be decently healthy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After crippling a foe with Trick, you have two choices; setting up Stealth Rock helps by slowly chipping away at the opposing team, while using U-turn after Trick lets Uxie switch after seeing what the opponent brings in. Choice Scarf Uxie lures in Tyranitar very often, so you should plan ahead and not use Trick if you suspect your opponent has a Choice item Tyranitar. Keeping your Choice Scarf can be useful mid-game to cripple setup sweepers with either Trick or Thunder Wave; in particular, Swords Dance Lucario won't be able to remove Uxie with Extreme Speed at +2, so it can be crippled for a teammate to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Uxie is bad against entry hazard users, such as Skarmory and Forretress, because they can freely set up entry hazards against Uxie due to its inability to dish out much damage. Therefore, a Rapid Spinner is a good teammate to remove those entry hazards. Forretress resists Ghost- and Dark-type moves, while Starmie is a splendid Rapid Spinner as it can scare away Spikes users with its powerful STAB moves. Although it lacks Rapid Spin, Heatran is great at destroying most entry hazard users due to its impressive typing and raw power. Magnezone can also serve to trap and remove Skarmory and Forretress, reducing the necessity for a spinner when using Uxie.</p> <p>Any setup sweeper that takes advantage of a bad locked move is a good teammate, there are certain Pokemon that can capitalize on that switch. Machamp appreciates Uxie's ability to both Trick a Choice Scarf to a foe and also spread paralysis, as it can set up a Substitute and immediately wreak havoc against the opposing team. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gyarados, and Tyranitar, as well as Swords Dance Lucario, all appreciate Uxie's Thunder Wave and Trick support.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Although Azelf seems better suited for this task due to its greater Speed and access to Explosion, Uxie can still set up Light Screen and Reflect well since it possesses much more bulk. This extra bulk allows Uxie to come in frequently throughout a match. Stealth Rock aids Uxie's teammates in sweeping, while U-turn can help scout your opponent's switches. Alternatively, Memento be used to sharply reduce a foe's Attack and Special Attack; a setup sweeper can then come in and take advantage of this.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Uxie to outspeed Roserade and other base 90s in order to get off another move before it takes a hit. Being slower than Gliscor also means that Uxie can U-turn out after Gliscor uses Taunt, which allows your next Pokemon to freely set up. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used in order to at least Speed tie with opposing Gliscor and set up another defensive screen.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Based on the lead match-up, Reflect should be used against physical attackers, while Light Screen should be employed against special attackers. Uxie's Speed should also not be forgotten, as if EVed properly, it can still outspeed base 90 Pokemon. Use Memento only when you've determined that Uxie won't be useful later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Uxie often draws in entry hazard users because it can't do much back to them. Heatran and Starmie both deter entry hazard users in their own ways: Heatran has powerful STAB attacks while Starmie can Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. Additionally, Heatran has good defensive synergy with Uxie because it resists all of Uxie's weaknesses.</p> <p>This type of Uxie is better suited for offensive teams because of the momentum it provides with dual screens and U-turn. Many opposing teams rely on powerful moves to take down Pokemon like Suicune and Dragonite, but with the reduced damage that they take thanks to dual screens, these Pokemon can set up additional boosting moves and proceed to sweep the opposing team. Alternatively, Machamp is a good partner because its Substitutes can survive more hits and let it wreck the opposing team easier. Additionally, Machamp resists two of Uxie's weaknesses: Dark and Bug.</p>"

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>BoltBeam and Psychic provide outstanding type coverage, allowing Mesprit to check some of the biggest threats in OU. High defensive stats allow it to take powerful hits, while above average offensive stats allow Mesprit to deal back decent amounts of damage. Mesprit is able to deal with threats such as Gyarados, Dragonite, Flygon, and Infernape with its great type coverage. Mesprit's only major downfall is the lack of a reliable recovery move outside of Rest. Wish support is always recommended due to Mesprit having to deal with such powerful hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mesprit has an amazing movepool; there are many options to consider. Reflect and Light Screen allow Mesprit to support its teammates while weakening attacks aimed at it. Healing Wish is somewhat risky, but allows Mesprit to restore the health of a deadly sweeper, which opponents may be unable to handle a second assault from. This move may be tempting but the exchange of Mesprit's life is a big turn off. Magic Coat can cripple opponents that try to status Mesprit, which is helpful in OU as many Vaporeon and Blissey use Toxic. Finally, Grass Knot is usable if you lack a way to remove Swampert, but this limits Mesprit's type coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that resist the BoltBeam combination or take little damage from any specially based attack are great counters to Mesprit. Blissey is every special Pokemon's worst nightmare. With her mammoth HP stat and great Special Defense, she is able to wall Mesprit all day with no problem. Blissey is also able to weaken Mesprit with Seismic Toss as it is unable to recover its health without Rest.</p> <p>Magnezone is another great option as it takes minor damage from Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Psychic, while it is able to hit Mesprit with a STAB Thunderbolt or take most of Mesprit's health with Explosion.</p> <p>Tyranitar makes an excellent counter to Mesprit as it has an immunity to Mesprit's STAB Psychic, and it also takes a small amount of damage from the BoltBeam combination thanks to the Special Defense boost that sandstorm provides. Choice Band Tyranitar is able to OHKO Mesprit with Crunch 100% of the time, while Pursuit will also OHKO if Mesprit tries to escape.</p> <p>Scizor makes another fine option as it takes little damage from Psychic or Ice Beam, while Thunderbolt only 4HKOes a Choice Band variant. U-turn will always OHKO Mesprit when Scizor is holding a Choice Band and Mesprit has taken damage from Stealth Rock. Scizor also has access to Pursuit in case Mesprit tries to switch.</p>",

      "Utility Counter": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to KO dangerous OU sweepers such as Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape. Even without Special Attack EVs Mesprit is able to OHKO all 4 HP / 0 SpD Gyarados with Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage, all offensive Dragonite and Flygon with Ice Beam, and all Naive Infernape with Psychic. The EVs ensure that you never get KOed by these threats in return.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is the best option in the final slot as it gives Mesprit the chance to cripple faster sweepers and KO them on the following turn. Stealth Rock is another useful option, as it allows Mesprit to score an OHKO on Gyarados when it decides to switch in, and it also renders any Focus Sashes useless. U-turn allows Mesprit to escape an oncoming Tyranitar or Scizor before they are able to severely damage it with Pursuit.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are specialized to take hits as well as possible. Max HP is vital as it allows Mesprit to survive even boosted assaults from the most powerful OU sweepers. 180 Defense EVs ensure that Mesprit survives a +2 offensive Gyarados's Waterfall 100% of the time, and it also allows Mesprit to survive a +1 Outrage from Dragon Dance Dragonite. 76 EVs in Special Defense allow Mesprit to survive a standard Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball most of the time. This is shown in the damage calculations below, along with more OU threats included.</p> <ul> <li>+2 252 Atk Adamant Gyarados + Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 73% - 87%</li> <li>252 SpA Timid Gengar + Life Orb Shadow Ball vs 252 HP / 76 SpD = 84% - 99%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant Machamp + Leftovers Payback vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 49% - 58%</li> <li>252 Atk Jolly Flygon + Choice Scarf Outrage vs 252 HP / 180 Def = 33% - 40%</li> </ul> <p>Stealth Rock support is helpful if Mesprit decides to not run it. Forretress makes a fine choice as it is able to switch in against Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves, while it is also able to remove entry hazards from Mesprit's side of the field. Stealth Rock is necessary to OHKO Gyarados after it switches in.</p> <p>Support from Wish is a massive help to Mesprit as it is unable to restore its health outside of Leftovers and Rest. Vaporeon is a great choice to do this as it has a huge HP stat and decent defenses. Blissey is another fine choice as she can switch in on Ghost-type moves with an immunity and threaten them with Thunder Wave. Mesprit and Blissey are a great defensive combination as they are able to switch in on each other's weaknesses. For example, Mesprit is able to switch in on Fighting-type moves that Blissey cannot handle.</p> <p>With the removal of Gyarados, Dragonite, and Gengar, Fighting-types such as Lucario and Infernape are able to set up without the fear of being KOed. After a boost from Swords Dance, Lucario will be almost unstoppable. Threats such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Weavile will all be OHKOed by Close Combat and Crunch. Infernape is a great option as it can deal serious damage both physically and specially, allowing it to defeat Rotom-A with Fire Blast, Swampert with Grass Knot, and Blissey with Close Combat. Magnezone is another option as it can switch into Scizor's Bullet Punch and trap it with Magnet Pull. Magnezone can then take out Scizor with Hidden Power Fire or damage it with Thunderbolt.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Mesprit makes an excellent user of Trick Room in OU due to its below average Speed and brilliant defensive stats. This set retains the ability to remove Gyarados, Dragonite, and Infernape with little trouble, while also allowing Mesprit to set up Trick Room and support slower members of its team. Thunder Wave isn't an option on this set as it will make the opponent slower than you, allowing them to outspeed Mesprit in Trick Room conditions.</p> <p>Trick Room allows Mesprit to support slow teammates. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam create the BoltBeam combination, giving great type coverage and being resisted by only Magnezone in OU. If Infernape or Gengar cause problems to your team, Psychic is the better option. U-turn allows Mesprit to escape the battle and scout oncoming attacks, as well as potentially bringing in a sweeper unharmed.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are the same as the above as they allow Mesprit to survive powerful boosted hits while being able to set up Trick Room for teammates. If you decide to use U-turn over Psychic, an alternative spread is recommended. 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Mesprit to move after most opponents, allowing the switch-in to come in unharmed.</p> <p>Wish support is helpful here as it allows Mesprit to switch in and set up Trick Room multiple times. Vaporeon is a great teammate for this as it can switch in on Water-type moves with an immunity and support the team with Wish. Its low Speed is helpful too as it allows you to use Wish before taking a hit.</p> <p>As this set is designed for Trick Room, slow and powerful teammates are recommended. Metagross, Snorlax, and Magnezone make great choices as they all pose a significant threat in the OU tier. Metagross is able to rip holes in the opponent's team with its STAB-boosted Meteor Mash and powerful Explosion. Snorlax is a great tank for Trick Room teams as it can set up Curse and batter the opponent with boosted Body Slam and Crunch. Magnezone, on the other hand, attacks from the special side. If Blissey decides to come in and wall you, Magnezone is free to use Explosion in her face.</p> <p>Steel-types are good partners as they can switch in on Dark- and Bug-type moves aimed at Mesprit. Magnezone makes an excellent teammate with its typing and good defensive stats. A huge Special Attack stat will allow it to switch in on resisted moves and force its way through your opponent's team with STAB Thunderbolt. Magnezone also has the bonus of Magnet Pull, allowing it to trap Scizor and OHKO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

Psychic is used as a reliable STAB move that hits Gengar and Machamp super effectively. Ice Beam will OHKO Dragonite and Flygon, while dealing huge damage to Celebi and Ground-types. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados, and it also provides excellent type coverage alongside Ice Beam. U-turn allows Mesprit to scout Pursuit users switching in and gain information about the opponent's team. Hidden Power Fire allows Mesprit to hit Scizor super effectively upon its switch-in.</p> <p>184 Speed EVs give Mesprit 363 Speed, which allows it to outrun positive natured base 115 Pokemon. Max Special Attack is vital for Mesprit to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Mesprit a little bulk. When using Hidden Power Fire, an extra 4 EVs should be placed into Speed to negate the lower Speed iv required.</p> <p>As this set removes common threats such as Dragonite, Gyarados, Gengar, and Infernape, setup sweepers have an easier time boosting their stats without the risk of being KOed. Dragon Dance Tyranitar is an option as Infernape and Dragonite are unable to hit it with Close Combat or Earthquake. A Babiri Berry is recommended however, due to the common usage of Scizor. Dragon Dance Kingdra is another option, as Mesprit is able to remove Dragonite from play. After a few boosts from Dragon Dance, Kingdra will be deadly with Outrage and Waterfall.</p>"

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the more iconic features of DPP OU is the lead metagame, and Azelf stands as one of the best candidates to get early momentum. Azelf's varied movepool, high base 115 Speed, strong offensive stats, and underrated bulk allow it to prevent Stealth Rock with Taunt, set up one's own Stealth Rock, and open up a hole with Explosion. These properties cement Azelf as a staple of hyper offensive teams. Azelf's bulk is not to be underestimated—with investment, Azelf can survive many strong attacks in the lead position, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch + sand damage, Metagross's Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, and Machamp's Payback + Bullet Punch that could invalidate frailer Azelf. Azelf also can lean into more immediately offensive sets with Choice Band and Life Orb, taking advantage of its high Speed and strong Explosion.</p> <p>Azelf's primary flaws lie in its mediocre Psychic typing and how the metagame has adapted to it. Despite Azelf's fantastic offensive stats, Nasty Plot, and many coverage options, sweeping Azelf sets are uncommon and easily revenge killed. Azelf needs Psychic to break through bulky foes such as Rotom-A and Clefable, but it is resisted by many dangerous threats in the tier, such as Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Azelf is the benchmark for successful leads; many leads are chosen for how they perform against Azelf. These include faster leads that try to get Stealth Rock up before Taunt such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Aerodactyl; extremely powerful leads that overwhelm it such as Dragonite, Gyarados, Heatran, and Choice Specs Latias; and leads that try to disable it such as Jirachi's Body Slam + Iron Head combo, Choice Scarf Breloom's Spore, and Choice Scarf + Trick Uxie. Azelf also requires planning against offensive leads that could carry Stealth Rock—leads such as Metagross, Empoleon, Swampert, Heatran, and Bronzong can heavily damage Azelf if it chooses Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock rather than just get its own Stealth Rock up and use Explosion. What to do in each situation depends on how weak the team is to Stealth Rock and how much bulk Azelf has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Azelf is effective in setting up the team with dual screens; however, it is almost completely outclassed by Uxie with the exception of Explosion and Taunt. Taunt does allow Azelf to more successfully prevent Stealth Rock for Gyarados and Dragonite, however. Azelf also can use a fully offensive set in the lead position with Psychic, Fire Blast, Explosion, and Stealth Rock or possible other coverage moves such as Grass Knot, Hidden Power Fighting, and Hidden Power Ground while holding a Life Orb. Such a set tries to combine the standard lead and Choice Band by aiming to KO opposing leads and use its offensive pressure to set up Stealth Rock. Azelf also can try sweeping with Nasty Plot alongside Flamethrower, Psychic, and Hidden Power Fighting, Grass Knot, Hidden Power Ground, or even Explosion. These sets can also hold other items, such as Colbur Berry to help with Tyranitar and Lum Berry for general status. While threatening, most offensive teams can revenge kill these fairly easily. Defensive teams are more threatened due to its coverage options, but Azelf will eventually be forced to use Explosion because of residual damage. Stealth Rock Azelf doesn’t have to be in the lead position—another more threatening lead such as Dragonite or Gyarados can lead so that Azelf can set up Stealth Rock afterwards. Choice Scarf Azelf is an extremely fast revenge killer and can set up Stealth Rock guaranteed on faster leads such as Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Roserade; however, it struggles with easily being trapped by Tyranitar as well as lack of general power. It also is generally outclassed by Trick + Choice Scarf Uxie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar, especially Choice Scarf variants, and Weavile are the strongest Azelf counters in the game. Their Crunch and Night Slash, respectively, can easily dispatch Azelf, while Pursuit does a lot of damage on the switch out. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can also use Stealth Rock before Azelf can use Taunt on it, defeating its purpose. However, Tyranitar needs to be careful, as Azelf is commonly invested to survive Crunch + sand and either paralyze it or use Explosion. Weavile easily dispatches all Azelf that don't carry a Colbur Berry. Azelf can threaten these with the rare Hidden Power Fighting. While rare, Spiritomb is immune to both Explosion and Psychic and can checkmate Azelf with the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Azelf cannot set up Stealth Rock effectively against faster Taunt users such as Aerodactyl or certain Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Jirachi and Roserade. However, the rest of Azelf's team often can take advantage of the free switch from Azelf's U-turn on Aerodactyl or Roserade and Jirachi's Choice lock.</p> <p><strong>Very Strong Attackers</strong>: Even with investment, Azelf has no hope to survive certain strong attacks, such as Choice Specs Heatran's Overheat, Choice Specs Latias's Draco Meteor, and Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage. Without a Focus Sash, Azelf will just be able to set up Stealth Rock. Choice Specs Starmie will commonly KO non very specially bulky Azelf and outspeed it, preventing even Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Both Gengar and Rotom-A are immune to Azelf's most common attacking move in Explosion and easily OHKO it with Shadow Ball. Since few Azelf run maximum Speed, Gengar will most likely outspeed it. Both do not enjoy paralysis and get hit hard by Psychic, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross, Bronzong, Empoleon, Jirachi, Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory often will prevent Azelf lacking Fire Blast to do anything besides use Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock, while Heatran walls Azelf. Choice Scarf Scizor can even OHKO it with U-turn before it does anything. However, all of these besides physically bulky Skarmory and Jirachi need to be careful of Choice Band Explosion, as it will KO them.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Choice Scarf Breloom and Roserade prevent Azelf without a Lum Berry from doing anything at all by putting it to sleep. Even with a Lum Berry, status leads such as Body Slam Jirachi and Trick + Choice Scarf Uxie will paralyze Azelf and attempt to flinch it down in Jirachi's case or prevent it from doing anything at all with Uxie.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: Azelf is a frail Psychic-type Pokemon, and as such, all offensive sets without a Colbur Berry and bulk investment are easily revenge killed by every Choice Scarf Pokemon in the tier, such as Tyranitar, Flygon, Latias, Rotom-A, and Heatran.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Azelf is one of the premier Stealth Rock setters in the metagame due to its Speed and great movepool. Once Azelf has set up Stealth Rock, Azelf's Explosion has two functions: it heavily damages every non-Ghost-type and lets in another threat to immediately gain momentum as a free switch. Explosion also OHKOes every Rapid Spin user in the game besides Forretress, which can not spin Stealth Rock away due to being slower. Even an Explosion on Normal-resistant targets such as Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran can open up the opposing team. Another main Azelf role is Taunt, which helps keep Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off the field as well as preventing setup from leads like Gyarados and Dragonite.</p> <p>As Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Explosion make up Azelf's main niche as a lead, the last slot is more flexible. One great option is Thunder Wave, as Azelf can spread paralysis effectively instead of using Explosion immediately. Common scenarios to use Thunder Wave include against Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Gengar coming in to block Explosion and paralyzing common defensive Pokemon resistant to Explosion such as Jirachi and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. U-turn is another useful move from the lead position, as it allows Azelf to break opposing Focus Sashes and scout out opposing Steel-types, Ghost-types, and Tyranitar trying to Pursuit trap it. Fire Blast directly threatens Steel-types such as Metagross, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Forretress. Make sure to use a Timid nature if using Fire Blast, as Azelf's Explosion is still strong even with a hindering nature.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Azelf has a myriad of different EV spreads to adapt to the metagame. Focus Sash is extremely useful for powerful attacks that OHKO Azelf regardless of its EV spread, such as Latias's Choice Specs Draco Meteor. Maximum Speed lets Azelf at least Speed tie with itself and outspeed Gengar, Latias, and Infernape, while HP investment helps Azelf avoid 2HKOes from attacks such as defensive Empoleon's Surf. Azelf can also use a Focus Sash with no bulk to power up Explosion; however, without HP investment, Focus Sash leads Azelf to be vulnerable to offensive leads with priority moves such as Metagross's Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, Empoleon's Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet, and Machamp's Payback + Bullet Punch while also being vulnerable to Tyranitar's sand, giving it only one turn to do anything. Another choice is 184 HP / 188 Def / 136 Spe. This particular EV spread gives Azelf the ability to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch while also outspeeding positive nature maximum Speed Jirachi, Zapdos, and Flygon. This spread prevents Azelf from fainting to almost all common attacks in the metagame without a Focus Sash, allowing it to use Explosion after it sets up Stealth Rock. Azelf can run many different items as well. Lum Berry prevents lead Breloom, Jirachi, and Uxie from statusing Azelf while also preventing Machamp's confusion. Colbur Berry allows Azelf to survive the strong Dark-type attacks from Tyranitar and Machamp that often prevent Azelf from doing anything beyond setting up Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry's 25% heal gives Azelf some flexibility in EVs, allowing it to survive various priority such as from Machamp and Metagross as well as Tyranitar's sand from KOing Azelf after a strong hit.</p> <p>Other EV spreads are viable—note all of these have a Jolly nature: these include outspeeding the positive nature base 90 Speed benchmark such as 228 HP / 216 Def / 8 SpD / 56 Spe that survives Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch + Sand damage and Roserade's Leaf Storm, 252 HP / 56 Def / 64 SpD / 136 Spe outspeeds up to positive nature base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as survive Machamp's Payback and Modest Zapdos's Choice Specs Thunderbolt, 44 HP / 248 Def / 216 Spe that outspeeds Gengar and gives the maximum chance to survive Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Crunch, and 8 HP / 248 SpD / 252 Spe with a Colbur Berry that survives various Dark type attacks and Metagross's Meteor Mash and has maximum Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azelf is primarily used as a lead: it sets up Stealth Rock, prevents set up with Taunt, and then uses Explosion. How aggressive to be with Taunt to prevent setup largely depends on how weak to Stealth Rock and other entry hazards the rest of Azelf's team is, Azelf's bulk, and how threatening the opposing lead is to the rest of the team. Hyper offense teams with Dragonite, Gyarados, and Zapdos struggle when they lose a quarter of their health to Stealth Rock, so Azelf should aim to use Taunt on potential Stealth Rock users aggressively, even potentially forgoing Stealth Rock or Explosion. However, bulky Azelf sets can be more forgiving should the opposing lead attack instead of setting up—as an example, physically bulky Azelf can comfortably use Taunt + Stealth Rock on Metagross, as Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch will not KO, but less bulky Azelf are much more at risk. Beware of opponents taking advantage of Taunt and switching to a Choice Scarf Tyranitar and preventing Stealth Rock. Explosion is often very predictable from Azelf, so mixing up the timing of the Explosion such as using Thunder Wave or U-turn on a Ghost-type switch-in can often lead to large payoffs. Fire Blast is often unexpected from Azelf, so hiding it often allows Azelf to do a lot of damage to bulky Fire-weak Pokemon such as Metagross and Forretress.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azelf is a cornerstone of the hyper offense play style in DPP OU—common teammates on these types of teams include Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Dragonite, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Scizor, and Swords Dance Empoleon. Azelf immediately gets these threats Stealth Rock and a free switch to start setting up. This setup is especially crucial for Gyarados and Dragonite, as it prevents them from having to deal with Stealth Rock. Azelf's Explosion also commonly targets Steel-types, meaning Dragonite has fewer Dragon-resistant Pokemon it needs to punch through. Azelf also is great for offensive paralysis teams, as it is effective at spreading paralysis on hard-to-paralyze threats such as Rotom-A and Gengar. Common teammates include Jirachi, Machamp, Tyranitar, Breloom, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Latias. Jirachi is particularly effective; Jirachi's Iron Head is not only an effective tool at flinching down paralyzed threats, but mixed Jirachi is very good at breaking threats hard to handle for hyper offense, such as Skarmory and Gyarados with Thunderbolt, Swampert with Grass Knot, and Lucario with Hidden Power Ground or Fire Punch. Jirachi and Latias can also use Healing Wish to open up another attempt from a sweeper such as Gyarados.</p> <p>Azelf often immediately attracts in Tyranitar to remove it, and as such, that can help Gengar, Calm Mind Jirachi, Zapdos, and Latias break past it once it paralyzes Tyranitar or uses Explosion. Zapdos also benefits from Azelf's ability to prevent Stealth Rock. Azelf's ability to prevent Toxic Spikes in the short term against Roserade and Nidoqueen is critical for Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and offensive Calm Mind Suicune. Azelf can also support teams built around Explosion, such as with Magnezone, Metagross, and even Choice Scarf + Copycat Lucario. Magnet Rise Magnezone works well with Azelf with U-turn, as Bronzong and Metagross will never use Earthquake on Azelf, while Skarmory gives easy entry, allowing Magnezone to trap these Pokemon. Magnezone also traps Choice Scarf Jirachi using Iron Head. Most offensive Pokemon in the tier can pair well with a free switch and Stealth Rock; good teammates can help to mitigate various matchups for hyper offense teams.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band Azelf takes a different approach than the standard lead: it doesn't set up Stealth Rock and just immediately threatens the foe with Explosion or a strong U-turn. Azelf's Explosion is among the strongest in the game—even many Explosion-resistant Pokemon have a high likelihood to be KOed, such as Metagross, Bronzong, Tyranitar, and non-physically bulky variants of Jirachi and Skarmory. This prevents Stealth Rock from going up while also taking out a threat. Choice Band also gives Azelf a very strong U-turn, having a chance to OHKO non-physically bulky Azelf, OHKOing Latias and Starmie without bulk investment after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOing Tyranitar. It also does respectable chip damage to most threats, which is especially helpful should Azelf want to save its Explosion for later in the game.</p> <p>Zen Headbutt is a strong physical Psychic-type move that OHKOes Machamp while being the strongest non-Explosion move. As an alternative, Sleep Talk makes Azelf a great switch-in to Breloom's Spore, as any of the moves Sleep Talk calls will do a lot of damage to it. Trick is the main final option, as it can shut down walls such as Rotom-A, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Ice Punch is another option that OHKOes all Dragonite without a Yache Berry and is favorable to OHKO Zapdos without bulk investment. Azelf has access to other elemental punches; however, Explosion outdamages all other options even when resisted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Azelf has some options on the EV spread, but it should almost always be running an Adamant nature, maximum Attack, and maximum Speed. Choice Band Azelf's primary niche is its nuclear Explosion and fast Speed, and an Adamant nature emphasizes that. Reducing that power makes Azelf less likely to OHKO Pokemon that resist Explosion that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Metagross, Bronzong, and Heatran. As an example, Adamant Azelf has a 68.8% chance to OHKO maximum HP Metagross with Explosion, but a Jolly nature only has a 18.8% chance. However, Azelf without any investment is quite frail—Azelf can be made more bulky by using 8 HP / 252 Atk / 112 SpD / 136 Spe with a Jolly nature. This allows Azelf to survive Life Orb Starmie's Hydro Pump while maintaining a lot of power. Another choice is to make Azelf even more bulky with 8 HP / 108 Atk / 228 SpD / 164 Spe with an Adamant nature that survives Choice Specs Starmie's Hydro Pump while still outspeeding Roserade. This spread still OHKOes Heatran and non-physically bulky Bronzong but only has a 6.3% chance to OHKO maximum HP Metagross with Explosion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Azelf most often will lead and use Explosion on the first turn. This can often surprise the opponent once their Metagross, Bronzong, or Heatran is KOed, as the standard lead is far more common, so they will almost assuredly stay in and attack. U-turn and Azelf's other coverage should be used if one predicts a Ghost-type switch-in or they are super effective. Beware of locking into Zen Headbutt and Ice Punch, as much of the tier takes little damage, and Tyranitar can easily trap Azelf. While using Trick on a wall will weaken Explosion, Azelf's Explosion will still OHKO almost anything that doesn't resist it even without a Choice Band. If Azelf stays alive mid-game and has Sleep Talk, switching it into Spore or other sleep-inducing moves is advised, as after the lead sequence, Azelf's lack of bulk makes it difficult to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Azelf is self-sufficient as an anti-lead designed to bait and remove bulky Steel-types and Tyranitar with Explosion. As such, sweepers that appreciate no Stealth Rock are advised, such as Gyarados and Dragonite. Since this Azelf cannot set up Stealth Rock, another user such as Uxie, Heatran, Tyranitar, Bronzong, Metagross, and Jirachi is needed. Pokemon that are good in one-on-one situations, such as Metagross, are quite good alongside Azelf, as Azelf often leads to a free switch for both players after it uses Explosion. Azelf also appreciates another U-turn user that can continue its chain, such as Scizor and Flygon. This Azelf is more conducive to teams built around using Explosion, so other common users such as Bronzong, Metagross, Magnezone, Heatran, Gengar, Camerupt, and Choice Scarf + Copycat Lucario are appreciated. Heatran is perhaps the best partner, as Azelf can heavily damage or KO Tyranitar with U-turn or Explosion, meaning offensive teams have less switch-ins to Heatran's Fire-type attacks. Other than these, this Azelf fits on standard hyper offense teams. As such, partners such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Swords Dance Empoleon, Dragonite, and Gyarados are good partners.</p> <p>Other good partners are specially offensive hyper offense teams focused on removing Tyranitar as soon as possible. Good partners include Heatran, various Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, Suicune, and Latias, and weather-dependent sweepers like Kingdra. Machamp also appreciates bulky Fighting-neutral Steel-types being heavily weakened or removed, potentially Rotom-A holding a Choice Band due to Trick, and it's also a great one-on-one Pokemon. Take care to use this set's unique advantages over the standard lead (eliminating Stealth Rock users instead of preventing it, strong U-turn, Trick) in mind when choosing teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Utility Rain Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Azelf can lean more into its support role by setting up Rain Dance and Stealth Rock for the team. Azelf is indistinguishable from the standard lead until it reveals Rain Dance or Damp Rock, so it can effectively set up Stealth Rock with its Speed. Rain Dance is the key to the set, as after Azelf sets up Stealth Rock and Rain Dance, it gives rain sweepers 8 turns to run through the opposing team. While it faces heavy competition for the role from Uxie, Azelf has several key advantages: it is naturally much faster, making foes less likely to use Taunt on it; it has Taunt itself to prevent entry hazards from more defensive leads such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Nidoqueen that Uxie struggles with; and it has Explosion to open up Tyranitar or other threats to rain on the opposing team. Taunt also helps to prevent status, Protect to stall rain turns, and opposing setup before the rain sweeper hits the field. Azelf can also use U-turn instead should the team value Azelf to set up rain later in the game. Explosion can weaken an annoying threat such as Tyranitar or Skarmory and gives a free switch to a rain sweeper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As Azelf constantly fears being removed by Choice Scarf Tyranitar before getting rain set, it must run a physically bulky set designed to live its Crunch + sand damage. The Speed and Special Defense EVs allow it to outspeed and live Timid Roserade’s Leaf Storm. The physical bulk also makes it survive strong physical attackers such as Metagross’s Meteor Mash + Bullet Punch, Machamp’s Payback + Bullet Punch, and Choice Band Gyarados. Azelf must use Damp Rock to keep rain up for the full 8 turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azelf typically lays Stealth Rock, sets up Rain Dance, and then uses Explosion. However, it can deviate from this gameplan against specific leads. As Azelf’s rain sweeping teammates generally aren’t weak to Stealth Rock, using Taunt on potential Stealth Rock users such as Metagross, Empoleon, Heatran, and Bronzong isn’t as necessary. However, against Spikes and Toxic Spikes users such as Skarmory, Roserade, and Nidoqueen, Azelf should use Taunt to prevent these entry hazards from going down. Against extremely powerful leads such as Choice Specs Latias, Choice Specs Heatran, and Tyranitar, Azelf should prioritize getting Rain Dance off, as rain sweepers need that support more than Stealth Rock should Azelf only survive one turn. Azelf’s Explosion is also very predictable after Rain Dance—while it is preferred to use Explosion on a good target, such as Tyranitar trying to reset rain, using Explosion immediately maximizes the turns rain sweepers have to run through the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain teams typically are formulaic and follow a general structure of three or four rain sweepers and the remainder support Pokemon. Swift Swim Kingdra is the best rain Pokemon in the tier and is generally required on rain teams. Kingdra has many possible sets it can run, but with Choice Specs, it can 2HKO even soft Water-resistant Pokemon such as Gyarados and Dragonite as well as special walls such as Clefable and Jirachi with a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. It also outspeeds every common Choice Scarf user. Kingdra OHKOes most non-specially bulky or Passho Berry Tyranitar after Stealth Rock even with the sand boost. After Kingdra, the other most common Swift Swim Pokemon used are Qwilfish and Ludicolo, as they provide other utility. Qwilfish absorbs Toxic Spikes, has a powerful Explosion, can set up Spikes and use Swords Dance, and hits Breloom and other Grass-types hard, while Ludicolo offers a neutrality to Electric and has strong Grass-type options for bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Suicune. Swords Dance Empoleon is an excellent choice as a non-Swift Swim sweeper, as it destroys defensive teams that rain sometimes struggles against while taking advantage of boosted Water-type attacks. For support, the standard choice is Bronzong, as it offers a Dragon-type resistance to absorb Latias, Dragonite, and opposing Kingdra while also easily setting up rain multiple times. It can set up Stealth Rock if Azelf is unable to, potentially put something to sleep with Hypnosis, and 2HKO Tyranitar with Gyro Ball. Another common support is Metagross, as it can lure in Skarmory, Rotom-A, and Zapdos with a Trick + Iron Ball set or take advantage of rain’s halving of Fire-type attacks to run an Agility set. A Lum Berry also helps against Breloom’s Spore. Rotom-A and Latias with Colbur Berry are other good supporters, as they both resist Electric, weaken Tyranitar, and can set up rain multiple times. Rotom-A is also a great answer to defensive Jirachi, which commonly survives rain-boosted attacks and spreads paralysis.</p> <p>Many Pokemon enjoy not having sand active, and as such, are prime candidates for rain teams. The most prominent of these is Suicune, as its Substitute sets give a bulky and strong rain sweeper. Suicune also appreciates Toxic Spikes absorption and offensive Water-resistant Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gyarados eliminated. Other more niche choices include Kabutops and Omastar, which are extremely powerful but lack the utility of other rain sweepers, defensive Dragon Dance Dragonite, Cresselia, Raikou, and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi. To be effective rain support, teammates generally want to lure in and KO weather changers such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Abomasnow; sponge hits from Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-A; and help weaken walls such as Skarmory, Jirachi, Latias, Milotic, and Blissey. Rain also struggles against Lucario and Gengar, as the style typically doesn’t run Choice Scarf Pokemon, and most of the support give up an easy Swords Dance or can’t absorb Gengar’s attacks. Helpful Pokemon include Magma Storm Heatran, ironically Rain Dance Tyranitar, Swampert, Magnezone, and Machamp.</p>"

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>When considering Grass-types, Shaymin is inevitably compared to Celebi. Both are base 100 Grass-types with Natural Cure, and Celebi has the edge in its host of support moves (including Recover, Thunder Wave, and Stealth Rock) as well as a coveted resistance to Fighting to help it deal with Pokemon such as Breloom, Machamp, and Lucario. However, Shaymin gives it a run for its money with Seed Flare and its lack of Psychic-typing to hold it back. Rounded base 100 stats provide Shaymin with respectable offense, solid bulk, and an important Speed stat, while Natural Cure allows Shaymin to pull off an effective Sleep Talk set; it can absorb Spore from Breloom, threaten it out while asleep, and then cure sleep. Seed Flare is huge for Shaymin, as the 40% chance to reduce Special Defense by two stages lets it pressure walls like Clefable and Latias somewhat effectively even with more defensively oriented sets, something Celebi cannot do. Shaymin’s pure Grass-typing means it isn’t weak to Pursuit, can check many threats such as Tyranitar, Gyarados, Suicune, Breloom, and Rotom-A effectively, and is a valuable Water-resistant Pokemon for defensive teams.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Shaymin is extremely uncommon in DPP OU because its movepool is just too small to justify over other options and Grass-type moves have very poor coverage. Shaymin is almost completely stopped by Latias; even with Seed Flare drops, Choice Specs Latias can come in and OHKO it, while defensive Latias is largely unfazed by Hidden Power Ice unless Shaymin gets a Special Defense drop. On the other hand, more defensive Shaymin sets based around Leech Seed are stone walled by Clefable and otherwise are not threatening enough to justify. Should Shaymin try to force its way through these Pokemon, Seed Flare’s 8 PP becomes a problem. Shaymin will also always have issues with either Steel- or Dragon-types, as it has to choose which Hidden Power to use and often can’t fit Earth Power to both threaten Heatran and supplement its coverage. Shaymin also suffers from a tiny movepool; it just doesn’t have the utility options that other Grass-types like Celebi, Roserade, or Breloom have. Shaymin mainly operates with its high stats and typing; only a vanishingly few teams need that over what these other Grass-types can provide. Shaymin also isn’t an amazing sleep absorber, because offensive Breloom can both easily 2HKO it and, since Shaymin cures sleep on switch out, Breloom can just come in again and threaten sleep. Finally, Shaymin struggles badly with residual damage, as it is grounded, vulnerable to all status and sand, and lacks reliable recovery. Even with Natural Cure + Rest, if Shaymin is pressured out before it can use Rest, it can struggle to come in again, especially with Spikes up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shaymin can use Earth Power instead of Sleep Talk, as Shaymin outspeeds and OHKOes offensive Heatran and hits other Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi hard. Other than this, Shaymin doesn’t have a lot of options. Historically, Shaymin has used Leech Seed + Protect to threaten special walls and heal itself, but this set is both not strong enough to keep up with modern offensive teams and cannot break through defensive teams due to Clefable’s immunity to Leech Seed and it still struggles against defensive Latias. Shaymin’s huge weakness to residual damage makes Life Orb and Choiced items hard to justify; while it badly wants additional power and has Natural Cure + Rest or Leech Seed to heal off the residual damage, it severely struggles with coverage and gets worn down very quickly, preventing it from having a defensive niche. Shaymin’s utility options either are mediocre moves like Worry Seed and Grass Whistle, or better used by other Pokemon such as Healing Wish, Swords Dance, and Aromatherapy. Shaymin has other coverage moves, including Psychic, Air Slash, and Signal Beam, but these are far too weak to make an impact and don’t help with Shaymin’s biggest checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Latias</strong>: Latias is perhaps the best check in the tier to Shaymin, as Latias outspeeds Shaymin, takes even Hidden Power Ice well and can heal it off with Recover, and offensive Latias OHKOes Shaymin with Choice Specs Draco Meteor. Latias doesn't enjoy Special Defense drops from Seed Flare and is annoyed by Leech Seed, but typically neutralizes Shaymin well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Especially without Hidden Power Fire, Shaymin really struggles against Steel-types. Heatran, Scizor, Metagross, Jirachi, Skarmory, and Forretress are all painful for Shaymin to deal with. Heatran, especially if Shaymin lacks Earth Power, is devastating as Shaymin can't touch it otherwise and Heatran easily OHKOes back. Scizor easily OHKOes Shaymin with U-turn and Bug Bite, while Metagross and Jirachi effortlessly generate momentum on Shaymin if it can't him them super effectively. Skarmory and Forretress are especially dangerous, as they set up Spikes with impunity. All of these need to be careful of the correct coverage move, however.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Blissey</strong>: Clefable walls Shaymin if Shaymin doesn't get the Special Defense drop, while Blissey doesn't even care if Shaymin gets the drop. Clefable is the main reason Leech Seed sets have dropped off, while Shaymin can't touch Blissey without multiple Special Defense drops or Leech Seed. Even if Shaymin does get the drop, it only has 8 PP to break through these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Infernape are daunting for Shaymin to face, especially without Earth Power. Heatran outspeeds slower Shaymin sets and roasts it, while Infernape outspeeds Shaymin and does the same.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Shaymin gets worn down very easily with its vulnerability to all entry hazards, sand, and status and its lack of reliable recovery. Especially with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Shaymin can struggle to do much more than when it initially gets on the field. While it has Natural Cure to heal it of status on switch out and Rest, it loses a lot of momentum doing this.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: While Shaymin can hit Flygon and Kingdra hard with Seed Flare, Dragonite is a terror without Hidden Power Ice, as it sets up on Shaymin and can sweep the whole team. Shaymin gets hit very hard by these Pokemon; Flygon can U-turn on Shaymin for momentum or nail it with Outrage, Draco Meteor, or Fire Blast, Kingdra 2HKOes Shaymin with both Choice Specs rain-boosted Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor, and unboosted Dragonite OHKOes Shaymin with Outrage and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types resist Seed Flare and aren't hit hard enough by Hidden Power Fire and Ice to deter them. Defensive Celebi is similar to Latias in that it hard walls Shaymin without a Seed Flare Special Defense drop. Roserade sets up on Shaymin before Shaymin can KO it back with Hidden Power Fire or Ice. Breloom is not OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire or Ice and can hit very hard either on the switch or while Shaymin is asleep with Superpower or Focus Punch. Abomasnow is perhaps the best check in the game if Shaymin doesn't have Hidden Power Fire, as it hits very hard with Blizzard and still handles Shaymin even with a Special Defense drop.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Zapdos and Skarmory are quite effective against Shaymin. Zapdos is especially dangerous, as Pressure reduces Seed Flare's PP and needs a Special Defense drop before Hidden Power Ice does enough damage to it. Skarmory lays Spikes, hits very hard with Brave Bird, and can even take a stray Hidden Power Fire as long as its Special Defense isn't reduced.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: When paired with residual damage, even Pokemon Shaymin is supposed to check can get through it because it doesn't have the power to OHKO what it checks with Seed Flare even after Stealth Rock. Gyarados 2HKOes it with +1 Ice Fang and OHKOes it with +1 Bounce, Tyranitar hits very hard with +1 Fire Punch, Empoleon and Suicune 2HKOes it with Ice Beam, Rotom-A hits very hard with Overheat, Breloom's Focus Punch can OHKO it after Stealth Rock, and even Swampert's Ice Punch 2HKOes it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rest + Sleep Talk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seed Flare gives Shaymin a niche, as it is the strongest special Grass-type move without drawbacks. Grass Knot has issues hitting low weight Pokemon such as Clefable and Rotom-A, while Leaf Storm has harsh stat drops. Seed Flare OHKOes offensive Suicune after Stealth Rock and comes close to OHKOing Gyarados and Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Seed Flare's 40% chance to drop Special Defense helps Shaymin power through Clefable, as Clefable is 2HKOed by Seed Flare if the first drops Special Defense. Hidden Power Ice is Shaymin's best option to hit Dragon-types, as it OHKOes Flygon and Dragonite after Stealth Rock. Shaymin has a chance to get through Latias if Latias switches into Seed Flare and gets the Special Defense drop, as that KOs offensive Latias after Stealth Rock and heavily pressures defensive Latias. Hidden Power Fire is another option, as it hits Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, Metagross, and Jirachi hard. Both options at least 2HKO Breloom.</p> <p>RestTalk is Shaymin's best option both for recovery and for helping it with Seed Flare's meager 8 PP. Both Seed Flare and Hidden Power threaten Breloom, the most prominent Sleep user in the tier. Shaymin is unique among Sleep absorbers in that it has Natural Cure, preventing it from being sidelined by Sleep either via Rest or opposing Sleep users until it wakes up after it switches out. That is a double-edge sword though, because it means every time Shaymin tries to absorb sleep, it risks being hit hard instead.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shaymin needs maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature to be as threatening as possible, since it has poor coverage and relies on Seed Flare's power to handle common threats such as Tyranitar and Gyarados, which aren’t even OHKOed with maximum investment. Maximum Speed EVs gives Shaymin a solid Speed tier, outspeeding Rotom-A (with Hidden Power Ice, as the IV drop from Hidden Power Fire causes it to tie with Rotom-A), offensive Suicune, most defensive Latias, and neutral-natured Lucario. Shaymin has naturally good bulk, but it can also run HP EVs instead of Speed EVs to better survive attacks from Breloom, +1 Gyarados, and Suicune.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shaymin typically comes in on its resistances or on sleep moves to make progress, as Shaymin is so uncommon that its presence is unexpected and can either check what it needs to or absorb sleep in the short term. Shaymin typically comes into the game pretty early to blunt momentum from Water-types, Ground-types, and Breloom to save other defensive walls such as Clefable and Latias from having to take these Pokemon on. However, once Shaymin comes in, it needs to be extremely careful around Spikes users such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Roserade, especially if it doesn’t have Hidden Power Fire for the former two. Entry hazards—not only Spikes but especially Toxic Spikes—are a death knell for Shaymin; Shaymin both lacks reliable recovery and is grounded, so if it can’t get a Rest off, it’s effectively fainted. Try to use Rest before Shaymin is forced out, as it isn’t extraordinarily bulky and can be KOed rather easily by what it’s supposed to check if it’s heavily worn down.</p> <p>Offensively, try to hide Shaymin’s coverage move as long as possible. Early in the game, it can be hard to tell if Shaymin has Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire, or even if it’s a more offensive set and potentially has Earth Power. Opponents might be hesitant to send in their Dragonite, Heatran, or Forretress in on Shaymin for fear of its coverage so try to take advantage of this. However, Shaymin doesn’t have a lot of Seed Flare PP and only can get more while asleep, so don’t use it too flippantly. Additionally, be careful against Breloom. Once Shaymin is revealed, every time Breloom comes in, it could just start attacking to get through Shaymin. This gives an opportunity to switch to a stronger, faster Breloom check like Latias to force out Breloom without getting put to sleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shaymin is most common alongside Magnezone or Choice Scarf Magneton support on more defensive teams for a few reasons. The foremost reason is that Shaymin enjoys Skarmory and other Steel-types out of the picture so it can use Hidden Power Ice with impunity. The second reason is that defensive teams with Magnezone often have large defensive holes, especially against Water-types, as they are using a frail Pokemon instead of another wall. Shaymin helps fill that hole, as it is an untrappable check to Water-types and Breloom. Shaymin’s goal against more offensive teams is to keep other walls such as Clefable and especially Latias healthy against strong Water-types such as Empoleon, Gyarados, Kingdra, and Swampert. As such, Clefable and Latias are fantastic teammates. Against more defensive teams, Shaymin is a solid wincon against them once Clefable is incapacitated. To pull this off, Shaymin appreciates teammates that can take a lot of defensive responsibilities such as Hippowdon, Wish + Protect Jirachi, and Swampert. Swampert and specially defensive Hippowdon are especially helpful, as they cover Shaymin’s weaknesses quite well. Shaymin really enjoys defensive Clefable sets that can beat other Clefable, such as one using Encore, Sing, or even Focus Punch. Even if it doesn’t, just having Knock Off is very helpful both to weaken opposing Clefable, but also to Knock Off Skarmory’s Shed Shell should Clefable get the chance early in the game. Additionally, Shaymin can support more offensive Latias sets such as Calm Mind + 2 attacks.</p> <p>Shaymin can fit on more aggressive teams in a Fire-Water-Grass core, but these structures often really struggle to deal with Latias, hyper offense, and entry hazards and Shaymin faces competition from Breloom and Roserade. Common partners for this structure include Heatran for the Fire-type and a host of Water-types such as Swampert, Suicune, Kingdra, Starmie, and Gyarados. Other common partners include revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Rotom-A, and Choice Scarf Latias and strong offensive partners such as Swords Dance + Pursuit Scizor, Metagross, and Jirachi.</p>"
