    "overview": "<p>Thanks to the sheer power of Tera Normal Extreme Speed, Dragonite is one of DOU’s biggest threats, threatening to KO a large portion of the metagame. Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches from Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage. This pairing is preferred by offensive teams but can fit on other archetypes appreciate Dragonite's power and priority. Due to Dragonite's heavy dependence on Extreme Speed, Pokemon that can block priority moves such as Farigiraf, Tsareena, and Indeedee-F limit its effectiveness. Dragonite also struggles against Pokémon with high physical bulk that can take an Extreme Speed and threaten it in return such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Garganacl. Additionally, Dragonite is greatly hindered by Stealth Rock, which nullifies Multiscale and limits its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li>Life Orb can be used on offensive teams that need Dragonite to be capable of switching moves while still dealing lots of damage.</li> <li>A mixed Life Orb set with Hurricane is a viable set on rain teams. Life Orb or Sharp Beak allows Dragonite to threaten an OHKO on Amoonguss.</li> <li>Iron Head Dragonite is useful on teams that want increased damage against Fairy-types such as Grimmsnarl and Sylveon.</li> <li>Running an Assault Vest on Dragonite gives it more bulk and allows it to switch between moves at the cost of decreasing its offensive presence.</li> <li>Weakness Policy Tailwind Dragonite can use Multiscale to tank a hit and leverage speed control while dealing increased damage.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Heatran uses its unique typing and defensive stats to match up well against common special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo and threaten them back with its great offensive stats and wide coverage. While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch. Heatran has no form of recovery, so it appreciates teammates that can extend its longevity, such as Cresselia with Lunar Blessing and Amoonguss with Pollen Puff.</p>"

While it won't win any awards for damage output, it allows Tornadus to stay on the field without losing too much momentum after using Tailwind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taunt is used primarily to stop Pokemon like Cresselia and Diancie from setting up Trick Room.

It excels at forcing the opponent into defensive positions, creating opportunities to play aggressively with Landorus and its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earth Power annihilates targets weak to it and puts massive dents in most neutral targets. Sludge Bomb allows Landorus to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Tornadus, which resist or are immune to its Ground-type moves. Tera Poison elevates Sludge Bomb to a STAB move, which secures the OHKO on Assault Vest Rillaboom, bulky Ogerpon-W, and Alolan Ninetales as long as Aurora Veil is not active.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sandsear Storm gives Landorus the option of a strong spread move, making it even more difficult to play around and preventing foes with Follow Me or Rage Powder from redirecting its attacks. This move is especially potent when used in the rain, as it becomes a 100% accurate spread move, allowing Landorus to reliably apply offensive pressure to both targets simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, Substitute gives Landorus the ability to safely fire off strong Earth Powers and Sludge Bombs while attracting attention to itself, which can supply its teammates with opportunities to set up or attack on their own. Substitute guarantees that Landorus will survive at least one attack while behind it, which it appreciates given its mediocre bulk that ordinarily leaves it vulnerable to getting OHKOed by super effective attacks or getting KOed by priority moves when weakened. Landorus's offensive pressure forces the opponent to switch and use Protect a lot, creating many opportunities for it to set up a Substitute. This is especially true when it is paired with Pokemon that can apply Fake Out pressure such as Rillaboom and Incineroar.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Tera Poison increases Landorus's offensive capabilities, a more defensive route can also be taken with Tera Steel, which turns its glaring 4x Ice weakness into a resistance, allowing it to flip the script on foes that would normally force it out such as Chien-Pao, Kyurem, and Alolan Ninetales. Additionally, Steel is a generally useful defensive typing with many miscellaneous resistances, including ones to common attacks such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Tornadus's Bleakwind Storm, among others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Landorus appreciates teammates that can set up Tailwind such as Tornadus and Whimsicott, as it is naturally outsped and threatened with super effective damage by common Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Chien-Pao, and Alolan Ninetales. Effective speed control and positioning can allow Landorus to gain the advantage on these foes and others, making Pokemon that supply redirection support useful teammates as well, including Indeedee-F, Ogerpon-W, and Sinistcha. Teammates that struggle either offensively or defensively against Fire- and Steel-types, such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Kyurem, appreciate Landorus's ability to neutralize those threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

Gaining Defense boosts from it also helps Diancie against physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Palafin.</p> </li> <li> <p>Body Press synergizes very well with Defense boosts from Diamond Storm, giving Diancie useful coverage to hit foes it would normally have a tough matchup against such as Kingambit and Hisuian Goodra.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trick Room allows Diancie to support itself and its teammates such as Iron Hands and Torkoal by turning their low Speed into an advantage. Diancie is an effective Trick Room setter as it is hard to remove and, unlike other Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, has the offensive capabilities to make the most of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Foes must always be wary of Weakness Policy, as activating it turns Diancie into a fearsome sweeper. As such, Diancie forces opponents to either OHKO it or whittle it down with multiple neutral attacks, as a weak super effective attack into the bulky Diancie will put it in a commanding position. This is especially effective once Diancie has accrued enough Defense boosts, as even Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Palafin's Wave Crash may not OHKO it anymore. Diancie can also use Mental Herb to guarantee it sets up Trick Room once against Taunt users such as Tornadus and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass allows Diancie to resist the Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks that would otherwise OHKO it before a Defense boost such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer, Palafin's Wave Crash, and Landorus's Earth Power. It also removes Diancie's 4x Steel-type weakness, which helps it matchup better against Steel-type foes like Heatran and Gholdengo and Pokemon with Steel-type coverage such as Iron Hands. Tera Grass also grants Diancie an immunity to powder moves, preventing Amoonguss's Spore from affecting it and circumventing Rage Powder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clear Body notably makes Diancie immune to Landorus-T's Intimidate and Grimmsnarl's Parting Shot, allowing Diancie to maintain a constant offensive presence on the field during its valuable Trick Room turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Sassy Nature and maximum HP investment allow Diancie to survive a Steam Eruption from Volcanion. 24 Defense EVs allow Diancie to survive a Jolly Ogerpon-Wellspring Ivy Cudgel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Diancie enables Trick Room attackers like Kingambit, Torkoal, and Glastrier to sweep alongside it. Diancie wants Fake Out support to help set up Trick Room more easily. Rillaboom is a Fake Out user that can eliminate Palafin and provide Grassy Terrain recovery, while Iron Hands functions better under Trick Room specifically and deals with Volcanion and Kingambit better. Amoonguss also acts as a great partner for Diancie, with its Rage Powder and Spore protecting it from the Ground, Water, and Steel attacks that would threaten it. Pollen Puff also helps to increase its longevity.</p> </li> </ul>"

Flare Blitz offers more immediate damage that can OHKO Chien-Pao and threatens common Pokemon like Gholdengo and Rillaboom. On the other hand, Knock Off adds to Incineroar's utility, removing items like Clear Amulet, Porygon2's Eviolite, and Choice items. With Incineroar's low Speed stat, Parting Shot will often go last, so teammates can enter the field without the risk of being hit.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Incineroar to survive Volcanion's Steam Eruption and Ogerpon-W's Tera Water Ivy Cudgel after Intimidate.

Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder. Tera Grass provides an immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, as well as resistances to Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Iron Hands's Wild Charge, which would otherwise OHKO Palafin. Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p>"

Its wide array of coverage and relative lack of weaknesses make it scary for foes to trade with, and Defiant deters common Intimidate users such as Incineroar and Hisuian Arcanine from switching in lest Kingambit become too powerful and take over games with its Sucker Punch pressure, though it is not as potentially game-ending as its Swords Dance set.</li> <li>Kowtow Cleave does a great deal of consistent damage and notably OHKOes Indeedee-F and bulkless Gholdengo. Sucker Punch circumvents Kingambit's middling Speed tier by pressuring weakened faster foes such as Landorus, and it becomes especially threatening after a Defiant boost. Iron Head OHKOes Fairy-types such as Diancie and Alolan Ninetales as well as hitting common Ice-types like Baxcalibur and Kyurem for a lot of damage. Low Kick is Kingambit's best means to hit opposing Steel-types such as opposing Kingambit and Heatran, as well as opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Chi-Yu. Brick Break is another option that does more damage to Chi-Yu and has the advantage of breaking screens.</li> <li>Kingambit has a great deal of flexibility in its Tera type, allowing it to cover a wide variety of team-specific weaknesses both offensively and defensively, although some Tera types have greater offensive potential than others. Tera Fairy, for example, lets Kingambit resist Iron Hands's Fighting-type attacks and 2HKO it in return with Tera Blast. Tera Flying grants Kingambit immunity to Landorus's Earth Power and a way to OHKO Ogerpon-W and 2HKO Amoonguss and Rillaboom. Tera Ghost leaves it immune to Fake Out and common Fighting-type attacks from Iron Hands and Body Press users such as Archaludon and Diancie.</li> <li>With an Assault Vest, Kingambit is able to soak up moves from common special attackers such as Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Glimmora and beat them with its own powerful attacks. It is particularly good against Tornadus as it resists Bleakwind Storm, which can also trigger Defiant. As such, Kingambit boasts a great deal of defensive responsibility, but it must remain wary of being whittled down too much, as accumulated damage over time and a lack of recovery means it can eventually get picked off by faster attackers with even neutral coverage.</li> <li>Teammates like Landorus which have more consistent ways of threatening Steel-types like Heatran and Archaludon are required for Kingambit. Conversely, Landorus is one of the biggest threats to Kingambit, and as such it appreciates support from faster attackers that can OHKO it like Ogerpon-W and Chien-Pao. To make up for its low Speed, pivots like Incineroar and Rillaboom can help Kingambit get into attacking positions.</li> </ul>"

Its offense especially shines when paired with Chi-Yu, which greatly increases Iron Bundle's damage output with Beads of Ruin. Iron Bundle has excellent speed control with Icy Wind, which, when combined with its high Speed, can easily ensure that it and its allies outspeed the enemy team. However, Iron Bundle is a fairly fragile Pokemon, especially against powerful special attackers such as Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Bundle can run Encore over Icy Wind or Protect, easily locking most Pokemon into a move such as Protect or Fake Out thanks to its high Speed. On a snow team with Abomasnow, Iron Bundle can run Blizzard as a powerful spread attack, and it also can maximize its damage output with Tera Ice. Snow also boosts Iron Bundle's Defense, making it particularly more effective against priority spam teams with Dragonite and Palafin. 252 HP and 64 Special Defense EVs can be used with Assault Vest to survive an Overheat from Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle still has above 152 Speed EVs left for outspeeding Meowscarada. 40 HP EVs allow Iron Bundle to avoid a potential OHKO from Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword if Chien-Pao lacks a damage-boosting item, so an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe on less bulky sets could be used instead.</p>",

Furthermore, Chi-Yu has very good Speed, allowing it to naturally outspeed a considerable portion of the metagame.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Ivy Cudgel is a strong STAB option that hits common threats like Landorus, Incineroar, and Diancie super effectively and threatens an OHKO on Flutter Mane while also dealing solid damage to neutral targets.</li> <li>Ogerpon-W has quite a few options for its Grass-type STAB attack to hit Water-resistant foes like Palafin, Volcanion, and opposing Ogerpon-W. Horn Leech has respectable power in addition to giving Ogerpon-W a way to sustain itself, which can be helpful considering how crucial its health is. Power Whip is a stronger option, allowing Ogerpon-W to hit some targets harder than it would with Ivy Cudgel such as Tyranitar and Ursaluna.</li> <li>Follow Me leverages Ogerpon-W's good typing to support its team and shield its teammates from threatening attacks and status moves, with Water Absorb allowing it to heal from Water-type attacks such as Palafin's Jet Punch and Volcanion's Steam Eruption. Encore punishes Fake Out, Protect, and speed control moves, forcing the Encore target to switch out or repeatedly use a detrimental move, generating momentum for Ogerpon-W's team.</li> <li>Ogerpon-W usually uses Spiky Shield, but on faster-paced teams, it might opt to drop this for Encore due to the utility of Follow Me being desired in addition to Encore's potential to swing the momentum of a game.</li> <li>In addition to the usual benefits, Ogerpon-W gains +1 Special Defense upon Terastallizing, considerably improving its matchups against Flutter Mane and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Ogerpon-W outspeed Landorus and survive a Tera Stellar Chien-Pao Icicle Crash, with the rest of the EVs going into Attack to allow Power Whip to OHKO maximum HP Flutter Mane. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 28 Atk / 84 Def / 72 SpD / 72 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to survive a Choice Band Tera Normal Extreme Speed from Dragonite with Sword of Ruin active or a Choice Specs Tera Fairy Moonblast from maximum Special Attack Flutter Mane while still outspeeding Smeargle and Modest Glimmora.</li> <li>Tornadus makes a great partner for Ogerpon-W, as it provides Prankster Tailwind support and threatens Grass-types Ogerpon-W can't touch such as Rillaboom and opposing Ogerpon-W with Bleakwind Storm, and it can even strengthen Ivy Cudgel with Rain Dance. Flutter Mane threatens out Dragon-types like Baxcalibur and Raging Bolt that resist Ogerpon-W's STAB combination, and it appreciates the potential Follow Me support Ogerpon-W provides to draw strong priority attacks like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide away from it. Setup Pokemon such as Swords Dance Kingambit appreciate Ogerpon-W providing both Follow Me and Encore support to generate setup opportunities for them by either redirecting attacks or shutting down an opposing Pokemon.</li> </ul>"
