  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir is a solid Trick Room setter and attacker due to its high Special Defense with a strong Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Gardevoir is also one of a few Trick Room setters to have a good matchup against Amoonguss, a big problem for most Trick Room teams. However, Mega Gardevoir's somewhat high base Speed can be an issue after setting up Trick Room, as it ends up being slower than a lot of Pokemon like Tapu Bulu. It also is not quite fast enough to keep up with some of the metagame's bigger threats like Mega Metagross and Tapu Koko outside of Trick Room. Gardevoir's low Defense also means it struggles to set up Trick Room at times and requires Intimidate support to function at its best. Both of Gardevoir's STAB attacks are walled by Steel-types too, one of the more popular defensive types, and so it can find itself unable to deal much damage at times.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A faster set with maximized Special Attack allows Gardevoir to function better outside of Trick Room and deal even more damage; this set pairs well with Sticky Web Araquanid. Substitute allows Gardevoir to avoid status effects or simply buy itself a bit of safety on a predicted Protect from the opponent. Encore is a nice option to potentially lock slower opponents into Protect or a resisted hit and fire off Hyper Voices with greater ease. Calm Mind is a decent option because after only one boost it becomes very hard to take Gardevoir out with special attacks and it hits extremely hard. However, without any speed control, you need to be careful of faster threats that can hit Gardevoir hard before it can use Calm Mind. Ally Switch offers a different form of support to Gardevoir's team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types resist both of Gardevoir's STAB attacks and can deal huge damage back. Mega Scizor can also hit Gardevoir for super effective damage with Bullet Punch under Trick Room before it gets a chance to attack in return, while also setting up Swords Dances easily on Gardevoir. Bronzong can hit Gardevoir with a Gyro Ball before it can attack if Trick Room has been set.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types resist Hyper Voice and can hit back with strong neutral attacks. Incineroar and Victini also reliably take Psychic and deal heavy damage with Flare Blitz and V-create.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Aegislash resists both of Gardevoir's main attacks and hits back hard with Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon, which are both super effective.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Pokemon like Mega Metagross, Mega Swampert under rain, and Tapu Bulu can all hit Gardevoir very hard on its weaker defensive stat.</p> <p><strong>Slow Pokemon: Due to Gardevoir's high base Speed, slower Trick Room attackers like Stakataka can outspeed it under Trick Room and and deal a lot of damage. Amoonguss resists Hyper Voice and can put Gardevoir to sleep with Spore, but it needs to be careful of Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard users can stop Gardevoir from using Hyper Voice and give their partner an easier time dealing with Gardevoir; Celesteela and Aegislash are especially notable for also resisting Psychic.</p> ",

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is Mega Gardevoir's main STAB attack, which, when boosted by Pixilate, deals heavy damage to both of the opposing Pokemon. Psychic is Gardevoir's other STAB attack, which can hit the Poison- and Fire-types that resist Hyper Voice, such as Amoonguss and Mega Charizard Y. Psyshock is also an option that allows Gardevoir to hit Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Zapdos harder, at the cost of slightly lower Base Power. Trick Room is the speed control on this set and can be set up with relative ease at least once during the match due to Mega Gardevoir's good Special Defense. Protect is obligatory on most Pokemon in Doubles, but it helps Gardevoir in particular since it is prone to being double targeted due to being a Trick Room setter and is quite frail physically.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The bulk EVs let Mega Gardevoir take an Iron Head from -1 Mega Metagross or Overheat from Mega Charizard Y in Sun. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to boost Gardevoir's damage output when in Trick Room. A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs minimizes Gardevoir's Speed to let it move as early as possible when Trick Room has been set while giving Gardevoir a Special Attack boost. It is also an option to leave Gardevoir's Speed IVs at 31 and use a Modest nature if it's paired with a Tailwind user, since it can then outspeed base 130 Pokemon under Tailwind while also outspeeding uninvested Tapu Fini. Trace is the best ability before Mega Evolving because Gardevoir can potentially copy some useful abilities such as Intimidate and Download. Telepathy can also be useful if you have a spread move user such as Landorus-T with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is usually faster than most other Trick Room setters or attackers, so always consider whether Trick Room is necessary or if you would be better off without it. For example, you may not want to set up Trick Room against opposing Trick Room teams, at risk of helping them more than yourself. Many of Gardevoir's counters are slower than it, so not setting Trick Room allows your faster check to pressure them with greater ease. Gardevoir is good at setting up Trick Room from the lead position or very early in the game and punching holes in the opposing team with Hyper Voice before the opponent can maneuver into a better position to stop Trick Room being set. It is also good at finishing off weakened teams once you have removed any opposing Steel-types; however, it struggles to switch into attacks due to its low Defense, so make sure to bring it in after sacking a teammate or through a slow U-turn. Intimidate support can increase your chance of setting up Trick Room drastically, so switch in your Intimidate user when you plan to set up Trick Room. Using Protect on the first turn can sometimes be a good idea, since Gardevoir can be double targeted in an attempt to stop Trick Room going up. This allows Gardevoir's partner to get a free hit off on the opposing team. Taunt users can stop Gardevoir from setting up Trick Room while also stopping Gardevoir from protecting itself from attacks. However, Gardevoir has the option of attacking on a predicted Taunt, as its STAB attacks deal a lot of damage to common Taunt users such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Intimidate support is very important to help Mega Gardevoir survive some of the stronger physical attacks in Doubles, such as Landorus-T's Tectonic Rage. This makes Incineroar, Scrafty and Landorus-T good partners. Incineroar and Scrafty also provide Fake Out to further aid Gardevoir in setting up Trick Room, and their low Speed allow them to perform well once Trick Room is up. They also help beat Ghost- and Steel-types that threaten Gardevoir like Aegislash and Kartana. Landorus-T has U-turn to help bring Gardevoir in safely later on in the game while also being able to cycle Intimidate very well and get multiple Attack drops on the opposing Pokemon. Partners that beat Steel- and Fire-types are very useful to allow Gardevoir to use Hyper Voice with more freedom, so Volcanion and Zygarde make nice partners. Since Amoonguss is a huge threat for Trick Room teams, ways to stop it from putting Gardevoir to sleep once Trick Room is set up are a necessity. Tapu Fini is good for this, as it sets up Misty Terrain to block Spore on grounded Pokemon, allowing Gardevoir to hit Amoonguss with a Psychic. Tapu Fini also beats Fire-types, which resist Gardevoir's Hyper Voice. An Amoonguss of your own can switch into Spore from opposing Amoonguss and start putting the opposing team to sleep once Trick Room is set up. It can also provide redirection support with Rage Powder to guard Gardevoir from potential super effective hits. Since Gardevoir is best used on a semi-Trick Room team, having a faster Pokemon like Genesect or Tapu Koko are useful to generate momentum when Trick Room is not set.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is able to find a niche in the Doubles OU metagame due to its unique Fire / Steel typing and a combination of its power and bulk. This allows it to check a variety of threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Salamence, and Genesect. However, Heatran faces difficulty against generally specially defensive threats such as Tapu Fini and Zapdos that can shrug off damage dealt by Heat Wave and find opportunities to set up. In addition, Heatran's weakness to the common Water- and Ground-type attacks can allow opposing Pokemon to bypass its defensive capabilities and deal irreparable damage to it. Furthermore, a Speed stat of base 77 leaves Heatran outsped by a large portion of the metagame. Although Heatran doesn't have any glaring reasons to struggle in Doubles, these little flaws add up to making it tough to fit on teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Cannon is a solid choice against Rock- and Fairy-types such as Tyranitar, Tapu Lele, and Diancie that also hits Kyurem-B harder than any other move. An Eruption set for use in Trick Room with minimized Speed and a Firium Z equipped has some merit as a powerful attacker, but it's generally outclassed by Mega Camerupt and left walled by various popular threats. Taunt can be a useful move to stop support moves such as Tailwind, Calm Mind, and Trick Room. Stealth Rock is an option to check opposing Mega Charizard Y and Salamence, as Heatran usually finds a favorable position to set it against both Pokemon. Solar Beam sets with Grassium Z can get a surprise knockout on Tapu Fini and offer a strong neutral attack on various threats, especially when boosted by Grassy Terrain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Zygarde are immensely threatening because they can OHKO Heatran due to its 4x Ground weakness. Shuca Berry Heatran can take an Earth Power or Thousand Arrows, but if Heatran is weakened, the moves will still KO. Gastrodon and Mega Swampert can shrug off any move Heatran goes for aside from the very rare Bloom Doom. Ground-type coverage moves such as Earth Power from Kyurem-B and Stomping Tantrum from Mega Metagross are also threatening.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Araquanid, and Pelipper take negligible damage from most of Heatran's attacks and can then proceed to set up or simply attack with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Scrafty and Kommo-o, as well as Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana that use Fighting-type coverage moves can do a lot of damage to Heatran.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>STAB-boosted Heat Wave provides consistent spread damage. Earth Power is a great coverage move used for hitting opposing Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcanion, as well as Rock-types such as Diancie. Hidden Power Ice targets Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence. Finally, Protect is a staple of the Doubles OU metagame, as it provides free turns for Heatran's partner, scouts moves, and stalls out field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Shuca Berry allows Heatran to survive a Ground-type STAB move from Landorus-T or Zygarde, with this set specifically designed to take Zygarde's Tectonic Rage and retaliate with Hidden Power Ice. A Timid nature is used for outspeeding most Zygarde and Excadrill in neutral conditions.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Heatran can take advantage of its various resistances in order to safely switch into resisted attacks. However, it also needs to stay healthy in order to take advantage of Shuca Berry, as otherwise it will still be KOed by Ground-type moves. Thus, it is often necessary to choose between the ability to switch into resisted hits and the ability to take a Ground-type move. Offensive Shuca Berry Heatran is very effective at spreading damage, as it becomes much harder to OHKO using Ground-type attacks. This ability to wear down the opposing team can easily pave the way for another sweeper such as Dragon Dance Mega Salamence or Zygarde. However, be advised that Tectonic Rage Zygarde and Landorus-T can hit hard enough to take out a healthy Heatran in one hit, even with Shuca Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is a fairly flexible Pokemon because it does not require specific support. Speed control is important, as Heatran sits at a middling Speed tier. Mega Salamence and Mew can use Tailwind, and Mew in particular threatens Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Gastrodon threaten common checks to Heatran such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Tyranitar. Also, Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Lurantis threaten Ground-types like Landorus-T and Water-types like Tapu Fini that beat Heatran. Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain, which halves damage taken from Earthquake.</p> "

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Suitable for a sword and shield, Aegislash operates as a fantastic pivot into powerful offensive threats like Kartana, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Lele, safely taking minimal damage and threatening a big hit in return. Thanks to its ability, Stance Change, Aegislash functionally has amazing all-around stats with base 150 offenses and defenses. Sadly, this comes with a few drawbacks. To change formes, Aegislash must use King's Shield, which is superior to Protect in that it also sharply lowers an offending foe's Attack, but inferior due to failing to block status moves like Taunt and Spore. Aegislash also must play carefully to avoid taking hits in its Blade forme, which is too frail to benefit from Aegislash's great defensive typing and thus forces Aegislash to use King's Shield more often than other Pokemon might need to use Protect. Aegislash's low Speed works in its favor here, making it more common for Aegislash to take hits in Shield forme, but this low Speed can also inhibit its ability to be a true offensive powerhouse. Aegislash's largest obstacle lies in one of the most common threats in Doubles, Incineroar, which safely takes hits from Aegislash and threatens significant damage, providing many teams with an easy answer to Aegislash. Still, Aegislash's solid movepool and role compression provide it a niche in the metagame. With a decent degree of versatility in its moves and item choices, Aegislash can adapt to fit many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wide Guard allows Aegislash to stay in Shield forme while it supports its team and helps weaken the impact of its weakness to common spread moves such as Thousand Arrows and Heat Wave. This support is particularly appreciated by Dragon-types like Zygarde for blocking Pixilate Hyper Voice and Icy Wind, as well as by Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona for blocking Diamond Storm and Rock Slide.</p> <p>Aegislash has a variety of alternative item choices to be aware of. A Spooky Plate boosts Shadow Ball's damage output, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Mega Metagross and the 2HKO on Zygarde. Ghostium Z provides Aegislash access to Never-Ending Nightmare, which benefits from Ghost's great neutral coverage. Steelium Z's Corkscrew Crash offers an OHKO on Tapu Bulu and all Kyurem-B. Wiki Berry offers healing like Leftovers and can offer a bit of a safety net for letting Aegislash get worn down too early, but it's not very consistent. Outside of additional items, Aegislash has the option to run Shadow Sneak, letting it pick off weakened or otherwise susceptible foes with a Spooky Plate-boosted priority attack and circumvent its low Speed. Hidden Power Ice catches various common threats off-guard, supporting teammates that benefit from weakening Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence. Finally, Head Smash offers a surprise strong hit on would-be switch-ins like Incineroar and Misty Seed Zapdos, and when used in conjunction with Rockium Z, it can OHKO both of them. However, Aegislash often has trouble making room on its moveset for these more niche options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Volcanion and Mega Charizard Y resist Flash Cannon and can roast Aegislash with super effective STAB moves. With three popular Steel-types in the Doubles metagame being 4x weak to Fire-type moves, some Pokemon like Zapdos and Kommo-o also carry Fire-type coverage moves that Aegislash should watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types scoff at Aegislash's Shadow Ball and are typically specially bulky enough to take a Flash Cannon. Incineroar and Scrafty can even potentially underspeed Aegislash to attack it in its much frailer Blade forme.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Though they might not resist Aegislash's attacks, if Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Zygarde are left free to attack it, Aegislash is in danger. Mega Camerupt is especially dangerous due to its ability to OHKO Aegislash, even in Shield forme. Additionally, Gastrodon will attack Aegislash after it has changed into its Blade forme.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore: Any move that inhibits Aegislash's ability to control which forme it is in makes its job a lot harder, so Taunt users such as Tapu Koko and Encore users such as Politoed must be played around carefully.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon provide great neutral coverage, with Incineroar being the only notable target that resists both and many common threats, including Mega Metagross, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele, taking super effective damage. Alternatively, Toxic can be used in place of Flash Cannon to wear down foes while stalling them out and provide its team an answer to slow setup Pokemon like Mega Latias or extremely bulky foes like Porygon2. Substitute takes advantage of Aegislash's sizable bulk and ability to force switches. It also solves the major shortcomings that come with a reliance on King's Shield; specifically, when behind a Substitute, Aegislash doesn't have to worry about many status moves that pass through King's Shield, and remaining in Blade forme to attack again becomes much safer. King's Shield is required to shift Aegislash into its Shield forme, both protecting it for that turn and improving its ability to take a hit until it next attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aegislash's EV spread is left simple, helping it take hits and counter with a strong attack. 44 Speed EVs are used to ensure that Aegislash moves before an uninvested Gothitelle, knocking it out before Gothitelle can use one of its many supporting moves. Minimizing Speed is also an option, giving Aegislash the best chance to take hits in its bulkier Shield forme. Leftovers provides passive recovery to make up for HP lost by placing a Substitute and keeps Aegislash healthy enough to tank hits. With Tailwind support, Aegislash can instead use a Modest nature and 168 Speed EVs to outrun Tapu Koko and other base 130 Speed Pokemon in Tailwind.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aegislash operates best early- and mid-game as a pivot that takes hits, forces a switch, and deals respectable damage to a foe on its way in. However, if Aegislash is your primary check to a threatening Pokemon like Deoxys-A, make sure you keep it healthy enough to keep that threat in check. Watch out for slow attackers like Gastrodon, as Aegislash is unlikely to survive a super effective or strong neutral hit in Blade forme. King's Shield helps with protection there, so use it to restore Aegislash's bulk while keeping in mind that it won't protect from status moves. Use Substitute when the opponent can't break it or on a predicted switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aegislash easily fits onto a variety of teams, so it doesn't need much support to function well. That said, its best teammates tend to be those that match up against Fire-, Dark-, and Ground-types that are offensive checks to Aegislash, making Kyurem-B, Tapu Bulu, and Diancie solid partners. Tapu Bulu also provides more recovery and notably supports SubToxic sets that are attempting to stall out the enemy. Aegislash's ability to act as a pivot into Steel-types helps out allies like Nihilego, Mega Salamence, and Kyurem-B.</p> "

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<p>Undoubtedly the most punk rock of all Pokemon, Tapu Koko's loud and intense effects on the Doubles OU metagame cannot be ignored: its high Speed stat, Electric typing, and immense power through Electric Surge make it one of the most potent offensive threats around, dropping wicked Thunderbolts onto anything that doesn't resist them. On top of its power boost, Electric Terrain also has great utility, providing a blanket sleep immunity for everything grounded. Tapu Koko's Electric typing additionally makes it one of the premier offensive answers to common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Mega Salamence and Tapu Fini. Conversely, Tapu Koko's unique movepool allows it to fulfill a more supportive role on certain teams, aiding its teammates with attacks like Electroweb and Defog. Unfortunately, Tapu Koko is heavily reliant on Electric Terrain and its item for damage output, as a base 95 Special Attack is pitifully low for an offensive Pokemon. Additionally, its most reliable Fairy-type STAB attack is Dazzling Gleam, which is even weaker when factoring in spread-reduced damage. Tapu Koko's offensive set is also incredibly frail, often taking half HP or even more from resisted moves and simply fainting to strong neutral hits. Nonetheless, Tapu Koko is a great addition to offensively oriented teams that need a fast attacker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Teams that run both Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini can use a unique set of Nature Power, Volt Switch, Hidden Power Ice, and Protect. Nature Power transforms into Thunderbolt in Electric Terrain and Moonblast in Misty Terrain, thus giving Tapu Koko a strong STAB option in both Terrains. Keep in mind, however, that it can be disabled by Taunt. If you're using Nature Power, Normalium Z can help Tapu Koko OHKO Tapu Fini with Gigavolt Havoc and Zygarde with Twinkle Tackle, depending on the active Terrain. On rain teams, Tapu Koko can use Thunder instead of Thunderbolt thanks to its boosted accuracy. With multiple Electric-immune teammates, Discharge offers decent spread damage, particularly on Choice Specs sets. Tapu Koko has a decent attack stat and can opt for Wild Charge as its Electric-type STAB move, hitting Calm Mind Tapu Fini much harder. U-turn offers a different form of pivoting that can still have an effect against threats like Zeraora and Zygarde.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Amoonguss can easily switch into Tapu Koko and essentially wall it completely. Tapu Bulu overrides Electric Terrain, whereas Ferrothorn and Amoonguss can threaten Tapu Koko with Gyro Ball and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon: While most Ground-types take massive damage from Hidden Power Ice, if they outspeed Tapu Koko, they'll usually OHKO it with their STAB attacks, such as Mega Swampert in rain and Dragon Dance Zygarde.</p> <p><strong>Icy Wind and Trick Room: Tapu Koko relies heavily on its high Speed; going last is dangerous for it because of its frailty. Beware of Hoopa-U, which can both set Trick Room and tear Tapu Koko apart with Hyperspace Hole should Tapu Koko dare to Taunt it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Very bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar laugh off everything Tapu Koko can throw at them except for Nature's Madness. Assault Vest Landorus-T can bait Tapu Koko into attacking, tank a hit, and do massive damage in return, and Hoopa-U can shrug off most hits and can either threaten Tapu Koko with Hyperspace Hole or set up Trick Room.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt is powerful and difficult to switch into with Electric Terrain; this is the move you're probably using the most. Dazzling Gleam, while much weaker, gives Tapu Koko a relatively strong spread STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Hoopa-U hard while decently damaging Zygarde. Hidden Power Ice allows Tapu Koko to hit Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence much harder than Dazzling Gleam. Volt Switch gives Tapu Koko a strong move that can be used to scout switches or get another Pokemon in easily. Alternatively, Taunt stops the foe from setting up, including stat boosting moves and speed control like Tailwind or Trick Room. Protect lets Tapu Koko block powerful attacks headed its way and do all the other wonderful things Protect does, such as stall out field conditions, but you should use it wisely, as it uses up a turn of Electric Terrain.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature make use of Tapu Koko's blistering Speed and ensure that it outruns the most Pokemon it can while being able to Speed tie opposing Tapu Koko. Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Life Orb boost Tapu Koko's otherwise mediocre Special Attack stat and make it hit as hard as possible. Alternatively, Electrium Z allows Tapu Koko to use a strong Gigavolt Havoc, picking up a notable OHKO on Mega Metagross. Choice Specs provides another possibility for boosting Tapu Koko's power, with access to Volt Switch easing the troubles of being locked into a move. Teams with enough assurance against Mega Salamence and Naganadel might benefit more from Modest Tapu Koko; aside from those two threats, Tapu Koko doesn't lose any of its ability to outspeed other prevalent threats and the added power can be very useful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most of the time Tapu Koko will be using Thunderbolt. Typically, switch out if Electric Terrain is gone, as Tapu Koko is somewhat weak without it. Use Protect when Tapu Koko is immediately threatened, thus letting Tapu Koko's partner soften up whatever is on the other side to put it into Thunderbolt's KO range. Moves other than Thunderbolt are typically more situational. Dazzling Gleam is a good move to use when Tapu Koko or its partner can possibly pick up two KOs or when you're staring down a Kommo-o or Scrafty. Hidden Power Ice snipes down Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, but shouldn't be used much otherwise. Thunderbolt will almost always do more damage to each target unless it's resisted. If Thunderbolt is resisted and Dazzling Gleam is super effective, such as against Kyurem-B, or Dazzling Gleam is 4x effective, such as against Scrafty, Dazzling Gleam will do more, but otherwise it is better to just use Thunderbolt.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>While Tapu Koko requires some team support, it's a strong standalone Pokemon that fits on many teams. Pokemon with Ice-type coverage are good partners, as they can hit every Electric-resistant or Ground-type Pokemon hard, with Kyurem-B and Genesect being notable options. Kyurem-B also benefits from Electric Terrain's boost, allowing it to beat Celesteela with Fusion Bolt. Tapu Koko's ability to beat bulky Water-types and Flying-types enables the Pokemon they normally wall to use their moves freely, such as Zygarde, Mega Charizard Y, and Kingdra.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Naturally high speed and access to Volt Switch make Tapu Koko an excellent pivot. When in an unfavorable position, it can easily score some chip damage on an opposing Pokemon while rotating into a Pokemon that can more effectively deal with the situation at hand. Nature's Madness provides a means of consistent damage output, covering for this set's lack of offensive investment and powerful attacks. Electroweb provides Tapu Koko with a way to give itself and its teammates speed initiative as well as knock out severely weakened Pokemon. Sky Drop can be used in lieu of Electroweb to disrupt opposing teams and give Tapu Koko's partner a chance to set up at a lesser risk. Taunt lets Tapu Koko shut down opposing status moves, preventing foes from utilizing speed control options like Trick Room and Tailwind or boosting their stats with attacks like Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. The combination of Taunt and Nature's Madness also makes Tapu Koko a very good check to Pokemon like Chansey and Cresselia, which rely on their bulk and recovery moves to be effective. Defog should be chosen when Tapu Koko is used alongside Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, which will be severely hindered by taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Speed EVs and Timid nature allow Tapu Koko to outspeed Mega Salamence, one of the fastest threats in the Doubles OU tier. Thanks to its investment in HP and Defense, Tapu Koko will survive a Stomping Tantrum from Mega Metagross after Stealth Rock or a -1 Kyurem-B's Subzero Slammer. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense, letting Tapu Koko survive a Psychic from Modest Tapu Lele in Psychic Terrain. Wiki Berry is used for recovery, but Assault Vest is another option if a status move like Taunt or Defog is not required. When Assault Vest is the item of choice, an EV spread of 252 HP / 24 Def / 56 SpD / 176 Spe should be used to guarantee survival of sun-boosted Overheat from Mega Charizard Y and Subzero Slammer from -1 Kyurem-B while maintaining the same Speed. The fourth move on Assault Vest Tapu Koko could be the previously unchosen Sky Drop or Electroweb, Thunderbolt for slightly better damage output overall, or Hidden Power Fire to OHKO Kartana.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Starting off a battle with Tapu Koko as a lead can be advantageous, since it can easily pivot into a better matchup and the Speed stats of opposing Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T can be checked by following the order of ability activation. Scoring some early damage with Nature's Madness can also be very helpful, as chipping targets down to 50% immediately can leave them crippled for the remainder of the battle. If Tapu Koko is used in conjuction with a Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona that desperately requires Stealth Rock to be cleared, Tapu Koko should be preserved until it can enter the field against two Pokemon that either are slower than it or cannot knock it out so it can guarantee a Defog. Electroweb can be spammed when Tapu Koko is in a relatively safe position for some chip damage and, more importantly, speed control. If Tapu Koko is in a position where it can claim a knockout on a severely weakened Pokemon, it is often more advantageous to take the knockout with Electroweb instead of Volt Switch so you get more out of that turn by lowering the Speed of the knocked-out Pokemon's partner. Nature's Madness combines incredibly well with strong attacks from Tapu Koko's partner, often resulting in knockouts. Generally, it is advisable to position yourself in such a way that you can use Nature's Madness and the aforementioned strong attack on the same turn such that your opponent cannot switch or Protect the weakened Pokemon to prevent a knockout on the next turn. If Sky Drop is chosen, the most efficient use of the pickup turn of Sky Drop is either setting up with a partner or switching in a Pokemon with a favorable matchup against the picked up Pokemon. This way, the Pokemon that was picked up cannot use Protect on the following turn before being dropped, and Tapu Koko's partner can secure an all-but-guaranteed knockout. Tapu Koko still isn't the bulkiest of Pokemon in general, so you must be sure not to be careless when using Tapu Koko as a damage sponge. If you lose Tapu Koko before it was able to perform an essential function, such as clearing Stealth Rock for its partners, you may find yourself at a stark disadvantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Tapu Koko is best used on teams that already have ample firepower; since Tapu Koko generally fits the role of a strong, fast attacker, the bulky set requires teammates that can maintain offensive pressure. Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona greatly appreciate the support provided by Tapu Koko because their 4x weaknesses to Stealth Rock all but necessitate entry hazard removal. Additionally, their strong Heat Waves can take advantage of Nature's Madness's ability to prime opposing Pokemon for knockouts. Life Orb Kyurem-B also synergizes well with Tapu Koko thanks to its fantastic BoltBeam + Ground coverage. Ice Beam handles the Ground-types that threaten Tapu Koko, while Electric Terrain and Nature's Madness both combine very well with Kyurem-B's powerful attacks. When Sky Drop is chosen, Pokemon with stat-boosting moves like Calm Mind and Swords Dance are fantastic partners. Common Swords Dance users include Tapu Bulu and Mega Scizor, which both additionally appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to outspeed and significantly damage Mega Charizard Y, while the most effective Calm Mind users are Tapu Fini and Cresselia. Cresselia deserves special mention thanks to Tapu Koko's Electric Surge ability, which allows Cresselia to consume its commonly chosen Electric Seed item and boost its Defense. Choice Band Zygarde makes for an interesting partner, since it benefits from the support provided by Nature's Madness and Electroweb while also being able to smack foes that have been picked up by Sky Drop with Thousand Arrows. Sky Drop also has a unique interaction with Trick Room—if Tapu Koko picks up a Pokemon slower than it while its partner uses Trick Room, its partner can use Trick Room again the following turn as Tapu Koko drops the opposing Pokemon to effectively remove it from battle for two turns. This technique is best used to stall out certain field conditions like rain or force opposing Pokemon to take more residual damage from sources like Toxic and Sand.</p> "

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Lele is one of the most versatile and devastating offensive forces in the Doubles OU metagame. This can mostly be owed to its ability, Psychic Surge, as it both provides invaluable support by blocking priority moves such as Fake Out for grounded teammates and provides a power boost to Psychic-type moves used by grounded Pokemon, heightening the power of Tapu Lele's Psychic-type blows to astronomical levels. With high natural offensive potential, STAB coverage that's walled only by Steel, just-enough Speed, workable bulk if invested into, and access to Taunt, Tapu Lele is highly customizable and can fulfill a bevy of roles, from a fast attacker that can crumble foes to a bulky pivot that can also keep threats in check with its respectable power. In particular, Tapu Lele is a very effective user of Taunt, as it can reliably stop any setup without fear of Fake Out thanks to the aforementioned Psychic Surge.</p> <p>Still, Tapu Lele has to watch out for opposing Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Aegislash, Celesteela, and Bronzong, as they can simply shrug off any blow from it and take advantage of its futile presence. In addition, Tapu Lele's bulk is average at best—its Defense paper thin in particular—and its Speed is only middling, leaving non-Choice Scarf sets prone to being beat down by faster threats in the metagame such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Metagross, Mega Salamence.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky Tapu Lele set with a Wiki Berry and Taunt can provide more lasting Psychic Terrain support and offer utility alongside its still powerful attacks. Fightinium Z with Focus Blast is useful for getting around certain Steel-types such as Ferrothorn as well as quickly mauling Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Kyurem-B with a Fighting-type move that is both strong and accurate. With a Pixie Plate, Tapu Lele's Moonblast gains the ability to OHKO Zygarde and non-Assault Vest Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Metagross, Aegislash, Assault Vest Genesect, and Ferrothorn can tank Tapu Lele's STAB moves and simply hit back for huge damage. Bronzong can also take a hit and set up on Tapu Lele with Z-Trick Room, ignoring Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Aegislash resists both of Tapu Lele's STAB types and can easily hit back with either of its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Victini</strong>: Victini resists both of Tapu Lele's STAB attacks and can easily shred it with V-create.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Lele dislikes facing faster Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Salamence, and Choice Scarf Genesect, as they can hit Tapu Lele for significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Terrain Control: Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko can change the active Terrain upon switching in, softening the blows of Tapu Lele's Psychic-type attacks. Still, this is no full counter, as hits coming from Tapu Lele's hefty Special Attack are still going to sting.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Tailwind from the likes of Zapdos and Mew and Trick Room from threats such as Bronzong and Diancie can annoy to no end, but note that Taunt variants can stop these threats bar Bronzong from setting up.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Tapu Lele's strongest and most spammable STAB move, capable of reliably nabbing KOs and keeping threats at bay. Moonblast provides Tapu Lele with additional coverage for Dragon- and Dark-type targets such as Mega Salamence, Zygarde, and Hoopa-U, and it is stronger than Psychic when Psychic Terrain is inactive, making it more useful in some cases such as when a different island guardian is expected to come in later on in a match. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Lele a decent spread option that is useful for late-game cleaning or attempts to spread some chip damage to the opposing team. The last moveslot is flexible, with Nature's Madness being a solid choice to prime Tapu Fini's partner for knockouts when none of its other attacks would suffice and Hidden Power Fire providing Tapu Lele with an option to reliably chunk Ferrothorn and knock out Kartana. Shadow Ball is also usable here, as it offers the most damage on Mega Metagross and hits other Tapu Lele harder than any other move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature is used to maximize Tapu Lele's offensive potential with a Choice Scarf, notably allowing it to get the jump on Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Psychic Surge lets Tapu Lele set Psychic Terrain upon coming in, powering up its Psychic-type attacks immensely.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This particular Tapu Lele set works well on teams that need a Speed controller, as it is very capable of pressuring a majority of the offensive threats in the metagame. With its ability to outrun the entire unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele should be utilized in a way wherein it can apply as much pressure as it can. With destructive power in its Psychic-type attacks and the Speed boost from the Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele is adept at picking off faster, frailer foes with even just little chip damage beforehand. Its high Speed also lends it the ability to be useful as a revenge killer and cleaner; in particular, once any Pokemon that resist or are immune to Psychic-type attacks are removed, Tapu Lele can simply mop up opposing teams with Psychic.</p> <p>Using Tapu Lele as a lead can be a good way to seize initiative and apply pressure from the get-go, utilizing its ability to threaten a good portion of the metagame with the power of its STAB moves alone. However, watch out, as Psychic Surge can activate first over normally faster abilities, such as Salamence's Intimidate and Tapu Koko's Electric Surge, removing any surprise factor and revealing key information the opponent can take advantage of. Similarly, leading with Tapu Lele against other island guardians can be quite problematic, as they override Psychic Surge, taking away much of Tapu Lele's power and forfeiting initiative early on. In addition, Tapu Lele isn't easily capable of switching in later on to regain control of Terrain against Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu. On that note, using the Psychic Terrain that comes with Psychic Surge to support teammates is recommended; blocking Fake Out and Extreme Speed for partners to safely attack can be key, and boosting the power of teammate Psychic-types can prove to be very devastating for foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The team Tapu Lele is on should be prepared for handling opposing Trick Room due to Tapu Lele working poorly in it; sturdy defensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Zapdos can hold out long enough for it to expire, Taunt users can stop it from getting set up entirely, and threats that can apply immense pressure to setters such as Hoopa-U and Groundium Z Zygarde can work for dealing with it. Checks to Mega Metagross are a must, as it walls Tapu Lele and takes advantage of Psychic Terrain; pressuring it with Choice Scarf Landorus-T is an option, though a more reliable route is packing a Steel-type that can deal with it such as Aegislash or Heatran. Generally, partners that can break through Steel-types are recommended; Fire-types, such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran, and Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Zygarde, work well in this regard. Pairing Tapu Lele with other Psychic-types such as Hoopa-U, Mega Metagross, and Deoxys-A for destructive offense can also prove to be very effective.</p> "

      {
        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic and Psyshock are simply powerful STAB moves and are largely interchangeable; however, Psyshock is generally preferred over Psychic, as the ability to break through foes running Calm Mind, Misty Seed, or Psychic Seed such as Zapdos is much more valuable than Psychic's 10 more Base Power, especially considering that the power of Psyshock is high enough regardless. The exception to this rule is when making use of Psychium Z, as you always want to opt for the strongest possible Shattered Psyche. Moonblast provides Tapu Lele with a strong way to hit Dark-types such as Hoopa-U and Tyranitar as well as a way to utterly demolish Dragon-types such as Zygarde and Kyurem-B. Moonblast also works as as a stronger attack in cases when Psychic Terrain is not on the field. Taunt is useful for stopping any setup from foes that can take a blow. Ally Switch can potentially allow Tapu Lele's partner a free turn if it catches the opponent off guard while providing a way for Tapu Lele to boost its Speed by 2 stages with Z-Ally Switch. Protect allows Tapu Lele to defend itself, stalling out field conditions and allowing it to safely pass a turn as a teammate acts or switches in.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A fairly straightforward spread of maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is used in order to let Tapu Lele outrun and threaten as much as it can, getting a Speed tie with Kyurem-B and opposing Tapu Lele in addition to getting the jump on non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Life Orb is simply used to make Tapu Lele's blows much more harder to stomach, though at the cost of recoil, while Psychium Z can be used if the ability to put out one large burst of damage is desired. Psychic Surge allows Tapu Lele to set Psychic Terrain by switching in, boosting its Psychic-type blows.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Tapu Lele particularly excels at devastating foes, even those that resist its attacks, with its powerful Psychic-type attacks and should be used as a way of punching holes in the opponent's team. Tapu Lele is especially useful early on in a game, as its power enables it to break down even resistant threats, limiting their defensive capabilities later on in the game and allowing Tapu Lele's teammates to have an easier time pressuring the opposing team. As the endgame draws closer, Tapu Lele can become a lethal finisher by claiming KOs with little chip damage beforehand, though its middling Speed can prove to be a bit of a concern.</p> <p>On a related note, using speed control, Tailwind in particular, in conjunction with Tapu Lele is especially recommended, as this lets Tapu Lele apply maximum pressure, taking advantage of the newfound ability to outrun most foes to raze an opposing team. In cases where Tapu Lele is against a setup user that it can't immediately KO, it is a good idea to use Taunt on it to prevent any momentum loss. One should also look out for situations where Psychic Terrain can prove useful not only for Tapu Lele but also for its teammates; with its ability to block priority attacks on grounded teammates, one can make Fake Out a non-factor, for example, making Tapu Lele a good lead against leads that use the support move. One can also boost the power of STAB Psychic-type moves from teammates such as Deoxys-A and Mega Metagross to much higher levels, amping up the pressure they can apply considerably. Still, one should exert caution when it comes to switching Tapu Lele in; with its frailty and with Life Orb taking its toll, Tapu Lele should only be switched only at times when it's truly needed, such as when Psychic Terrain is required or when the situation is particularly safe like when coming in on a predicted weak blow or when a teammate gets KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As this Tapu Lele variant is geared towards breaking the opposing team, answers to Steel-types, the best switch-ins to Tapu Lele, are recommended. Fire- and Ground-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Zygarde work best in this regard. Tapu Lele also appreciates pivots that it can fall back onto when it gets threatened; switch-ins for Mega Metagross are very important in particular, as well as answers to strong attackers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard Y, and Tapu Koko. A variety of Pokemon can serve as an answer to some but not all of them, with Psychic Seed Zapdos decent at checking them barring Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar dependable at taking them on except Mega Metagross, among others. Seeing as Tapu Lele fits well on offensive teams, upping the ante with another Psychic-type Pokemon is recommended, as they can also take advantage of the Psychic Terrain; Deoxys-A becomes a nightmare to take on, as its Psycho Boost become pretty much untankable, Mega Metagross is capable of checking numerous threats, as it also threatens hefty damage with Zen Headbutt, and Hoopa-U gains a boost to its already powerful Psychic-type STAB attack that can't be defended against. Speed control support is very effective with Tapu Lele, as it lets it become a much bigger threat; Tailwind setters such as Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Mega Salamence fit the bill for this one.</p> "

  "Tapu Bulu": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Bulu's niche in Doubles is strongly rooted in the Terrain it summons. A Grassy Terrain-boosted Wood Hammer off base 130 Attack makes Tapu Bulu an incredibly strong attacker that dents any foe that doesn't resist Grass. Since Wood Hammer is the only real requirement for Tapu Bulu to be successful, it enjoys some flexibility in sets to use, allowing it to somewhat pick its counters and role and adapt to the team it's on. In addition, Tapu Bulu offers its team passive recovery and a solid matchup against all other Guardian Deities, which are found on most every team. Unfortunately, Intimidate users are also found on most every team, and one of the most common, Incineroar, both resists Grass and can KO Tapu Bulu. Though it is decently bulky, Tapu Bulu's defensive prowess is undercut by a poor defensive typing and the recoil it's forced to incur by its primary attack. Its middling Speed tier is somewhat remedied by a Choice Scarf set, but this in conjunction with its lacking defensive qualities can leave it susceptible to stronger fast attackers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set with coverage moves like Stone Edge or Nature's Madness circumvents some of Tapu Bulu's speed issues and enable it to score surprise KOs against foes like Mega Charizard Y or Tapu Koko. However, locking into a single move is often exploitable, so be careful once you have revealed your Choice Scarf. Such a set should use a simple EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and Jolly nature to ensure it outspeeds Mega Manectric and hits as hard as possible. An Assault Vest set uses a more defensive approach to taking advantage of Tapu Bulu's many viable attacks, also allowing it the freedom to switch moves. Meadow Plate and Life Orb offer boosted damage output, though they're rarely more useful than the boost from Grassium Z. Whirlwind is usable as the third move on Figy Berry sets, as it phazes the opposing Pokemon and checks setup sweepers like Kommo-o while preventing Trick Room from setters such as Bronzong.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types: Amoonguss easily deals with Tapu Bulu and only really has the rare Zen Headbutt to fear. Some foes also run Poison-type coverage specifically for taking on Tapu Bulu, making such sets on Volcanion, Landorus-T, and Hoopa-U into decent answers.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types resist Wood Hammer, and many common ones like Mega Metagross and Genesect are neutral to Superpower, enabling them to simply attack with their Steel-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Tapu Bulu struggles to stand against Fire-type STAB attacks from Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Volcarona, all of which also resist both Wood Hammer and Superpower. Fire-type coverage from foes such as Mega Manectric and Kommo-o can be similarly troubling, though they're less reliable as defensive answers.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Zapdos, Tornadus, and Mega Salamence all take Wood Hammer fairly comfortably and can either heal off the damage or hit Tapu Bulu hard with Flying-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Offensive Kyurem-B sets with Icium Z or Life Orb easily dispatch of Tapu Bulu's bulky sets, while bulkier Assault Vest sets take on Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu quite reliably and slow it down with Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate from foes such as Incineroar, Landorus-T, and Mega Manectric makes it much harder for physical attackers such as Tapu Bulu to power through and attack effectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wood Hammer is superbly powerful with the Grassy Terrain boost, OHKOing all Grass-weak targets as well as some frailer neutral foes. Superpower offers Tapu Bulu coverage on some of the more common Grass-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem-B. Alternatively, Horn Leech offers a secondary Grass move that makes up for its lower Base Power through healing, making it a valuable option when the power of Wood Hammer isn't needed or Tapu Bulu is low on health. Swords Dance helps counteract the many Intimidate users in Doubles, easing Tapu Bulu's job of breaking through the opposition or cleaning up late-game. If Taunt support would be more useful to its teammates, Tapu Bulu can instead use the move to prevent some slower Pokemon like Amoonguss, Tapu Fini, and Trick Room setters like Gothitelle from using their status moves. Protect scouts the opponent's move, shielding Tapu Bulu while you work the positioning game to garner momentum. For Tapu Bulu, it's an especially nice move to have, as it can be used to stall for Grassy Terrain recovery and get Tapu Bulu out of range of a potential knockout.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs and nature ensure Tapu Bulu will OHKO Kingdra with Grassy Terrain-boosted Wood Hammer, outspeed Tapu Fini, and be as specially defensive as possible to counteract its lower base Special Defense stat. Many other Speed benchmarks are viable on Tapu Bulu—minimum investment works best on Trick Room builds, teams with Tailwind may opt to run 136 Speed EVs to outpace Deoxys-A, and teams with a tough Volcanion matchup may instead choose 216 Speed EVs to outrun Modest Volcanion. Grassium Z provides Tapu Bulu a nuke in Bloom Doom, which circumvents the issue in a different way by boosting Wood Hammer's power and removing its recoil effect. Alternatively, a Figy Berry gives Tapu Bulu a boost of life when its health gets low, which fixes some of the issues in relying on a recoil-heavy attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu's bulk and summoned Terrain make it an effective pivot on weak or resisted attacks, especially as Tapu Bulu is almost guaranteed 1/16 recovery after it takes the hit. Once switched in, Tapu Bulu can threaten many foes with a strong Grass-type attack, so take advantage of its power by breaking through important Pokemon on the other side of the field. If Tapu Bulu's Attack is lowered due to Intimidate, Superpower, or a removal of its Terrain, don't be afraid to switch it out, as it will often be considerably more useful later without these reductions. For Figy Berry sets, Wood Hammer recoil can act as a method of recovery, knocking Tapu Bulu into activation range if it's already damaged. Grassium Z sets must be careful to use Bloom Doom at the right time. This could mean ensuring Tapu Bulu knocks out a threat or preventing it from taking recoil that would prevent it from acting as a check to certain threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu benefits greatly from reliable users of speed control; this could mean Tailwind users like Zapdos and Suicune or Trick Room setters like Diancie and Stakataka, but whichever you pick should be able to set speed control multiple times over the course of the match. Fire-types, such as Incineroar and Volcanion, are important teammates for taking on Grass- and Bug-types like Amoonguss and Genesect that easily defeat Tapu Bulu; they also benefit from Grassy Terrain's weakening of Earthquake. Volcanion is particularly notable for also taking on opposing Fire-types, a role that could also be filled by Zygarde or Mega Camerupt. Life Orb Kyurem-B and Incineroar are naturally bulky Pokemon that can't take full advantage of their bulk due to their attacks causing recoil, so Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain recovery helps them perform throughout the match. Though it shares weaknesses with Tapu Bulu, Kartana becomes incredibly powerful under Grassy Terrain and may be a viable teammate.</p> "

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini leverages its great defensive typing and stats to secure a place at the forefront of the Doubles metagame. Though Tapu Fini is the only Island Guardian whose summoned Terrain doesn't boost the power of its attacks, its ability to block status and weaken Dragon-type attacks on grounded targets is still quite useful. With a solid movepool that contains useful attacks and utility moves alike, Tapu Fini has every tool it would need to thrive, save for a recovery move. As a result, Tapu Fini can end up being worn down somewhat easily. Tapu Fini is also a bit weak unless it's accrued a Calm Mind boost or two, but its STAB attacks are super effective on large metagame threats like Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Incineroar, so Tapu Fini fits onto most teams quite easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini has a fairly wide movepool with varyingly viable options. Ice Beam might seem like an odd pick when its STAB combination already hits the most common targets, Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence, super effectively; however, it does considerably more damage without needing a boost and also hits Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini might seem a bit out of place, but when used in conjunction with Soak and a strong Electric- or Grass-type like Tapu Koko or Kartana, it can be quite valuable. Soak also has the benefit of removing the STAB bonus from foes' attacks, making them weaker. Assault Vest is another slightly strange item choice, but it fits well with Tapu Fini's access to Icy Wind and decent moves to pair it with such as its STAB attacks, Nature's Madness, Hidden Power Fire, and Knock Off; the result is a highly specially defensive Tapu Fini set with utility in speed control, Knock Off, Nature's Madness, and some decent coverage. A Choice Specs set provides considerably more damage output with Tapu Fini's decent coverage through its STAB attacks and Ice Beam, but Tapu Fini still struggles to hit neutral targets hard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: In addition to resisting Muddy Water, many common Grass-types also resist Moonblast, and all can hit Tapu Fini hard in return. Amoonguss, though its Spore is blocked by Misty Terrain, can be especially frustrating to handle, with Clear Smog even removing Tapu Fini's Calm Mind boosts. Tapu Bulu can use Tapu Fini to heal up with Horn Leech and typically runs sets with enough special bulk to take even a boosted Moonblast. Ferrothorn also resists Moonblast and hits physically, avoiding any potential Calm Mind boosts attempting to shield Tapu Fini from damage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Fini is weak to STAB Electric-type attacks, and Z-Moves can KO even from full health. Tapu Koko, Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Electric-type coverage users like Kyurem-B and Mega Metagross are all threatening, though none resist Tapu Fini's STAB combination, and they must fear a boosted Tapu Fini with speed control on its side.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Losing Protect and either Heal Pulse or Calm Mind access can be a big momentum drain, and Tapu Fini can't hit most Taunt users like Tapu Lele and Gothitelle very hard.</p> <p><strong>Redirection: Heal Pulse becomes a liability instead of a tool if redirected. Amoonguss, the most common redirector, also doesn't take much from Tapu Fini's attacks anyway.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nature's Madness offers consistent damage on foes that normally switch in on Tapu Fini for free like Chansey and Amoonguss, chipping enemies in range of a more offensive ally's attack. Moonblast is Tapu Fini's best Fairy-type STAB attack, helping it deal with threats such as Zygarde and Kommo-o offensively. Heal Pulse is Tapu Fini's most commonly valuable support move, either aiding a setup user like Mega Scizor in preparation for a sweep or simply keeping an important teammate healthy. Taunt stops slow setup Pokemon like Cresselia and foes trying to set Trick Room. Protect shields Tapu Fini from damage and allows it to scout the opponent's moves, stall out certain field effects, and retain solid positioning.</p> <p>Icy Wind offers some speed control that also deals decent damage to Landorus-T. Scald is most notable for taking out Mega Camerupt, a threat that few Pokemon in the meta can claim to tank a hit from and return with a KO. Though Misty Terrain blocks its ability to burn foes, levitating enemies are still susceptible. Defog aids Stealth Rock-weak allies like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Each of these three moves could go anywhere in Tapu Fini's moveset, but Nature's Madness should find its way on most all sets. So, Icy Wind would often replace Moonblast or Protect, Scald usually replaces Moonblast, and Defog takes the third moveslot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread allows Tapu Fini to take less than 50% from Mega Metagross's Iron Head. With 132 EVs in Special Attack, Tapu Fini's Moonblast OHKOes an omni-boosted Kommo-o. The remainder of the EVs are dumped in Special Defense. A Wiki Berry provides significant healing to a weakened Tapu Fini, lessening the impact of it failing to learn any recovery moves. Sets with Scald in place of Moonblast can instead use a spread of 252 HP / 32 Def / 80 SpA / 36 SpD with a Calm nature, which retains the defensive benchmark but instead offers enough power to OHKO Mega Camerupt with Scald. If Tapu Fini is using Icy Wind, 16 Speed EVs are all it needs to outrun a -1 Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Fini functions best on bulky offense teams, keeping threatening teammates healthy and providing role compression by checking a variety of threats in one team member. Use Tapu Fini's defensive typing to switch into threatening Pokemon like Kommo-o and Kingdra, pivoting in to either threaten super effective damage or heal up an ally. If you're predicting an incoming status move like Spore or Hypnosis, switch Tapu Fini in to nullify its effect. However, keep in mind that non-grounded Pokemon aren't affected by Misty Terrain and won't be shielded from status effects. Heal Pulse is best used on teammates with setup moves or those that are especially bulky, as frail Pokemon rarely benefit from having a bit more health. Tapu Fini's damage output can be disappointing, so it should generally only attack when the move will hit super effectively. The main exception to this would be to use Icy Wind to pick off one weakened foe and chip the other. Don't use Heal Pulse if the opponent has a redirection user such as Amoonguss or Volcarona on the field, as they can steal the effect and cause your move to be detrimental.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A wide variety of teams can benefit from Tapu Fini's presence due to its generally solid matchups and easily usable support. Teams with bulky setup Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Mega Tyranitar that can take advantage of Heal Pulse support and the prevention of status effects will especially appreciate having this Tapu Fini as a teammate. Dragon-type Pokemon that don't use Dragon-type moves themselves, such as Kyurem-B and Zygarde, benefit from the weakening of opposing Dragon-type moves to keep them healthy. Tapu Fini doesn't need much in return from its team, but a teammate to beat Grass-types is essential, making Mega Scizor, Incineroar, and Heat Wave Zapdos solid picks. Zapdos can also use a Misty Seed set to pair with Tapu Fini and boost its staying power. Tapu Fini also has trouble breaking through opposing bulky Water-types like Volcanion and Suicune, making Zapdos an even better partner. Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona also roast Grass-type foes, and Defog Tapu Fini sets ensure they can enter the field without taking Stealth Rock damage. Landorus-T and Assault Vest Kyurem-B can aid Tapu Fini by threatening Electric-types.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dealing damage to both foes is a valuable asset for setup users in Doubles, so Muddy Water is a crucial part of this set. Potential accuracy drops can also ease setup. Moonblast is Tapu Fini's strongest attack for neutral targets. It also does respectable damage even unboosted, KOing Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage. Calm Mind opens the door for Tapu Fini to either break through or clean the opposing team while also improving its staying power by boosting its already decent Special Defense. With Calm Mind, Tapu Fini also forces the opponent to respond by making itself significantly more threatening. Protect keeps Tapu Fini safe while its teammate takes out a threat or sets a useful field effect. It's an essential move in Doubles for ease of positioning, but it also allows Tapu Fini to stall for Leftovers recovery and improve its ability to take a hit.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Defense investment makes sure Tapu Fini will avoid the 2HKO from Mega Metagross's Iron Head. The remaining investment is used to improve Tapu Fini's ability to do damage. If Tapu Fini's being used on a team with Tailwind support, you may want to move 60 EVs from Special Attack to Speed so that it outruns Pheromosa under Tailwind. With Leftovers, Tapu Fini can lower its Defense investment to 72 EVs with a Modest nature and still retain the defensive benchmarks. However, Wiki Berry tends to provide considerably more recovery than the slow drip of HP from Leftovers, giving Tapu Fini a second chance to act as a switch-in.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set functions best on bulkier teams that need Tapu Fini's positive matchups but can't afford the passivity of support sets. There are two main times Tapu Fini can benefit from using Calm Mind: to put pressure on early-game or clean up late-game. If Tapu Fini provides your best chance to finish off your opponent's team in the end, avoid letting it take unnecessary damage early on, since this set has limited recovery. However, this set otherwise operates similarly to more support-focused sets. That is, Tapu Fini acts as a solid defensive pivot against some popular attackers like Incineroar and Zygarde while also using its Misty Terrain to block incoming status moves like Hypnosis and Spore.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types are Tapu Fini's biggest obstacles for cleaning, so it needs a teammate to take on Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Tapu Bulu. Incineroar takes these on and also provides Fake Out support to ease setup. Other options for this role include Kyurem-B and Heat Wave Zapdos, which also provides speed control and offers Tapu Fini a way to break through bulky Water-types. Intimidate support helps Tapu Fini cushion the attacks that won't become weaker after it uses Calm Mind, and the common Intimidate users also offer valuable additional roles. In addition to the aforementioned Incineroar, Landorus-T beats Electric-types, Mega Salamence defeats Grass-types, and Mega Manectric can help against both Grass-types and bulky Water-types.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia finds success in the Doubles metagame thanks to its absurd bulk and a powerful, slow setup set with a Terrain Seed and Calm Mind, which sweeps unprepared teams with how difficult it is to take down. In addition, it also has access to various utility options to aid teammates, allowing for some flexibility. Its only real shortcoming lies in its offensive presence, with a somewhat poor attacking movepool and mediocre Special Attack stat. As a result, the Calm Mind set is nigh useless in taking down fairly common threats that wall it like Mega Metagross and Incineroar and has generally unimpressive damage output without multiple boosts. Utility sets are also left reliant on allies to retain momentum. Still, Cresselia's bulk often forces opponents to spend multiple turns trying to take it down, giving its partners a ​bit more time to do their job.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Kee Berry acts similarly to Electric Seed for the Calm Mind set on teams without Tapu Koko, but its lack of instant activation can be unideal. Some utility sets sometimes prefer Sitrus Berry to Wiki Berry; with Sitrus Berry, attacks that deal just over half damage no longer 2HKO, and opponents can't just chip Cresselia until it's just above Wiki range to prepare for the knockout. Sunny Day can disrupt rain teams and boost an ally's Fire-type attacks, but Cresselia rarely finds room for the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Most Dark-types in the tier, including Tyranitar, Incineroar, and Hoopa-U, can significantly damage Cresselia and also benefit from an immunity to Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types resist the most common attacking moves found on Cresselia's sets, and some like Genesect and Aegislash can also be offensively threatening.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Cresselia often relies on setup or utility moves, so Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Gothitelle can be disruptive to its success.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic wears Cresselia down steadily and greatly hampers the Calm Mind set's ability to sweep, so it should be wary of common users like Chansey and Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Phazers: With single-use items, a boosted Calm Mind Cresselia loses much of its ability to succeed if it is forced out by Whirlwind Zapdos, Roar Suicune, or other phazers.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psyshock offers this set a way to take advantage of Calm Mind boosts and is chosen over Psychic for its ability to take on Chansey, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and Seed Zapdos. Icy Wind can deal decent damage to Ice-weak targets, especially when boosted, but it's primarily used for speed control; allies become more likely to move first, and Cresselia gets to recover with Moonlight more safely. Calm Mind offers defensive utility while also making Cresselia offensively threatening. Moonlight keeps Cresselia healthy and is especially useful in sun thanks to its boosted healing.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Electric Seed gives Cresselia a one-time Defense boost under Electric Terrain. With the given spread, Cresselia gains the ability to outrun Tornadus and Mega Metagross after hitting them with Icy Wind, which also 2HKOes uninvested Mega Salamence after Cresselia has used Calm Mind once. Defensively, Cresselia is guaranteed to take maximum Attack Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer in Grassy Terrain, even if it scores a critical hit, and the remaining 52 EVs are put in Special Defe​nse.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>There are a few key checks that can stop Cresselia in its tracks, primarily Toxic users like Chansey, phazers like Whirlwind Zapdos, and Taunt Pokemon like Tapu Koko, which can also carry Nature's Madness. Be sure to scout foes' movesets before setting up with Cresselia, as it often has trouble setting up a second time due to the loss of its Seed boost and starting from a weakened or statused state. On that note, avoid sending Cresselia in when its Seed will activate unless you're planning to leave it on the field for the long haul. This includes the opponent potentially setting the associated Terrain as well, so be vigilant. If Cresselia isn't able to act as a wincon, Icy Wind can still be useful to its teammates, so don't necessarily throw it out just because its setup fails. With the amount of pressure opponents often have to exert to take Cresselia down, make sure you keep it healthy enough to withstand double targeting.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y stands out as one of the best teammates for Calm Mind Cresselia thanks to its ability to check Steel-types, which resist both of Cresselia's attacks, and its summoned sun offering a boost to the efficacy of Moonlight. Other offensive answers to Steel-types like Volcanion, Incineroar, and Zygarde can also be useful. Cresselia needs an Electric Terrain setter for its Electric Seed, so it looks to Tapu Koko for this. Tapu Koko also offers Taunt to prevent opposing Whirl​wind, Taunt, and Toxic,​ making it especially valuable. Incineroar and Tyranitar are two of the most common threats that both wall Cresselia and threaten it offensively, so bringing checks to them such as Landorus-T and Scrafty is incredibly important. Wallbreakers with a middling Speed tier like Kyurem-B and Fightinium Z Kartana benefit from Icy Wind support and open up teams to being cleaned by a boosted Cresselia. Using either Fake Out support from Zeraora or redirection from Amoonguss or Volcarona can ease setup, but Cresselia rarely needs it, so it's just a nice thing to have—not a priority for the team Cresselia finds itself on. Avoid adding too many passive teammates; Cresselia can't do much damage while it's setting up, and it will require the rest of its team to keep up the offensive pressure.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>A variety of popular threats like Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence are extremely susceptible to Ice-type attacks, so Ice Beam acts as Cresselia's primary attack. Trick Room provides support for slower teammates. Psychic is beneficial for teams that need Cresselia to have a way of damaging Ice-resistant threats like Volcanion and Kyurem-B. Helping Hand provides Cresselia with a way to increase its team's offensive pressure, as it rarely exerts much on its own. Toxic chips away at supremely bu​lky foes, making it useful against both setup​ users like Mega Latias and support Pokemon like Porygon2. Ally Switch offers another form of support by allowing Cresselia to take a frailer teammate's place, with its great bulk, immunity to Ground, and resistance to Psychic and Fighting often coming in handy for taking these incoming attacks. Icy Wind provides an alternate method of speed control and can be used instead of or in conjunction with Trick Room to be flexible in its ability to ensure its teammates' ability to move first. None of these moves are strictly required for Cresselia to function well; some form of speed control and some sort of attack are strongly advised, but depending on its team, Cresselia could thrive with any combination of the moves listed here.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 164 Defense EVs are used to ensure that Cresselia will take standard Tapu Bulu's Bloom Doom, even after incurring Stealth Rock damage. With 64 Special Defense EVs and a Sassy nature, Cresselia is also guaranteed to survive the combination of Kingdra's Muddy Water and Hydro Vortex from Hydro Pump when rain is set. A Wiki Berry offers burst recovery and is especially nice for such a bulky Pokemon that is rarely taken out by attacks above its activation range. A Speed-reducing nature is used for maximum efficacy in Trick Room, and you can also minimize Cresselia's Speed IVs if you want to lower its Speed further. However, on semi-Trick Room teams, Cresselia usually prefers retaining some Speed for those times that Trick Room isn't set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set has limited offensive potential, so Cresselia should only attack in specific situations, such as against a foe that's hit super effectively or that an ally needs Cresselia to weaken or finish off. For the most part, stick to using Trick Room and then make a teammate more threatening with Helping Hand. However, Cresselia's bulk allows it to set Trick Room multiple times during the match, and the limited number of turns available often makes switching Cresselia out a stronger play. Ally Switch, if carried, should be used primarily to protect a teammate rather than Cresselia itself; Cresselia can't do much with the additional safety that turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar, with or without its associated Mega Stone, is a great teammate, as it thrives under Trick Room and takes on some of Cresselia's greatest obstacles like Incineroar and Zapdos. It can even use coverage like Low Kick or Flamethrower to take on opposing Tyranitar or Genesect, respectively. Fire-types appreciate Cresselia's solid matchup against Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence, and they generally take on the Steel-types that often wall Cresselia, such as Mega Metagross. Volcanion is particularly notable, as it also takes on Incineroar well. Other slow Pokemon that benefit from Trick Room support like Tapu Bulu and Mega Camerupt are also strong picks, especially as they offer significant damage output to make up for Cresselia's difficulty in taking foes down on its own.</p> "

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur succeeds primarily thanks to its positive matchups against many very common Pokemon, including Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, Kartana, Diancie, and Zapdos. With its bulk, typing, and ability, it's difficult for many teams to break, and a naturally decent Special Attack stat means that it can still hit hard enough in most scenarios. In addition, Venusaur can tweak its moveset to fit its teammates' needs, but its inability to run all of its solid options leaves it lacking in at least one area that it could otherwise excel in. Moreover, a middling Speed tier means Venusaur often needs to take hits before attacking, so it risks being taken out if it doesn't focus on remaining healthy. Speed control and Chlorophyll help ease this a bit, but neither is permanent and the latter is only available before Mega Evolution.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venusaur's main set has a decent amount of versatility already, so only a few niche other options are worth considering. Sleep Powder can give teammates free turns, but it mandates Tapu Lele as a partner, since the other three Island Guardians either prevent sleep or share too many checks with Mega Venusaur. Growth makes Venusaur a scarier offensive threat, but it's only really worth considering when used in conjunction with Torkoal to double its effect thanks to the sun. Knock Off improves the team's matchup against Chansey and Porygon2 while also acting as a decent catch-all move against predicted switches; however, it's difficult to fit onto Venusaur's moveset or find many situations where it's worth using over Venusaur's other options. Hidden Power Ice hits Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence, three threats that could otherwise take Venusaur's attacks fairly well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Without Hidden Power Fire, Mega Venusaur is absolutely walled by Steel-types. Mega Metagross can even carry Zen Headbutt to deal serious damage to it, and Mega Scizor can use non-Hidden Power Fire Venusaur as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types like Tapu Lele and Mega Latias hit Mega Venusaur super effectively without having to go through Thick Fat like Ice- or Fire-types would. However, Tapu Lele can't switch in safely out of fear of Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Few Flying-types in the metagame use their Flying-type STAB moves, but those that do like Mega Salamence, Pelipper, and Tornadus are the most dangerous of the bunch for Mega Venusaur to face.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Unlike other Ice-types and Pokemon that use Ice-type moves as coverage, Kyurem-B has Teravolt to circumvent Thick Fat and thus hits Mega Venusaur quite hard with its STAB attacks. In addition, it's naturally bulky enough to take Venusaur's attacks pretty well.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Without Leech Seed recovery, Mega Venusaur finds it difficult to stay healthy enough to check what it's needed to check. This makes Taunt users like Gothitelle and Substitute users like Kommo-o and Aegislash frustrating foes to face.</p> ",

Giga Drain facilitates Venusaur's goal of staying healthy in addition to the obvious merits it provides in matchups against Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types. Hidden Power Fire ensures that Venusaur isn't walled by Steel-types, notably making it the best Kartana answer available. Genesect and Mega Scizor are decent targets too, but most other Steel-types aren't likely to struggle with taking the hit. Leech Seed provides constant recovery, especially in tandem with Protect, and helps with the Pokemon that Mega Venusaur walls but can't do much damage to offensively, such as Zapdos. Protect stalls out field conditions and may give Venusaur a turn to safely chip away at a foe while regaining health thanks to Leech Seed. Synthesis takes a more active role in healing, relieving the pressure to keep Mega Venusaur healthy by other means. Many combinations of the moves discussed here are viable, but the listed grouping is often most effective.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With the given EV spread, Mega Venusaur is guaranteed to take two Heat Waves from Mega Charizard Y. With a Bold nature and the investment in Defense, it will also avoid the 2HKO from Mega Metagross's Iron Head, even after Stealth Rock. The remaining 52 EVs are placed in Speed to ensure its ability to outspeed uninvested Rotom formes and Tapu Fini. Chlorophyll is the preferred base ability in case the opponent brings Mega Charizard Y or Torkoal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur generally fits best on bulky offense builds, as these can offer it the time it needs to succeed and still provide enough damage output to make up for the times it can't deal much damage itself. Try to keep Venusaur healthy so that it can continue to check the threats it's needed for throughout the game. It won't deal a ton of damage to neutral targets, so focus on either hitting foes super effectively or taking advantage of the secondary effects offered by Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain. In sun, it may be better to forgo Mega Evolution to take advantage of the added Speed, provided that Mega Venusaur's added bulk isn't necessary to do its job that turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types, especially Mega Metagross, can prove to be obstacles to Venusaur's success, so it's a good idea to pack answers like Incineroar and Landorus-T. These teammates often also benefit from Mega Venusaur's great matchup against Water-types. Kyurem-B and Mega Salamence are two of Mega Venusaur's worst matchups, so packing checks to these is crucial. Among these, Tapu Fini can provide Heal Pulse support, Diancie offers speed control, and Genesect both beats Tapu Lele and has Flamethrower to free up Venusaur from needing Hidden Power Fire. Setup sweepers like Volcarona and Kommo-o benefit from Leech Seed chipping down foes into KO range as well as Venusaur's ability to take on Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko. Conversely, some opposing setup sweepers like Mega Latias, Substitute Kommo-o, and Volcarona can give Venusaur trouble; strong checks to these such as Tapu Fini and Diancie ensure that Venusaur being setup bait won't ruin the team's chances.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>A high Special Attack combined with the weather-setting ability Drought makes Mega Charizard Y one of the strongest attackers in the tier. Mega Charizard Y also boasts a strong matchup against Metagross, one of the most common Mega Evolutions. With its base 100 Speed, Charizard can outspeed Genesect, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B but still requires speed control to perform most effectively. Offensively, Mega Charizard Y struggles against opposing Fire-, Dragon-, and Water- types, as they can usually switch into Fire-type attacks relatively safely. Defensively, Charizard struggles against common Rock- and Electric-type attacks and is weak to physical attackers due to its less-than-stellar Defense. However, despite its flaws defensively and its middling speed, with sufficient support, Charizard can perform its offensive role excellently.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y can use Hidden Power Ice to deal large amounts of damage to Zygarde, but Overheat's general coverage and power are typically preferred and Overheat takes out most Landorus-T anyway. Flamethrower and Fire Blast are alternatives to Overheat, keeping the strong, single-target option without the sharp Special Attack drop. However, the power drop is noticeable, and both options miss many OHKOs that only Overheat can achieve, such as against offensive Kyurem-B. Mega Charizard Y can use Focus Blast to beat Tyranitar and Incineroar, but its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable, and these foes are usually better left for teammates to deal with.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Zygarde and Kommo-o resist Mega Charizard Y's Fire-type attacks, while the pair mentioned in particular can setup against Charizard. However, Kommo-o must be careful about switching in, as the combination of Heat Wave and Overheat will KO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Incineroar and Volcanion can comfortably take any of Mega Charizard Y's Fire-type attacks. Incineroar especially can come in on Mega Charizard Y to provide Fake Out pressure and can 2HKO it with sun-boosted Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Politoed and Pelipper can completely neutralize Mega Charizard Y upon switching in with Drizzle, as rain both weakens Charizard's Fire-type attacks and makes Water-type attacks against it stronger. Tyranitar can easily switch into Charizard and OHKO or threaten it out with ease.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Deoxys-A, and Nihilego are all able to outspeed Charizard and deal massive damage to or OHKO it. Under rain, Kingdra can outrun and KO Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Despite being usable on teams with Trick Room, Mega Charizard Y needs to be cautious when facing opposing Trick Room, as normally slower Pokemon such as Diancie and Araquanid can move before Charizard and deal massive damage to, if not outright OHKO it. Tailwind works similarly, allowing many Pokemon, such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Volcanion, to outspeed Charizard. Mega Charizard Y generally requires its own speed control to function effectively, which makes opposing speed control especially troubling for it.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Wide Guard: Stealth Rock, despite not being quite as common in doubles as in singles, does see usage in DOU. This move badly hurts Mega Charizard Y's staying power, taking away 50% of its HP on each switch in, with even one time switching into it putting Charizard in range of many attacks, such as Mega Metagross's Ice Punch. Wide Guard stops Charizard from being able to freely spam Heat Wave, the move it will want to be using most turns. Araquanid, a common user, also deals very handily with Mega Charizard Y due to its ability Water Bubble.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Sun Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave is Mega Charizard Y's main attack, being a sun-boosted STAB spread move sure to heavily dent both opposing Pokemon. Solar Beam provides valuable coverage, hitting Water- and Rock-types that resist Heat Wave such as Tapu Fini and Diancie for super effective damage. Overheat allows Mega Charizard Y to deal a large amount of damage to one foe, even OHKOing many Pokemon that do not resist Fire, at the cost of lowering its Special Attack. Rather than Overheat, Charizard can instead use Tailwind, providing a reliable form of speed control to help itself and teammates. Tailwind can also be used over Solar Beam instead, but losing the coverage to hit Pokemon that resist Fire like Tapu Fini and Diancie can hurt Charizard offensively. Lastly, Protect shields Mega Charizard Y from attacks and allows it to stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A simple EV spread with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment maximizes Charizard's offensive capabilities. The remaining EVs are put into either defense stat, but not HP, so Charizard has an odd HP stat and can switch into Stealth Rock twice. A Timid nature allows Mega Charizard Y to move first as often as possible, ensuring it will move before any non-Choice Scarf Genesect, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B. Alternatively, Charizard can use a Modest nature with a bulkier spread of 232 HP / 104 Def / 4 SpA / 60 SpD / 108 Spe. This allows it to take any one attack from -1 Kyurem-B, survive a Thunderbolt from non-Life Orb Tapu Koko, and outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Tapu Koko at -1 Speed. However, the lower Speed makes Charizard even more reliant on speed control to work well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y often makes a good lead due to its ability to put pressure on the opponent right away and force switches. Against rain teams in particular, being able to Mega Evolve and nullify rain once they have led or switched in their Drizzle Pokemon gains vital early momentum. The biggest problem when leading Mega Charizard Y is opposing Incineroar, which is a very popular lead, so Charizard's fellow lead should be able to deal with it. Mega Charizard Y should be safely sent onto the field from free switches or pivot moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch and switch only into weaker and resisted hits, if needed. This helps preserve Charizard's health for surviving a strong attack from the likes of Mega Metagross and KOing it in return. Mega Charizard Y should aim to be out alongside other offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Kommo-o to crank up the offensive pressure on the opponent and force pins or KOs. This lets Charizard weaken foes for its partner to finish off or force defensive plays that can be taken advantage of with moves like Tailwind and Clangorous Soulblaze. In weather wars, it's important to keep Mega Charizard Y alive so it can come in and override the opposing weather. However, be wary that Charizard cannot safely switch into attacks from the likes of Kingdra and Tyranitar. Particularly against rain teams, this type of positional play can be crucial in maintaining momentum and winning the match. If using a teammate with Defog, note that targeting your teammate will not remove Stealth Rock from the opposing side of the field. Otherwise, using Defog to lower the opposing Pokemon's evasion will ensure any of Charizard's attacks will connect with it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is an excellent offensive partner to Mega Charizard Y, being able to effectively deal with the Water- and Dragon-types that resist Charizard's Fire-type attacks. Landorus-T is another superb partner, offering Intimidate to soften physical attacks for Charizard's subpar Defense and helping deal with Incineroar quite well. Charizard's Flying typing also makes it easier for Landorus-T to use physical sets that take advantage of its higher Attack stat. Fake Out users such as Incineroar, Scrafty, and Mew are also great partners for Mega Charizard Y that can allow more defensive plays, such as letting Charizard safely switch in or set Tailwind, and more offensive plays, for example protecting it from threats such as Mega Metagross and Landorus-T so Charizard can safely knock them out. Mega Charizard Y greatly benefits from speed control, so Pokemon with Tailwind such as Kartana and Mew as well as Pokemon with Icy Wind or Electroweb such as Kyurem-B and Porygon2 work extremely well with it. Using a slower, bulkier set, Mega Charizard Y can also function under Trick Room from setters such as Cresselia and Diancie, on teams with multiple forms of speed control. On dedicated Trick Room teams, however, it is outclassed by Mega Camerupt. Zygarde and Kommo-o are two Dragon-types that can each form a sturdy offensive backbone with Mega Charizard Y. Zygarde can hit Fire- and Rock-type foes with its Ground-type STAB attacks, while Charizard can deal with Grass-types in return. For Kommo-o, Mega Charizard Y can threaten Steel- and Fairy-types, especially Mega Metagross, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu, which resist its Dragon-type STAB attacks. This aids Kommo-o’s ability to set up using its Z-Move, and in return Kommo-o can use Close Combat or Flash Cannon to hit Tyranitar or Diancie, both of which Charizard struggles against. Stealth Rock can be a valuable asset to Mega Charizard Y to prevent Fire-types from switching as easily into its attacks. Common users such as Landorus-T and Mew both synergize well with Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, Charizard is especially weak to opposing Stealth Rock, so having Defog on a teammate such as Tapu Fini or Tapu Koko is exceptionally useful when facing it.</p> "

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Ninetales is one of the only reliable Ice-type attackers in the tier, being able to threaten common Pokemon such as Salamence, Landorus-T, and Zygarde. The main reason to use Alolan Ninetales is for Aurora Veil, which is an amazing support move for setup attackers such as Zygarde and Mega Scizor. Hail is also very beneficial for chip damage and breaking Focus Sash from Pokemon like Deoxys-A. However, Alolan Ninetales is very reliant on hail; if hail is gone, Alolan Ninetales becomes useless, as it loses its most reliable attack and the ability to set up Aurora Veil. Unlike weather setters like Tyranitar and Politoed, Alolan Ninetales cannot do anything without its weather. The latter two can at least still do damage and threaten the opposing team or use Icy Wind and support its partner with Helping Hand. Alolan Ninetales is also very weak and will usually not KO the foe unless it hits it super effectively. Despite its good Special Defense, Alolan Ninetales's very poor defensive typing combined with its low HP and Defense stat leaves it unable to switch into very many attacks. Its Speed tier is also very unfortunate, as it is essentially deadweight under Trick Room once Aurora Veil is up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moonblast can be used in one of the last two moveslots to hit Kommo-o and Kyurem-B hard and provide strong, reliable STAB damage outside of Hail. Focus Sash can mitigate Alolan Ninetales's frailty by ensuring that it survives a hit. Disable is a situational support move that has some merit alongside Encore to force the foe to use Struggle or to get rid of key attacks and force a switch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Alolan Ninetales relies heavily on hail. Tyranitar, Pelipper, and Mega Charizard Y can change the weather and essentially turn Alolan Ninetales into a useless Pokemon, thus forcing it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Alolan Ninetales's two STAB attacks are resisted by Steel-types.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blizzard is Alolan Ninetales's best Ice-type STAB attack thanks to its high Base Power and ability to deal spread damage. Freeze-Dry is a more reliable option, as it does not require hail to have 100% accuracy and allows Alolan Ninetales to hit Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and common rain sweepers, such as Kingdra and Mega Swampert, for super effective damage. Aurora Veil is the main reason to use Alolan Ninetales. This move single-handedly makes Alolan Ninetales a viable support Pokemon. Encore is another move that boosts Alolan Ninetales's utility by enabling it to punish foes using Protect to stall out hail or trying to take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's passivity by setting up on it. Protect shields Alolan Ninetales from a potential OHKO and can let its partner deal with the threat. Keep in mind the hail turns when using Protect because you might accidentally help stall it out. Icy Wind can be used in either of the last two slots to give Ninetales a bit of extra utility in the form of Speed control.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure that Alolan Ninetales is as fast as possible. 184 HP and 72 Defense EVs allow Alolan Ninetales to take a Double-Edge from 180 Attack Mega Salamence. Snow Warning is the only ability to use because it allows Alolan Ninetales to use Aurora Veil, makes Blizzard perfectly accurate, and provides nice chip damage. Light Clay is the preferred item to prolong Aurora Veil's effects. For a bit of extra Speed, a Choice Scarf set can be used. This would allow Ninetales to outspeed and OHKO such notable threats as Mega Salamence, both formes of Choice Scarf Landorus, post-Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, and +1 Speed Zygarde. Blizzard, Freeze-Dry, Moonblast, and Aurora Veil should be the moves accompanying a Choice Scarf, while a simple EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and Timid Nature maximize Ninetales' Speed and power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Aurora Veil when Alolan Ninetales's partner is planning to set up. Keep in mind that Aurora Veil only works under hail, so if the foe has a Pokemon that can change the weather, such as Tyranitar or Pelipper, be wary of using it. Alolan Ninetales relies heavily on hail, so if the opponent has a Pokemon that can change the weather, try to get rid of it as soon as possible. Preserve Alolan Ninetales in that situation so it can win the weather war, since it needs hail to function. Keep in mind that due to Alolan Ninetales's Speed, it will almost always set up weather first, so if the opponent has any weather setters, don't lead with Alolan Ninetales, or else its weather will be overridden if the opponent also leads with their weather setter. If switching Alolan Ninetales in, try to switch it into neutral special attacks. Never switch it into a physical attack, unless resisted, since it is pretty frail physically. Be careful of Trick Room, as once it is set up, Alolan Ninetales is useless.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales is great next to setup sweepers thanks to Aurora Veil. Zygarde is a great partner, as it threatens Fire- and Steel-types that threaten Alolan Ninetales. In return, Alolan Ninetales discourages and threatens Salamence and Landorus-T, two common Intimidate users, from switching in, which allows Zygarde to set up more easily. Porygon-Z benefits greatly from the added padding from Aurora Veil, as it is very frail. Porygon-Z can also effectively use Blizzard when paired up with Alolan Ninetales, which is a step up from Ice Beam. The added chip damage from hail is also nice for Porygon-Z to get some KOs that it normally might not get, such as on Tapu Lele. Fire-types, most notably Volcanion, can threaten opposing Steel-types and easily switch into any Fire-type attacks aimed at Alolan Ninetales.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>After a few generations of terrorizing singles tiers, Chansey has established itself as a very competent Pokemon in Doubles OU. Serving a similar role in DOU as it does in OU, Chansey's main job is to absorb damage while providing passive support for its team. This is especially possible in DOU due to the specially oriented nature of the metagame; Chansey thrives on the skewed number of common special attackers in the tier due to its monstrous Special Defense and very weak Defense. Its incredibly wide movepool provides it with a large number of options when it comes to exacting that support, but it also leads to pretty significant four-moveslot syndrome. No matter what move Chansey forgoes, it will leave itself open to being exploited in one way or another. However, in the right hands, Chansey is quite capable of leaving its pink mark on any Doubles OU battle.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Icy Wind can allow Chansey to support its teammates with Speed control, while Ally Switch can throw opponents for a loop and create some wiggle room for Chansey's teammates.  Psywave is an option over Seismic Toss that allows Chansey to damage Ghost-types like Aegislash. However, the vulnerability to more common Dark-type Pokemon and inconsistent damage make Seismic Toss a better choice in most situations. Wish can be used to keep Chansey or its teammates healthy in various ways, getting a special mention thanks to its synergy with Ally Switch. Counter can punish physical attacks sent Chansey's direction, but it depends on Chansey being hit with a physical attack and can be played around once revealed. Finally, Incinerate is a niche option that can remove Berries from opposing Pokemon while significantly damaging one of Chansey's best checks in Kartana.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off: Losing its Eviolite is pretty detrimental for Chansey, since its entire purpose relies on its bulk. The lack of a boost to its defenses means that the amount of damage it takes becomes much more significant, especially from physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attacks</strong>: As mentioned, Chansey's Defense is much lower than its Special Defense. This means that physical attackers like Mega Metagross and Kartana are much more effective at taking Chansey down, and removing such threats should be prioritized.</p> <p><strong>Setup Users: Chansey can tend to be setup bait, especially if it doesn't carry Toxic to punish passive turns. Examples of setup Pokemon that can exploit Chansey include Dragon Dance Zygarde and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, the latter of which also prevents Toxic thanks to Misty Surge. Substitute variants of Kommo-o can also evade Toxic, though its Substitutes are unable to withstand a Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele shut down a majority of Chansey's support options and prevent it from staying healthy with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Scrafty and Kommo-o can deal significant damage to Chansey with their STAB attacks and should be avoided. Additionally, Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Kartana almost always carry Fighting-type coverage moves in the form of Superpower and Sacred Sword, respectively. Both of these Pokemon also have ways to boost their already good Attack via either Swords Dance or a Z-Move and should be handled before trying to win a game with Chansey.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Seismic Toss prevents Chansey from being completely passive, dealing a set 100 damage to any non-Ghost-type Pokemon. While it will take a few turns to knock out an opposing Pokemon with Seismic Toss alone, Chansey can use this move to prime its partner for a KO or finish off something at low HP. Soft-Boiled is the second of two all-but-mandatory moves on Chansey's set, allowing it to remain healthy. Given that a large portion of common attacks in the tier will fail to deal more than 50% to Chansey, this is an invaluable tool that can turn Chansey into a late-game wincon. The final two moveslots are highly variable, and while two moves tend to be the best options in a vacuum, various teams tend to appreciate different types of support. Toxic allows Chansey to put opposing bulky Pokemon on a timer and more effectively close out games on its own, as one Toxic is often enough for Chansey to play a stall endgame. Stealth Rock punishes opponents' switches and adds another dimension Chansey's support capabilites. Heal Pulse turns the focus from Chansey to its partners, making it easier for Chansey's teammates to stay on the field just a bit longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Chansey's EV spread is quite simple and, in conjunction with a Bold nature, aims to maximize Chansey's poor Defense, since its monstrous Special Defense requires no assistance. 248 HP / 8 SpD is used over 252 HP / 4 SpD because this allows Chansey to survive a Shattered Psyche from neutral-natured Deoxys-A in Psychic Terrain should Chansey lose its Eviolite. Speaking of which, Eviolite is the only acceptable item choice on Chansey thanks to the much-needed boost to Chansey's Defense it provides. The ability choice is largely one of personal preference. Natural Cure provides a way for Chansey to cure its harmful status conditions, while Healer does the same for Chansey's teammates. This choice can be largely inconsequential, however, as status moves are relatively uncommon in Doubles OU.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey is most effective when it can stay healthy throughout an entire battle. Since it very rarely carries Protect in its moveset, Chansey can be prone to being double targeted. As such, keeping Chansey healthy at all times lowers the chance that it can be knocked out by a combination of two attacks in one turn. Chansey should avoid Knock Off, since losing its Eviolite makes it much more vulnerable to taking large amounts of damage, especially from physical attacks. Additionally, Chansey needs to be careful about being hit by Z-Moves; these strong, one-time-use attacks are a great way to power through the wall that is Chansey, but they can be played around either by switching or using Soft-Boiled to counteract the damage. If Chansey runs out of support options near the end of a battle, it can act as a checkmate on its own when the opponent's remaining Pokemon cannot deal significant damage to it. When playing with this endgame in mind, you should prioritize eliminating physical attackers before special attackers, as Chansey will have a much easier time closing out games when it only has to rely on its Special Defense.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>One must be careful about letting the team surrounding Chansey become too passive; Chansey is the very definition of passive support, so slow-paced teammates like Amoonguss can provide opponents with too much time to enact their plan. In general, Pokemon with the potential to output large amounts of damage right off the bat, such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele, make great partners. Means to deter setup, such as Taunt and Haze, help Chansey by eliminating one of the best means of muscling through its defenses. When running Toxic, Chansey also appreciates an Island Guardian by its side that can override Misty Terrain; any of Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele will fill this role effectively. Finally, Pokemon with Intimidate like Incineroar and Landorus-T help further bolster Chansey's Defense against opposing physical attacks, allowing it to remain on the field much longer. All things considered, Chansey's vast arsenal of support options lends it to being useful on just about any team.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>With four Pokemon on the field at once, turn order is especially important in Doubles, making speed control users extremely valuable. Zapdos stands out as one of the most reliable setters of Tailwind due to its all-around solid stats, decent offensive matchups, and ability to stay healthy throughout a match. The dominance of the Island Guardians further boosts Zapdos's niche thanks to its excellent synergy with most of them and its effectiveness using a Terrain-activated Seed. However, due to many teams relying on Zapdos for significant role compression throughout the game, Zapdos can't take full advantage of its Special Attack stat and is left to be somewhat passive and walled by certain threats without the right coverage move. In addition, the best items for its main set are one-time use, which isn't ideal for a Pokemon that's needed at the beginning, middle, and end of a match.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>More offensive Zapdos sets typically run Electrium Z to break through bulkier foes like Tapu Fini and Suicune; such sets should run Protect, since they won't have the bulk necessary to get by without it. Volt Switch offers a way for Zapdos to pivot, but this doesn't work particularly well with most of its best items due to their single-turn benefit. Thunder is a decent option for rain teams, sometimes with Electrium Z to not only power it up significantly but also offer an accurate Electric-type attack outside of rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kyurem-B and Kommo-o take little from Zapdos's attacks and can either attack Zapdos or use its passivity as an opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Diancie, Tyranitar, and Stakataka hit Zapdos quite hard with their STAB attacks, though this impact is significantly weakened if Zapdos has used Roost.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Without Hidden Power Ice, Zapdos can lose to certain Landorus-T and Zygarde sets. Mega Swampert and Mega Camerupt take negligible damage from any of Zapdos's moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: In addition to its resistance to Electric-type attacks, Tapu Koko commonly carries Taunt to disable Zapdos's Tailwind and Roost. Zeraora takes this one step further by healing up when Zapdos attacks it with Thunderbolt and weakening a potential coverage move with Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock cuts into Zapdos's health and forces it to use Roost more often to stay healthy while it's on the field and to be healthy after a future return to the field.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control</strong>: A large part of Zapdos's role stems from its ability to make it more likely that its team will move first. Opposing setters of Tailwind and Trick Room make this much harder to achieve.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Zapdos often enters the field with the goal of setting Tailwind, which Taunt prevents. Since it also prevents Roost or Whirlwind, Zapdos can struggle against Taunt users like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is a decently powerful attack that lets Zapdos avoid being a momentum drain, especially in conjunction with its coverage move of choice. Although a spread-reduced Heat Wave from a non-Fire-type like Zapdos isn't particularly strong, it still provides Zapdos with coverage for Kartana, Genesect, and Ferrothorn. If Landorus-T and Zygarde are larger issues for Zapdos's teammates, it can instead run Hidden Power Ice. Either coverage move also gives Zapdos a way to dent Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu and prevent them from switching in for free. Tailwind helps Zapdos's whole team be more threatening in future turns, while Roost ensures Zapdos can fulfill its job later on in the match. Roost also benefits from Tailwind, as the move enables Zapdos to shrug off an otherwise super effective move like Ice Beam. If using a Seed, Zapdos should always carry Roost to stay healthy with its boosted Special Defense. For Wiki Berry sets, Whirlwind phazes boosted setup sweepers like Kommo-o and prevents Trick Room by forcing setters out before they can use the move. Wiki Berry sets may also run Protect, as Zapdos is a common recipient of double targeting due to it often lacking room for the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Wiki Berry offers automatic healing, which is especially nice if activated by Stealth Rock upon entering the field. Such sets do well with the listed spread, which ensures Zapdos's survival of Tapu Koko's Gigavolt Havoc at full HP as well as its ability to take two hits from unboosted Zygarde's Thousand Arrows; one neutral hit and one super effective one after Zapdos is smacked down. After investing enough into Speed to outrun Pelipper and, under Tailwind, all relevant Choice Scarf users, the remaining investment is dumped into Special Attack.</p> <p>Misty Seed and Psychic Seed are alternative item options that work well with ally Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele, respectively, boosting Zapdos's Special Defense to allow it to stay healthy longer between Roost and boosted bulk. If Zapdos opts for one of these items, a spread of 244 HP / 80 Def / 16 SpA / 104 SpD / 64 Spe with a Modest nature should be used to guarantee Mega Metagross's Ice Punch and Mega Charizard Y's Overheat in the sun are unable to take out a boosted Zapdos, even after Stealth Rock. With Static, Zapdos threatens contact attackers with potential paralysis.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Setting Tailwind is often important for Zapdos's teammates, but don't see it as essential; it's often more useful for Zapdos to attack immediately. Wiki Berry sets can pivot much more freely, as Seed sets only get one chance to take advantage of their boosted Special Defense. Still, don't be afraid to switch out a Zapdos whose Seed has activated; this set can be valuable even without the Seed bonus and it shouldn't stay on the field if it's in a passive or otherwise disadvantageous position. Zapdos is generally useful throughout the game, so it should be kept healthy if possible and not used as a simple vessel for Tailwind once in the game. Roost does this and also helps stall out turns against would-be offensive counters like Tyranitar and Kyurem-B, giving Zapdos's teammates time to take out these threats while it stomachs the now-neutrally effective attacks. Avoid pivoting too recklessly with Zapdos if the opponent sets Stealth Rock, as the added damage greatly cuts into Zapdos's longevity. The sole notable exception to this rule would be if Zapdos is weakened to the point that its next switch into Stealth Rock will activate its Wiki Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers with middling Speed stats appreciate​ Zapdos's Tailwind, making Kyurem-B, Genesect, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele all valuable partners. Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini activate Zapdos's Seed if running this; they also offer decent matchups against Kyurem-B and Tyranitar for Zapdos. Other decent options for taking out these threats include Kartana and Mega Metagross. Regardless of its coverage move choice, Zapdos will need teammates that can take on the targets of the move it doesn't pick. Kyurem-B, Tapu Bulu, and Hidden Power Ice Landorus-T pair well with Heat Wave sets by taking on Landorus-T and Zygarde reasonably well. Hidden Power Ice sets should consider Volcanion, Incineroar, and Victini as teammates to cover Ferrothorn and Genesect.</p> "

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is a very unique and versatile Pokemon, as it has access to many valuable moves. This, coupled with a solid Speed tier and good bulk, allows Mew to support its team in a number of ways. However, while its bulk is good, its Psychic typing leaves it walled heavily by Incineroar and Mega Metagross, as well as causing a weakness to U-turn, a prevalent move. It can carry offensive options like Ice Beam as well to help take on certain threats, but it can't provide much offense outside of preparing for specific matchups. It's important to remember that while Mew may not be the best option for filling one specific role, its ability to perform multiple roles in one slot is what makes it useful. On the same token, if the selected moveset isn't particularly helpful in a certain matchup, Mew can be quite the momentum suck.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flamethrower hits Steel-types, most notably Genesect and Mega Scizor, for big damage. Overheat is usable too, as it nets KOs on Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, but has the drawback of not being able to do a lot of damage again without switching out. Trick Room is another option to be used on Mew, providing speed control for slower team compositions. If Trick Room is used, the given Speed EVs should be moved into Defense and the Speed IVs should be set to 0. Helping Hand allows Mew to boost the power of an ally's move, giving it a way to help provide offense in a way it wouldn't normally be able to. Super Fang is a good support option that gives Mew greater offensive presence, which supports Pokemon like Zygarde that appreciate the chip damage. Toxic allows Mew to wear down some of its easier defensive switch-ins, like Gastrodon and Incineroar. However, Toxic shouldn't be used if Tapu Fini is a teammate and is obviously nullified when there is an opposing Tapu Fini with Terrain control. Defog is a niche pick that can be used to remove Stealth Rock if the team has a lot of Pokemon with a Rock-type weakness or a Mega Charizard Y. If Stealth Rock is not an issue for the team, Defog is not necessary. Roar allows Mew to force out enemies that would use its passive nature to set up; it also functions as a way to prevent Trick Room from being set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Pokemon like Genesect and Mega Metagross make fantastic switch-ins to Mew, though they can be covered with a Fire-type move.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Incineroar and Tyranitar are both very good Mew switch-ins, as Mew can do little back to them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Victini and Mega Charizard Y switch into Mew comfortably and hit it hard, though they need to be wary of Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Opposing Tailwind or Trick Room can hinder Mew's ability to provide team support, as a big portion of Mew's utility is providing speed control.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from threats like Tapu Koko really puts a hold on most anything Mew tries to do, as it cannot provide support if it can't use its status moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is a great move in Doubles, as it can stop a foe from moving for a turn, which provides Mew and its partner with the ability to avoid damage from the target for that turn. Ice Beam is Mew's most reliable coverage move, as it covers Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu. Stealth Rock supports the team by punishing the opponent more for switching, especially into Pokemon that would like to switch into Mew, such as Incineroar and Kyurem-B. Tailwind speeds up your side of the field for a time, allowing your team to swing the momentum by outspeeding the opposing Pokemon. U-turn is a solid option that allows Mew to pivot out into a partner, which can be useful because Mew needs to leave the field after its support is given. Transform is a unique option that allows Mew to take the form of any other Pokemon on the field; this can be used to take advantage of both allies and foes that have used setup moves. It's important to remember when picking Mew's four moves that almost none of them are \"mandatory\"—many of the moves suggested on this set can go in any slot, and Mew's set should be tailored to fit the team it is placed on.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs in Speed allow Mew to outspeed all Kommo-o variants. The EVs placed into HP and the two defensive stats allow Mew to survive either a Bloom Doom from Kartana or a Gigavolt Havoc from Tapu Koko in Electric Terrain. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack in order to boost the power of Ice Beam. Wiki Berry provides recovery and is the pinch Berry of choice to confuse opposing Adamant natured Pokemon that might steal the Berry, such as Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mew is a very solid lead, as it can set either Stealth Rock or Tailwind, and even if Mew isn't carrying Fake Out, the opponent has to respect the possibility on Turn 1. It can be vitally important to keep Mew healthy into the late-game if it is the team's primary means of setting speed control. If there are other reliable sources of speed control, Mew can be sacrificed in order to get a more powerful offensive Pokemon on the field. U-turn allows Mew to get off the field in a way that can provide more momentum than a hard switch. U-turn is used often because once speed control has been set and there isn't much more for Mew to do, it needs to be replaced by another teammate that can actually provide offensive pressure. Transform can be useful both offensively and defensively to become a copy of either an ally or a foe that has boosted its stats. It can also be useful to transform into a more offensive threat once Mew's utility is used up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mew is used best when supporting offensive Pokemon like Zygarde and Kartana. Mew is unique in that it can provide speed control, pivoting, and entry hazards all in one slot. This role compression really benefits its teammates by putting them in a better position to defeat opposing Pokemon. Most of Mew's teammates need to be offensive, benefit from the support Mew provides in some way, or both, as Mew provides very little offense, so the rest of the team composition will need to be more offensive. Mew needs teammates that can damage Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Genesect. Incineroar and Volcanion are good Fire-types that fill this role. Mew is walled by the very common Incineroar, so teammates like Landorus-T and Zygarde help Mew a lot with that matchup. Tapu Fini can usually sit in front of Mew and punish its lack of offense with Calm Mind, though it has to be wary of Transform. Checks to Tapu Fini include Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu.</p> "

Azumarill is let down by its poor Speed, however, though this can be an asset with the use of Trick Room. This makes Azumarill rely on Aqua Jet to KO faster Pokemon, which is not reliable because of Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain. While Azumarill does have good bulk that allows it to use Belly Drum in a variety of situations, it typically needs support in the form of redirection or Fake Out in order to create a situation in which it can sweep the opposing team. Azumarill is also able to be worn down by Intimidate and burns, which can quickly reduce its ability to threaten a team. Additionally, sharing a typing with a metagame threat as common as Tapu Fini leads to most teams being naturally prepared for Azumarill, despite its own rarity.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aqua Jet lets a boosted Azumarill pick off specific threats and break opposing teams without the risk of getting outrun. Play Rough is used to hit prevalent Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu as well as hitting Dragon-types such as Kommo-o and Zygarde hard even before a Belly Drum boost. Knock Off is a nice option to allow Azumarill to hit Pokemon that resist Aqua Jet, such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, and those that can possibly survive Aqua Jet, even at +6, such as Celesteela and Aegislash. Belly Drum turns Azumarill into a sweeper powerful enough to OHKO a large portion of the metagame after just one turn. Protect is essential, since it lets Azumarill stall out field effects such as sun, Psychic Terrain, and Tailwind.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry is used to minimize the cost of using Belly Drum, which means Azumarill has more time to sweep after a boost. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature gives Azumarill the most offensive presence, while maximum HP investment and 4 Defense EVs give Azumarill the best overall bulk. A Brave nature can be worthwhile on a Trick Room-oriented team. If there is Tailwind support on Azumarill's team, 160 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Mega Metagross under Tailwind.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Azumarill being an all-or-nothing Pokemon with Belly Drum, it is best saved for late-game when your opponent's Pokemon are sufficiently weakened so it can successfully sweep their team. You don't want to use Azumarill that much beforehand, or it'll be too low on HP to use Belly Drum. You should also only use Belly Drum when the biggest threats to Azumarill are removed, most notably Tapu Lele, whose Psychic Terrain makes Aqua Jet mostly useless. Using Fake Out or redirection gives Azumarill a much easier time setting up by incapacitating one of your opponent's Pokemon, since due to Azumarill's good defensive typing and solid bulk, most Pokemon are unable to do enough damage on their own to stop a Belly Drum if Azumarill has full HP. Protect is very useful to help keep Azumarill free from harm when the threat of Belly Drum forces your opponent to target it. Protect also lets Azumarill safely bait attacks when boosted because its +6 Attack stat makes it almost always the most immediate threat to the opponent, forcing them to attack or double target Azumarill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The island guardians, with the exception of Tapu Lele, make good partners for Azumarill because they can cancel out the Psychic Terrain that stops Azumarill's Aqua Jet. Tapu Koko pairs well because it threatens the Water-types that Azumarill can't break easily, and it appreciates Ground-types being removed by Azumarill. Tapu Bulu also makes for a solid partner for Azumarill by removing troublesome Water-types that would otherwise check Azumarill, while Azumarill can remove Fire-types that threaten Tapu Bulu. Redirectors such as Amoonguss make setting up Belly Drum much easier by making your opponent target the redirector instead of Azumarill. Fake Out users such as Incineroar also make setting up Belly Drum easier, since Fake Out means Azumarill only has to worry about one of the opponent's Pokemon while setting up; this strategy has a shared weakness with Azumarill in Psychic Terrain, however, since Fake Out fails on grounded targets in Psychic Terrain. Pokemon such as Transform Mew and Psych Up Metagross can copy and utilize the +6 Attack boost from Azumarill's Belly Drum. If Azumarill is running Knock Off instead of Play Rough, it's crucial that it is partnered with a Pokemon that can deal with Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu, such as Amoonguss or Heat Wave Zapdos.</p> "

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Weather can be a very oppressive force during battles, and rain is no exception. At its core, Politoed is a support Pokemon whose main method of support conveniently allows it to deal some respectable damage itself. Coveted access to the ability Drizzle allows Politoed to set up rain for its teammates, facilitating sweeps by their hands. When not aiding its partners with one of its many support moves, Politoed can fire off Scalds to chip away at its foes or fish for a burn. While it faces competition from Pelipper in this role, Politoed's superior defensive typing and statistics, as well as its access to a different array of support options, often lead to its inclusion on rain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For a more offensive take on Politoed, Choice Scarf can be used to overwhelm opposing teams with a lot of damage very quickly, especially when paired with a Swift Swim user. A Timid nature and a simple EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe are recommended so Politoed can outspeed standard Tapu Koko and OHKO it with Hydro Pump. For a more offensive option without sacrificing utility, Hydro Pump can replace Scald on the bulky set in order to allow Politoed to guarantee an OHKO on standard bulky Landorus-T at the cost of accuracy and a burn chance. Ice Beam can be used over Icy Wind if the speed control is unnecessary and you want Politoed to act as a more proactive check to Pokemon like Mega Salamence and Zygarde. In order to have a better chance at winning the weather war, a Sassy nature with 0 IVs in Speed could be used to make Politoed slower than standard Tyranitar, meaning that rain will be the prevailing weather if both enter the field on the same turn. This also comes in handy if Politoed carries Perish Song, as being the slowest Pokemon on the field is advantageous when using Perish Song in endgame scenarios. Haze is another support option of which Politoed can make good use, since it is bulky enough to take a hit from some boosted threats like Dragon Dance Zygarde and Calm Mind Tapu Fini and eliminate their boosts. It also synergizes well with Kingdra and Mega Swampert, removing drops from Draco Meteor and Superpower, respectively. Toxic can also be used if Politoed's team struggles with bulky, passive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Chansey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Since Politoed's main job is to set rain, other weather setters can disrupt this goal. While Politoed generally has a good matchup against the other two main weather setters in the tier, Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y, its Scald will not do much damage to either in any weather other than rain. Ensuring that rain is up is more valuable than inflicting small amounts of chip damage in most situations.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu and Kartana both take minimal damage from Politoed's attacks and threaten an OHKO with Wood Hammer and Leaf Blade, respectively. Amoonguss can sit in front of Politoed and most common Swift Swim users and threaten to redirect attacks, put something to sleep with Spore, or deal significant damage with either of its STAB attacks, only having to be wary of catching an untimely Encore from Politoed.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko will OHKO Politoed with Gigavolt Havoc or Thunderbolt as long as the latter is boosted by any item, such as Life Orb or Choice Specs. Zapdos usually won't OHKO Politoed with Thunderbolt but still threatens significant damage while neutralizing the Swift Swim advantage with Tailwind and forcing Politoed's team to fight at a speed disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Kyurem-B, especially Assault Vest sets, will take negligible damage from Politoed and most of its partners. Even Life Orb Kingdra fails to knock out standard Assault Vest Kyurem-B with Draco Meteor unless boosted by Helping Hand. Kyurem-B can then retaliate with Icy Wind to neutralize Swift Swim's Speed boost or Fusion Bolt to threaten Politoed itself.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is an easy choice on Politoed thanks to its respectable damage output in the rain and convenient 30% burn chance. Helping Hand boosts Politoed's partners' attacks to menacing levels, often scoring knockouts that are otherwise impossible. Encore is useful for punishing Pokemon that try to set up or stall out rain turns with Protect in front of Politoed. Icy Wind provides Politoed with a means of speed control, setting its partners up to fire off powerful attacks before facing punishment. Protect allows Politoed to survive a turn without taking damage so it can more effectively support its team at a later time. Perish Song is an interesting option that can lock down endgames when the opponent only has two Pokemon remaining or deter slower-paced setup that requires multiple turns to be effective.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense investment allows Politoed to survive a Fusion Bolt from standard Life Orb Kyurem-B, which is one of the biggest threats to rain teams in general. Additionally, a Calm nature and 8 EVs in Special Defense allow Politoed to survive a Thunderbolt from Timid Tapu Koko in Electric Terrain, provided it is not holding a boosting item. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack, which gives Politoed a substantial chance to OHKO uninvested Landorus-T in the rain. Damp Rock and Eject Button are two ways Politoed can try to maximize the time its allies will have to take advantage of its summoned rain, with the former focusing on extending the duration and the latter placing emphasis on maintaining momentum after bringing in Politoed. Alternatively, a Wiki Berry provides Politoed with some much-needed longevity, which can aid in its ability to set rain multiple times in a match.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Politoed is most effectively used when it can set up rain multiple times throughout a battle. It is therefore recommended that you keep Politoed as healthy as possible. It is likely that, for maximum damage output, Politoed is better off boosting its partner with Helping Hand instead of attacking itself, but Scald can be used to prime partners for KOs or fish for burns whenever Helping Hand is not appropriate. For example, if Politoed's partner is using a rain-boosted Hydro Vortex, Helping Hand can usually boost it to levels that will knock out all but the bulkiest of Pokemon. For Eject Button sets, keep in mind that Politoed is nearly guaranteed to get off a Helping Hand before being forced out by an attack thanks to its increased priority; the same cannot be said of its other moves. Icy Wind is most effectively used when Politoed's partner needs an extra speed boost, most likely due to rain expiring or a lack of Swift Swim. If a slower Pokemon like Porygon2 or Aegislash has used a passive attack like Recover or King's Shield, Encore can punish them by forcing them to spend 3 turns failing to make any progress. Additionally, Encore can punish predicted setup moves from faster Pokemon like Dragon Dance Zygarde and Substitute Kartana, as well as locking opposing Pokemon into Fake Out if they target Politoed's partner. If you choose to employ Perish Song, it is most effectively used when your opponent only has two Pokemon remaining, effectively putting the game on a three-turn timer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Given that Politoed's existence is predicated around setting up rain for its partners, its teammates always include at least one Pokemon with the Swift Swim ability. These Pokemon, like Kingdra, Mega Swampert, and Ludicolo, make use of boosted Speed and boosted Water-type attacks very effectively, often exerting immense offensive pressure when the rain is up. All three of these Pokemon have their pros and cons, but perhaps the most effective partner is Kingdra due to its access to Muddy Water and lack of weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. With boosts from rain, Helping Hand, and a potential Life Orb or Z-Crystal, Kingdra is able to provide both single-target burst damage or heavy multi-target damage. Mega Swampert can also clean up games with rain-boosted Waterfall or Earthquake, but the latter generally requires a partner immune to Ground-type attacks so it doesn't accidentally knock out Politoed in the process. Ludicolo is the weakest attacker of the three, but it does benefit from its access to Fake Out and Grass typing to deal with problematic Water-types like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Electric-type Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos, also partner well with Politoed, since they are generally good offensive checks to Water-types not named Gastrodon and can make use of perfectly accurate Thunder while rain is active. Grass- and Steel-types benefit from the rain thanks to the power of Fire-type moves being weakened, and Grass-types specifically can also deal with opposing Water-types. Kartana is a good example, as it benefits from the traditional rain core throttling Incineroar and can remove threats to rain cores like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon with a well-timed Leaf Blade. Since teams with Politoed tend to stack weaknesses to Electric-types, Pokemon like Kyurem-B that can sponge Electric-type moves and threaten their users are good partners for Politoed as well. There is a lot of flexibility available to Politoed teams as far as Mega Evolutions go, since many different Mega Evolutions benefit from the support Politoed provides. Mega Metagross appreciates Fire-type moves being weakened and sits in a great Speed tier for taking advantage of Icy Wind, while Mega Manectric can soft check opposing Electric-types and make use of an accurate Thunder. Finally, Politoed and its typical teammates tend to struggle with certain Steel-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Pokemon with strong Fighting-type coverage, such as Sacred Sword Kartana, Superpower Mega Swampert, and Superpower Landorus-T, therefore make good partners for Politoed. While it may seem counterintuitive, Fire-type Pokemon with useful secondary typings like Incineroar and Volcanion can also help alleviate this issue. Gothitelle provides invaluable trapping support for sets running Perish Song, making it significantly harder to escape the countdown timer that Politoed starts.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor thrives thanks to a powerful Bullet Punch, which hits the common Fairy-types, Kyurem-B, and Tyranitar super effectively. With Swords Dance and a powerful priority attack, it does quite well blasting through the opposition. Thanks to a great defensive typing and solid defensive stats, opportunities to set up Swords Dance are fairly easy to come by. This also helps Mega Scizor retain its effectiveness in a metagame where Intimidate is quite common. Mega Scizor's moves tend to have pretty low Base Power, but that ends up somewhat working to its advantage thanks to Technician providing these moves with an extra boost. Bug Bite, its other common attack with somewhat low Base Power, also allows Mega Scizor to take advantage of the ubiquity of healing Berries such as Iapapa and Figy. However, Mega Scizor is rather slow; although this is somewhat mitigated by its primary attack having priority, if Psychic Terrain is set or the foe resists Steel-type moves, it's fairly easy to capitalize on Mega Scizor's low Speed. Since Psychic Terrain inhibits Mega Scizor's primary way of circumventing its problematic Speed tier, it rarely works on teams with Tapu Lele. Fire-type Pokemon and attacks are the largest obstacles Mega Scizor has to overcome, as they immediately shut it down. Aside from Fire- and Steel-types shutting Mega Scizor down, it otherwise does quite well against the majority of common Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used instead of Bug Bite for the utility it provides in removing non-Berry items as well as gaining a much stronger hit on Aegislash. Tailwind and U-turn can be used instead of Swords Dance and Bug Bite—this makes Mega Scizor more focused on team support than late-game cleaning.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Scizor has lots of difficulty against Fire-types such as Volcanion, Mega Charizard Y, and Incineroar; it is not only unable to hit most even neutrally but also 4x weak to their STAB attacks. Some foes, such as Kommo-o and Zapdos, will sometimes carry Fire-type coverage moves to help them take on Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor deals little damage to most Steel-types thanks to their resistance to both Steel- and Bug-type moves. Celesteela and Genesect are the most threatening, as they have access to Flamethrower, though Aegislash is also difficult for Mega Scizor to deal with thanks to King's Shield sharply lowering its Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Access to Swords Dance prevents Attack drops from Intimidate being permanent; however, as a physical attacker, Mega Scizor doesn't appreciate having its damage output lowered by foes such as Landorus-T and Scrafty.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch functions as Mega Scizor's primary STAB attack, dealing respectable damage and making up for Mega Scizor's relatively low Speed. With many prominent threats having a Steel-type weakness and the move getting a Technician boost, Mega Scizor is able to get by with a 40-Base Power attack as its main mode of offense. Bug Bite offers a stronger, though non-priority STAB attack and takes advantage of the plethora of healing Berries used in Doubles. Alternatively, Superpower offers Mega Scizor a way to take out Kartana for its allies or, once boosted, KO Incineroar before it's targetted by a Flare Blitz. Swords Dance helps Mega Scizor retain its offensive presence in the face of Intimidate users and clean late-game. Doubles is a metagame built on positioning and keeping control of field effects, so Protect is a useful tool in aiding Mega Scizor's team to do just that. However, on teams with ample pivoting, Fake Out, or Shadow Tag support, Roost may be used instead, ensuring that Scizor can set up without fear of being chipped too low.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Being able to take out Tapu Lele with a priority Bullet Punch as a teammate switches in to change the terrain is one of Mega Scizor's more crucial roles. 136 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to ensure this is accomplished on minimally invested Tapu Lele, also ensuring that +1 Bug Bite OHKOes Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. 84 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Scizor can move before uninvested Tapu Fini, hitting it with Bug Bite to eat a potential Berry before being picked off. After these offensive benchmarks are accounted for, the spread focuses on general bulk, maximizing HP and patching up Mega Scizor's lower Special Defense. Light Metal should be used as Scizor's ability before Mega Evolution, as it makes Scizor a better switch-in to Low Kick, and Scizor should never attack without Mega Evolving to gain Technician anyway.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If Scizor needs to use Bullet Punch, do whatever you can to ensure that Psychic Terrain will not be set when Scizor attacks. If the opponent has a Tapu Lele already on the field, switching to another Island Guardian accomplishes this; switching to another Island Guardian on a predicted Tapu Lele switch can also make sure Scizor's attack will go through provided that the teammate being switched out is slower than the departing foe. If Scizor is low on health, keep in mind that Bug Bite can offer a form of healing when used on foes likely to be carrying an HP-restoring Berry. Mega Scizor is most effective early- or mid-game as a tool to pick off weakened foes, but late-game it shines as a cleaner. Use Swords Dance once all opposing Fire-types have been removed to take advantage of its cleaning ability. Once Scizor is on the field, it should Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as there is no benefit to attacking or defending with Scizor pre-Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Scizor's primary attack is a form of priority, so teammates with the ability to remove Psychic Terrain are an absolute necessity. Tapu Fini, which also provides Heal Pulse support and protects Mega Scizor from confusion after eating a Wiki Berry, and Tapu Koko, which takes on faster threats and Celesteela, are two prime candidates for this role. Fire-types in general are Scizor's biggest enemies, so teammates such as Tapu Fini, Volcanion, Heatran, and bulkier Landorus-T sets are a huge help in removing them. Steel-types, though not as troublesome as Fire-types, also resist Mega Scizor's attacks and thus should be dealt with through teammate support from Pokemon such as Volcanion, Heat Wave Zapdos, and Heatran. Stealth Rock support, though not typically seen as a requirement on Doubles teams, is crucial for a variety of offensive benchmarks. For example, after a Swords Dance boost, having Stealth Rock on the opposing side of the field ensures that Mega Scizor will OHKO Tapu Koko, Mega Tyranitar, and Assault Vest Kyurem-B. Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tyranitar are all decent options for setting Stealth Rock. Allies such as Kyurem-B and Zygarde that appreciate the removal of Fairy-types can benefit from Mega Scizor's presence on a team.</p> "

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra is a powerful rain sweeper that applies immediate offensive pressure to its foes. It outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame when Swift Swim is activated, and its Water-type attacks hit most targets for heavy damage when boosted by rain. Draco Meteor generally allows Kingdra to nuke targets that resist its Water coverage, although strong Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu wall Kingdra completely. One of Kingdra's main drawbacks is the middling accuracy of its STAB attacks Muddy Water, Hydro Pump, and Draco Meteor, which are all prone to missing at inopportune moments. It should also be noted that, outside of its STAB moves, Kingdra's offensive coverage is quite underwhelming due to its middling Special Attack stat. Defensively, Kingdra's Water / Dragon typing leaves it with few weaknesses overall but with a crippling weakness to strong Fairy-types, which are omnipresent in the metagame. Finally, it should be noted that Kingdra relies on its high Speed to maintain a commanding position, and it quickly loses its momentum if the opponent activates an opposing weather or a form of speed control like Tailwind or Trick Room.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Choice Specs, Kingdra deals a significant damage to even bulky or resistant targets; for example, it OHKOes 4 HP / 252 SpD Kartana with Hydro Pump in rain. Rain Dance is an option that allows Kingdra to maintain its rain advantage, especially against opponents planning to switch in an opposing weather setter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini completely wall Kingdra's STAB coverage and threaten back with STAB-boosted Moonblasts or Grassy Terrain-boosted Wood Hammers. Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko also threaten Kingdra with strong Fairy- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, but inside of rain, Kingdra can threaten to outspeed and KO them first with strong Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss are capable of absorbing Kingdra's STAB coverage and hitting back either with strong Grass-type moves or with status moves such as Spore.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Volcanion, Milotic, and Araquanid have enough bulk and the right typing to absorb Kingdra's STAB attacks. Tapu Fini can then hit back with a STAB-boosted Moonblast, while Milotic can simply use Recover to negate the damage. Milotic also gains a sharp Special Attack boost if its accuracy is lowered by Muddy Water. Araquanid can block Kingdra's Muddy Water with Wide Guard for as long as it stays on the field.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Kingdra quickly becomes dead weight outside of rain, since it relies on its Swift Swim Speed boost to maintain its offensive pressure. Therefore, opposing weather setters like Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar can be problematic for Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Tailwind and Trick Room either negate or reverse Kingdra's Swift Swim Speed boost. Prominent Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Bronzong are also generally bulky enough to survive one attack from Kingdra, although a well-timed Hydro Vortex inside of rain is generally able to OHKO them before they set Trick Room. A Zapdos carrying Misty Seed or Psychic Seed is a particularly thorny Tailwind setter for Kingdra to deal with, as it has enough bulk to withstand all of Kingdra's attacks outside of Hydro Vortex. However, Zapdos almost never carries Protect, so Kingdra is pretty safe to use up its Hydro Vortex on an opposing Zapdos.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Muddy Water is a powerful spread STAB move that also has a 30% chance to drop the accuracy of each target it hits. Hydro Pump is a single-target STAB attack that can snipe out targets that are just outside of Muddy Water's KO range. It also bypasses Wide Guard Araquanid to hit its ally. Draco Meteor hits hard against most targets that resist Water-type attacks and destroys opposing Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Mega Salamence, Zygarde. Beware of Misty Terrain, though, as it halves the power of Draco Meteor against grounded targets. Ice Beam is another option that lets Kingdra snipe out opposing Dragon-types without dropping its Special Attack stat or worrying about Misty Terrain. However, running this leaves Kingdra helpless against bulky Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, and Araquanid. Protect keeps Kingdra safe while its partners deal with any possible threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Kingdra's spread isn't complicated. Maximum investments in Special Attack and Speed let it hit as hard and fast as possible under rain. A Modest nature is preferred for maximum power, since the extra Speed granted by a Timid nature isn't generally useful. It is worth noting, however, that a Timid nature on Kingdra is required to outspeed Dragon Dance-boosted Mega Salamence in the rain. Waterium Z grants Kingdra one opportunity to turn Hydro Pump into Hydro Vortex, a move that bypasses Kingdra's otherwise shoddy accuracy and hits all but the bulkiest of targets for heavy damage. Life Orb is an alternative item that can be used for more consistent damage output. Swift Swim doubles Kingdra's Speed when rain is activated.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If the opponent isn't carrying an opposing weather setter, Kingdra and its respective rain setter make for excellent leads that apply immediate offensive pressure, but if they are, consider playing Kingdra more conservatively, opting to take out the opponent's weather setter first if possible. Kingdra quickly becomes dead weight once Swift Swim deactivates, so it is best saved for a point in the match where rain can't be disrupted. If you're able to clear out Kingdra's checks and counters beforehand, it also makes for an excellent late-game cleaner, outspeeding and picking off weakened foes with strong spread damage. When in play, Kingdra's main goal is to spam Muddy Water and consistently chip away at the opponent's team. Hydro Pump can also be used to snipe down targets that are just outside of Muddy Water's KO range. Use Draco Meteor with caution, as Kingdra quickly loses momentum once its Special Attack drops to -2. Also keep in mind that Misty Terrain halves Draco Meteor's power against grounded targets like Zygarde. If using Waterium Z, be mindful that Hydro Vortex is a one-time nuke; avoid using it on a turn where the opponent is likely to Protect or switch into a Water-resistant Pokemon. Finally, Kingdra's bulk is average at best, and Life Orb sets in particular are prone to getting worn down quickly, so avoid pivoting Kingdra in on opposing attacks if you can.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kingdra is a dedicated rain attacker, so it goes without saying that running either Politoed or Pelipper as a rain setter is mandatory. Politoed offers higher overall bulk and has access to Helping Hand, which further amplifies Kingdra's attacks. Pelipper has access to Tailwind, a second form of speed control that reduces Kingdra's dependency on Swift Swim being activated. On hyper offensive teams, Kingdra pairs notably well with Tapu Lele and Psychic Terrain attackers such as Deoxys-A and Mega Metagross. Psychic Terrain blocking priority attacks reinforces Kingdra's commanding Speed tier inside of rain. Deoxys-A and Mega Metagross apply immense offensive pressure to targets that resist Kingdra's STAB moves, such as Tapu Fini and Milotic. Likewise, these Psychic-types appreciate Kingdra's ability to clear out bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash. On more balance-oriented teams, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash make for excellent partners, as they can pivot in on the strong Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks that Kingdra hates. Tapu Koko and Thunder Punch Mega Metagross are great options for beating Tapu Fini and Araquanid, which are prominent checks to rain teams. Kingdra relies on Swift Swim to maintain a commanding position, so partners that can deal with opposing weather setters and speed control techniques are always a good idea. Running Taunt on at least one partner helps to shut down opposing Tailwind and Trick Room users. Opposing speed control can also be countered with your own, so consider running Tailwind users like Zapdos and Pelipper or Icy Wind users such as Politoed.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2's fantastic bulk with Eviolite, access to reliable recovery, and only one weakness make it a solid Trick Room setter. Porygon2 also has an expansive support movepool and useful abilities, which make it flexible an easy to put on teams. Porygon2 is unique because it is not weak to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, which many Trick Room setters are, making it able to set up Trick Room in front of Tyranitar and Aegislash. However, Porygon2 can be very passive without offensive investment and deals insignificant damage against targets that are not weak to its coverage moves. Since Porygon2's bulk is reliant on Eviolite, it is very weak to Knock Off, and an inability to effectively use other items makes it extremely weak to Spore and Taunt. With most sets not running Protect, Porygon2 can be a sitting duck for foes like Tapu Lele.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Foul Play is an offensive option to take on Mega Metagross, also offering decent damage on Aegislash and Genesect. Icy Wind and Electroweb are alternative forms of speed control over Trick Room. With this, Porygon2 frees up a moveslot and gains the ability to function beside teammates with more middling speeds. Sets without Trick Room can use Analytic due to Porygon2's mediocre Speed stat. Ally Switch is an option to force opponents to predict hard and makes Porygon2's presence on the field unignorable. Toxic enables Porygon2 to wear down defensive threats that otherwise wall it such as Assault Vest Kyurem-B and Chansey.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Scrafty and Kommo-o threaten Porygon2, as they deal huge damage to it with their powerful STAB moves. Some Pokemon run strong Fighting-type coverage moves to break through bulky Normal-type Pokemon like Porygon2, so it should be wary of All-out Pummeling Hoopa-U, Kyurem-B, and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Even though Porygon2 can survive powerful attacks such as Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost, the lack of Protect makes Porygon2 vulnerable to double targeting and easily overwhelmed. Porygon2 also struggles against bulky hard hitters that are not weak to its coverage such as Tyranitar and Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Setup Attackers: Bulky setup Pokemon such as Mega Scizor can comfortably take Porygon2's attacks and set up safely in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele make Porygon2 unable to use Trick Room and Recover, leaving it with not much to do.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Porygon2 is very reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, which makes it vulnerable to Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar and Scrafty.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room lets Porygon2 and its teammates take advantage of their low Speed stats. Ice Beam threatens Landorus and Mega Salamence and offers decent coverage in general. Thunderbolt completes BoltBeam coverage alongside Ice Beam and is a reliable option to hit Tapu Fini and Volcanion effectively. Lastly, Recover keeps Porygon2 healthy, which also helps it set Trick Room multiple times and take advantage of opposing Protect that is frequently used to stall out Trick Room turns.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread aims to boost Porygon2's overall bulk by ensuring it takes less than 50% from Kartana's Sacred Sword, leaving it able to heal off the damage afterwards. The Special Attack investment ensures Ice Beam can KO uninvested Mega Salamence regardless of a Download boost. Eviolite gives additional bulk and is an irreplaceable item for Porygon2. A Special Attack boost from Download can be useful to give Porygon2 offensive presence, but Download should only be used if running two special moves. If Porygon2 is running Foul Play, Trace is an option, as it lets Porygon2 copy useful abilities such as the ubiquitous Intimidate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Set Trick Room as soon as possible if it benefits Porygon2's team, especially if the opposing team is weak to Trick Room. However, don't do this if the opponent also brings slower Pokemon like Amoonguss and Stakataka. Use Recover freely to keep Porygon2 healthy, making it harder to KO and letting it set Trick Room multiple times. Hard switching Porygon2 into hard hitters such as Mega Metagross and Life Orb Tapu Koko must be avoided, as it needs its health to reliably set Trick Room. Stay away from Knock Off, since the loss of Eviolite makes Porygon2 unable to tank damage from hard hitters. Against obvious Taunt and Spore users such as Tapu Lele and Amoonguss, it's usually better to switch out or attack rather than set up Trick Room. Porygon2 is generally too weak to use for just throwing out attacks, so it is better to switch out Porygon2 to slow attacker if Trick Room is already up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are slow enough to take advantage of Trick Room such as Stakataka, Mega Camerupt, and Tapu Bulu work well with Porygon2. Fake Out support from Incineroar helps prevent Taunt and Roar users from stopping Porygon2 from setting up. Redirection from Amoonguss eases pressure when setting Trick Room, and Amoonguss pairs especially well with Foul Play variants of Porygon2, appreciating their ability to deal with Mega Metagross, Aegislash, and Hoopa-U and set up Trick Room so it can more effectively spread sleep. In return, Amoonguss can take on Water-types to free Porygon2 from running Thunderbolt. Having an alternative plan to beat fast attackers without relying on Porygon2's Trick Room is mandatory, so carrying secondary Trick Room setters such as Diancie and Necrozma is a good idea for full Trick Room teams, but making your team functional outside Trick Room by adding your own fast attacker such as Tapu Koko also works.</p> "

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is a solid setter of Tailwind, helping strong but somewhat slow teammates wreak havoc with turns of added Speed. Suicune also sets itself a part from other Tailwind setters because of its ability in Inner Focus, which allows it to avoid being flinched by Fake Out, alongside its outstanding bulk and typing, which allow it to set up Tailwind reliably and consistently throughout a match. In addition, Inner Focus with Roar allows it to always phaze Trick Room setters in spite of Fake Out, a common technique certain teams use in an attempt to guarantee Trick Room. Unfortunately, Suicune is somewhat passive, not being able to do much aside from setting up Tailwind. Its passiveness and low Speed also make Suicune a big bait to Taunt users, including the likes of Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko. Finally, Suicune suffers from stiff competition from other Tailwind setters such as Zapdos, Mew, and Kartana.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune's role in the tier is rather limited, so it doesn't have many extra options. Protect is an excellent move in Doubles, but more often than not, the utility of Roar or Snarl is superior. A more offensive set with Hydro Pump and Waterium Z allows Suicune to take out Incineroar instead of simply chipping it away.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: The likes of Tapu Koko, Mega Manectric, and Zapdos can deal a lot of damage to Suicune. Kyurem-B also gets a mention, as its Fusion Bolt is devastatingly strong.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Despite many of them being weak to Ice Beam, most Grass-types, like Tapu Bulu, Lurantis, and Kartana, don't take all that much damage from it and can hit Suicune hard with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users, such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele, can easily shut down Suicune, as it and its teammates are usually very reliant on Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Setup: Even if Suicune is packing Roar, Pokemon with setup moves can take advantage of Suicune's passivity and, at the very least, force Suicune to Roar them out while spreading huge amounts of damage to Suicune's allies. A special mention goes to Soundproof Kommo-o for being immune to both of Suicune’s methods of dissuading setup in Roar and Snarl.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Tailwind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald gives Suicune some offensive presence, having a sizable chance to burn foes like Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor and dealing decent damage to the likes of Incineroar and Stakataka. Ice Beam deals a lot of damage to the likes of Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence while still being its best option against Kommo-o. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Suicune and its allies for three turns, enabling slower but stronger allies to shine. Roar scares away Trick Room setters by threatening to phaze them before they can use Trick Room, further helping allies that benefit from Tailwind. Roar also phazes setup sweepers, especially since they take advantage of Suicune's passiveness. Alternatively, Snarl can replace either Ice Beam or Roar to punish special attackers by reducing their main offensive stat, easing setup a bit for Suicune's allies. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon like Porygon2 and Gothitelle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Alongside Suicune's HP EVs, its Defense and Special Defense investment allows it to avoid the KO from Landorus-T's Tectonic Rage after Stealth Rock or Life Orb Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt. The Speed EVs make it so Suicune outruns Deoxys-A with the help of Tailwind. Finally, the rest of its EVs are added to Special Attack. Inner Focus is the preferred ability to prevent Fake Out from flinching, which is a common strategy used by Trick Room teams, enabling Suicune to phaze Trick Room setters and set Tailwind. Wiki Berry gives Suicune some added longevity, allowing it to set up Tailwind and Roar away Trick Room setters more consistently.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to use Tailwind as soon as possible with Suicune, but be careful of Taunt users. After using Tailwind, it might be smart to switch Suicune out for a more offensive teammate that can make use of it. If one of your opponent's Pokemon can be taken down by Suicune, such as Deoxys-A or a weakened Zygarde, it might be ideal just to stay in and attack, though. If you're facing a potential Trick Room setter, using Roar as they go for Trick Room is highly advised because, commonly, the teams that Suicune fits the best in tend to struggle against Trick Room otherwise. Avoid letting Suicune get worn down, as Tailwind will often help win games or at the very least put on some pressure against the opponent. If at all possible, make sure to consume Suicune's berry, as it further increases Suicune's longevity. For instance, if Suicune is left at just above a quarter of its health and would get knocked out, it might be a good idea to switch it out and bring it in on a resisted move for its Wiki Berry to trigger.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that best fit alongside Suicune are offensive ones that appreciate it setting up Tailwind and preventing Trick Room. The likes of Tapu Bulu and Landorus-T fit exceptionally well alongside Suicune, having great defensive synergy while also appreciating the added Speed from Tailwind. Powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Choice Band Zygarde can become even deadlier when backed up by Suicune's Tailwind. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Dragon Dance Zygarde also appreciate the additional Speed to counteract opposing Tailwind and Suicune’s matchup against Intimidate users bar Mega Manectric, which Zygarde already handles.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar has a great offensive and defensive typing with the stats to back it up. Rock Slide and Crunch together hit most of the tier for consistent damage, and unique resistances and amazing defensive stats enable Tyranitar to check top-tier Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard Y, and Hoopa-U. Tyranitar also matches up well against speed control users such as Zapdos and Mega Salamence. Furthermore, Tyranitar's low Speed can be used to its advantage, as it beats the most common Trick Room user, Hoopa-U, with its defensive typing. Tyranitar also has an incredibly diverse movepool that includes premier coverage moves such as Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Low Kick and can properly utilize them with its good mixed offenses. Tyranitar is also able to effectively use many item options such as Choice Band, Z-Crystals, Tyranitarite, and resistance Berries; this makes it a truly unpredictable threat. Sand Stream gives Tyranitar a lot of utility; it not only gives Tyranitar a 50% boost in Special Defense but also removes opposing weather, deals chip damage, invalidates Focus Sash, and scouts foes' Speed. However, Tyranitar has plenty of weaknesses to common attacking types such as Ground, Water, and especially Fighting, which are carried by common threats such as Landorus-T. Low Speed makes Tyranitar reliant on its bulk and speed control, although Mega Tyranitar is able to patch up its speed by Mega Evolving and setting up a Dragon Dance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is such a flexible Pokemon that you can mix and match items, coverage moves, and EVs to suit your team. Flamethrower allows Tyranitar to hit Kartana, and Ferrothorn significantly harder than with Fighting-type moves. Assault Vest allows Tyranitar to check the majority of special attackers despite the wide distribution of moves that can hit it for super effective damage. As a result, Assault Vest lets Tyranitar check the likes of Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, taking notably less damage in the process. A Rock Polish set with either a Weakness Policy or Z-Crystal equipped takes a different method of solving Tyranitar's poor Speed tier, though such a set struggles to overcome the ubiquity of Intimidate and its inability to make room for a coverage move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Scrafty make short work of Tyranitar with their super effective STAB attacks. While not Fighting-types themselves, Kartana and Deoxys-A commonly carry Sacred Sword and Superpower, respectively, and All-Out Pummeling Tapu Lele also downs Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon can hit Tyranitar with a super effective STAB move. Landorus-T has Intimidate to dampen Tyranitar's attacks, while Zygarde resists Rock Slide. However, they are vulnerable to Ice-type coverage moves from Tyranitar. Gastrodon and Mega Swampert can shrug off Ice-type coverage moves, making them more reliable answers.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Milotic take minimal damage from Tyranitar's attacks bar Continental Crush or Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge. They can wear down Tyranitar with a super effective STAB move or start setting up against it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss take minimal damage from Tyranitar aside from Continental Crush or Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge and threaten Tyranitar with large damage and Spore, respectively. Ferrothorn can also handle Tyranitar, but it needs to be careful of Fighting- and Fire-type coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Genesect and Metagross can outspeed Tyranitar and threaten it with plenty of damage. Celesteela can stomach a few attacks from Tyranitar and has Wide Guard to stop Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: As a physical attacker, all variants of Tyranitar are weakened and threatened out by Intimidate users like Landorus-T and Scrafty. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is especially threatened by Intimidate, since it relies on Dragon Dance to boost its power and speed while Landorus-T and Scrafty can negate the Attack increase and potentially force it out altogether.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Although regular variants of Tyranitar don't always mind moving after their opponent, Dragon Dance sets are more reliant on their speed to maintain momentum, so they are easily pressured by Pokemon that take more than one Dragon Dance boost to outpace. Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Swift Swim Kingdra, and Sand Rush Excadrill all accomplish this and carry STAB attacks that hit Mega Tyranitar for super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Without sand, Tyranitar becomes much easier to handle using special attacks. Pokemon such as Pelipper, Politoed, and Mega Charizard Y have ways to hit Tyranitar for large damage as long as they have the weather control. However, Mega Tyranitar's ability to set sand again as it undergoes Mega Evolution gives it a valuable weapon in the weather war.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Crunch is a reliable STAB move that has great neutral coverage with Tyranitar's Rock move of choice. Stone Edge hits Tapu Fini and Zapdos significantly harder than Rock Slide and allows Tyranitar to use a notably stronger Continental Crush, but Rock Slide's accuracy and spread damage may be preferred for some teams. The increase in Base Power of Continental Crush is so worthwhile that Rockium Z Tyranitar can use both Rock Slide and Stone Edge, forgoing alternative third moves entirely. Low Kick offers a more accurate way to hit Kyurem-B and Incineroar while also hitting Ferrothorn, Stakataka, and opposing Tyranitar far harder than other moves. Ice Beam allows Tyranitar to hit Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, most notably Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence, while ignoring Intimidate. This works best on teams with Trick Room support that allow Tyranitar to use a Brave nature for higher Special Attack, as Tyranitar would otherwise need to sacrifice bulk with a Lonely nature. Stealth Rock offers chip damage to threats that Tyranitar scares off the field like Zapdos, Kyurem-B, and Mega Charizard Y, punishing their pivoting. Finally, Protect helps Tyranitar with positional play. Tyranitar has multiple weaknesses, and the ability to avoid damage from super effective hits while its partner gets a free turn can be very advantageous.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack allows Tyranitar to hit as hard as possible. With 76 EVs in Speed, Tyranitar will outpace uninvested Volcanion as well as Brave Hoopa-U, even if the latter has full Speed IVs. Teams with Tailwind support may prefer to bump this up to 160 EVs to outspeed Tapu Koko under Tailwind. If Ice Beam is chosen, 68 Special Attack EVs with a nature like Brave that does not reduce Special Attack ensures the move will OHKO minimum bulk Landorus-T. Rockium Z allows Tyranitar to use Continental Crush to decimate most targets. Should players opt for the Mega forme of Tyranitar, an EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Atk / 68 SpD / 100 Spe should be used to outspeed Mega Manectric in Tailwind and OHKO all but the most physically bulky of Zapdos. Shuca Berry synergizes well with Ice Beam, further improving its ability to take on Ground-type attackers like Landorus-T and Zygarde. Sand Stream provides Tyranitar a Special Defense boost to take on most special attackers. It also removes opposing weather, deals chip damage, breaks Focus Sash, and scouts foes' Speed.</p> <p>While it may seem like a less-than-optimal use of a Mega stone for this set to be used on Mega Tyranitar, it actually finds a pretty solid niche. If a team does not need the burst damage of a Z move, or already employs a Z crystal on another Pokemon, while also having no other Pokemon capable of Mega Evolution, Mega Tyranitar can easily fit. When running a general offensive set, Mega Tyranitar benefits from all of greater bulk, greater Speed, and greater Attack than its normal forme, making it an easy choice on the appropriate teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar can take advantage of its solid bulk and resistances by acting as a pivot into dangerous Pokemon and threatening them out with its attacks. With Sand Stream, this ability to pivot is two-fold, as Tyranitar offers weather to either counter opposing weather or set its own for a teammate that benefits from sandy conditions. Mega Tyranitar has the added benefit of also using Sand Stream, meaning that it can delay Mega Evolution until the opponent’s weather summoning Pokemon is brought onto the field and block the attempt to control field conditions. Keep Tyranitar healthy if you need it as either a check to a specific threat or for weather management, as it’s generally useful throughout the game. Rockium Z sets only get one chance to use Continental Crush, so be careful to not waste it on a foe using Protect or one likely to switch out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control helps Tyranitar attack first and eliminate targets with Continental Crush before they can retaliate with super effective moves. Zapdos and Mega Salamence can set up Tailwind, while Pokemon such as Hoopa-U and Porygon2 can reliably set up Trick Room. Terrakion and Scrafty, threatening Fighting-types, can be checked by Fairy-types, such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini, or by Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Salamence. Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Milotic prevent Intimidate users such as Landorus-T from switching in. Partners to threaten Water-types, such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Amoonguss, allow Tyranitar more freedom to maneuver. Finally, Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion can threaten opposing Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Metagross.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Crunch and Rock Slide are STAB moves with great neutral coverage. Stone Edge is an alternative Rock-type STAB move; it has a shaky accuracy, but it is Tyranitar's strongest attack, heavily punishes Tapu Fini switch-ins, OHKOes Zapdos, and bypasses Wide Guard. Ice Punch targets Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, most notably Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Zygarde, but being locked into it can be a momentum sink. Low Kick and Superpower are options for hitting Snorlax, opposing Tyranitar, and Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn for extra damage. Superpower lowers Tyranitar's Attack and Defense but hits more Pokemon for high damage than Low Kick. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap and remove frail or weakened Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band allows Tyranitar to hit as hard as possible without incurring Life Orb recoil. The above spread maximizes bulk and damage, but there are multiple ways to tweak it to best suit your team. As speed control is crucial to Choice Band Tyranitar's success, one most important factor to consider is whether you want to use Choice Band Tyranitar with Tailwind or Trick Room support. In Tailwind teams, 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Rash Deoxys-A with Tailwind support, but the loss in bulk is noticeable. It is even possible to simply maximize Speed and Attack with a Jolly nature in order to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Jolly Landorus-T in Tailwind as well as at least Speed tie with opposing Tyranitar. In Trick Room teams, simply maximize HP and Attack. Being Adamant allows Tyranitar to outspeed foes outside of Trick Room, including uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon like Aegislash and Celesteela, while still being slower than the majority of the metagame. Meanwhile, Brave Tyranitar is slower than opposing Trick Room attackers such as Heatran and Hoopa-U, OHKOing them when Trick Room is active before they do any damage to your team. Sand Stream allows Tyranitar the Special Defense boost to take on most special attackers. It also removes opposing weather, deals chip damage, breaks Focus Sash, and scouts foes' Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar can easily switch into attacks using its natural bulk and resistances. Thanks to its power and coverage options, Tyranitar can often surprise Pokemon with an unexpected amount of damage or a coverage move. For instance, it OHKOes Scrafty with Superpower, Landorus-T switch-ins with Ice Punch, and Zapdos with Stone Edge before it can match Tailwind. Such KOs can turn the game drastically. Therefore, good information management and successful predictions are crucial to Tyranitar's success. Choice Band Rock Slide and Crunch are hard to switch into and let Tyranitar break defensive cores more easily without the need to predict with super effective moves. Due to Tyranitar's low Speed and numerous weaknesses, proper speed control and positional play with its partner become imperative for Tyranitar to not be dead weight. The lack of Protect on the set makes it even more important to have proper speed control. Try to bring out Tyranitar with your preferred speed control already active so it does not have to maneuver around opposing super effective moves before attacking. Also, try to have strong partners on the field so when a Pokemon tries to hit Tyranitar with one of its multiple weaknesses, it is threatened by Tyranitar switching out and the partner going for a super effective move in return. Use Tyranitar's Sand Stream to deny opposing weather sweepers' Speed boosts. Tyranitar also can take advantage of opposing Trick Room teams, against which Tyranitar does not need team support to go first and wreak havoc.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control like Tailwind from Zapdos or Mega Salamence helps Tyranitar attack first with Rock Slide without getting pinned by super effective moves or double targets. Pokemon such as Hoopa-U and Porygon2 can reliably set up Trick Room, but be aware that they share weaknesses with Tyranitar. Fairy-types such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini can handle Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Scrafty for Tyranitar. Intimidate support rounds out Tyranitar's terrific bulk, and the common users of Intimidate such as Landorus-T and Salamence also handle Fighting-types for it. Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Milotic prevent Intimidate users such as Landorus-T from easily switching in. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos and Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu can threaten opposing Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Milotic. Finally, Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion can threaten opposing Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Metagross.</p> "

        "name": "Mega Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide and Crunch are Mega Tyranitar's two preferred STAB moves with great neutral coverage. Rock Slide is a reliable spread move to clean up against weakened teams, while Crunch provides a single-target option for more focused damage. Dragon Dance increases Mega Tyranitar's offenses and allows it to outspeed base 130 Pokemon like Tapu Koko after one boost. Protect keeps Mega Tyranitar safe while its partners deal with any possible threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar needs to run 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature to outpace base 130 Pokemon like Tapu Koko after a Dragon Dance boost. The remaining EVs go into Attack to maximize Mega Tyranitar's offensive pressure. This is the optimal spread, as there aren't any relevant defensive benchmarks worth striving for. Sand Stream as a pre-Mega ability gives Mega Tyranitar two chances to set sand.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar is a decent lead, as it can activate Sand Stream to break Focus Sashes and Mega Evolve to increase its bulk to switch in more easily later in the game. When faced against an opposing weather team, it sometimes makes more sense to hold off on Mega Evolving until after an opposing weather setter is predicted to switch in. Early-game, Mega Tyranitar's best use is to soften up foes with unboosted attacks and passive sand damage. It generally isn't a good idea to attempt a Dragon Dance before any foes that can force Mega Tyranitar out have been dealt with. Situationally, it may be appropriate to go for an early-game Dragon Dance to apply pressure to an opponent making passive plays, but ideally Dragon Dance should be reserved as Mega Tyranitar's late-game win condition so it can break down weakened teams after its checks have been cleared out. When attempting to set up Dragon Dance, it's generally a good idea to have either a redirection supporter like Amoonguss or a Fairy-type like Tapu Lele or Tapu Fini on the field to redirect or force out Fighting-type attackers. Mega Tyranitar makes a decent pivot into neutral and resisted attacks thanks to its high bulk, but this should be done sparingly, as it wants to conserve its HP until it can clean up late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection support is nearly mandatory on Mega Tyranitar teams. Pokemon like Amoonguss are able to divert otherwise fatal Fighting-type attacks like Marshadow's Close Combat away from Mega Tyranitar while also freeing up a window of opportunity for Mega Tyranitar to set up Dragon Dance without being Taunted or incurring targeted damage. Pokemon that can deal with Landorus-T are greatly appreciated, as Landorus-T throws off Mega Tyranitar's offensive momentum with Intimidate and forces it out with Earthquake and Superpower. Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, and Genesect are all decent options for checking Landorus-T. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is the optimal Island Guardian to pair with Mega Tyranitar, as it can outspeed and OHKO Marshadow, provided Psychic Terrain is activated to block Shadow Sneak. Psychic Terrain is also useful for blocking Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, which otherwise inflicts severe damage to Mega Tyranitar. Tapu Fini is also a great partner that can help force out Marshadow, threaten out Landorus-T, and offer Heal Pulse support to Mega Tyranitar. Although a more niche option, Tapu Bulu is an option that helps check Water-types like Tapu Fini and Mega Swampert, which Tyranitar otherwise struggles with. Mega Tyranitar also appreciates Grassy Terrain's ability to provide passive recovery and protection against Earthquake. Tailwind setters like Zapdos are able to give Mega Tyranitar enough of a Speed boost to beat down faster foes without the need for a Dragon Dance. Fire-types like Volcanion and Heatran are useful to help fend off offensive Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, which otherwise tank hits from Mega Tyranitar and threaten to hit back with strong Steel-type attacks. Choice Scarf attackers like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Genesect are useful for outspeeding Deoxys-A, which is guaranteed to faint after one attack plus sand damage but otherwise threatens to KO Mega Tyranitar with Superpower.</p> "

Whereas other rain sweepers like Kingdra and Ludicolo offer fast but frail stat spreads that are suitable for highly offensive teams, Mega Swampert has enough bulk and power to function well on bulkier, more balance-oriented teams that still want the speed advantages offered by a Swift Swim user. Unlike other popular rain sweepers, Mega Swampert isn't able to make use of an item to augment its power, but its base Attack stat is significantly higher to compensate. That said, as a physical attacker, Mega Swampert can quickly be shut down by Intimidate users like Mega Salamence and Scrafty. Thanks to Mega Evolution mechanics, Swampert is always guaranteed a Swift Swim Speed boost on the turn it Mega Evolves if a rain setter is switched in on that turn, making it a much more flexible and forgiving lead than other Swift Swim users. However, Mega Swampert also takes up a team's Mega slot, whereas its alternatives do not. Furthermore, while Mega Swampert's movepool offers more well-rounded coverage than Kingdra's and Ludicolo's, it still has a slight case of four move-slot syndrome; it really wants to run Waterfall, Earthquake, Ice Punch, and Superpower on the same set but needs to give up one of those moves for Protect.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is Mega Swampert's most reliable Water-type attack as well as its hardest-hitting STAB attack overall in rain. Earthquake is a secondary STAB move that provides spread coverage, allows Mega Swampert to hit hard against bulky Water-types like Volcanion and Tapu Fini, and works well as an attack for cleaning up against weakened targets late-game. Superpower offers super effective coverage against targets like Kartana, Kyurem-B, and Ferrothorn. Protect keeps Mega Swampert safe while its partners deal with any possible threats. Ice Punch can be used to score OHKOs on Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Zygarde while also providing coverage against Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Mega Swampert to hit as hard and fast as possible. Adamant is generally the preferred nature for maximum power. However, a Jolly nature is necessary for Mega Swampert to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect, Choice Scarf Victini, +1 Speed Volcarona, and Tailwind-boosted Zapdos. The power drop inherent to running Jolly is noticeable, though. Neither of Swampert's pre-Mega abilities have much competitive value, but Damp has a small niche in preventing Explosion, while there is never a good reason to attack before Swampert Mega Evolves to utilize Torrent.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Swampert and its respective rain setter make for excellent leads that apply immediate offensive pressure when the opponent isn't carrying their own weather setter. When faced with weather teams, consider playing Mega Swampert more conservatively, opting to take out the opponent's weather setter first if possible; Mega Swampert becomes dead weight once Swift Swim deactivates. When leading with Mega Swampert, don't feel obligated to lead with the rain setter as well. Swampert is always guaranteed a Swift Swim Speed boost on the turn it Mega Evolves if a rain setter is switched in on that turn, so you can lead with a second offensive option and switch it out for your rain setter if you deem the Swift Swim boost desirable on that turn. While Mega Swampert is often a great lead, it is sometimes better to keep it in the back it as a late-game cleaner if you're able to clear out Mega Swampert's checks and counters beforehand. When in play, Swampert's main goal is to spam Waterfall and Earthquake to break down the opposing team. Thanks to its good bulk and great defensive typing, Mega Swampert isn't really threatened by most attackers under rain, so it can leverage its bulk and power to consistently apply offensive pressure while wearing down opposing targets. Just stay clear of any potential Grass-type attacks! The opponent will be tempted to switch in an Intimidate user like Mega Salamence or Landorus-T to drop Mega Swampert's power, so factor that into your expectations about Swampert's damage output, and try to catch Mega Salamence and Landorus-T with an Ice Punch on their switch in. If using Superpower, keep in mind that it is going to drop Swampert's Attack and Defense, potentially making it dead weight.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A rain setter is a mandatory partner for teams with Mega Swampert. Pelipper has phenomenal synergy with Mega Swampert, allowing Mega Swampert to freely spam Earthquake and KOing Electric-types that threaten Pelipper like Tapu Koko. On the other hand, Politoed can provide Helping Hand support to cancel out potential Intimidate drops. It is really important to bring strong checks to Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Amoonguss, since bulky rain teams with Mega Swampert struggle to check these threats. Pelipper can help check Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss, but consider incorporating additional checks like Ferrothorn and Genesect to beat Tapu Bulu and having Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B to beat Amoonguss. Checks to opposing weather, especially sun, are important. Landorus-T is a solid option for checking both Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar. Tapu Koko is a good check to Mega Charizard Y, and it is also a fast attacker that functions outside of rain. Stealth Rock setters like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T can punish opponents that repeatedly switch in Intimidate users like Mega Salamence, weather setters like Mega Charizard Y, and speed control users like Zapdos and Kyurem-B. Ferrothorn enjoys working with rain teams, as they naturally pressure the Fire-types it hates. In return, Ferrothorn is a decent bulky pivot, checks Tapu Fini (a Pokemon typically used on teams as a rain check), helps check opposing rain teams, and serves as a reliable late-game win condition.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock supports Swampert's team by chipping opposing threats like Zapdos and Kyurem-B. Additionally, opponents often use Protect to stall out turns of rain, giving Swampert the free turn to set them up. Stomping Tantrum can be used over Earthquake to allow Mega Swampert to freely use its Ground-type attack without regard for its ally. However, the loss of spread coverage is noticeable at times. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall for more power at the expense of accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu lowers the damage dealt by Earthquake, easily takes a Waterfall, and OHKOes Swampert with Wood Hammer or Horn Leech. Amoonguss tanks hits from Swampert and potentially hits hard with Giga Drain. Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y and Energy Ball from Genesect are also things to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Suicune can comfortably retaliate with STAB Water-type attacks that are boosted by the same rain that Mega Swampert relies on. Gastrodon even has Storm Drain to prevent Swampert's Waterfall from hitting its intended target.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Intimidate users like Mega Salamence and Landorus-T reduce Swampert's ability to break through an opposing team, but they do risk taking a Waterfall or Ice Punch in retaliation.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Mega Swampert becomes somewhat dead weight outside of rain, since it relies on its Swift Swim Speed boost to maintain its offensive pressure. Therefore, opposing weather setters like Mega Charizard Y and Tyranitar can be problematic.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind, Trick Room, and Icy Wind</strong>: Mega Swampert relies on its high Speed to maintain momentum, so opposing speed control is disruptive. Tailwind setters like Zapdos and Mew negate Mega Swampert's Swift Swim Speed boost, while Trick Room setters like Bronzong and Porygon2 can reverse it. Kyurem-B can wall a non-Superpower Mega Swampert and whittle down its Speed with Icy Wind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a strong rain attacker, firing off powerful Water-type attacks in order to punch holes in the enemy team. It has access to Fake Out, which is a useful move for disrupting opposing strategies, and under rain, Ludicolo is the fastest Fake Out user in the metagame. Immunity to powder moves can be handy, making Ludicolo unaffected by Spore and Rage Powder, which allows it to get around Amoonguss, an annoyance to rain teams. Ludicolo has Grass-type STAB coverage and can deal with traditional rain checks such as Tapu Fini. However, Ludicolo lacks useful resistances, has mediocre bulk, and falls easily to more powerful attacks. Additionally, it is very dependent on rain, thus being limiting towards teambuilding.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Blast can be used to hit Kyurem-B, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, and Fightinium Z can give it a power boost and offset Focus Blast's poor accuracy. An Assault Vest set can be run to give Ludicolo more bulk and help it tank more special hits. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump, but it loses out on a lot of power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Tyranitar is usually bulky enough to take a hit and set up sand, which removes the advantages of rain. Mega Charizard Y can do this as well by setting up sun, weakening Ludicolo's main STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Kyurem-B can all easily tank a hit from Ludicolo and either set up on it or deal a lot of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Pokemon such as Genesect and Victini can carry a Choice Scarf and outspeed Ludicolo in rain and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Opposing Trick Room and Tailwind can allow strong Pokemon to outspeed Ludicolo, preventing it from attacking safely.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump functions as Ludicolo's primary STAB move, dealing significant damage under rain to neutral targets. Energy Ball can hit Pokemon that resist Water-type moves such as Tapu Fini and Suicune. Giga Drain can be used instead for its healing, but usually the power from Energy Ball is more useful. Ice Beam can be used to hit common Pokemon that resist Ludicolo's STAB moves such as Mega Salamence and Amoonguss. Protect allows Ludicolo to stall out field conditions and shield itself from damage. Fake Out is able to prevent an opposing Pokemon from doing anything for a turn, allowing a partner to KO them or use a setup move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Ludicolo's Special Attack EVs are maximized to allow it to hit as hard as possible, and its Speed EVs are also maximized so it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible both in and out of rain, notably outspeeding Choice Scarf Tapu Lele under rain. A Modest nature is used to boost its Special Attack even further, but Timid is also an option to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect and Choice Scarf Victini. Waterium Z gives Ludicolo a powerful and accurate Water-type STAB attack; alternatively, Life Orb offers a more general boost to Ludicolo's power. Swift Swim is used to double Ludicolo's Speed under rain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ludicolo works best under rain thanks to Swift Swim, so avoid sending it out when rain isn't up. It is best used to punch holes in the enemy team early-game. If your opponent doesn't have a weather setter such as Tyranitar or Mega Charizard Y, Ludicolo can be a perfect lead to pressure the opposing team. If they have a weather setter, consider removing it first before sending in Ludicolo. Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's most powerful attack, especially under rain, so use it as often as possible to deal maximum damage. Ludicolo typically works best when it switches in on fairly weak resisted attacks such as Tapu Fini's Muddy Water. It can also work well as a late-game cleaner if you are able to clear its checks and set up rain, so consider saving Ludicolo and a rain setter if you see a chance to use it for this.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo needs a partner to set up rain, so either Pelipper or Politoed is necessary. Ludicolo also benefits from another rain attacker that can help wear down its checks, such as Kingdra or Mega Swampert. Because it relies heavily on rain, running a check for opposing weather setters is always a good idea. Pokemon that set weather such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y are beaten by Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Tapu Koko. Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage, such as Hammer Arm Metagross, can help deal with defensive checks to Ludicolo such as Ferrothorn, Kyurem-B, and Chansey. A check to opposing speed control is useful, such as a Taunt user like Tapu Lele or Tapu Koko for Trick Room and your own Tailwind user such as Pelipper to deal with opposing Tailwind.</p> "

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>Pelipper is one of the premier rain setters in the Doubles OverUsed metagame with its ability Drizzle. However, Pelipper faces stiff competition from the other common rain setter, Politoed. While Politoed is bulkier and has more supportive options, Pelipper is more offensive. Hurricane and Hydro Pump give Pelipper excellent STAB coverage that allows it to keep momentum while also breaking foes, especially Grass-types. Pelipper offers useful additional support with its access to Tailwind, which can benefit Pelipper's offensive partners, and its low Speed gives it the potential to act as a slow pivot into teammates that can take advantage of rain or frailer Pokemon that do not wish to take any more damage than they have to. However, a critical Electric weakness means almost any Electric-type attack will knock Pelipper out. This, combined with less overall bulk, makes it a frailer rain setter than Politoed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash can be used to prevent Pelipper from being OHKOed by strong attacks, particularly Electric-type moves. A bulkier spread can be used; however, it is generally outclassed by Politoed. Rain Dance can be situationally useful for when opposing Pokemon attempt to neutralize Pelipper's weather. Choice Specs can be an option that gives Pelipper an even stronger offensive presence on a rain team. Knock Off can be run as a utility move to remove a foe's item.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pelipper is 4x weak to Electric-type moves, and common foes such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko can dispose of Pelipper with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather: Other weather, such as sand set by Tyranitar and sun from Mega Charizard Y, can cancel out Pelipper's Drizzle and possibly render your rain sweepers near uselessness.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Trick Room can ruin rain teams, which rely on the ability Swift Swim to double teammates' Speed in rain. Without their Speed, they lose their ability to pressure opposing Pokemon and threaten KOs.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini can cause difficulty for rain teams, as they often have difficulty breaking them.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Kyurem-B, particularly the Assault Vest set, easily shrugs off Pelipper's attacks and takes it out with Fusion Bolt.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is a powerful STAB move that will never miss in rain, which can help Pelipper check Grass-type Pokemon that are annoying to rain teams, such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu. Hydro Pump, when boosted by rain, is significantly more powerful than Hurricane, so it is the better option for hitting foes hard in general. Tailwind provides speed control for Pelipper and its allies. Protect can keep Pelipper safe from attacks while an ally attacks or can help stall out Trick Room or opposing Tailwind. Be careful that you are not stalling out your own rain, however. U-turn can help gain momentum, as Pelipper can pivot into a Pokemon that will do the most work depending on the situation. Wide Guard can be used in the last moveslot to protect Pelipper and its allies from moves that would hit multiple team members.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Drizzle is an ability that provides eight turns of rain when used with Damp Rock, enabling Swift Swim users like Mega Swampert and Kingdra to sweep. Maximum Speed EVs are used to outrun Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl under Tailwind.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As long as your team has rain sweepers healthy, Pelipper should be preserved to ensure rain stays up so they can maintain a fast, strong offensive presence. If an opponent has their own weather setter, make sure to keep Pelipper as healthy as possible in order to win the weather war. Pelipper can also be used as a slow pivot thanks to its access to U-turn, giving it momentum that can be a crucial edge over an opponent. Pokemon that run Electric-type coverage moves should always be feared when using Pelipper, as almost all of these can OHKO Pelipper, potentially your team's only rain setter. Tailwind needs to be used appropriately to help keep pace with other members of your team. Pelipper is a great switch-in for other weather conditions like sun and sand and is a particularly good switch-in for Mega Charizard Y, which is a pain for rain teams. Switches should happen before opposing setters Mega Evolve, as otherwise the turn will end up with sand, sun, or hail up against Mega Tyranitar, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Abomasnow. Pelipper can be sacrificed late-game to set rain and take back momentum by capitalizing on the free turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert and Kingdra can be used to gain doubled Speed during rain, allowing them to outrun the entire unboosted metagame and turn them into major threats with their rain-boosted STAB attacks. Mega Swampert also has great synergy with Pelipper due to its Electric immunity and Pelipper's immunity to Earthquake. They also appreciate the removal of Grass-types through Pelipper's Hurricane. Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu can help break through bulky Water-types which rain teams can struggle with. Bulky Steel-types such as Metagross and Aegislash can benefit from rain halving their Fire weakness. Since teams with Pelipper tend to be more offensive, Pokemon that offer offensive pressure, most notably Deoxys-A, and Tapu Lele, along with the aforementioned rain sweepers, work well together. Landorus-T can be a good teammate to help deal with annoyances to rain, such as Tyranitar, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem-B. Pelipper appreciates a teammate that can deal with other weather, like Grass-types for opposing rain and sand or Rock-types for sand and hail. Pokemon that can threaten Mega Charizard Y and Amoonguss, such as Kyurem-B and Tapu Koko, can help deal with common checks to rain teams.</p> "

Access to Volt Switch and Intimidate in tandem with a good typing make Mega Manectric a formidable positioning tool, letting it come in several times in a match to weaken physical attackers. Fire coverage in Overheat or Flamethrower sets it apart from other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, and Snarl is another nice tool that punishes special attackers. However, despite its handy Intimidate, Mega Manectric can't come in on metagame-defining attackers like Zygarde and Landorus-T. Mega Manectric's damage output is also rather lackluster, and it struggles considerably with opposing speed control.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>By virtue of its limited niche, Mega Manectric doesn't have many additional options. Flamethrower gives up a lot of Overheat's power but doesn't lower Mega Manectric's damage output like Overheat does; Flamethrower also pairs better with Hidden Power Ice, as Overheat also risks weakening the latter. Thunder can be used over Snarl on rain teams for added power. Finally, Thunderbolt can replace Volt Switch to allow Mega Manectric to use Electric-type moves without having to switch out on non-rain teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: While most common Ground-types are weak to Hidden Power Ice, Mega Manectric is still vulnerable to any of them switching in to block Volt Switch; the likes of Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Swampert can hit it with a STAB Ground move of choice, dealing decent damage even after spread reduction and Intimidate, with Mega Swampert taking on even Hidden Power Ice variants. Landorus can also block Volt Switch, but it has a chance to get OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice and doesn't appreciate Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Most Grass-types, such as Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss, can take at least one Overheat and thus force Mega Manectric out due to the Special Attack drop. Amoonguss can also put it to sleep with Spore, and Tapu Bulu can hit it hard with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kyurem-B can take absolutely anything Mega Manectric throws at it and retaliate with an Earth Power, Ice Beam, or Icy Wind for speed control. Soundproof Kommo-o is immune to Snarl and also stomachs any move from Mega Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Mega Manectric is very susceptible to speed control, as it relies on its high Speed stat to be an efficient pivot. Trick Room from the likes of Diancie and Stakataka, Tailwind from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Suicune, and Icy Wind from the likes of Kyurem-B and Milotic can heavily annoy Mega Manectric and most of its teammates.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is key to make Mega Manectric the reliable pivot it is, enabling it to switch out while dealing decent damage. Snarl punishes special attackers, being notably helpful to let teammates shrug off moves. Overheat hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, as well as Mega Metagross, a powerful and popular pick. Hidden Power Ice hits foes 4x weak to Ice, most notably Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence, the former two of which wall any set lacking the move. Hidden Power Ice could replace either Snarl or Overheat. Giving up Overheat makes Mega Manectric lose important coverage on Grass-types and Mega Metagross, whereas losing out on Snarl reduces some of its utility against special attackers; choosing which move to give up depends a lot on Mega Manectric's teammates, making it important to evaluate Mega Manectric's choice of moves on a case-by-case basis. Finally, Protect not only keeps Mega Manectric safe from attacks that could be troublesome but also lets it stall out methods of speed control such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature let Mega Manectric outrun +1 Modest Kommo-o and Rash Deoxys-A while still tying with opposing Mega Manectric. Its bulk investment enables it to take a Psychic from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele in Psychic Terrain or a Stomping Tantrum from Mega Metagross. The rest of EVs are invested into Special Attack. Alternatively, 252 SpA EVs and 252 Spe EVs can be used to increase firepower, but this makes Mega Manectric a less reliable pivot. Lightning Rod is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution to redirect Electric-type moves, which not only can improve its firepower considerably but also helps teammates take on threats like Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Manectric is quite a solid lead, providing not only Intimidate but also a reliable method of pivoting and scouting thanks to its fast Volt Switch. It's important to try to undergo Mega Evolution early if Lightning Rod won't have much use, as this allows it to offer Intimidate support on the switch. Nonetheless, it's always nice to attempt to preserve Mega Manectric for late-game, as it can be quite helpful to seal a match with the combination of Intimidate and Snarl to keep faster foes in check. Pivot Mega Manectric into physical attackers to reduce their firepower with Intimidate. Decent effective bulk after Intimidate lets it come in a couple times on a match, so make sure to make the best use of that bulk by constantly utilizing Volt Switch and Intimidate against your opponent. Speaking of Volt Switch, be careful not to use it when the opponent predicts it and sends in a Ground-type; this will leave Mega Manectric vulnerable to damage it might not have intended to take during that turn. If running Overheat, it's usually ideal to pivot out afterward due to the resulting Special Attack drop. Allies with a setup move can take advantage of Intimidate and Snarl, giving them a lot more opportunities, so try to pivot Mega Manectric in when attempting to set up with them. Lastly, if your opponent has a strong Electric-type like Tapu Koko, it could be ideal to hold off on Mega Evolving for a turn or two to redirect its Electric move; just keep the lack of Intimidate, power, and Speed in mind.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers like Zygarde and Kommo-o greatly appreciate Intimidate and Snarl giving them more opportunities to set up. Pokemon with U-turn like Genesect and Incineroar have great synergy with Mega Manectric, enabling constant pivoting and a continually changing board state. In a similar manner, a secondary Intimidate user like Landorus-T or the aforementioned Incineroar is a good choice to annoy opposing physical attackers with a lot more effectiveness by constantly pivoting back and forth. Pokemon that take on Dragon-types like Kyurem-B and Kommo-o that would otherwise wall Mega Manectric are great partners; examples include Tapu Fini and the aforementioned Genesect. Tailwind users like Suicune and Mew greatly appreciate Intimidate and Snarl giving them more opportunities to set up. Similarly, speed control in Icy Wind or Electroweb is also appreciated, making up for Mega Manectric's susceptibility to opposing speed control. Notable users include Assault Vest Kyurem-B and Porygon2, especially since both have great matchups against Landorus-T and Zygarde. A countermeasure to Trick Room is important, as most frameworks with Mega Manectric can be quite susceptible to it otherwise; Roar Suicune is a sound pick, also compressing the role of a Tailwind setter, but Taunt users such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele also excel at this role. Gothitelle can trap opposing Pokemon whose stats were lowered by Intimidate or Snarl while also being able to reset opposing Trick Room.</p> "

If Trick Room isn't up, the safest way you can ensure it is set safely is to use Protect and let Mega Camerupt's ally set it up. Once Mega Camerupt is in play, the goal is typically to use Heat Wave as many times as possible before Mega Camerupt is forced out, as Sheer Force-boosted Heat Wave takes large chunks of HP out of both opposing Pokemon, assuming they do not resist it. Mega Camerupt forces a lot of switches; your opponent will likely switch in a bulky Water-type if they have the opportunity to, and if they're expecting you to use Earth Power, they will probably consider switching in a Flying-type or a Pokemon with Levitate. Substitute is best used when Mega Camerupt forces a switch and on the last turn of Trick Room, when foes are more likely to use Protect to stall it out, thus reducing their reliance on prediction. For sets using Nature Power, you're most likely to get value out of Grassy and Electric Terrain, as these allow you to counter opposing Water-types. Try to keep Tapu Bulu or Tapu Koko in the back so you can switch them in once a bulky Water-type like Tapu Fini is on the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters are necessary for Mega Camerupt to take advantage of its low Speed. Having a bulky option like Bronzong, Porygon2, or Cresselia as an ally is crucial, since the priority of Mega Camerupt teams is getting Trick Room set regardless of the opponent's attempts to stop it, and Mega Camerupt is absolute deadweight if Trick Room can't be set. Pokemon that struggle with Steel-types such as Tapu Bulu and Diancie benefit from Mega Camerupt's presence. Tapu Bulu is the ideal Island Guardian for Mega Camerupt's team because it forces out Water-types and summons Grassy Terrain, which converts Nature Power to Energy Ball, halves Earthquake damage, and provides recovery that is especially useful to Substitute variants of Mega Camerupt. Tapu Fini is also a worthwhile partner that can provide Heal Pulse recovery and extra defense against Amoonguss's Spore. An Amoonguss of your own is able to redirect Scald or Waterfall for Mega Camerupt and threaten the opposing team with Spore.</p> "

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<p>Drought gives Torkoal a niche as a powerful Trick Room attacker along with Eruption's high Base Power and spread damage. Its decent bulk also allows it to tank a hit from notable threats such as Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, and Genesect and retaliate with powerful Fire-type moves. Torkoal's low Speed not only allows it to move first under Trick Room, which is huge for underspeeding Amoonguss, but also has the advantage of guaranteeing its weather will be set up last and thus remain on the field. However, Torkoal is too dependent on Trick Room and its own weather to work effectively, mandating Trick Room setters as partners and therefore becoming very one-dimensional and predictable. Furthermore, it is very reliant on its HP staying high to make effective use of Eruption, making it rather weak after it has taken some damage or its weather has been replaced.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulldoze can activate an ally Diancie's Weakness Policy while providing another method of speed control for semi-Trick Room teams. Hidden Power Ice could be used for hitting Zygarde and Mega Salamence, which otherwise shrug off any damage Torkoal can do to them, while also hitting Landorus-T more reliably.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Zygarde, and Kingdra can tank a hit from Torkoal and OHKO or 2HKO it with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcanion and Mega Camerupt take little damage from Torkoal's moves and can 2HKO it effortlessly. However, they must still watch out for Earth Power, which does a notable chunk of damage to both. Mega Charizard Y doesn't take much damage from Torkoal, but it doesn't deal much back either.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Stakataka can revenge kill Torkoal with a Rock-type move under Trick Room and claim a boost from Beast Boost, making it a big threat for Torkoal. Mega Tyranitar is also troublesome due to its ability to win the weather war and make Torkoal's Solar Beam useless; it also shrugs off any damage from Torkoal, as Earth Power fails to even 3HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Without Trick Room, Torkoal is outspeed by pretty much the entire metagame, making it vulnerable to threats such as Tapu Lele, Tyranitar, and Zygarde.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Pelipper can switch into Torkoal with little to no drawback and OHKO it with a rain-boosted Scald; Tyranitar is also a safe switch-in, taking little from Earth Power and threatening Torkoal with Stone Edge.</p> ",

        "name": "Trick Room Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Eruption is a high-Base Power spread STAB move capable of heavily damaging most of the tier, being able to pick off weakened foes under Trick Room such as Tapu Koko, Marshadow, and Landorus-T. Flamethrower is a more reliable single-target move that should be used when Torkoal's HP is too low for Eruption to inflict sufficient damage. Fire Blast is a slightly stronger alternative that is not as accurate. Solar Beam hits Water- and Rock-types such as Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, Diancie, and Tyranitar. Protect could be used instead on non-Assault Vest sets for shielding Torkoal while a teammate retaliates. Earth Power hits opposing Fire-types such as Incineroar and Volcanion, which would otherwise shrug off Torkoal's hits with ease. Alternatively, Stealth Rock takes a more supportive role by chipping down the opposing team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Drought summons sun, boosting Torkoal's Fire-type moves and allowing it to use one-turn Solar Beams. The investment in HP and Special Defense gives Torkoal overall great mixed defenses while allowing it to tank a Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt from Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain or a -1 Tectonic Rage from Zygarde. Charcoal gives Torkoal some extra power behind its moves along with the ability to run Protect. Alternatively, Torkoal can use an Assault Vest to make up for its poor Special Defense, though this requires Torkoal to sacrifice the option to use Protect. The Special Attack investment along with a Quiet nature allows Torkoal to hit as hard as possible, while 0 Speed IVs are beneficial to outspeed Amoonguss under Trick Room and allow Torkoal to set its weather last.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid letting Torkoal get worn down easily, as it really appreciates keeping its HP for full-powered Eruptions. Therefore, avoid recklessly switching Torkoal in and wait for the correct opportunity to do so; most of the time it's ideal to only send Torkoal in after one of its teammates gets KOed. Also, make sure Trick Room is up as well when switching Torkoal in, as Torkoal has little use without it, being outsped and worn down rather quickly. Opposing weather setters are also a pain for Torkoal, removing its power boost and possibly locking it into Solar Beam, which gives the opponent countless opportunities to knock it out. Therefore, try taking care of the likes of Pelipper and Tyranitar before sweeping with Torkoal.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A Trick Room setter is mandatory for Torkoal to work effectively: Diancie benefits from the weakening of Water-type moves, allowing it to run a Weakness Policy set more reliably, and deals with Fire- and Dragon-types for Torkoal, while Victini appreciates the power boost from sun. Other Trick Room setters such as Mega Gardevoir, Stakataka, and Porygon2 are still overall great picks. Tapu Bulu is an amazing partner as well, as it gives Torkoal passive recovery from Grassy Terrain, which also boosts Torkoal's Eruptions, allows it to tank Earthquakes a lot better, and as a bonus lets Torkoal's Solar Beam hit a lot harder. Furthermore, Tapu Bulu also provides a great matchup against rain and appreciates Torkoal taking out Steel-types for it.</p> "

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic has good bulk and a good defensive Water typing that renders most attacks neutral, offering its team a defensive backbone and a good switch-in to sponge most attacks. Its access to a good range of supportive moves like Icy Wind and Scald alongside reliable recovery is also noteworthy, making Milotic a good utility Pokemon with longevity. In addition, its ability Competitive allows it to check Intimidate users like Landorus-T, Incineroar, and Salamence, which are extremely common. On the other hand, it has a rather mediocre Speed stat of 81 and underwhelming Special Attack, making it, without a Competitive boost, lack the offensive presence that other Water-types like Tapu Fini and Volcanion have. This is also made worse by the fact that Milotic has a poor offensive movepool and no STAB type other than Water.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Milotic's movepool is somewhat limited, leaving its other options less varied and generally less viable; thus, it isn't encouraged to stray too much from the standard set or moves. A set featuring Coil and Hypnosis allows Milotic to pressure foes in a different way; with a Psychic Seed boost and Defense raises from Coil, it becomes quite difficult to break, especially since Milotic can spread sleep fairly reliably. However, such a set suffers from passivity and often sits on the field for a long time without accomplishing much. Mirror Coat can be used for a surprise factor, as Milotic is generally very capable of surviving special hits and can use this to offer an unexpected counterattack. Hydro Pump can be used over Scald to provide a potentially higher amount of damage at the cost of accuracy, even if Milotic's low base Special Attack doesn't usually make the increase too impactful. It's also better if you manage to get a Competitive boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric are very common Pokemon that hit Milotic hard, and Rotom-Wash also heavily walls Milotic. Electric-type coverage users such as Kyurem-Black and Mega Metagross can be particularly threatening with Fusion Bolt and Thunder Punch, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Tapu Bulu, Shaymin-Sky, and Amoonguss threaten Milotic despite the fact that it often runs Icy Wind or Ice Beam, since they either outspeed Milotic and hit it first or put it to sleep. Ferrothorn has the added bonus of a neutrality to Ice-type attacks and access to Leech Seed to cut into Milotic's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types are scary because Milotic can't dent them offensively and is unable to prevent them from setting up; examples include Calm Mind Tapu Fini, Tailwind Suicune, and opposing Milotic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Without access to Recover, Milotic is easily worn down.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Milotic's primary STAB attack and source of damage, with the added possibility to inflict burns, allowing it to take physical hits better and cripple physical threats. Icy Wind is used mainly for speed control on both targets, helping Milotic's partner to outspeed threats it normally would not. Ice Beam may be used if there is preference for a more offensive attack to hit Flying- and Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Zapdos much harder. Being a supportive Pokemon with access to recovery is great, since Recover gives Milotic longevity and helps it carry out its role of switching in and crippling opposing Pokemon. Last but not least, Protect allows Milotic to stall out field conditions and is used to protect Milotic from being targeted while its partner clears threats on the field. Haze can also be used over Protect if the team struggles with setup Pokemon, but the latter two moves are useful more often.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With 56 EVs in Speed, Milotic outspeeds -1 Kyurem-B, allowing it to hit Kyurem-B with Icy Wind and Recover off the damage before being hit again. Maximizing Defense gives Milotic good physical bulk to complement its high natural special bulk with Psychic Seed or Maranga Berry. Competitive gives Milotic a niche in the Doubles metagame, as it allows it to check Intimidate users by deterring Intimidate switch-ins and to even become a threat of its own after a boost, making up for its lackluster offensive presence. Finally, whether to use Maranga Berry or Psychic Seed for an item depends on if you have a Tapu Lele on your team. Psychic Seed also avoids forcing Milotic to risk being hit by a strong special move to activate Maranga Berry. If using a Psychic Seed, Milotic can opt for a spread of 240 HP / 156 Def / 56 SpD / 56 Spe with a Calm nature. With this, Milotic can take Tapu Koko's Z-Thunderbolt in Electric Terrain after the seed boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Milotic is usually sent out if you think the opponent will send out an Intimidate user or if you predict a switch to one. Competitive provides a nice boost when this happens, but it isn't worth going out of your way to force it. It's also to be kept in mind that Pokemon switch order also depends on speed, so avoid switching in Milotic if your Pokemon is slower than the departing foe, as Intimidate would have already been activated. Milotic's presence on the field can also be used for the opposite effect; discouraging the foe from sending out Intimidate users to avoid triggering Competitive and making Milotic a bigger threat. It's also smart to switch in Milotic in case you predict a stat-lowering move such as Snarl or Icy Wind, since Milotic generally doesn't mind them and appreciates getting the Competitive boost in return. While out on the field, Milotic's job consists mostly of supporting its teammates by lowering opposing Pokemon's Speed with Icy Wind or by attempting to cripple physical threats with a Scald burn. This is facilitated by Milotic's good bulk and typing, which allow it to take hits fairly well and make it generally a good switch-in option, and it can also activate Psychic Seed on a switch to take a hit even better. It should be kept in mind that Maranga Berry and Psychic Seed are one-time-use items, so use them wisely. Lastly, preserving Milotic is important because it usually requires being healthy to perform its sponging role, so finding the opportunity to safely recover health is crucial.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thanks to Competitive, most physical attackers appreciate having Milotic on their team and out on the field, since it greatly discourages opponents from sending out Intimidate Pokemon, notably Landorus-T and Incineroar, to cripple these teammates. This makes Milotic a great teammate for Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, which relies on its naturally high base Attack to do damage considering its poor offensive typing. Zygarde is another notable example, as it suffers from an already low Attack stat further aggravated by the spread reduction on its main move Thousand Arrows, making Intimidate really harmful to it, especially as it neutralizes a potential Dragon Dance. If using Icy Wind support, offensive Pokemon that lack high Speed such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Heatran become able to outspeed and KO opposing threats after the Speed drop on both targets. Due to the lack of offensive pressure it exerts, Milotic has little way to play around its offensive threats and thus relies on its teammates to do so. Pokemon like Incineroar and Landorus-T make good teammates in this regard due to their ability to check common offensive Grass- and Electric-types, respectively. Another important partner is Tapu Lele, since Psychic Seed is usually the optimal item on Milotic and is less risky than Maranga Berry. On the other hand, Milotic's passivity makes it setup bait for Pokemon like Tapu Fini, which can ignore Milotic to a certain degree, making teammates that deter setup, such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele with Taunt, appreciated partners.</p> "

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>For what is generally considered a purely offensive Pokemon, Mega Salamence boasts impressive defenses and a unique support movepool, making it a top threat in the Doubles OU tier. Salamence has a lot of flexibility in its ability to use a mixed set or specialize in either physical or special attacks. However, it often relies on its speed to maintain offensive pressure, so if it's not attacking first, it can be liable to taking a lot of damage. The all-out attacking and Dragon Dance sets have somewhat similar checks but are played to entirely different win conditions, so any opponent of Mega Salamence must tread lightly until its set is revealed. Unfortunately, the prevalence of other Pokemon 4x weak to Ice in the tier, such as Landorus-T and Zygarde, means that most teams have built-in Salamence checks. Additionally, the prevalence of Stealth Rock means that Salamence has to be careful about how many times it switches in and out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast can be used instead of Flamethrower on the mixed set if you are in desperate need for more damage, but the slight increase in Base Power is generally not worth the lower accuracy. Flamethrower and Fire Blast both 2HKO standard Mega Metagross, while Fire Blast fails to guarantee a knockout against standard Ferrothorn. Roost is an alternative to Tailwind on the mixed attacker set that bolsters Mega Salamence's longevity at the cost of coverage or utility. If you want to more effectively check Dragon-types like Zygarde and Kyurem-B, a fully special set of Hyper Voice / Draco Meteor / Flamethrower / Protect can be used in conjunction with an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature. Earthquake is an option over Roost on the Dragon Dance set if you want a way to better damage Steel-types, but it is far inferior to Roost as Steel-types are better left to Salamence's partners.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types take very little damage from any of Salamence's attacks and threaten big damage in return. Tyranitar often carries an Ice-type attack to threaten Salamence even harder and summons sand to chip away at Salamence's health, reducing the longevity of the Dragon Dance set. Diancie can set up Trick Room to neutralize Salamence's high speed, threaten it with either of its STAB attacks, or boost its Defense with Diamond Storm, effectively making it one of the best Salamence checks.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type moves: Given Salamence's 4x weakness to Ice, it wants to avoid taking Ice-type attacks at all costs. Kyurem-B can take at least one hit from Salamence and either blow it back with Ice Beam or lower its Speed with Icy Wind. This applies to non-STAB Ice-type coverage moves too; Landorus-T often carries Hidden Power Ice, while Mew and Porygon2 usually pack Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Tapu Fini is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier and can threaten Salamence with Moonblast while also negating damage its partner has taken with Heal Pulse. Milotic takes advantage of Salamence's Intimidate with its Competitive ability and can lower Salamence's Speed with Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types resist Mega Salamence's Flying-type STAB attacks, which is often the only type of attack it will carry. Tapu Koko outspeeds Salamence and threatens it with any of Terrain-boosted Thunderbolt, Dazzling Gleam, or Gigavolt Havoc. Zapdos can passively paralyze Salamence with Static, neutralize its high speed with Tailwind, and threaten to negate any Dragon Dance boosts with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types that resist Flying-type attacks are strong defensive checks to Mega Salamence. Aegislash can continuously take hits from Mega Salamence lacking a Fire-type attack while either threatening it with a strong Shadow Ball or cutting its longevity with Toxic. Celesteela can use Leech Seed to slowly drain Salamence's health, but it struggles to break through Roost sets. While it's neither bulky nor resistant to Flying, Choice Scarf Genesect will outspeed unboosted Salamence and cleanly OHKO it with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic from Pokemon like Chansey and Aegislash severely threatens Salamence's longevity, especially for the Dragon Dance set, which relies on its bulk. Paralysis takes away one of Mega Salamence's biggest assets in its Speed and can be incurred from Pokemon like Static Zapdos and Thunder Wave Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While fast, Mega Salamence is not the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Choice Scarf Genesect all outspeed Mega Salamence and are capable of scoring a clean OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Salamence generally relies on its speed to either safely KO opposing Pokemon or Roost off damage, so ensuring that it won't be attacking first is a good way to take it down. Zapdos and Suicune are both Tailwind setters capable of taking a hit and threatening it with a possible Ice-type attack or phazing move. Diancie, Cresselia, and Porygon2 can all set up Trick Room and threaten Salamence with a super effective attack in the form of Diamond Storm or Ice Beam. Icy Wind and Electroweb combine speed control and damage and are often seen on Cresselia, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Koko.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge is Mega Salamence's primary attack, dealing large amounts of damage to any target that doesn't resist it. Some common Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele, are even knocked out by a single Double-Edge. Hyper Voice is a very spammable attack and provides Mega Salamence with a means of consistent spread damage, often chipping foes into range for a Double-Edge knockout. Hyper Voice also has the added bonus of circumventing the omnipresent Intimidate, which would otherwise deter physical sets. Tailwind gives Salamence a means of all-important speed control, adding some utility to an otherwise purely offensive toolkit. Flamethrower turns Mega Salamence from a very good Kartana check to arguably the best Kartana check while also enabling it to hit problematic Steel-types like Metagross and Aegislash. Protect is important on a Pokemon with a major offensive presence like Mega Salamence to buy a turn of safety while under fire so its partner can hopefully deal with the threat at hand.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>To take advantage of its high base Speed and ensure that Mega Salamence is attacking first as often as possible, a Hasty nature and 252 EVs in Speed are employed. 180 Attack EVs allow Mega Salamence to OHKO all of Mega Charizard Y, Hasty Genesect, and Tapu Lele. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to boost the power of Hyper Voice. Intimidate is chosen due to its vast utility in DOU, adding to Mega Salamence's already above average physical bulk and supporting its teammates to boot. While the Hasty nature seems to contradict this point, losing a little bit of Defense is less harmful than losing a little bit of Special Defense, since Intimidate covers this loss and the extra special bulk allows Mega Salamence to stand up to special attackers more comfortably. If Flamethrower is chosen in the third moveslot, 20 EVs should be moved from Attack to Special Attack for a total of 96, which allows Mega Salamence to 2HKO Mega Metagross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As one of the primary damage dealers on its team, Mega Salamence should be maneuvered into positions where it can start firing off powerful attacks at low risk. Salamence can switch into weak physical attacks and resisted special attacks fairly easily thanks to its natural bulk. Since a significant portion of Salamence's utility comes from Intimidate, Mega Evolving and using Protect on the same turn is almost never advised. In fact, if you want to use Tailwind but have not yet Mega Evolved Salamence, it can even be advantageous to hold off on Mega Evolving for that turn. Once you're ready to start attacking, that's when Mega Evolution becomes necessary. You almost never want to attack before Mega Evolving because Mega Salamence's Aerilate ability is the only reason this set can pump out damage. Hyper Voice can either be used to chip foes into knockout range for partners or clean up weakened foes in endgame scenarios. Double-Edge is very powerful and capable of OHKOing some frailer Pokemon, but you must be wary of taking too much recoil damage and compromising Salamence's survivability. Similarly, you must be careful to not switch Salamence in and out too often when Stealth Rock is on the field, as taking 25% chip damage multiple times can be disastrous.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Salamence fits on a wide variety of teams thanks to its decent synergy with all four Island Guardians, something that does not apply to many Pokemon. Tapu Fini can support Salamence with options like Icy Wind and Heal Pulse while using Nature's Madness to prime opposing Pokemon for knockouts at Salamence's hand. Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu both threaten troublesome bulky Water-type Pokemon, while Tapu Lele and Mega Salamence can combine for insane damage output thanks to their outstanding neutral power and, in conjunction, can threaten most of the top Pokemon in the tier. Steel-type Pokemon make good partners for Salamence as well, as Salamence threatens Fire-types while Steel-types can withstand Ice-, Fairy-, and Rock-type moves sent Salamence's way. Aegislash fills this role very well defensively, while Genesect can act as a more offensive partner. Checks to Steel- and Rock-types are important for any team, so a Pokemon like Volcanion also partners well with Salamence thanks to its ability to offensively threaten both. Even though Salamence resists Water-type attacks, most bulky Water-types can stand up to Mega Salamence's strong offense and fire back with threatening attacks like Ice Beam or Icy Wind. As a result, alongside Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, Kartana and Zapdos make for good Salamence teammates thanks to their ability to clear out or at least significantly damage Water-types. Most of the suggested partners for Salamence experience a symbiotic relationship with it, as they allow Salamence to do its job effectively while also benefiting from the Tailwind support it can provide. However, Salamence's typing leaves it weak to more types than the average Pokemon, so you must be wary not to start stacking weakness when building a team around Mega Salamence.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is preferred over Double-Edge in order to maximize Salamence's longevity. When its Attack is boosted, Mega Salamence's damage output is high enough that the difference in Base Power between Return and Double-Edge is largely negligible. Dragon Dance is used to raise Salamence's Attack and Speed to sky-high levels and transform Salamence from a general chip damage machine to a sweeper. Roost can negate damage Salamence might incur as it switches in or sets up a Dragon Dance. Given this set's emphasis on bulk, Salamence is often able to Roost away more damage than it takes on a given turn, allowing it to safely remain on the field until it can begin its sweep. Protect is a staple in DOU and is often the fourth move of choice, but Substitute can be used instead to block status moves and Intimidate or gain free turns on predicted Protects or switches. Substitute also synergizes well with Roost, since Salamence can easily recover the damage lost from creating a Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given investment in HP and Special Defense allows Mega Salamence to survive a Moonblast from standard Tapu Lele, which means that Salamence can beat what would be a hard stop to its sweep in a vacuum. This bulk investment also means that Mega Salamence can survive a -1 Ice Punch from Mega Metagross after Stealth Rock. Speed is invested to the point where Mega Salamence will always outspeed Landorus, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack. An Adamant nature is used in order to boost Salamence's Attack even further. Dragon Dance Salamence should still use Intimidate in order to facilitate its own setup while leaving it with an element of team support.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Mega Salamence operates best as a late-game sweeper. It can certainly be used to deal some damage earlier on in battles, but you should only start setting up with Dragon Dance when you think you can win the game from that point. Before that, feel free to use regular Salamence's Intimidate ability to support its team or Mega Evolve to fire off a Return or two. Keep in mind that, even though Salamence can Roost off any damage incurred, Stealth Rock damage must still be considered carefully when switching in and out. The beauty of bulky Dragon Dance Mega Salamence is its forgiving nature—Roost and above average bulk allow it to take hits more comfortably and recover back up to full health. One more unique way to use this bulkier set is to check Speed stats on turn 1. For example, if you lead off a battle with this Salamence set and your opponents leads with Tapu Lele, the order of activation of Intimidate and Psychic Surge can tell you something about the Tapu Lele's EVs. Once the time comes for Mega Salamence to start boosting, it can effectively set up for free in the face of a lot of common Pokemon such as Incineroar, standard bulky Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and non-Hidden Power Ice Volcanion. Staying healthy with Roost is important, as a bit of unexpected damage is one of the best ways to counteract a Mega Salamence sweep. Using Roost often can put you in a better position if your opponent tries to switch into a better matchup. Remember that Return still does a lot of damage without a boost, so against frail or Flying-weak Pokemon that threaten Salamence with super effective damage or status like Tapu Lele and Amoonguss, it's more advantageous to attack immediately. Finally, Dragon Dance can be used not only to boost Mega Salamence's stats but also to counteract Intimidate on a predicted switch or after the drop.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Mega Salamence loves having teammates that can buy it free turns. Scrafty and Incineroar are both good partners thanks to their access to Fake Out and Intimidate, both of which ease Salamence's stay on the field. Scrafty provides much-needed assistance against Tyranitar and aid against some Steel-types but adds a Fairy weakness, while Incineroar handles all relevant Steel-types but stacks a weakness to Rock and struggles to deal with bulky Water-types. Zeraora is another Pokemon that can provide Fake Out support while also improving the matchup against Electric-types, threatening most bulky Water-types, and using its nice access to Snarl to facilitate Salamence's setup. Redirection can also pave the way for a Mega Salamence sweep; Amoonguss and Volcarona are both effective Rage Powder users that also provide sleep and Tailwind support, respectively. Amoonguss has the added bonus of checking both Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini, while Volcarona can roast Steel-types. Steel-types also make good partners for Mega Salamence to check Rock-, Ice-, and Fairy-types. Genesect is an offensive option that heavily threatens Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Lele. Aegislash takes a more defensive role and can protect Salamence from moves that would otherwise deal big damage like Rock Slide or Icy Wind with its access to Wide Guard. Bulky Water-types also present a problem thanks to their ability to take hits from Mega Salamence and threaten with an Ice-type move or, in Tapu Fini's case, a STAB Moonblast. Kartana and Tapu Bulu can both use their strong Grass-type attacks to neutralize Water-types while also threatening the other three Island Guardians. Finally, Zapdos presents a problem for Mega Salamence thanks to its deadly combination of bulk, typing, and access to both Static to threaten paralysis and Tailwind to neutralize Speed boosts. Kyurem-B makes for a good partner thanks to its ability to threaten Zapdos with a strong Ice-type attack while also eliminating a common Intimidate user in Landorus-T.</p> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>In a metagame dominated by strong Fairy-types, Mega Metagross stands out as a powerful offensive Steel-type that can pivot in and break down an opposing team with minimal support. With a solid defensive typing, a diverse offensive movepool, and solid stats across the board, Mega Metagross finds itself in favorable matchups against several of the metagame's top-tier threats including Mega Salamence, most of the island guardians, and Kyurem-B. The ability Tough Claws delivers a 30% boost to most attacks in Mega Metagross's movepool, while Psychic Terrain and Electric Terrain can be leveraged for additional boosts to Zen Headbutt and Thunder Punch, respectively, making Mega Metagross an extremely potent attacker in the right situations. However, Mega Metagross's Steel / Psychic offensive typing offers it limited opportunities for super effective coverage, so it often finds itself relying on coverage moves or raw power to beat down its foes. Finally, Mega Metagross suffers from a small case of four-moveslot syndrome; while there is no shortage of coverage options in Mega Metagross's movepool to compensate for some of its weaknesses, no matter what it runs, it is likely to find itself walled by something.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hammer Arm is an option to hit Incineroar harder than any of Metagross's other moves and break down Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Stakataka, but the consequent Speed drop hinders Mega Metagross, and the move still leaves it walled by Aegislash. Thunder Punch can be used (possibly in tandem with Electric Terrain) to give Mega Metagross strong coverage against Mega Charizard Y as well as a means of breaking down bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Milotic. Bullet Punch is an option to chip away at faster threats, although this move is incompatible with teams built around Psychic Terrain. Psych Up is a nifty option for teams with a setup sweeper like Kommo-o; Mega Metagross can copy the boosts of its teammate and also punish opposing setup sweepers for setting up. Stealth Rock may be a useful supportive option to chip away at every Pokemon the opponent sends out, but Metagross typically needs its moveslots for coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Levitate Bronzong wall Mega Metagross and don't take much from even its coverage moves. Aegislash additionally threatens Mega Metagross back with a strong super effective attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Strong Fire-types like Volcanion, Mega Charizard Y, Incineroar, and Volcarona can all survive an attack from Mega Metagross then threaten it back with super effective attacks. Additionally, various threats use Fire-type moves as coverage, so Mega Metagross must be wary of foes like Genesect and Kommo-o.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde can take on Mega Metagross with a Choice Scarf and Dragon Dance boost, respectively, and use their respective Ground-type attacks. Mega Metagross's Ice Punch, however, can KO these Pokemon on a predicted switch or before Zygarde is able to set up a Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Prior to Mega Evolving, Clear Body prevents Intimidate from affecting Metagross. However, once Mega Evolved, Mega Metagross's offensive presence can be mitigated by the opponent switching in an Intimidate user such as Landorus-T or Mega Manectric. Still, these Intimidate users need to be wary of Metagross's coverage moves, with Ice Punch taking on Landorus-T and Salamence and Stomping Tantrum severely damaging Mega Manectric and Incineroar, even at -1.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Mega Metagross typically has the bulk to temporarily ride out opposing speed control in many scenarios. However, it is most effective when it is able to leverage its high Speed. Zapdos and Mew stand out as a Tailwind setters that can comfortably absorb an attack from Mega Metagross before setting up. Bulkier Trick Room setters like Porygon2 and Cresselia also have little issue setting up in front of Metagross.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Mega Metagross's most reliable Steel-type STAB move and has a 30% chance to cause its target to flinch, which Mega Metagross is often able to take advantage of due to its high Speed. Meteor Mash offers slightly more power at the expense of accuracy, and it has a 20% chance of boosting Mega Metagross's Attack stat. Ice Punch allows Metagross to OHKO the metagame's plethora of Ice-weak threats, such as Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. Stomping Tantrum hits would-be checks, including Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcanion and Steel-types like Aegislash and opposing Mega Metagross, for decent damage. Protect keeps Mega Metagross safe while its partners deal with any possible threats. In place of Stomping Tantrum or Ice Punch, Zen Headbutt offers a secondary STAB attack that is most useful for Amoonguss and Kommo-o and becomes Mega Metagross's strongest attack inside of Psychic Terrain.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Mega Metagross to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is preferred to allow Mega Metagross to outpace positive-natured base 100s like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as faster attackers like Kartana and Landorus. Clear Body is a handy pre-Mega ability that can be used strategically to scout out and negate Intimidate drops from Landorus-T and Salamence as they switch in.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With a great defensive typing and a versatile offensive movepool, Mega Metagross works well in early- or mid-game scenarios to pressure foes and force switches. With solid bulk and a good defensive typing, Mega Metagross pivots into resisted and neutral attacks fairly well. However, it lacks a means of recovery, so its HP should be conserved as much as possible if you're relying on it to check a particular threat like Deoxys-A. Prior to Mega Evolution, Metagross's Clear Body negates Intimidate drops, so consider not Mega Evolving if you expect your opponent to switch in an Intimidate user like Incineroar or Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types tend to wall Mega Metagross, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Volcanion make for excellent partners. Fire-types like Incineroar and Charizard Y can snipe down Mega Metagross if left unchecked, so partners such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Tapu Fini that can deal with Fire-types are useful. Mega Metagross does well on rain teams, which clear out Fire-types and also cancel out Mega Metagross's weakness to Fire. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde can snipe down Mega Metagross if given the chance, especially if holding a Choice Scarf or Dragon Dance-boosted, respectively. As such, faster Pokemon with Ice-type coverage such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Swift Swim Kingdra make for good partners. Icy Wind or Tailwind users like Kyurem-B and Zapdos are able to place Mega Metagross in a favorable position against faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric. Milotic stands out as a niche option with access to Competitive that deters would-be threats such as Landorus-T and Incineroar.</p> "

These factors as well as Levitate also allow Mega Latias to consistently check notable threats like Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence even without needing a boost. However, Mega Latias is hopelessly walled by Dark-types like Incineroar and Tyranitar as well as nearly any Steel-type. Its damage output is somewhat disappointing when unboosted, too. Also, Mega Latias faces competition as a Calm Mind sweeper from Cresselia because the latter doesn't take the Mega slot and boasts higher bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse hits the likes of Incineroar and Tyranitar for neutral damage, but Ice Beam is usually preferred because it lets Mega Latias beat Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu one-on-one more easily. Icy Wind can be used over Ice Beam to provide teammates with a form of speed control while still hitting Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence. However, Icy Wind's drop in power is very noticeable and makes it generally inferior to Ice Beam. A non-Mega Latias set with Psychic, Ice Beam, Tailwind, and Heal Pulse or Ally Switch holding Psychium Z could be used if you need a bulky Tailwind setter. Unfortunately, this set struggles against many common threats and is outclassed by better Tailwind setters like Kartana.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Pokemon like Incineroar and Tyranitar are immune to Psyshock and take little damage from Ice Beam. In return, they threaten to KO Mega Latias with their super effective Dark-type STAB options.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: The likes of Mega Metagross, Genesect, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor are resistant to Mega Latias's attacks and usually can deal heavy damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B: Kyurem-B is bulky enough to withstand any of boosted Mega Latias's attacks save for the rare Dragon Pulse and, if running Icium Z, is capable of easily KOing Mega Latias.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Status from Pokemon like Chansey and Porygon2 significantly cuts Mega Latias's longevity and prevents it from sweeping the opposing team and checking threats.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Threats like Genesect and Volcarona are capable of KOing Mega Latias with their super effective Bug-type STAB options.

Maximizing its Speed will make Mega Latias an even better check to Kartana by outspeeding it; however, this comes at the cost of bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Latias's aim is to pull of a sweep late-game when its answers like Incineroar, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash are severely weakened or completely eliminated. However, you can use Mega Latias to check the likes of Landorus-T and Mega Salamence at any point of the battle. Keep Mega Latias healthy so it can check various threats more consistently and secure more setup opportunities.

Fire-types such as Incineroar and Volcanion can break past Steel-types as well, with the former also boasting Intimidate to help Mega Latias further, while Fairy-types like Tapu Fini threaten Dark-types. Speed control from the likes of Zapdos and Kartana helps Mega Latias set up and sweep the opposing team. Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Incineroar and Zeraora gives Mega Latias more setup opportunities and free turns, as does Intimidate support.</p> "

  "Deoxys-Attack": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-A's ridiculous Speed and power cement its place as one of DOU's most immediately threatening attackers. When combined with Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge, it's capable of OHKOing almost the entire metagame bar bulky Pokemon that naturally resist Psychic-type attacks, such as Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and Bronzong. If its wide array of viable Z-Moves based off its expansive movepool is taken into consideration, no threat is truly safe from Deoxys-A's almost perfect offensive coverage. Despite all these positive traits, though, Deoxys-A has abysmal defenses, which makes KOing it a mostly trivial matter; furthermore, being a relatively one-dimensional fast attacker, it is very reliant on its Speed and thus highly susceptible to opposing speed control and priority attacks. As such, Deoxys-A fits best on select hyper offensive teams, and when positioned properly, it is an extremely potent threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-A's wide range of coverage options means that a similarly wide range of Z-Crystals are viable options with it. Fightinium Z, for example, can be used with either Focus Blast or Superpower to create a strong Fighting-type move capable of OHKOing Incineroar, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Kyurem-B, which aren't OHKOed by a regular Superpower. Darkinium Z can combine with Dark Pulse to threaten would-be checks to the ubiquitous combination of Tapu Lele and Deoxys-A like Gothitelle and Aegislash. Finally, Hidden Power Fire can play a minor role in netting surprise KOs on opposing Ferrothorn while still giving Deoxys-A a free item slot. A less offensive but also effective option is Stealth Rock, which capitalizes upon free turns caused by the switches Deoxys-A often causes—all in all, Deoxys-A's extremely deep movepool contains many other options that could be at least somewhat usable on the right teams. Other items Deoxys-A could viably run include a Life Orb, which boosts the power of Deoxys-A's attacks across the board and frees up the Z-Crystal slot for a teammate, and Focus Sash, which offers far less power than the other two options but guarantees that Deoxys-A can get an attack off, usually two. However, when running Focus Sash, it's important to watch out for Stealth Rock and damaging weather, which completely negate its effectiveness.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Select Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Bronzong can survive a Psycho Boost due to their resistances to it and take neutral damage from Superpower, and they easily KO Deoxys-A in return. Each of these have to be wary of a Z-Move or coverage moves, though, such as Black Hole Eclipse from Dark Pulse for Mega Metagross and Bronzong and Hidden Power Fire for Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Icy Wind, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Due to Deoxys-A's extreme frailty, its Speed is its greatest asset in preventing it from taking hits by knocking out its would-be aggressors before they can attack. Speed control options can either remove this advantage or even turn its Speed on it, almost ensuring that it's unable to move before it can fire off one of its powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia, Bronzong, Gothitelle, and Necrozma can easily stomach a hit from Deoxys-A and retaliate with Trick Room or Icy Wind to severely hamper Deoxys-A's offensive presence on the field. Notably, Cresselia can even stomach a potential Black Hole Eclipse from Deoxys-A before it retaliates.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: While Pokemon that are naturally faster than Deoxys-A are few and far between, relatively common Choice Scarf users like Genesect and Tapu Lele can outrun Deoxys-A, forcing it to switch out if the player is aware of the Choice Scarf or outright KOing it through its meager defenses otherwise. In addition, Swift Swim and Sand Rush users on weather teams could also easily outpace Deoxys-A and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: If Psychic Terrain is replaced by another Terrain or simply expires, Deoxys-A becomes extremely vulnerable to priority attacks like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and Zygarde's Extreme Speed, which are capable of OHKOing it before it even gets to move. These users must be wary of a potential Tapu Lele switch-in next to Deoxys-A, though.</p> ",

        "name": "Z-Move Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>True to Deoxys-A's nature, this moveset allows it to hit extremely hard and fast. Psycho Boost and Superpower are its main offensive moves, as its frailty leaves it with few turns on the field to feel the effects of the resultant stat drops. Psycho Boost is a powerful STAB move that can be boosted further with Psychium Z or Psychic Terrain, while Superpower grants Deoxys-A coverage on most of the Pokemon that resist or are immune to Psycho Boost, mainly Steel- and Dark-types such as Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. Substitute can be used in the third slot to capitalize upon the switches and Protects its sheer offensive pressure often forces, making it even harder for the opponent to play around Deoxys-A, while Ice Beam is another option to OHKO Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence without wasting its Z-Move or incurring the Special Attack decrease from Psycho Boost. Finally, on a Pokemon as frail and prone to double targeting as Deoxys-A, Detect buys it a turn on the field, letting an ally deal with a threatening opposing Pokemon and also allowing Deoxys-A to have a chance at stalling out field conditions such as rain and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Since Deoxys-A's non-existent bulk is clearly not worth investing in, this set aims to maximize the power of Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost as well as its odds of actually being able to fire off the move by maximizing its Special Attack and Speed EVs. A Naive nature is generally preferred, as it lets Deoxys-A outrun Mega Manectric, but a Rash nature could be used for the 10% increase in damage output. Finally, Psychium Z is often Deoxys-A's item of choice—it makes an already powerful Psycho Boost even more powerful, allowing it to secure OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and avoiding the Special Attack drop from Psycho Boost so it remains a strong offensive threat the turn after.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-A's complete lack of bulk is a major factor in how it's played; since Deoxys-A has difficulty switching in even on some resisted attacks without fainting, it's best brought as a lead or after an ally has fainted. In particular, Deoxys-A works best early- or mid-game to punch holes in the opposing team, notably making a good Turn 1 lead because of its ability to apply immediate offensive pressure to an opponent, putting them on the back foot from the get-go; however, if Deoxys-A is unable to immediately OHKO either opposing Pokemon, it's likely to faint to retaliation later on in the turn and should switch out instead. Likewise, should Deoxys-A manage to fire off several Psycho Boosts or Superpowers, it should switch out to reset its stat drops lest it act as dead weight. On the other hand, while Deoxys-A should generally be played offensively, a degree of caution is required to use it optimally—most importantly, since its Z-Move has such high damage potential, it's very precious and some care should be taken to avoid having it go to waste on a Protect. Other small things to note include using the activation of Pressure to check if any opposing Pokemon outrun it—if a foe's ability, outside of Unnerve, activates before Deoxys-A's, said foe is likely faster than Deoxys-A and poses a significant threat to it, so Deoxys-A should switch out of the situation.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Lele is one of the best partners to Deoxys-A and is almost mandatory when using this set, with its Psychic Terrain not only boosting the power of Psycho Boost and Shattered Psyche to ridiculous levels but also removing Deoxys-A's vulnerability to priority moves. Apart from Tapu Lele, though, Deoxys-A also appreciates teammates that can easily break through the foes it struggles with; for example, Mega Charizard Y helps to break through Celesteela, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn, while Tyranitar can deal heavy damage to bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia and Necrozma that otherwise wall Deoxys-A. In terms of single moves, Deoxys-A enjoys Tailwind support to outspeed faster attackers, such as Choice Scarf users or weather sweepers, which it otherwise struggles against, though a weather setter such as Mega Charizard Y or Alolan Ninetales could potentially fulfill this role by removing Speed boosts from opposing weather sweepers like Excadrill and Kingdra. Finally, Stealth Rock is always a boon for fast sweepers like Deoxys-A: its ability to break Focus Sashes gives foes fewer chances to survive and retaliate against Deoxys-A's powerful attacks, while the mere chip damage it provides can be key on certain targets, such as Heatran and Kyurem-B, which are chipped into range of Superpower and Terrain-boosted Psycho Boost, respectively.</p> "

Ice Beam hits targets that evade or shrug off Earth Power; namely, Flying-types like Landorus-T and Mega Salamence as well as Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu. Icy Wind, on the other hand, is weaker than Ice Beam but provides the team with speed control. Recover increases Gastrodon's longevity, allowing it to do its job for a longer amount of time. Protect helps scout opposing moves and survive a strong attack or a double target. Toxic is an option over Protect that allows Gastrodon to cripple bulky Pokemon like Porygon2, opposing Gastrodon, and Cresselia.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Wiki Berry heals Gastrodon for half of its maximum HP when it's severely weakened. Groundium Z reduces Gastrodon's passivity at the cost of Berry recovery by providing it with a strong one-time nuke. Using Groundium Z also makes it even easier to switch in on Incineroar, which cannot punish such sets with Knock Off. Storm Drain is necessary for redirecting opposing Water-type moves and potentially increasing Gastrodon's Special Attack, making it less passive. 236 EVs in HP, 152 EVs in Defense, 84 EVs in Special Defense, and a Relaxed nature ensure that Gastrodon will survive Landorus-T's Tectonic Rage and two standard Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beams. The leftover EVs are dumped in Special Attack. Minimized Speed is used to have a better matchup against Trick Room. If using Groundium Z, Gastrodon can move 20 EVs from Defense to Special Attack and run a Quiet nature to OHKO standard Incineroar with Tectonic Rage while still surviving two Choice Band Zygarde's Thousand Arrows.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You can switch Gastrodon in on a predicted Water-type attack to possibly get a Special Attack boost. Be careful if there is a Grass-type like Tapu Bulu or Kartana or just a strong Pokemon like Tapu Lele or Dragon Dance Zygarde on the field, however. Keeping Gastrodon on the field alongside Pokemon weak to Water-type attacks like Incineroar and Diancie is a smart idea too, but note that Storm Drain redirects only single-target attacks, so Gastrodon's teammate still will be vulnerable to spread moves like Muddy Water. Use Recover proactively to keep Gastrodon out of the range of attacks like Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam and Tapu Lele's Psychic. Avoid status, namely Toxic, and carefully play around possible Toxic users like Porygon2 and Chansey.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon weak to Water-type attacks like Victini and Diancie enjoy Water-type moves being redirected by Gastrodon. Fire-types like Incineroar, Volcarona, and the aforementioned Victini are especially notable teammates, as they appreciate Gastrodon's Storm Drain and threaten Grass-types in return. Gastrodon handles Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric well, so Pokemon that have trouble dealing with them like Mega Salamence and Zapdos enjoy having Gastrodon as a teammate. In return, they can beat Grass-types like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Amoonguss. Thanks to its low Speed, Gastrodon can even find a place on some Trick Room teams. It synergizes well with attackers like Diancie and Mega Camerupt because they are able to either lure Water-type moves for Gastrodon or deal with Grass-types.</p> "

Further, the option to choose between Levitate and Heatproof complements this, as Bronzong can choose one of two major weaknesses to mitigate. That said, weaknesses to Fire-types like Volcanion and Mega Charizard Y, as well as to Dark-types like Incineroar, don't do favors for its longevity given their popularity. Similar can be said for the ever-present Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko, which are able to prevent the use of Hypnosis against grounded targets.

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room grants Bronzong and its slow teammates speed control by reversing the turn order. Gyro Ball is often Bronzong's strongest STAB move, being mostly chosen as a means of dealing good neutral damage against fast foes, but it notably allows Bronzong to OHKO Tapu Lele. Hypnosis sends the foe to sleep and, while usually inaccurate, is aided by the accuracy boost gained from Z-Trick Room. It allows Bronzong to put pressure on the opponent by shutting down key threats. Protect allows Bronzong to shield itself while an ally KOes a threat or switches into a more appropriate partner, such as a Trick Room sweeper. Stealth Rock can be used over Protect to give Bronzong another opportunity to be productive and punish the defensive switches that usually accompany Trick Room counterplay.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Psychium Z allows for the use of Z-Trick Room, which boosts accuracy, notably making Hypnosis 80% accurate. Heatproof is the primary ability thanks to it granting a 50% reduction in Fire damage, which is valuable given the prevalence of Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Incineroar. That said, Levitate can also be useful if immunity to the STAB moves of Ground-type attackers such as Landorus-T is preferred. Keep in mind, however, that this will not shield Bronzong from Zygarde's Thousand Arrows. The EVs prevent Mega Charizard Y's Overheat in Sun from OHKOing Heatproof Bronzong, with the remaining EVs dumped into Defense. If Bronzong is using Levitate instead, a spread of 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD and a Sassy Nature should be used to ensure Bronzong's ability to take Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave in Sun. Speed is minimized to move quicker under Trick Room and to increase Gyro Ball's Speed-dependent damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's recommended that Bronzong be put in the lead position to be able to set Trick Room as soon as possible and to provide an easy way for it to get onto the field with the proper support. Such support comes in the form of Fake Out, redirection such as Rage Powder, and Intimidate, each of which improves its chances of successfully using Trick Room. Don't be overly concerned about Taunt on the first turn, as Z-Trick Room bypasses Taunt. After Trick Room is set up, your goal should be to bring out the Trick Room sweeper with the highest damage output to make use of it, using Hypnosis to provide safer opportunities for them to switch in where necessary.</p> <p>Bronzong's Hypnosis putting pressure onto your opponent makes it a priority target, particularly given the accuracy loss associated with switching, so taking countermeasures such as keeping Tapu Bulu or Tapu Lele in the back to remove Electric and Misty Terrain is reasonable. That said, Hypnosis's accuracy still isn't perfect after an accuracy boost, so avoid putting yourself into situations where it missing will cost you the battle. If you think Bronzong can set Trick Room again in the late-game and don't immediately require the benefits that Z-Trick Room grants, you may opt to save it for later in the match. When you do so, avoid switching Bronzong back in directly to attacks, as it lacks a form of recovery and needs all the bulk it can to maximize its chances of setting up Trick Room again.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In order to make proper use of Hypnosis, Electric Terrain and Misty Terrain must be kept off the field, making Tapu Bulu an almost mandatory partner. It reducing the damage of Ground-type attacks and providing recovery, which Bronzong otherwise lacks, are nice bonuses as well. Tapu Lele can equally remove Electric and Misty Terrain, should you prefer it, though it has less natural synergy with Bronzong. Support to aid Bronzong in setting up Trick Room is also essential to ensure this occurs successfully. Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Scrafty are prime candidates for this, as they can cause flinches against the foe most hindersome to Trick Room's setup. Scrafty can also eliminate Dark-types in addition to softening physical blows through Intimidate. Redirection from users such as Rage Powder Amoonguss can provide another means of more safely setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>On dedicated Trick Room teams, having at least one more Trick Room setter is often important to ensure the field condition remains active for the entire match. Trick Room Diancie and Stakataka are a good partners for Levitate Bronzong, as they can threaten Fire-types and enjoy having a Ground-type switch-in. The high damage output of spread attackers like Diancie is also great for capitalizing off Trick Room's limited turns. Mega Camerupt is an excellent example of this, and it also does a good job at handling Fire-types with Earth Power. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T also deal spread damage, eliminating threatening Fire-types quite freely alongside Levitate Bronzong thanks to its Ground immunity. Landorus-T can also pivot out with U-turn on the turn Trick Room is used to bring out a more appropriate sweeper and, like Scrafty, can Intimidate both foes.</p> "

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Abomasnow is a powerful wallbreaker when paired with a dedicated Trick Room team. Its low base Speed and solid base stats across the board allow it to take advantage the decent offensive coverage provided to it by its Ice / Grass typing. In addition, Abomasnow outslows and strongly damages Amoonguss, which can otherwise be annoying to many Trick Room teams. However, Abomasnow’s STAB coverage leaves it completely walled by Steel- and Fire-types like Mega Metagross and Incineroar, and such threats are nearly guaranteed to be on every team. For an archetype like Trick Room where taking advantage of limited turns is essential for success, being walled by various threats makes Abomasnow a fairly niche pick. Additionally, a Grass / Ice typing leaves Abomasnow with seven weaknesses, including a crippling weakness to incredibly common Fire-type moves. As a result, Abomasnow needs Trick Room up, because otherwise it's quite likely that a foe will be able to take advantage of its low Speed and hit it with a super effective attack.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Energy Ball is usable in place of Giga Drain for more power, if you're willing to give up the recovery provided by Giga Drain. However, Energy Ball doesn't hit any noteworthy offensive benchmarks. Wood Hammer is usable as a physical STAB option that deals more reliable damage to Water- and Rock-types with high Special Defense, such as Tapu Fini and Tyranitar. Soundproof is a niche pre-Mega ability that makes Abomasnow a decent Mega Gardevoir switch-in and, far more riskily, a switch-in to Mega Salamence's Hyper Voice or Kommo-o's Clangorous Soulblaze to prevent it from receiving the boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Abomasnow has a crippling 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks and thus drops to all but the weakest of them. Many Fire-type Pokemon like Incineroar, Volcarona, and Victini resist both of Mega Abomasnow's STAB attacks and threaten to OHKO it in return. Additionally, Abomasnow has to fear Fire-type coverage from threats it would otherwise match up decently against, such as Zapdos, Kommo-o, and Mega Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Aegislash, Genesect, and Mega Scizor completely wall Abomasnow and threaten to hit back with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Scrafty is a slow and bulky Fighting-type that doesn't mind taking a hit from Abomasnow inside of Trick Room and retaliating with either Drain Punch or Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Despite being a Rock-type, Tyranitar has enough bulk to comfortably absorb a Giga Drain and retaliate with strong Rock attacks. However, physical or mixed variants of Mega Abomasnow can OHKO Tyranitar first with Wood Hammer under Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Outside of Trick Room, Mega Abomasnow's rock-bottom Speed tier forces it to withstand attacks before it gets the chance to move. Its low speed and defensively poor Grass / Ice typing make it vulnerable to a myriad of faster attackers ranging from Mega Salamence and Mega Metagross to Genesect and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: When hail isn't active, Blizzard only has a 70% chance of hitting each target. Mega Charizard Y, Tyranitar, and Pelipper can all threaten Abomasnow with super effective STAB moves as well, although in the right situations Mega Abomasnow can KO Tyranitar and Pelipper first with strong Grass-type attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blizzard is Mega Abomasnow's main STAB attack, which provides powerful spread coverage and is perfectly accurate in hail. Giga Drain is a secondary STAB attack that allows Mega Abomasnow to beat Water-types, such as Tapu Fini and Gastrodon, while also providing health recovery. In a pinch, Ice Shard lets Mega Abomasnow snipe down a weakened target, notably Zygarde or Landorus-T, outside of Trick Room. Hidden Power Fire is another option to lure and hit Steel-types like Genesect, Mega Metagross, and Mega Scizor for super effective damage. Protect allows Abomasnow to stall out a turn while its partner deals with anything threatening, and it is also useful for keeping Abomasnow safe while its teammate sets Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread maximizes bulk and power behind Blizzard, with the remaining 4 EVs dumped into Attack to power up Ice Shard. A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs allows Mega Abomasnow to move as fast as possible inside of Trick Room. Snow Warning is the preferred pre-Mega ability, as it gives Abomasnow two chances to set hail against opposing weather teams before being forced to switch out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Abomasnow is typically most effective as a mid-game sweeper, being sent in to attack after Trick Room has been set up. You should typically wait until you have a safe switch to bring in Abomasnow; in many cases, this means waiting until a teammate faints before you bring it in. Abomasnow is quite frail in comparison to Mega Abomasnow and shares its large number of weaknesses. In some situations, however, it makes sense to lead with Abomasnow to set hail early on. For example, if you expect your opponent to lead with a frail Focus Sash holder like Deoxys-A, leading with Abomasnow pressures these Pokemon to switch out or risk incurring chip damage from Hail. If they don't switch out, Abomasnow can also snipe them down on the following turn with Ice Shard. With an immunity to powder moves and access to strong Ice STAB, Abomasnow makes a decent answer to Amoonguss, a Pokemon that otherwise troubles Trick Room teams when Misty or Electric Terrain isn't activated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters like Porygon2, Bronzong, and Diancie are necessary to unlock Mega Abomasnow's full potential, since its low speed severely hinders it outside of Trick Room. Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcanion have fantastic synergy with Abomasnow, clearing out the Steel-types that Abomasnow doesn't want to deal with. In return, Abomasnow helps deal with opposing Water-types like Tapu Fini and Suicune and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde. Tapu Fini or Tapu Lele are the preferred Island Guardians to pair with Mega Abomasnow; Tapu Bulu, while an option for powering up Grass-type attacks, shares many common weaknesses with Abomasnow, while Tapu Koko's high Speed tier makes it awkward on most Trick Room teams that Mega Abomasnow would find itself on. Tapu Fini has particularly fantastic type synergy with Abomasnow, dealing with Fire-types like Incineroar, which Abomasnow can't stand.</p> "

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss is the sole viable user of Follow Me in the DOU metagame, matching the move's utility with solid bulk and a strong supporting movepool including Tailwind, giving it further access to speed control. Unlike other supportive Tailwind setters, Togekiss can further leverage on its own Tailwind through Air Slash, which lets it generate free turns for its allies through the move's better-than-even flinch odds due to Serene Grace. Despite this niche, however, it generally lacks a solid offensive presence on the field, causing it to face competition from other redirection users such as Amoonguss and other Tailwind setters like Zapdos. Furthermore, its typing, though useful for its Ground-type immunity, gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, which severely impedes its ability to withstand moderately strong attacks like Zapdos's Thunderbolt.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Apart from the five moves listed above, Togekiss doesn't have a lot of other viable options, as its viable role in the DOU metagame is generally quite narrow and well-defined. Togekiss can, for instance, channel some degree of offensive presence through its partner by using Helping Hand, though this is contingent on its teammate's positioning on the field. It also has access to Roost to increase its longevity, but it generally gets more value out of using its free turns to fish for flinches with Air Slash. Fire Blast is another offensive option that lets Togekiss guarantee an OHKO on Mega Scizor, Genesect, and Kartana, as well as a 2HKO on Mega Metagross. However, it does insignificant amounts of damage to most other targets. Similarly, Togekiss doesn't have much choice of viable items—it could further boost its synergy with Tapu Bulu by holding a Grassy Seed, allowing it to run a little more Special Defense or Speed EVs and widening the range of threats it can stand up to while maintaining its physically defensive benchmarks, but this perk is usually outclassed by the general bulk that Wiki Berry offers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and Stakataka can both deal a lot of damage to Togekiss with their Rock-type STAB attacks while not taking much damage from Air Slash. Additionally, Tyranitar can set up Dragon Dance in front of Togekiss as long as it isn't hit by an Encore, while Stakataka can set up Trick Room to turn Togekiss's Tailwind from an asset to a liability.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko and Zapdos can both deal heavy damage to Togekiss with a STAB-boosted Thunderbolt, especially Tapu Koko, which threatens an OHKO if it's holding a Life Orb. Additionally, Tapu Koko sometimes carries Taunt, which shuts down Togekiss's support capabilities, while Zapdos can match Togekiss's Tailwind with its own. Finally, both resist Air Slash and take little damage from it, especially Zapdos, which can take advantage of Togekiss's passive presence to more easily use Roost to heal itself.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela can all threaten Togekiss with strong Steel-type attacks. However, Togekiss can uncommonly carry Fire Blast, so slower Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn may want to be wary of it.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock lowers Togekiss's HP by 25% every time it switches in, making it more vulnerable to stronger attacks and leaving its defensive benchmarks useless, as well as curtailing its flexibility in switching in and out and preventing it from being used consistently throughout a game.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B has strong Ice-type STAB attacks and can 2HKO Togekiss with Ice Beam or OHKO it with an Electric Terrain-boosted Fusion Bolt or simply a Subzero Slammer. It can also use Icy Wind to get around Follow Me and generally shrugs off damage from Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Despite its status as one of the more offensive redirection users, Togekiss is still heavily reliant on its support moves and is thus significantly hampered by Taunt. Taunt can therefore exacerbate negative matchups for Togekiss when seen on a common user such as Tapu Koko, which already threatens Togekiss.</p> ",

        "name": "Follow Me Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's STAB attack of choice, taking advantage of its ability of Serene Grace to have a 60% chance to induce flinching on any slower foe it hits. In terms of its supportive options, Follow Me gives Togekiss the opportunity to protect its partner for a turn, allowing it to attack or set up safely; this support is compounded by Tailwind primarily to allow Togekiss's partner to outrun key threats and more comfortably land attacks. Togekiss can also use Encore to prevent foes from taking advantage of Togekiss's relatively passive nature, locking them into moves such as Protect, Fake Out, and a setup move, forcing them to choose between switching out or staying in and losing momentum. Due to the nature of Togekiss's redirection role, it tends to become a valuable target for opposing attacks and can thus use Protect as a means to take advantage of the double targets it will inevitably draw.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given set grants Togekiss well-rounded defensive abilities, giving it more consistency as a Tailwind setter. The listed HP and Defense EVs let it survive one Iron Head from Mega Metagross, while its Speed investment allows it to outrun Mega Manectric and anything slower under Tailwind, letting it make better use of Air Slash's high flinch rates. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to increase Togekiss's longevity and are more than enough to let Togekiss survive one non-Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt from Tapu Koko. The Wiki Berry takes advantage of Togekiss's tendency to barely survive stronger attacks, as Togekiss can thus consistently fall below 25% of its maximum HP to activate it. From a more offensive standpoint, Serene Grace is used to give Air Slash a 60% flinch chance on a slower foe provided it hits, which works well in conjunction with Togekiss's previously mentioned slight investment in Speed EVs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Togekiss's goal is generally to help support its partner and team with Follow Me and Tailwind; as such, its role is generally very straightforward. While Follow Me is extremely convenient for an ally to set up or attack without having to take any single-target attacks, keep in mind that Togekiss is not invincible. Though Togekiss is bulky, it can still be hit for significant amounts of damage quite easily due to its key weaknesses to Poison- and Electric-type moves like Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt. Therefore, it's important to be careful when using Follow Me if a foe directly threatens a KO on Togekiss; one should always weigh the costs and benefits of having Togekiss stomach one or two attacks in a turn. Tailwind, on the other hand, has more general applications, allowing Togekiss and its ally to outspeed foes to more easily launch attacks without first having to stomach incoming attacks. In Togekiss's case, this also allows it to take advantage of Air Slash's high flinch rate; however, do keep in mind that Air Slash is not guaranteed to land a flinch, so do not play it as such and always prepare for the scenario in which it does not. Tailwind also lets Togekiss make better use of Encore, should it be running the move, as more often than not Tailwind allows the Togekiss player to be certain of what move they are locking the foe into. Additionally, the presence of Encore forces opponents to think twice before they use Protect to attempt to stall out Tailwind turns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to its ability to fairly consistently allow its ally a free turn, Togekiss is best used alongside setup users that are capable of getting a significant return out of that free turn, such as Kommo-o with Clangorous Soulblaze and Zygarde with Dragon Dance. Additionally, both can cover several significant threats to Togekiss—Kommo-o can threaten Kyurem-B with Clangorous Soulblaze and OHKO Ferrothorn after a boost, while Zygarde's Thousand Arrows threatens Steel- and Electric-types like Mega Metagross and Tapu Koko, especially after a Dragon Dance. Togekiss is also capable of threatening Tapu Bulu with Air Slash, which is otherwise a big roadblock for Zygarde. Do note, however, that both Kommo-o and Zygarde share an Ice-type weakness with Togekiss, so keep this in mind when redirecting potential Ice-type attacks from either one.</p> <p>Togekiss also has a place next to hard-hitting mid-speed threats such as Volcanion, Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, and offensive Kyurem-B, all of which are extremely powerful but are barely outsped by key threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Metagross. Hence, each of these allies would appreciate Togekiss's Tailwind, allowing them to instead outspeed and OHKO their erstwhile threats. Of the three, Landorus-T additionally has Intimidate, which allows Togekiss to more easily take hits while redirecting, while Volcanion can help deal with Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Metagross, which otherwise threaten Togekiss. Tapu Bulu has especially interesting synergy with Togekiss, as Togekiss's redirection enables Tapu Bulu to set up a Swords Dance to become extremely threatening, and Togekiss is the only viable redirector capable of dealing with Amoonguss not only by being able to redirect its Poison-type attacks but also by having access to super effective Air Slash with which to hit it.</p> "

It's perhaps most well known for the flinches it threatens through its use of Serene Grace Air Slash; the fear of these flinches alone can heavily limit opposing teams' options, and when Air Slash actually does cause flinches, the opponent's plans can be disrupted and subverted in an instant. Seed Flare is the icing on the cake, with a chance to drop foes' Special Defense stats and thus boost teammates' damage output to snowball a lead; Shaymin-S can even use these stat drops to get around Pokemon that resist its attacks by lowering their Special Defense to a point where type advantage no longer matters.</p> <p>Despite Shaymin-S's decent defensive stats, its poor defensive typing heavily hurts its ability to remain on the field for extended periods of time, and most strong attacks can OHKO it if it's without a Focus Sash; that in combination with its poor STAB coverage, which leaves it walled by many common threats, means Shaymin-S's presence on the field is unfortunately rather easily curtailed by a large variety of threats.</p> ",

Life Orb, for example, grants Shaymin-S a 30% boost to its damage output, shifting some of its 2HKOs to OHKOs on Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko, while its natural bulk still allows it to avoid being KOed by most neutral and resisted hits. Another item choice is Groundium Z, which allows Shaymin-S to catch Mega Metagross off guard and OHKO it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Setting up Trick Room or Tailwind against Shaymin-S causes it to lose its most important advantage, which is its ability to usually move first. Given its mediocre bulk, it has difficulty outlasting Trick Room or Tailwind turns, while Trick Room setters such as Bronzong and Cresselia and Tailwind setters like Zapdos have a fairly easy time setting up against Shaymin-S as long as they're not caused to flinch by Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Bulkier Electric-types discourage the use of Shaymin-S's most common STAB move in Air Slash by merit of resisting it. The best example of this is Zapdos, which can completely wall any Shaymin-S variant and even retaliate by setting up a Tailwind to remove Shaymin-S's Speed advantage. Tapu Koko is another good check to Shaymin-S, as it has the ability to take an Air Slash, outspeed Shaymin-S, and hit it with a potential Hidden Power Ice or simply a Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many Steel-types can take Shaymin-S on fairly comfortably, as they resist both of its main STAB moves; Levitate Bronzong and Celesteela are also immune to Earth Power, while Aegislash and Mega Metagross can typically take one Earth Power fairly comfortably. Either way, each of these Pokemon can retaliate offensively, breaking Shaymin-S's Focus Sash so a more offensively oriented teammate can get the KO later in the game.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: If Pokemon faster than Shaymin-S are on the field, it's hard to effectively use Shaymin-S, as its lack of bulk leaves it vulnerable to a simple attack from these threats. For example, Tapu Koko, by merit of its Electric typing, can switch in on an Air Slash and KO Shaymin-S with a Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Charizard Y poses a huge offensive threat to Shaymin-S in the form of its sun-boosted Fire-type STAB moves, and unlike most Fire-types, it is immune to Shaymin-S's potential Ground-type coverage and has a sizeable Special Defense stat, which allows it to take Air Slashes relatively well. Mega Charizard Y can also set up a Tailwind for its own team, which would leave Shaymin-S vulnerable to an even wider array of attacks.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Opposing sand and rain setters can activate Sand Rush and Swift Swim respectively, allowing Shaymin-S to be outrun by a number of foes such as Excadrill, Kingdra, and Ludicolo, causing it to lose out on one of its most valuable advantages in battle—its capacity to move before foes. Hail and sand can also break Shaymin-S's Focus Sash, thereby curtailing its ability to stay on the field.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Unlike many other glass cannons like Deoxys-A and Pheromosa, Shaymin-S is part Flying-type and is therefore unable to draw upon Psychic Terrain in order to protect itself from priority. Thus, it must be wary of potential priority moves from the opposing team such as Extreme Speed from Zygarde, particularly if it has few HP remaining.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's most powerful attack, providing heavy damage output with an 80% chance to lower a target's Special Defense by two stages if it connects; however, it is resisted by many viable Pokemon in DOU. Air Slash makes up for this inherent type disadvantage somewhat, allowing for wider coverage and playing a mildly supportive role, as Shaymin-S's teammates are granted more free turns by virtue of Air Slash's high chance to cause opponents to flinch. While the use of Tailwind is often left to more dedicated support Pokemon, Shaymin-S's ability to force switches by merit of its fearsome offensive prowess affords it turns to set up Tailwind, to which more passive options like Zapdos may not have access. Protect is essential on a Pokemon as frail as Shaymin-S, especially since its threatening presence on the field can draw a lot of double targets from frustrated opponents aiming to remove Shaymin-S before it wreaks further havoc upon their teams. Earth Power can be used to round out Shaymin-S's coverage and allow it to hit many of the Steel-types that would otherwise wall it completely, such as Mega Metagross and Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set sports a simple EV spread aiming to optimize the degree of offensive pressure Shaymin-S can exert by maximizing both its Special Attack and its Speed stats, letting it hard and fast. A Timid nature is used here, as it is necessary to outspeed Mega Salamence, which is a prominent threat in the DOU metagame and especially to Shaymin-S. Focus Sash is the item of choice because it allows Shaymin-S to survive a hit, making up for its poor defensive typing and lack of bulk investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In a format as fast-paced as DOU, it is almost never safe to switch Shaymin-S in in the middle of a turn. Rather, it should be played cautiously, being brought into the field after a teammate has been KOed or on the back of a slow U-turn. Even simple annoyances like sand and hail may have to be avoided, as their side effect of breaking Shaymin-S's Focus Sash is extremely detrimental to the time Shaymin-S can spend on the field, and hence the amount of work Shaymin-S can carry out in a game.</p> <p>Once Shaymin-S is safely on the field, it should ideally be played like the offensive Pokemon it is, as its mere presence can force switches and allow it to get damage off on opposing teams easily. Furthermore, the more attacks Shaymin-S lands, the more chances these attacks have to activate their secondary effects to disrupt the opposing team. For example, though obviously not completely reliable, Air Slash has a 57% chance of connecting with and causing a given foe to flinch, and it can be extremely helpful in allowing allies to switch in and out or set up Substitutes and boosting moves safely. Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's other STAB move, carrying with it a 68% chance of a Special Defense drop; since Shaymin-S is likely to be faster the rest of its own teammates, Seed Flare can be used to attempt to set up a KO by a partner, though the chance of a Special Defense drop should not be taken for granted.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shaymin-S's STAB combination leaves it easily walled by common presences in DOU, most notably bulky Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor. It's thus unsurprising that Fire-types and Ground-types make extremely good teammates for Shaymin-S, as they are able to easily threaten KOs on the Steel-types that neuter Shaymin-S's offensive presence; good examples include Volcanion, Mega Charizard Y, Landorus-T, and Zygarde. The most common threat to Shaymin-S's offensive prowess comes in the form of Zapdos, which is capable of resisting Shaymin-S's STAB combination as well as setting a Tailwind in retaliation. A good way to combat this threat involves the use of strong Ice- or Rock-type attacks, preferably boosted by STAB; Kyurem-B, Tyranitar, and Nihilego all perform this role admirably, while a strong Z-Move user such as Psychium Z Tapu Lele or Electrium Z Tapu Koko can also be used to quickly OHKO most unboosted Zapdos.</p> <p>On the other hand, Shaymin-S can lend support to its teammates through the secondary effects on both of its main STAB moves. Threats with moderate Speed, such as Heatran and non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, appreciate flinches caused by Air Slash and the speed control provided by Tailwind, while special attackers can take advantage of the Special Defense drops caused by Seed Flare. Setup sweepers, especially slower-paced ones such as Zygarde and Tapu Fini, can leverage on switches caused by Shaymin-S's offensive presence as well as free turns afforded by Air Slash flinches in order to use their respective setup moves a few times.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini finds a unique niche in the Doubles OU metagame thanks to the vast utility provided by its unique moveset and all-around solid stats. Sporting an almost-exclusive combination of Fire and Psychic typing, Victini is easily able to switch into and check prominent metagame threats like Kartana and Mega Metagross. Moreover, its coveted access to both Glaciate and Incinerate allow Victini to support its team in a wide variety of ways. As a Fire-type, Victini is naturally walled by every common Water-type as well as the omnipresent Incineroar, but Victini can easily pivot out of tough matchups or turn its focus to its less damage-oriented roles when facing these threats. In addition, Victini can quite successfully run a Choice Scarf set thanks to its high Speed and access to Final Gambit, which can often take out a problematic enemy in one hit at the cost of its own life.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Energy Ball can be used over Incinerate on the bulky set to provide coverage against Gastrodon and Tapu Fini. An offensive Trick Room set provides an archetype that typically struggles with Amoonguss a strong offensive answer, though it’s left wholly walled by one of the most commonly-used Pokemon in Incineroar. Choice Scarf sets could use Trick to cripple bulky Pokemon that would otherwise sit in front of it fairly safely like Porygon2 or Cresselia. Normalium Z Celebrate sets take advantage of the Z-Move’s omniboosting effect and can work well with spread damage in Heat Wave and a powerful Stored Power; however, they’re typically too weak to get through common Pokemon like Landorus-T and have generally poor coverage. Access to Final Gambit also offers Victini the potential for a strong Fighting-type Z-Final Gambit that can nab a surprise KO on Incineroar and Tyranitar, two of its erstwhile most effective checks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Victini has no way to significantly damage the common bulky Water-types in the tier, and Milotic can take advantage of Glaciate to get a Competitive boost. Despite having access to Bolt Strike, Choice Scarf Victini also has issues beating the most common Water-types in the format, such as Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Volcanion, as it simply can't hit hard enough. Choice Scarf sets are also outrun and OHKOed by Swift Swim Kingdra, leaving Victini with no possible options for retaliation. They should be wary of switching into a Final Gambit, however, which easily OHKOes most of the tier's common Water-types.</p> <p><strong>Incineroar: Incineroar's typing and defenses make it an easy answer to any Victini set, often taking even a healthy Victini's Final Gambit. In addition, its Intimidate, access to Knock Off, and ability to chip away at Victini's health with Fake Out can all cripple Victini.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar makes a strong switch-in to all Victini's moves and also activates a sandstorm as it switches in, slowly whittling away Victini's HP and potentially neutering the power of Final Gambit in the process.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control</strong>: Since Choice Scarf Victini relies heavily on moving first to effectively conduct Final Gambit trades and hit with fast and strong V-creates, it struggles against teams that manage to get Trick Room or Tailwind up. Diancie and Porygon2 easily set Trick Room in Victini's face, while Suicune and Mega Salamence can reliably use Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Assault Vest Victini relies on being healthy and pivoting often to do its job effectively and Choice Scarf sets need their HP to keep the power of Final Gambit. Stealth Rock removing 25% of its health on each switchin greatly inhibits this, and common setters such as Landorus-T and Tyranitar also threaten Victini with super effective STAB moves.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Supportive Victini has a pretty straightforward moveset with little need for variation. An attack like Blue Flare should be used at any given opportunity, and Assault Vest Victini is no exception. Victini is one of three Pokemon with access to Glaciate, which is essentially just a stronger Icy Wind. This allows Victini to provide its team with valuable speed control while also hitting the various Ice-weak Pokemon of the format, such as Landorus-T and Zygarde, for significant damage. U-turn lets Victini function as an effective pivot. Incinerate may seem like an odd choice at first, but it has incredible utility in a metagame full of Berries such as Sitrus and the various pinch Berries like Mago and Wiki. If Victini is instead holding an Iapapa Berry, it may opt for Protect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with the given Speed EVs allows Victini to outspeed all Deoxys-A after one Glaciate. 96 HP and 128 Special Defense EVs ensure that Assault Vest Victini will always survive two Earth Powers from standard bulky Landorus-T, which packs a Modest nature and 176 Special Attack EVs. Even without an Assault Vest, this spread allows Victini to take one Earth Power after taking Stealth Rock damage. As a consequence, Victini will always survive a Choice Band-boosted Thousand Arrows from Zygarde and almost always take two Stomping Tantrums from -1 Mega Metagross. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack, which allows Victini to 2HKO the standard 252 HP / 28 SpD Landorus-T with Glaciate. With an Iapapa Berry equipped, Victini can receive a boost of recovery when it’s chipped low, also opening the door to run Protect and lessen the harm Stealth Rock can inflict.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Victini wants to come in on weak special attacks and use Glaciate once or twice before pivoting to a teammate that can effectively take advantage of the opponent's reduced Speed. If facing down Pokemon that typically hold a Berry, Incinerate is a great option for effectively removing a big chunk of their overall health. While it won't be scoring many KOs on its own, Blue Flare has acceptable damage output at worst and can allow Victini to prime opposing Pokemon for knockouts at the hands of its partners. Victini's nearly unique typing and above average bulk allow it to function as a very effective pivot into some very common Pokemon in the tier, such as Kartana and Kyurem-B. However, Victini's typing also burdens it with a weakness to such common attacks in Doubles OU as Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Knock Off, the last of which gets a special mention for removing Victini's important Assault Vest. That said, you must be selective about when to let Victini take the field; if it comes in at the wrong time, it can be crippled for the remainder of the game and lose most of its usefulness. In a similar vein, you must also be careful about letting Victini take Stealth Rock damage. Victini can still do its job from 75% of its health most of the time, but losing a quarter of its health multiple times severely hampers its staying power. Finally, Victini users must be very careful when facing Incineroar, which will take very little damage from any of Victini's attacks and can essentially switch into Victini for free and threaten with a powerful Knock Off. This means that it can be advantageous to use U-turn much more aggressively before opposing Incineroar are knocked out in order to prevent giving it a free turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are naturally fast enough to take advantage of Glaciate Speed drops are great partners for Victini. While this pool of Pokemon is slightly narrower than that of other methods of speed control like Tailwind, there is still a wide selection of effective beneficiaries, such as Mega Metagross and Kyurem-B. Mega Metagross specifically can benefit a lot from having Assault Vest Victini as a partner, since it appreciates Victini's ability to roast troublesome Steel-types—just be careful about stacking Ground-type weaknesses. Pokemon weak to Grass-type attacks are also great partners for Victini, as Victini firmly handles the most common Grass-types in the tier, Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Thus, Victini is often seen with Tapu Fini, and the two create a strong core both offensively and defensively. Calm Mind Tapu Fini benefits from Glaciate, chip damage, Berry removal, and the elimination of one of its biggest checks in Kartana, while defensive Tapu Fini can keep Victini healthy with Heal Pulse. Grass-types make great partners for Victini due to their ability to check opposing Water-types like Tapu Fini and Milotic. Tapu Fini specifically can come in pretty easily on Victini and start setting up Calm Minds, so Pokemon like Kartana and Tapu Bulu can help to keep opposing Tapu Fini at bay. Both of these Pokemon also offer offensive options against Incineroar with their Fighting-type coverage moves, while Tapu Bulu is a very reliable switch-in to Ground-type Pokemon like Zygarde and Landorus-T. Victini also partners well with Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Mega Manectric for a few reasons. Both of these Pokemon form a powerful pivoting core with Victini thanks to U-turn and Volt Switch while covering for Victini's uninvested Defense. Mega Manectric and Victini cast a wide net with their type coverage, always combining for Electric + Fire + Ice attacks between the two regardless of Mega Manectric's moveset. Mega Manectric's Snarl can also augment Victini's ability to sponge special attacks. Landorus-T, on the other hand, gets a special mention for its Ground-type immunity and ability to check Incineroar quite effectively. Mega Manectric and Landorus-T also both help offensively check Volcanion, which is one of Victini's best counters. Finally, Incineroar checks are mandatory on teams that carry Victini. A few previously mentioned Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Landorus-T fill this role well, but other Pokemon like Zygarde or Diancie take little damage from Incineroar's attacks and can fire back with powerful STAB moves.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Final Gambit allows Victini to easily trade itself for the removal of a crucial attacker or pivot from an opposing team, generally without much counterplay. V-create is an alternate source of damage that doesn't sacrifice Victini, but unfortunately, it lowers Victini's defenses and Speed, leaving it vulnerable to damage that could lower Final Gambit's effective power or even outright KO Victini. Bolt Strike acts as a strong coverage move to hit Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Volcanion, while U-turn rounds out the set, allowing Victini to easily pivot out of unfavorable situations.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread focuses on allowing Victini to effectively use Final Gambit: the HP investment gives Victini the same HP stat as fully invested Zapdos, and equivalently other base 90 HP foes, allowing Victini to OHKO it with Final Gambit. Meanwhile, its Speed is maximized to allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect to threaten it with a V-create. The remaining EVs are invested into Attack to get the most damage out of its other moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Victini is most effectively used as a lead, with the capacity to efficiently trade itself for a key threat on the opposing side or to U-turn out if no viable target presents itself. However, if it doesn't trade itself off early-game, it should be played cautiously later on—generally, one should keep Victini's health high in order to preserve its damage output from Final Gambit, so it should be brought into play primarily off free switches or off the back of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. In the same vein, Victini should generally be played to avoid chip damage from Stealth Rock or priority moves like Fake Out and Zygarde's Extreme Speed; though these might seem like sources of insignificant chip damage, Victini needs to be near or at full health in order to OHKO some of its key targets, including Zapdos and Landorus-T, with Final Gambit. Furthermore, when using its non-Final Gambit moves, Victini should be going for guaranteed KOs, since it doesn't want to risk taking unnecessary damage and hamper its Final Gambit damage. Finally, when using V-create, one should be wary of the stat drops the move causes, especially the Speed drop, which nullifies the Choice Scarf boost and may force Victini to leave the field and return later before it can pose a significant threat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini's best use is alongside an ally that needs to set up in some way, as it helps to alleviate the offensive pressure exerted on its partner by removing a key threat on the opposing side with Final Gambit. Good examples of such teammates include Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Zygarde, which can easily get an important boost to chunk teams early-game or clean up late-game. Aurora Veil Alolan Ninetales is a more passive example of a partner that requires this setup opportunity, but it can nonetheless make use of it to ease other teammates' setup, conveniently aided by the free switch Victini creates after fainting from Final Gambit. Similarly, offensive Trick Room setters like Stakataka appreciate Victini as a more permanent solution to their threats, in the form of Final Gambit incapacitating a foe for the remainder of the match instead of just for a single turn. Allies like Tapu Fini that typically struggle with opposing Grass-types will also appreciate Victini's strong Fire-type STAB attacks.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is a fast, threatening attacker with Sand Rush, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under sand. It can also function as a setup sweeper with Swords Dance, which lets it easily punch holes in opposing teams. However, being reliant on sand is a significant flaw considering the prevalence of opposing weather teams in Doubles OU. Also, by nature of being a fast attacker, Excadrill is very susceptible to opposing speed control. On top of all this, it's checked by a number of DOU's top threats such as Landorus-T and Celesteela. Overall, Excadrill performs excellently on sand teams, but otherwise, it shouldn't be used over other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Zygarde.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Excadrill has few other options, since it really can't afford to replace any of its moves. Rock Slide hits select Flying-types like Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y, but giving up Swords Dance is not desirable. It can run Stealth Rock, but again, giving up Swords Dance is a massive pain. In terms of items, Focus Sash adds a little longevity, but the power drop is noticeable. Rapid Spin can be used on teams that necessitate the removal of Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types such as Zygarde and Landorus-T can take a hit and KO Excadrill with a super effective attack. Landorus-T has the added benefits of Intimidate and an immunity to Ground.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Milotic greatly threaten Excadrill. They have to watch out for Swords Dance-boosted Z-Moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types with their immunity to Ground are problematic for Excadrill. Landorus-T and Salamence also have Intimidate on top of this. Celesteela is immune to Excadrill's primary STAB attack and resists the other. It can recover its HP with Leech Seed plus Leftovers and beat Excadrill one-on-one as well. Zapdos can KO Excadrill with its coverage moves and Roost off damage from Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Since Excadrill is pretty reliant on Sand Rush, it doesn't fare well against opposing rain teams. They threaten it with super effective Water-type attacks, while Excadrill can do little in return. Hail and sun are also annoying, but they are overall less threatening because Excadrill and its typical partner Mega Tyranitar can beat Alolan Ninetales, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: By virtue of being a physical attacker, Excadrill is susceptible to Intimidate users. Landorus-T, Incineroar, and Scrafty get special mentions because they can hit it super effectively. However, Excadrill can use Swords Dance to overcome Intimidate drops.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Opposing speed control is very threatening because it takes away one of Excadrill's best attributes: its high Speed. Tailwind users such as Mega Salamence and Zapdos are often immune to its primary STAB attack, and Trick Room is even worse since sand teams are typically pretty fast.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's primary STAB move, which hits both opposing Pokemon for good damage, and it is preferred for its higher damage output when used with Groundium Z. Alternatively, Drill Run can be used to bypass Wide Guard and hit single targets harder. Iron Head hits Ground-immune Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Mega Salamence while also allowing Excadrill to OHKO prominent threats such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B. Swords Dance lets Excadrill turn itself into a dangerous sweeper and overcome Intimidate drops, and Protect is mandatory in order to allow allies to take care of threatening opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread and nature allow Excadrill to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Adamant is preferred to Jolly, since Jolly doesn't hit any relevant benchmarks. Sand Rush lets Excadrill outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under sand. Its other abilities aren't useful because being a fast attacker is Excadrill's only solid niche. Groundium Z is the preferred item, which gives Excadrill a way to hit exceptionally hard and KO bulkier threats such as Tapu Fini. Steelium Z can be used instead to KO select Ground-immune threats, such as Landorus-T. If neither of those items sounds appealing, Life Orb can be used if you value a higher consistent damage output to a one-time use Z-Move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Excadrill is a decent lead to apply pressure early on, although it won't likely want to stay in for too long until its checks have been dealt with. It also works as a great mid- or late-game sweeper due to its high Speed under sand. You should generally avoid setting up Swords Dance until Excadrill's checks have been dealt with. Opposing weather setters should be KOed, as should other checks like Flying-types or Intimidate users. Finally, it's important to make the best use of Excadrill's limited sand turns, so don't use Protect if it's not necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar is an absolutely mandatory teammate for its ability to set sand. The two also have decent synergy together, with Tyranitar checking most of the Flying-types that Excadrill is unable to beat and Excadrill threatening fast attackers that prey on Tyranitar's low Speed. Furthermore, Celesteela checks are mandatory, as Celesteela readily beats both Tyranitar and Excadrill. Electric-types such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko are good partners, with Zapdos providing speed control and a Ground immunity while Tapu Koko provides Terrain control. Fire-types such as Volcanion and Heatran work too.</p> <p>Additional rain checks are recommended, since sand teams naturally struggle versus rain teams. Water-types such as Tapu Fini or Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu are good options. Tapu Fini provides Terrain control, as does Tapu Bulu, while Amoonguss checks Trick Room. Landorus-T is another common Pokemon that both Tyranitar and Excadrill struggle with. Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Ice-types such as Kyurem-B scare it out. Kyurem-B has the added benefit of soft checking rain along with Flying-types.</p> "

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting access to the rare combination of Fake Out and Intimidate, Scrafty finds itself a niche as a very effective utility Pokemon. Scrafty's above-average bulk and unique typing, combined with the aforementioned Intimidate, allow it to switch into multiple threats in Doubles OU, such as Zygarde and Tyranitar. Thanks to a wide movepool, Scrafty also finds itself capable of dealing respectable damage to a variety of Pokemon while maintaining good neutral coverage with its STAB attacks. Knock Off is usually its strongest damage-dealing option and doubles as another utility move, especially against Pokemon carrying the ever-present pinch Berries. However, Scrafty is still a utility Pokemon at its core, and relying on it to be a consistent source of damage will often lead to disappointment. While it competes with Incineroar in this role, Scrafty still finds a place on teams that want to avoid stacking weaknesses to common types like Ground, Rock, and Water. Unfortunately for Scrafty, the ubiquity of Fairy-types in Doubles OU means that it can often be scared off the field thanks to its lack of counterplay for such Pokemon as Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele. However, Scrafty's ability to compress a few different roles into one Pokemon still makes it a strong pick on multiple team archetypes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using a Speed-reducing nature and lowering Scrafty's Speed IV to 3 guarantees that it is slower than Aegislash. This will allow Scrafty to always attack Aegislash when it is in Blade forme, resulting in greatly increased damage if not a KO. Snarl is an option on either set that further augments Scrafty's ability to support its partners, while Head Smash can be used to threaten Fire-types, scoring a clean OHKO on the popular Mega Charizard Y. High Jump Kick and Super Fang are viable options on the Figy Berry set for better damage output but are generally inferior to the more standard Drain Punch. Dragon Tail can be used on the Assault Vest set as a pseudo-Taunt that deters Trick Room and setup moves like Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. Finally, full Trick Room teams that require even more damage output can make use of Life Orb or Fightinium Z to boost Scrafty's attacks even further.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Given its 4x weakness to Fairy-type attacks, Scrafty should be avoiding Fairy-type Pokemon at any expense. In an absolute pinch it can survive some of the weaker Fairy-type attacks, but doing so will severely limit its longevity for the rest of the battle. Tapu Lele gets special mention, since it summons Psychic Terrain and blocks Scrafty's main support option in Fake Out, but other Fairy types like Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini also pose a significant threat.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Especially if lacking Ice Punch, Scrafty fails to threaten most Flying-type Pokemon with any of its attacks. Mega Salamence can even tank an Ice Punch with ease and consequently set up Tailwind, boost its Attack and Speed with Dragon Dance, or go straight for damage with a super effective Hyper Voice or Double-Edge. While less of an offensive check, Zapdos takes very little damage from any of Scrafty's attacks and can support its team with Tailwind. Zapdos also threatens Scrafty with paralysis via Static and does not mind taking a Knock Off given its tendency to use items that can activate on command such as Misty Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Rounding out Scrafty's type weaknesses, Fighting-type Pokemon take minimal damage from Knock Off and threaten Scrafty with super effective STAB attacks. Kommo-o can usually unleash a Clangorous Soulblaze in front of Scrafty and threaten it with +1 Close Combat, while opposing Scrafty can threaten your own with Intimidate as well.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Scrafty already has mediocre damage output, so Intimidate can turn Scrafty into dead weight if it stays on the field for too long. Salamence and Landorus-T both lower Scrafty's attack while resisting its Fighting-type attack of choice, while Incineroar resists Knock Off and can use Scrafty's presence to pivot away with U-turn.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is the most important attack on any Scrafty set, since it allows Scrafty to buy an invaluable free turn for its partner. Knock Off is generally Scrafty's strongest attack, especially if it manages to remove a healing item like a pinch Berry or Leftovers. Scrafty has a couple options for its Fighting-type move; Drain Punch provides Scrafty with consistent damage against all targets and another means of healing beyond its Figy Berry, while Low Kick can be used to OHKO heavier threats like Tyranitar. However, it should be noted that opting for Low Kick makes Scrafty a less effective check to lighter Pokemon like Kartana, whose low weight causes Low Kick's Base Power to drop to 20. Taunt is an incredibly useful move to shut down opposing support options, such as Trick Room, Rage Powder, and Spore, and prevent Pokemon like Chansey and Mega Latias from healing themselves with Soft-Boiled and Recover, respectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given investment in HP and Special Defense, when combined with a Careful nature, allows Scrafty to survive Dazzling Gleam from Life Orb Tapu Koko. In order to outspeed Gothitelle and prevent it from using any status moves with Taunt, 60 EVs are placed in Speed. This conveniently allows Scrafty to also outspeed uninvested Tyranitar and standard Incineroar. The remaining 20 EVs are dumped in Defense, which allows Scrafty to survive any attack from standard -1 Mega Salamence. Figy Berry is used for recovery, providing Scrafty with extra longevity. While any of the non-Wiki pinch Berries could be used in theory, it should be noted that using Mago Berry reveals that Scrafty is not using a Speed-reducing nature and should be avoided.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Scrafty is most effectively used by switching it into resisted or weak neutral attacks to dampen blows for its teammate with Intimidate. It also functions well as a lead, especially next to Pokemon that can set up favorable field conditions for your team, such as Stealth Rock or Tailwind. Common Scrafty switch-ins like Tapu Fini don't appreciate having their items removed, so Knock Off can be used gratuitously to punish any defensive switches. Taunt can be used to shut down opposing support options and gives Scrafty a very favorable matchup against passive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Gothitelle. Despite its 4x weakness to Fairy, Scrafty can stomach some Fairy-type attacks if it absolutely needs to, but they should generally be avoided at all costs. If Scrafty's health is just outside of pinch Berry range, you can try to force it to activate by switching into weaker attacks that you are confident will not knock it out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that either have low Defense or appreciate Fake Out and Intimidate support are prime partners for Scrafty. Mega Gardevoir and Mega Latias are great examples, as they both appreciate Scrafty's ability to buy them some free turns. Gardevoir in particular desperately needs help covering its poor Defense, while Mega Latias appreciates the ability to invest in Speed while still retaining its bulk with Calm Mind and Scrafty's Intimidate. Mega Salamence teams often appreciate Scrafty more than Incineroar for their matchup against Tyranitar but must be sure to cover the weakness to Fairy-type Pokemon. The necessity of partners that can handle Fairy-types is not unique to teams with Mega Salamence though, as Scrafty is incredibly vulnerable to their attacks. Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Kartana, and Aegislash all do this job well, while Metagross and Aegislash also appreciate their Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses being covered. Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcanion make for good partners for Scrafty, as they absorb Fairy-type attacks with ease, while Scrafty can take on threatening Rock-types.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is the staple move on any Scrafty set, as it provides a very good means of disrupting opposing teams. Knock Off is a strong option in most situations, either dealing significant damage or removing an important item, if not both. Drain Punch is extremely useful on Assault Vest Scrafty sets, as they lack the ability to recover their health with Figy Berry, but Low Kick is also usable if more damage on specific targets like Tyranitar is desired. High Jump Kick is another potential Fighting-type attack and increases Scrafty's firepower greatly. High Jump Kick has a chance to OHKO standard Incineroar and Kartana, neither of which can be OHKOed by either Drain Punch or Low Kick. However, High Jump Kick must be used carefully, as whiffing it into a Protect will severely hurt Scrafty's longevity. The last slot is flexible and can be adjusted based on the needs of Scrafty's team. Ice Punch lets Scrafty serve as a better check to Zygarde and Landorus-T, 2HKOing both reliably at neutral while having a very good chance to 2HKO bulky Landorus-T at -1 Attack. Super Fang is useful for consistent damage against all non-Ghost-type targets, which can come in handy against bulky Pokemon like Cresselia and Tapu Fini. Poison Jab is an option that provides Scrafty with a way to damage threatening Fairy-type Pokemon, consistently 2HKOing all Island Guardians except Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Thanks to the Assault Vest and the given HP and Special Defense investment, Scrafty is able to survive a Moonblast from standard Calm Mind Tapu Fini before a boost. This Scrafty also takes on Mega Salamence relatively well, as it will always survive two Hyper Voices or one -1 Double-Edge from standard mixed Mega Salamence. Additionally, Scrafty will never be OHKOed by an All-Out Pummeling from -1 Kartana. The Speed EVs allow Scrafty to outspeed Gothitelle, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack. When combined with an Adamant nature, the Attack investment turns Scrafty into an offensive threat while still maintaining its defensive characteristics.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Assault Vest Scrafty is meant to be used more offensively than the bulkier Figy Berry set. As such, you must be deliberate about when you switch this Scrafty into attacks, since it lacks the fallback option of a pinch Berry. It lacks recovery entirely when not using Drain Punch, so those sets require extra caution to preserve Scrafty's health. The last move affects what kind of Pokemon Scrafty is most effective against. For example, Ice Punch lets Scrafty function as a very good check to Landorus-T and Zygarde, while Poison Jab turns Scrafty from setup bait to a decent check when facing Tapu Bulu. Super Fang sets are effective at chipping away at bulky Pokemon like Zapdos, Cresselia, and Chansey. Overall, Assault Vest Scrafty should prioritize dealing damage much more than its Figy Berry counterpart in order to make the most out of its time on the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This more offensive variant of Scrafty is effective on teams that still appreciate Fake Out and Intimidate support from one Pokemon while also requiring consistent damage output every turn. A prime of example of such a team archetype is full Trick Room, which needs to make the most of the limited time Trick Room remains up. Pokemon that can handle opposing Fairy-types like Mega Metagross, Kartana, and Aegislash make great partners. Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcanion also fill this role effectively while appreciating Intimidate support and a Rock-type resistance, and Pokemon with low Defense like Mega Gardevoir enjoy the utility provided by Scrafty. Tapu Bulu makes for an interesting partner for Assault Vest Scrafty, as Tapu Bulu provides Scrafty with a means of recovery via Grassy Terrain and has a positive matchup against most of the Fairy-types in the tier, namely the other three Island Guardians.</p> "

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Gothitelle's presence in DOU is defined primarily by its ability Shadow Tag, which grants it the niche of immediately trapping in both its foes, giving its partner the ability to either pick off important targets on the opposing side of the field or safely set up in the optimal board state locked in by Gothitelle. This support is enhanced by its great supportive movepool, prominently featuring Trick Room and Heal Pulse to aid further in its partner's setup and sweep. However, Gothitelle is brought down by its tendency to become a momentum sink against more offensive foes, as it's unable to hold its own and can be fairly easily overwhelmed. Additionally, its pure Psychic typing gives it key weaknesses to Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type attacks in exchange for a single useful resistance to Psychic-type attacks, enhancing its vulnerability to strong foes like Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Genesect.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gothitelle's deep supportive movepool gives it a number of strong options for moves. Recycle, in conjunction with Gothitelle's Berry, can give it more staying power against weaker or more passive foes, provided that it's able to get into range to activate its Berry fairly consistently. Foul Play grants Gothitelle more offensive presence in some situations against foes like Mega Metagross, Kartana, and Dragon Dance Zygarde, limiting the opponent's ability to freely break Gothitelle with repeated strong attacks and discouraging opposing Pokemon from setting up. Ally Switch can be fairly useful as a \"surprise\" option to gain a crucial free turn for Gothitelle's ally, but it is rather inconsistent and requires good timing to use. In terms of items, a Berry is generally Gothitelle's best choice, but it can sometimes use Mental Herb effectively to guarantee itself immunity to a single use of Taunt so it can use a key support move like Trick Room. For an entirely different take on Gothitelle, you could run Competitive with Psychium Z, making Gothitelle much more offensive and capitalizing on the popularity of Intimidate, Icy Wind, and Electroweb. However, losing the niche of trapping makes Gothitelle much less viable in most other situations, so this set primarily relies on surprise factor for its value.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar, Scrafty, and Incineroar are all able to KO Gothitelle with appropriate sets. Tyranitar in particular can also take advantage of Gothitelle's passive nature to set up with Dragon Dance mostly unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt shuts down all of Gothitelle's support options, removing its ability to support its ally and leaving it open to attack. Notable users of Taunt include Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Scrafty.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Setup Sweepers: If Gothitelle isn't running Taunt, it risks being enough of a momentum sink that foes such as Dragon Dance Zygarde and Tyranitar can easily set up on it and swing the momentum away from the Gothitelle player.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Aegislash cannot be trapped by Gothitelle's Shadow Tag, allowing them to freely switch out into an appropriate counter from the opponent's team. Furthermore, they can deal significant amounts of damage to Gothitelle with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Pivots: Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Landorus-T, Incineroar, Genesect, and Tapu Koko, can use these moves to escape from Gothitelle's trapping effect and allow an opponent to bring in an appropriate counter or check to Gothitelle and its ally.</p> <p><strong>Redirection: If Gothitelle doesn't run Taunt, redirection users such as Amoonguss and Togekiss can be difficult to play around, as they redirect Gothitelle's Heal Pulse to prevent its partner from getting access to recovery. Amoonguss can further threaten Trick Room builds of Gothitelle, taking advantage of Trick Room to move before Gothitelle and its ally and threatening to shut them both down with Spore.</p> ",

        "name": "Trapper Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gothitelle's moveset is fairly flexible overall, and it can adapt itself to fit the needs of most teams. Most Gothitelle sets use Psychic as a STAB attack to avoid being forced into Struggle by the Taunt users that often target it; this also allows it to contribute to breaking down bulkier foes like Amoonguss and Tapu Fini by providing valuable chip damage. The rest of Gothitelle's common moves are generally aimed at supporting its partner; Helping Hand is an effective way of allowing Gothitelle's ally to deal heavy damage without requiring too much investment in setting up. Helping Hand also gives Gothitelle a good way to channel some sort of offensive presence through its ally. Trick Room can help to support slower attackers, letting them set up and attack more comfortably before opponents can intervene. Heal Pulse allows Gothitelle to support its ally's setup by keeping it healthy. Taunt is especially powerful on Gothitelle given its ability to trap Taunted foes; passive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Chansey struggle to do their job while inflicted with a Taunt and even offensive threats can be decent targets for Taunt to ensure their inability to use Protect. Any combination of these five moves could realistically fill the first three slots. Finally, Protect capitalizes on the double targets that Gothitelle is usually subject to due to the high value of the trapping it provides. It also guarantees an extra turn of trapped foes for an ally to take advantage of.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Shadow Tag is Gothitelle's claim to fame, locking opponents into a board position and allowing an ally of choice to set up or attack in a favorable position. Thus, its set aims to let it stick around the field as long as possible to maintain this trapping effect. A Wiki Berry is used with the idea that Gothitelle will generally take low amounts of damage from most hits and can therefore consistently activate it. This is aided by its EV spread, which aims to optimize overall bulk; the HP and Defense EVs make Choice Band Zygarde's Thousand Arrows a 3HKO on Gothitelle, while the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to maximize its durability. Finally, a Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs makes Gothitelle as slow as possible so it can move first in its own Trick Room, though if it's not running Trick Room, a Calm nature with 31 Speed IVs is preferred.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Gothitelle is indeed a bulky Pokemon, it's not invincible, and its bulk shouldn't be overestimated. If Gothitelle is KOed before its ally is sufficiently set-up, the opponent can often just switch in an appropriate check to Gothitelle's ally, rendering it ineffective and wasting the turn investment of the setup. As such, Gothitelle should generally be played fairly conservatively; it should be protected from taking unnecessary hits, especially if its presence is required for a mid- to late-game setup and sweep. For instance, one generally shouldn't commit to maximizing the stat boosts of a setup sweeper next to Gothitelle, since Gothitelle often can't last that long; remember that after the ally KOes one foe, the opponent can bring in their counter to that Pokemon, so there's sometimes no point setting up so far and taking unnecessary damage. Gothitelle also has access to Helping Hand to help its ally achieve extra damage without having to leave Gothitelle in play for too long while its ally sets up. In the same vein, if Gothitelle has nothing of use to do on a given turn but needs to stay in for the trapping effect, a double Protect is often a viable play, for the 33% chance of reducing potential damage to it; don't be ashamed to click Protect twice in a row if that's the best play. On the other hand, it's important to know when Gothitelle's Shadow Tag isn't required anymore to contribute towards winning a game; don't take pains and make unnecessary sacrifices just to keep Gothitelle from fainting if you can feasibly win without needing to trapping foes. Sometimes, Gothitelle even gets in the way of the game's progression by failing to contribute any sort of offensive pressure, making it better to sacrifice it rather than lose momentum via its presence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gothitelle is most commonly and most effectively run alongside bulky setup Pokemon, such as Mega Scizor, Zygarde, Tapu Fini, and Kommo-o, which can more easily use their respective setup moves with the aid of Gothitelle's Heal Pulse and take advantage of Gothitelle trapping foes that are setup bait on the field. On the other hand, Gothitelle itself appreciates having support to keep it healthy; partners with Intimidate like Landorus-T, Incineroar, and Mega Manectric help to soften blows to its weaker Defense stat and to Gothitelle's ally and can allow Gothitelle to trap in significantly weakened foes, proving a huge damper on an opponent's momentum while Gothitelle can help its ally set up safely. Additionally, pivots such as Tapu Koko, Incineroar, and Genesect allow Gothitelle and its partner to switch in safely on less threatening foes. Strong Z-Move users such as Tapu Koko and Kyurem-B appreciate Gothitelle's trapping ability, as it allows them to safely use their Z-Move to its maximum potential on important threats without the fear that they could switch out.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is one of the metagame's best redirection support Pokemon, with high enough bulk to comfortably absorb neutral and resisted attacks and secondary utility through its access to Spore. Its ability Regenerator allows it to recover one-third of its HP whenever it switches out, making it extremely tough to KO if it isn't taken down in one strong blow. Amoonguss's bulk, combined with its Grass / Poison typing and Rage Powder utility, allows it to outright wall some top-tier threats like Tapu Koko and Kartana. Other foes like Zygarde, Diancie, and Kingdra can bypass Rage Powder with spread attacks, but they still struggle to deliver meaningful damage to Amoonguss and risk being afflicted by Spore. In general, Amoonguss poses an immediate threat to foes if Misty Terrain or Electric Terrain isn't active, as they risk being put to sleep by Spore if Amoonguss isn't dealt with promptly.</p> <p>However, Amoonguss is easily forced out by strong Flying-, Psychic-, and Fire-types like Mega Salamence, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y. Amoonguss's utility as a Spore user is also severely hampered by the metagame's omnipresence of Electric Terrain and Misty Terrain, set by Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini, respectively. Furthermore, Amoonguss has a very passive presence on the battlefield. It struggles to deal meaningful damage to the majority of the metagame, only really posing a threat to foes with severe Poison or Grass weaknesses, like Tapu Bulu and Mega Swampert.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Foul Play hits a few select targets harder than any of Amoonguss' other options for attacks, most notably Mega Metagross and Kartana, 2HKOing the former and preventing a Substitute from the latter. Mental Herb can be used to counter Taunt users like Tapu Koko. Resist Berries like Occa Berry and Payapa Berry can be used over Wiki Berry to patch up some of Amoonguss's weaknesses, allowing it to lure would-be counters like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele into attacking before retaliating with Spore. Clear Smog allows Amoonguss to neutralize threatening setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Cresselia, but its low damage output makes it difficult to fit onto Amoonguss's already passive set, thus typically forcing it to forgo Protect. Sunny Day can be used to hard counter rain teams, since Amoonguss has ample opportunity to reset weather in the face of opposing rain sweepers due to its high bulk and Grass typing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Prominent Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, Mega Metagross, and Deoxys-A all threaten to OHKO Amoonguss with their STAB attacks, especially when Psychic Terrain is activated.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Powerful Fire-types like Incineroar, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion are able to quickly tear away at Amoonguss's HP, if not OHKO it outright under sun. Some of these threats are also able to bypass Rage Powder using Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Strong Ice-types like Kyurem-B are able to swiftly tear away at Amoonguss's HP with their STAB attacks. Genesect also has access to a potentially Download-boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Prominent Flying-types like Mega Salamence and Pelipper threaten severe damage, if not an outright KO, against Amoonguss with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Kartana and Mega Venusaur are able to ignore Amoonguss's presence on the battlefield, as they're immune to Amoonguss's powder moves, but others like Ludicolo and Lurantis have to be wary of Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute: Amoonguss is primarily a support Pokemon, with little to no use as an offensive threat. Therefore, Taunt users like Tapu Lele render it virtually useless, and Substitute users like Aegislash are able to set up freely against Amoonguss with little consequence.</p> <p><strong>Misty Terrain and Electric Terrain: Misty Terrain and Electric Terrain, as set by top-tier threats Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko, both shut down Spore, thereby preventing Amoonguss from using Spore as a means of pressuring grounded foes.</p> ",

        "name": "Redirection Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rage Powder allows Amoonguss to redirect single-target attacks from its allies. Using Spore, Amoonguss can put foes to sleep with 100% accuracy. Combined with Amoonguss's rock-bottom Speed, this lets it pose a significant threat to opposing Trick Room teams after Trick Room is set. Sludge Bomb is generally the preferred attacking move on Amoonguss, as it hits each of the four island guardians for respectable damage. Giga Drain is an alternative option, hitting prominent Water-types like Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Mega Swampert for decent damage while also providing another form of recovery to Amoonguss. Protect is generally used in the last slot, allowing Amoonguss to stall out a turn while its ally deals with any pressing threats on the battlefield.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread, combined with a Wiki Berry, a Sassy nature, and 0 Speed IVs, minimizes Amoonguss's Speed for optimal performance inside of Trick Room and allows it to take Landorus-T's Tectonic Rage. Regenerator is the preferred ability for Amoonguss, as it allows Amoonguss to recover a third of its HP every time it switches out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Amoonguss works well at almost any point in the game to provide redirection support for its allies or just serve as a bulky pivot that absorbs attacks in place of teammates that don't want to. When Electric and Misty Terrain are down, use Spore to immobilize the foes that are particularly threatening to your team. Keep in mind that even when the aforementioned Terrains are active, Spore can still be used on Flying-types and levitating Pokemon. Be wary of Grass-types, as they can ignore both Rage Powder and Spore. Regenerator gives Amoonguss plenty of opportunities to recover, so don't be afraid to pivot Amoonguss in on a neutral or resisted hit and definitely don't think twice about switching it out if it's in danger. Offensively, Amoonguss is very weak and passive, so don't keep it in when Terrains prevent sleep, or when redirection support isn't needed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Most ally Pokemon appreciate Amoonguss's ability to redirect attacks, but setup attackers like Zygarde, Tapu Fini, and Kommo-o especially appreciate Amoonguss's presence. Trick Room setters like Stakataka and Diancie have great synergy with Amoonguss, as Amoonguss helps the setters activate Trick Room while Amoonguss gets to move first once Trick Room is set. Out of the four island guardians, Tapu Lele is usually the best teammate for Amoonguss, as Psychic Terrain cancels out Electric and Misty Terrain, allowing Amoonguss to freely use Spore on its foes. Tapu Bulu is also able to reset sleep-cancelling Terrains, but it shares most of the same weaknesses Amoonguss has. Although less than ideal, Amoonguss is still capable of being on the same team as Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini; Amoonguss is redirection utility first and foremost, and it still does an excellent job at that when paired with them. Although Amoonguss is usually placed on teams to support allies and not be supported by them, it certainly appreciates teammates that can clear out the strong Flying-, Psychic-, Fire-, and Ice-type Pokemon that Amoonguss struggles with. Tyranitar stands out as a Pokemon that clears out all of the aforementioned threats, and in return Amoonguss can help it set up a Dragon Dance. Rain sweepers like Kingdra and Mega Swampert are adept at clearing out Fire-types with their STAB moves, Flying-types with Ice coverage, and Psychic-types with rain-boosted sheer force. Because Amoonguss is so passive offensively, try not to use too many other passive Pokemon besides Amoonguss on your team.</p> "

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn finds its role in Doubles as a hard-to-take-down pivot that can take strong resisted moves and recover the lost HP thanks to Leech Seed. Ferrothorn is able to check many common threats in the metagame such as the Island Guardians, Tyranitar, and rain teams in general. Ferrothorn is also handy against bulky offensive teams, as it absorbs most hits they dish out. Ferrothorn has some offensive presence as well, thanks to a decent base 94 Attack stat and a typing that lets it hit common threats like Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, Tyranitar, and Tapu Lele super effectively. However, its typing makes it 4x weak to Fire, rendering it almost deadweight when an opposing Fire-type Pokemon is out on field. Additionally, Kartana's presence in the tier both operates as a hardstop to Ferrothorn and one that takes up a large part of its niche, not suffering from any of its passivity issues. Ferrothorn's base 20 Speed makes it one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, which has drawbacks such as draining momentum but also brings good aspects with high Gyro Ball Base Power and high Speed under Trick Room.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used if removing a foe's item is prioritized. An alternative set featuring Curse can increase Ferrothorn's chances of becoming a late-game cleaner after Fire-types or strong special attackers have been dealt with because it can be too bulky for the rest of their team to take down. Note that this is a bit harder to pull off, and Curse usually takes a valuable moveslot, making it somewhat niche. Thunder Wave isn't traditionally the best fourth move, but it can be considered as well for speed control, as it's unexpected and can cripple a fast threat. However, it weakens Ferrothorn's own Gyro Ball and can be prevented by Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Ferrothorn doesn't really have much in its set to deal with Fire-types, such as Incineroar, Volcanion, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, as they OHKO it with their STAB moves. Fire-types can also drain momentum, as they almost always force a switch unless Ferrothorn's partner can check them. Ferrothorn must also be wary of Flamethrower Genesect, Heat Wave Zapdos, Overheat Mega Manectric, and other assorted Fire-type coverage users.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Scrafty or Fighting-type coverage moves, such as Kartana's Sacred Sword and Deoxys-A's Superpower, can cause heavy damage to Ferrothorn, even if they are rare to come by.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Aside from using Leech Seed, Ferrothorn can't dent most Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Celesteela, the latter of which can even carry Flamethrower to beat Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Aegislash can set up its Substitute to block Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and take any of its hits with ease. Under Trick Room, Mega Camerupt also uses Ferrothorn's presence as an easy opportunity to set up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Intimidate from Incineroar and Landorus-T cuts Ferrothorn's Attack, meaning it loses its offensive presence and can only chip down foes with Leech Seed or set Stealth Rock.</p> ",

Power Whip is Ferrothorn's secondary STAB move that gets the 2HKO on Pokemon that it should eliminate or hits super effectively like Suicune and Tapu Fini. It's also used to hit Steel-resistant or slow Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Pelipper that don't mind Gyro Ball too much. Stealth Rock offers Ferrothorn's team consistent chip damage on common metagame threats such as Kyurem-B, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y to make them easier to handle. Alternatively, Leech Seed offers immediate chip damage and sustainability at the same time. Protect is an essential move in Doubles for shielding the Pokemon while its partner removes a threat for it, protecting Ferrothorn from potential double targeting, and scouting the foe's sets, especially for surprise Fire-type coverage. It's particularly good on Leech Seed or Leftovers Ferrothorn due to the resulting ability to stall for passive recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 88 Defense EVs ensure +1 Zygarde's Tectonic Rage will be unable to OHKO Ferrothorn. 80 Special Defense EVs let it take less than 50% from Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam, with the remaining investment focused on increasing its offensive potential. Iron Barbs accumulates chip damage alongside a potential Leech Seed, which is Ferrothorn's main way of handling or checking certain threats. Minimizing Speed IVs boosts the Base Power of Gyro Ball and enables Ferrothorn to move faster under Trick Room. A Wiki Berry offers burst healing, giving Ferrothorn a second chance at remaining healthy enough to check certain threats even if it's caught off-guard by a coverage move. However, Leftovers may be preferable for some sets for more reliable recovery, especially due to the way its recovery compounds with Leech Seed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In addition to its good pivot potential, Ferrothorn is good at regaining that lost health with Leech Seed, as the opponent is likely to switch out their Pokemon to something that can hit Ferrothorn decently, giving it chip damage and recovery combined with Leftovers. However, try to avoid losing too much health from pivoting in, especially when Ferrothorn is your main check to specific threats on the opposing team, namely rain sweepers like Mega Swampert or powerful offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele, as you want it to be able to switch in or take their attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ferrothorn improves a team's matchup against rain teams by resisting Kingdra and Mega Swampert's rain-boosted STAB attacks, which is notable when teambuilding if you are weak to the archetype. Ferrothorn appreciates teammates that can handle the Fire-types it dislikes facing, such as Incineroar, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion. Checks to these include Landorus-T due to its bulk and access to Earth Power and Stone Edge, or a Dragon-type that resists Fire, such as Zygarde. Volcanion itself also works for this role, notably completing a Fire / Water / Grass core. Ferrothorn offers its own Fairy-type teammates such as Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele a switch-in to Steel-type attacks.</p> "

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance, coupled with a decent Special Attack and Speed, allows it to function as a setup sweeper that can snowball out of control if not stopped. Its diverse coverage options allow it to choose its checks to a certain degree. However, no matter the coverage option it chooses, Volcarona is bound to be walled by a significant number of relevant threats in the Doubles metagame. Volcarona also has a variety of utility moves in its movepool, enabling it to take up a more supportive role with Rage Powder. This allows Volcarona to redirect most attacks away from teammates and makes a great combo with its Fire STAB moves, which let Volcarona remove problematic Grass-types, which cannot have their attacks redirected by Rage Powder. That being said, it is not easy to fit Volcarona onto teams due to the amount of support it requires to function to its fullest potential. Volcarona also faces stiff competition from other, more popular Fire-types, such as Incineroar, Victini, and Volcanion, which can fulfill more useful niches in teams. As a bulky supporter, it has a niche over other popular support options, thanks to its unique combo of utility moves, allowing it to act as a redirection user, provide speed control, and even act as a phazer all in one slot. However, its mediocre physical bulk and poor defensive typing mean that Volcarona can be forced out easily by common physical attackers or bulkier Pokemon that can wall it reliably. The fairly common use of Stealth Rock in the Doubles metagame also makes it hard for Volcarona to function to its fullest potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain allows Quiver Dance Volcarona to hit bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Suicune, which otherwise wall it. Fiery Dance can be used as a more accurate alternative over Heat Wave on the Quiver Dance set as well as for a chance at getting a Special Attack boost, although it is worth noting that it has lower Base Power and will also result in a weaker Inferno Overdrive. Flamethrower and Fire Blast can also replace Heat Wave on the Quiver Dance set, with the latter being able to OHKO Mega Metagross without any boosts, though it is risky due to its low accuracy. In addition, all three fail to deal spread damage and are thus less likely to clean than Heat Wave. Hidden Power Ice can replace Bug Buzz to KO a chipped Mega Salamence or Landorus-T. Incinerate has some use in the support set to remove Berries from common switch-ins such as Tapu Fini and Incineroar. Struggle Bug can be useful on the support set to weaken incoming special attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Pelipper, and Suicune are annoying for Volcarona to face, as they are able to take most of Volcarona's attacks comfortably and hit back with a strong STAB move or annoy Volcarona with Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Pokemon such as Incineroar, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion are able to take all of Volcarona's attacks comfortably and deal reasonable damage back with their Fire-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Diancie can easily take a hit or two from even a boosted Volcarona and hit back with Diamond Storm or set up Trick Room. Tyranitar is quite threatening offensively as well, but a boosted Bug Buzz or Savage Spin-Out often takes it off the field. Common Rock coverage users such as Landorus-T also threaten Volcarona greatly.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and Kommo-o often have no trouble taking Volcarona's attacks and can deal huge damage back with their STAB attacks or set up in front of Volcarona. Mega Salamence in particular can also counter both of Volcarona's sets unless Volcarona is carrying the rare Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Volcarona's poor physical bulk means that it cannot stay in against some strong physical attackers such as Incineroar and Landorus-T. Staying in recklessly on such Pokemon means that Volcarona might get 2HKOed easily.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is extremely threatening to Volcarona and can chunk Volcarona upon switching in, pushing it into KO range of opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Spread Attackers</strong>: Common spread attackers such as Zygarde and Mega Charizard Y can ignore Volcarona's attempts to redirect their respective spread STAB moves, rendering Rage Powder useless.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heat Wave is the Fire STAB move of choice, allowing Volcarona to hit both targets. Bug Buzz nabs 2HKOs on Zygarde and Tyranitar when Volcarona has set up Quiver Dance once and is its best attack against Incineroar. Quiver Dance lets Volcarona boost its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage, allowing it to function as a late-game sweeper once all of its checks have been gotten rid of. Protect is good for scouting moves and stalling out turns, especially if Volcarona has already set up and cannot afford to switch out while its partner gets rid of the threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect after a single Quiver Dance and hit as hard as possible. A somewhat bulkier spread of 80 HP / 4 Def / 200 SpA / 4 SpD / 220 Spe can also be used, allowing Volcarona to take Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost while maximizing damage output and outspeeding Kyurem-B and Adamant Mega Metagross before setup. Flame Body is the ability of choice to make opposing physical attackers think twice before attacking Volcarona. Buginium Z allows Volcarona to net KOs on Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Cresselia at +1 or, if running Swarm instead of Flame Body, at under one-third health. Firium Z gives Volcarona a different way to break though bulkier Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T. However, a Wiki Berry can also be used instead to increase Volcarona's longevity and grant it more opportunities to set up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona can be brought in mid-game or late-game to set up Quiver Dance and try to seal the game after most of its checks have been gotten rid of. However, it is not mandatory to set up before attacking, as Volcarona can always use its Z-Move as a one-time nuke to muscle past bulkier Pokemon or to chunk a foe early-game. Volcarona should not typically be brought into the field directly, as it is vital to keep it as healthy as possible in order to set up Quiver Dance successfully, so it should only be brought in with a pivot or when an ally faints. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid switching Volcarona in when Stealth Rock is up in order to keep it as healthy as possible. If Volcarona is holding a Wiki Berry, then it may also be more beneficial to set up a Quiver Dance instead of attacking when its health is low, as this may ensure its ability to take another special attack and restore health by activating its Wiki Berry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water- and Ground-types are often good Volcarona partners, as they help remove Rock- and Fire-types, which could be problematic for Volcarona. Volcarona appreciates Electric- or Grass-type partners such as Tapu Koko and Kartana, which can break through bulky Water-types with their respective STAB moves. Intimidate users like Landorus-T help prolong Volcarona's longevity by giving Volcarona an easier time setting up in front of physical attackers. Fake Out users such as Zeraora and Mew are also able give Volcarona opportunities to set up Quiver Dance. Defog users, such as Mew, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T, are nearly mandatory on teams with Volcarona to help get rid of Stealth Rock, which poses a serious threat to Volcarona's survivability and functionality. Kyurem-B is another good partner for Volcarona, helping remove Dragon-types and physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Zygarde, allowing Volcarona to set up smoothly.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat grabs an OHKO on bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Metagross and Amoonguss, notably hitting the Grass-types that cannot have their attacks redirected by Rage Powder. Heat Wave offers a more reliable attack that can be used repeatedly without drawback. Rage Powder is useful for redirecting moves away from Volcarona's teammates while threatening physical attackers with a burn in the process. Tailwind lets Volcarona provide a form of speed control for its teammates. Protect helps Volcarona scout opposing sets and shields it from Fake Out. Whirlwind can also be used in place of either Tailwind or Protect in order to stop Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Cresselia from setting Trick Room or to remove setup sweepers such as Tapu Fini and Mega Latias from the field.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense investments enable Volcarona to survive Mega Metagross's Psychic Terrain-boosted Zen Headbutt and activate its Wiki Berry. 44 EVs in Speed let Volcarona outspeed Choice Scarf Victini in Tailwind. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to maximize Volcarona's offensive capabilities while retaining its defensive benchmarks. Flame Body punishes contact attackers that Volcarona redirects.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona can be brought in early-game to set up Tailwind or to stop Trick Room from getting up with Whirlwind. Volcarona can also be hard switched into resisted contact moves for a chance of inflicting burns on the attacking Pokemon thanks to Flame Body. It is also a good idea to bring Volcarona into the field to help support a setup sweeper such as Zygarde or a glass cannon such as Deoxys-A with Rage Powder. However, it is worth noting that spread moves, such as Thousand Arrows and Icy Wind, are not affected by Rage Powder, so be sure to use it wisely. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid switching Volcarona in when Stealth Rock is up in order to keep it as healthy as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairy-types such as the Island Guardians and Pokemon weak to Steel such as Kyurem-B appreciate Volcarona's ability to KO Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Metagross and Kartana. Pokemon with middling Speed tiers, such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, benefit from the speed control provided by Tailwind. Defog users such as Mew and Tapu Fini make great partners with Volcarona by removing Stealth Rock, allowing Volcarona to do its job properly. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T also help make up for Volcarona's poor physical bulk and increase its longevity. Setup sweepers, especially those weak to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks such as Zygarde, Mega Latias, and Kommo-o, value Volcarona's ability to redirect such attacks away while they set up.</p> "

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>Intimidate plagues many physical attackers in Doubles, with common users like Landorus-T, Incineroar, and Mega Manectric all being very popular. Tornadus turns this into an advantage thanks to its ability Defiant. With ample potential for boosts, a strong STAB attack in Acrobatics, and decent coverage for Flying-resistant threats through Superpower or Knock Off, Tornadus can punch through unprepared teams. Acrobatics mandates that Tornadus use an item that's immediately expendable; this is most easily accomplishable with a Terrain-activated Seed. However, even with a boost, Tornadus is still somewhat frail, especially since the boost is lost if Tornadus switches out in order to be useful again later in the match. These Seeds also make Tornadus a bit predictable in both set and strategy, as its chosen Island Guardian partner will need to be led alongside it or switched in before it attacks. Access to Tailwind further adds to Tornadus's value, especially as its high natural speed makes it easy to set Tailwind. However, aside from supporting its team with speed control, Tornadus can't punish most common Electric-types like Zapdos and Tapu Koko.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt offers a different form of support than Tailwind that may be more effective on certain teams. If Tornadus is paired with either Tapu Bulu or Tapu Koko instead, it can use a Grassy or Electric Seed, respectively. However, this can be somewhat less synergistic than the other Seeds thanks to Superpower removing the provided boost. Fling may be useful with a King's Rock equipped, guaranteeing its target will flinch and providing both team support and convenient item loss without having to rely on a teammate. However, this means Tornadus is forced to use Fling before it can effectively use Acrobatics, and the moveslot becomes useless after Tornadus uses it once.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types have strong STAB attacks that threaten Tornadus and can shrug off its attacks. Tapu Koko and Zapdos also resist Superpower, while Mega Manectric and Zeraora have the added benefit of outspeeding Tornadus. Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt is similarly threatening, though it has to watch out for a boosted Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Metagross and Aegislash are among the Steel-types that can take a Superpower and retaliate with strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Tornadus thrives when it can use a potential Defiant boost to get a strong first hit; Deoxys-A, weather sweepers like Excadrill and Kingdra, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele are a few threats that could get in the way of that.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Without the rare Taunt, Tornadus can't do much against many common Trick Room setters like Bronzong, Diancie, and Cresselia, and its Tailwind becomes a detriment to its team's success.</p> ",

        "name": "Defiant Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Acrobatics is Tornadus's only strong and reliable STAB attack, though it requires Seed activation before it can do decent damage. Most switch-ins to Flying-type moves like Tyranitar can be hit for decent damage thanks to Superpower; this also gives Tornadus a way to hit Incineroar incredibly hard after getting a Defiant boost from its Intimidate. Knock Off can be used instead for added utility and to provide a solid hit on Aegislash and the chance to 2HKO Mega Metagross at +1. Tailwind supports Tornadus's team and also ensures it can get a hit off against faster foes after hopefully gaining Defiant boosts. Protect allows Tornadus to scout the opponent's moves, manage positioning, or stall out potentially detrimental field effects.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Defiant enables Tornadus to be successful in a metagame with many popular users of Intimidate; its power and Speed are both maximized to make the most of potential boosts. The choice between Misty Seed and Psychic Seed is dependent on whether Tornadus has Tapu Fini or Tapu Lele as a teammate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tornadus operates very well as a lead, as Intimidate users often act as leads too. If you want Tornadus to use Acrobatics, make sure the correct Terrain is set to activate its Seed. Activating this Seed does provide a useful boost to its special bulk, but don't be afraid to switch it out if Tornadus is threatened and could be useful later on in setting Tailwind or dissuading Intimidate users. Tornadus isn't particularly strong without a Defiant boost, so do your best to position it accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele are ostensibly solid partners due to their abilities ensuring easy item activation, but they also offer additional synergy. Calm Mind Tapu Fini can apply pressure much more effectively with Tailwind support and Tornadus's fantastic matchup against Grass-types, while more defensive sets can keep Tornadus healthy with Heal Pulse. Tapu Lele appreciates Tailwind, allowing it to more easily run a Life Orb or Psychium Z set, and can use Taunt to help take on Trick Room. Attackers with middling Speed benefit greatly from Tailwind, and those that struggle with Intimidate are especially notable, making Zygarde and Kyurem-B solid options. Zygarde and Kyurem-B also help take on Electric-types, a role that could also be filled by Landorus-T or Tyranitar. Many popular Steel-types have second typings that prevent them from being directly threatened by Superpower, so a teammate like Incineroar or Volcanion can help Tornadus handle those tough matchups.</p> "

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Though often overshadowed by its Therian counterpart, Incarnate Landorus is a considerable force in its own right, easily dealing with common Steel- and Fire-types courtesy of its iconically powerful Sheer Force-backed Earth Power, which is notably unaffected by both Grassy Terrain and Wide Guard, two huge problems to most Earthquake users. However, it still faces competition from special Landorus-T for a team slot; though Landorus hits much harder, it lacks the Therian forme's key selling point of Intimidate. Perhaps precisely because it lacks Intimidate, Landorus is also heavily threatened by opposing speed control and even faster foes, which can take advantage of its relative lack of bulk to quickly KO it. Landorus is also hurt by the ubiquity of Ice-type coverage attacks, a consequence of the high usage of Zygarde and Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Yache Berry allows Landorus to win the matchup one-on-one against Mega Metagross and Tapu Koko, taking their respective Ice-type attacks and OHKOing in return with Earth Power. A Choice Scarf set can also win these one-on-one matchups, but with a Yache Berry, Landorus retains the ability to switch moves. Rock Slide offers a more accurate alternative to Stone Edge, but the reduced power is a significant dropoff. If Landorus doesn't need additional coverage, it can set Stealth Rock for its teammates. Alternatively, setting up a Substitute provides Landorus some protection from moves that would otherwise KO it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types hit Landorus for quadruple damage and can easily OHKO it, as it tends to hold neither a Yache Berry nor a Focus Sash. Furthermore, due to the ubiquity of Landorus-T and Zygarde, Ice-type coverage is extremely common and not hard to fit onto most teams. Kyurem-B has STAB-boosted Ice-type moves to dispatch of Landorus, and threats such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Mega Metagross commonly run Ice-type coverage in the form of Hidden Power Ice or Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Landorus has little way to deal with bulky Water-types and gets OHKOed by most Water-type moves. Common Pokemon possessing STAB-boosted Water-type moves include Tapu Fini and Suicune as well as Swift Swim users like Kingdra, which can move before even a Choice Scarf Landorus and take it out before it gets the chance to attack.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room: Landorus's mediocre bulk leaves it wide open to being severely damaged by foes that it can't KO with Earth Power first. Opposing Tailwind and Trick Room remove what semblance of a speed advantage it had, greatly lessening its presence on the field.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Life Orb Landorus's frailty causes it to be threatened by any faster Pokemon that can hit it hard, including but not limited to Choice Scarf Genesect, Deoxys-A, and Mega Salamence. Choice Scarf sets outpace almost all popular foes, but when facing unfavorable field conditions, they face similar struggles.</p> ",

        "name": "Sheer Force Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Landorus's claim to fame: backed by Sheer Force, it can deal huge amounts of damage, OHKOing many common threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Metagross and 2HKOing a large number of bulkier threats such as Kyurem-B. Sludge Bomb, also backed by Sheer Force, deals with Fairy- and Grass-types such as Tapu Lele, Lurantis, and Tapu Bulu, though another option is Stone Edge, which can take out Mega Charizard Y and allows Choice Scarf Landorus to outspeed and KO a boosted Volcarona. In the last of Landorus's attacking moveslots, Hidden Power Ice is a solid choice to allow Landorus to deal large amounts of damage to Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Zygarde. Finally, U-turn offers fast pivoting to a Choiced attacker, while Protect keeps Life Orb Landorus safe for the turn and helps it stall out opposing Tailwind and Trick Room, which would otherwise pose a large threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Landorus can take out fast Ground-weak threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Metagross or pivot out of bad matchups before having to tank a hit. This set can also use a Life Orb to further boost the power of Landorus's attacks with secondary effects; as a bonus, Sheer Force prevents recoil damage from the Life Orb. The given EV spread and nature maximize Landorus's Special Attack and Speed stats, allowing it to get the most damage and guaranteeing that it can outrun a boosted Volcarona and various popular Choice Scarf users like Genesect, Tapu Lele, and Victini. Life Orb sets will also outpace the denizens of the well-populated base 100 Speed tier.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Although Landorus's high-powered attacks are very threatening, its Speed tier and lack of general bulk put it at risk when against faster foes. Landorus is best used either early-game, to put severe dents in bulky foes to clear the way for the rest of the team, or late-game, to clean up a match once major threats to it have been removed and many bulkier foes have been put into range to be KOed by Earth Power. Choice Scarf sets make for decent leads, since a fast U-turn enables them to pivot out of potentially poor matchups. Despite its typing lending it immunities to both Ground- and Electric-type attacks, Landorus should not be switched in during a turn, as its mediocre bulk puts it at risk of taking heavy hits from opposing attacks; instead, Landorus is best brought in after a partner has been KOed or off the back of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Landorus's quadruple weakness to Ice means that it must be wary even around the Electric-types it should beat, as such foes, including Tapu Koko and Zapdos, are often either immune to Earth Power, can outspeed it and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ice, or both. Zapdos can further worsen Landorus's standing on the field speed-wise by setting up a Tailwind. Indeed, opposing speed control greatly threatens Landorus, as it prefers to move first in order to deal with threats before they can damage it; therefore, one's own speed control is key in order to allow it to continuously exert pressure on the opponent.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Genesect and Mega Metagross pair well with Landorus, appreciating its ability to beat Fire- and Steel-types with Earth Power while threatening Ice-types such as Kyurem-B for it. Other attackers like Tapu Lele and Nihilego also benefit from the removal of Fire- and Steel-types and can threaten Kyurem-B. Due to Landorus's glaring weakness to Water- and Ice-type attacks, it should be paired with one or more partners capable of switching into those, such as Tapu Fini or Suicune.</p> <p>Another important aspect of Landorus's potential teammates is their access to speed control, which Landorus appreciates greatly in order to keep it moving before its threats, allowing it to get the most use out of its devastating Earth Powers. This speed control can come in several forms, such as Icy Wind and Tailwind; notable users of each include Icy Wind Kyurem-B and Tailwind Zapdos and Suicune.</p> "

Landorus-T also naturally performs well against other common Pokemon in the metagame, most crucially Incineroar. However, as an incredibly common Pokemon itself, it will face solid checks on every well-built team. Still, Landorus-T should always find a way to be useful.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide deals decent spread damage with a helpful chance to induce flinches on the foes. Sludge Bomb is a decent option on the Choice Scarf set for teams that appreciate the removal of Tapu Bulu, netting a surprise KO on it and providing a way for Landorus-T to hit Tapu Fini super effectively. However, outside of this, it has little use. Landorus-T's all-around nature lends well to an Assault Vest set with either fully physical or mixed attacks. One move that could find its way onto Assault Vest sets as well as others is Superpower, which hits a variety of Steel-types like Ferrothorn harder than Ground-type STAB moves. Superpower is also a solid option on a Choice Band set, which capitalizes on Landorus-T's ability to inflict heavy spread damage through Earthquake or severely hurt bulky threats such as Chansey and Porygon2 with Superpower. Explosion also works well on such sets or those with a Choice Scarf equipped, though Landorus-T needs to be careful not to take out its own allies. Life Orb sets offer a different style of offense and typically tend to focus on special attacks like Earth Power, Hidden Power Ice, and Sludge Bomb. Swords Dance finds its way onto some Tectonic Rage sets as a way to combat the usage of Intimidate, but it is somewhat difficult to fit onto the set, and Landorus-T is hard to support as a setup user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Tapu Fini and Suicune are typically bulky enough to take an attack from Landorus-T and retaliate with a super effective STAB attack. Milotic is especially notable due to its Competitive enabling it to take advantage of Landorus-T's Intimidate. Kingdra in the rain outspeeds even Choice Scarf Landorus-T and can knock it out with any Water-type move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Kyurem-B is an incredibly threatening foe, as offensive sets outspeed and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T even through a potential Yache Berry. Many Pokemon also use Ice-type coverage specifically for Landorus-T, so watch out for those that can outspeed and KO it with such coverage like Genesect, Mega Metagross, and Mew. Zapdos and Porygon2 run Ice-type coverage and are bulky enough to take Landorus-T on defensively too, and both have access to speed control that's especially damaging to Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: With no readily available Flying-type STAB attack, Landorus-T is often unable to deal with Ground-immune Pokemon. Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Landorus-T with Overheat, only really fearing Choice Scarf Stone Edge sets. Zapdos also sets up Tailwind, while Cresselia carries Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Being outsped is mostly problematic for more offensive sets that don't have the bulky set's ability to take a hit and retaliate. Choice Scarf Genesect outspeeds all Landorus-T and threatens it with Ice Beam. Tornadus gets an Attack boost from Intimidate thanks to Defiant and hits hard with boosted Acrobatics, only really fearing Rock-type coverage moves. Tapu Lele has a fairly common Choice Scarf set to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and if Landorus-T isn't holding Choice Scarf, Life Orb or Psychium Z Tapu Lele can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Grassy Terrain: Earthquake sets have their primary mode of attack drastically weakened by Grassy Terrain, though Tectonic Rage doesn't have the same consequences. Grassy Terrain also lets foes benefit from passive healing that Landorus-T can't receive due to its Flying typing.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power provides consistent damage; although Landorus-T has higher base Attack, Earthquake is considerably weaker in many situations due to spread reduction, the prevalence of Intimidate users, and the potential for Grassy Terrain. U-turn synergizes quite well with Intimidate, allowing Landorus-T to enter the field, neuter opposing physical attackers, and pivot out while also hitting decently hard on targets that are weak to it such as Hoopa-U. Knock Off primarily works as a way to remove items such as Chansey's Eviolite, but it provides fairly consistent damage as well. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice covers opposing Landorus-T as well as Zygarde and Mega Salamence, all of which can otherwise take on this set somewhat effectively. Stealth Rock punishes pivot-dependent Pokemon like Incineroar, Kyurem-B, and Victini and makes opposing Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona considerably easier for Landorus-T's team to take down. Protect is always valuable in Doubles for scouting moves, stalling field conditions, and managing positioning, but it offers added value on a set such as this that rarely finds the room for it, as opponents won't necessarily assume that Landorus-T carries the move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With the provided spread, Landorus-T gains the ability to take two common Ice-type moves in -1 Mega Metagross's Ice Punch and Life Orb Tapu Koko's Hidden Power Ice. 136 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature ensure the OHKO on offensive Kartana sets with Earth Power. The remaining 48 EVs are dumped in Speed so that Landorus-T will outspeed Modest Pelipper naturally and Deoxys-A in Tailwind; if Landorus-T's team lacks Tailwind support, these can be moved to Special Attack for a slower U-turn against other Landorus-T that have the given investment. Landorus-T can also go even bulkier, with a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 96 SpA / 96 SpD with a Calm nature allowing it to tank 0 Atk Kartana's Bloom Doom or +0 Genesect's Ice Beam while still being able to OHKO uninvested Tapu Koko with Earth Power. An Iapapa Berry provides significant recovery when Landorus-T is low on health, which greatly augments its ability to serve as a successful pivot.</p> <p>Alternatively, Landorus-T might benefit more from a Yache Berry, which gives it the ability to take considerably stronger Ice-type moves without fainting. If this choice is made, a spread of 224 HP / 32 Def / 136 SpA / 116 Spe and a Modest nature should be used. With this, Landorus-T is guaranteed to take +1 Genesect's Ice Beam and outspeed up to +1 Volcarona in Tailwind, with enough Special Attack EVs to KO offensive Kartana with Earth Power and the remaining investment dumped in Defense. Regardless of item choice, there are many viable Speed benchmarks available; for example, with 88 Speed, Landorus-T will outrun Modest Volcanion and, in Tailwind, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T functions brilliantly as a lead for a variety of reasons; it provides attack control from Intimidate, it offers the opportunity to set Stealth Rock early, it can scout foes' Speed tiers based on the timing of Intimidate's activation, and with U-turn, it can pivot out of bad matchups. Setting Stealth Rock early is hugely beneficial in many matchups for sets running the move, but it's by no means required, so use your own judgment on whether it could offer enough benefits over the course of the game. If the opponent has a guaranteed safe switch-in to Landorus-T, it's usually best to use U-turn on the switch to retain momentum. Alternatively, Knock Off works as a way to punish bulky Pokemon that otherwise don't fear Landorus-T such as Tapu Fini and Suicune. Switching Landorus-T in can be useful not only to protect the teammate that switches out but also to help an ally Pokemon take an incoming physical attack, so consider both slots when deciding whether Landorus-T should enter the field. This benefit makes Landorus-T useful throughout the game, especially upon switch-in when it activates Intimidate, so pivot it often.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nearly every team can benefit from this set's support; it fits easily onto most builds. Physically frail Pokemon appreciate Intimidate, so Mega Charizard Y, Hoopa-U, and Mega Gardevoir all benefit greatly from Landorus-T's presence. Bulky Water-types are best left for teammates to handle, so Landorus-T should be paired with checks such as Tapu Bulu, Mega Manectric, and Volcanion, which it can send in through U-turn. Similarly, Steel-types take incoming Ice-type moves for Landorus-T and check Kyurem-B. In return, Landorus-T beats Fire-types for them. Some especially notable examples include Mega Scizor, which benefits strongly from Stealth Rock support; Genesect, which forms a pivoting core with Landorus-T; and Kartana, which handily beats down opposing Water-types.</p> "

        "name": "Tectonic Rage",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a powerful spread STAB attack that works especially well on this set due to Landorus-T's item unlocking the ability to use Tectonic Rage. With this Z-Move, Landorus-T can circumvent all the issues Earthquake has, as Tectonic Rage won't hit its ally, doesn't have any spread reduction, and isn't weakened by Grassy Terrain. Rock-type coverage ensures that Landorus-T can punish Flying-type foes that avoid Earthquake, and it has a few options for such moves. Stone Edge hits the hardest of these options, though some teams may prefer the speed control offered by Rock Tomb. U-turn provides a way to pivot safely out to an ally when faced with a poor matchup or to retain momentum on a predicted switch. Thanks to Protect, Landorus-T can scout the opposing Pokemon's moves, shield itself from damage while an ally deals with a threat, and stall out harmful field conditions, including Grassy Terrain. Stealth Rock support is quite valuable in some fights, punishing opposing teams with Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type threats that like to switch around often.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With 180 EVs invested into Speed, Landorus-T will outrun all Volcanion and most Zapdos, hitting the former with Tectonic Rage before Steam Eruption can KO Landorus-T. If Landorus-T has Rock Tomb, you may want to bump this up to 212 EVs to outspeed Mega Manectric after a Speed drop. Either way, Landorus-T should use maximum investment into its Attack to take full advantage of Tectonic Rage, with the rest dumped in HP for general bulk. If you want instead to use more bulk, just make sure Landorus-T still has 116 EVs in its Attack and an Adamant nature so that it can OHKO minimally invested Mega Metagross with -1 Tectonic Rage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T works well as a pivot throughout the match thanks to Intimidate and U-turn. If the opponent has used Intimidate to cripple Landorus-T or Grassy Terrain is set, Landorus-T is usually better off pivoting directly or switching out with U-turn. You could also handle Grassy Terrain in a couple other ways; you could switch in a different Island Guardian, enabling Landorus-T's Earthquake to be fully effective, or you could use Tectonic Rage to hit the foe on which you most wanted Earthquake damage without any reduction. Tectonic Rage is also useful for taking out a bulky foe, ensuring a knockout on a weakened target that may use Protect, or dealing decent Ground-type damage without hurting Landorus-T's ally. If Landorus-T is carrying Stealth Rock, it's most beneficial when set towards the beginning of the match to maximize damage over the course of the game. However, it's by no means essential, so don't feel that Landorus-T must use Stealth Rock if the entry hazard isn't yet set.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain greatly weakens Landorus-T's main form of attack in Earthquake, so Landorus-T should be paired with another Island Guardian to summon a competing Terrain. Tapu Koko is especially notable thanks to its positive matchup against Water- and Flying-types. Some form of speed control, the most noteworthy being Tailwind, ensures that Landorus-T can get off its hard hits before ideal targets such as Mega Manectric, Kyurem-B, and Mega Metagross KO it or pivot out. Tailwind is best provided by Zapdos or Kartana; like Tapu Koko, these can also help against Water-types. You should be sure to pack answers to opposing Landorus-T, which is very common and walls this set. Tapu Fini works well here, removing Grassy Terrain and using either Heal Pulse to keep Landorus-T healthy or Calm Mind to clean late-game after Landorus-T punches through an obstacle with Tectonic Rage. Ground-immune teammates let Landorus-T use Earthquake more freely, so be sure to carry at least one. Zapdos and Tornadus are a couple decent options; Wide Guard Aegislash accomplishes the goal of having a teammate to click Earthquake next to in a different way.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Landorus-T's most widely usable STAB attack that won't be affected by Intimidate, making it a fantastic move for a Choice Scarf set. U-turn makes Landorus-T a fast pivot, which is quite useful for positioning management. Hidden Power Ice hits opposing Landorus-T and revenge kills +1 Zygarde and Mega Salamence, two foes that outspeed other Landorus-T sets and can largely ignore its other moves. Landorus-T only really needs the first three moves to succeed in its role, so its last slot is quite flexible. Stone Edge offers considerably more damage than Hidden Power Ice against some Flying-types, like Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos, which avoid Earth Power. Defog is a decent fourth slot option for teams with Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona that can't afford to leave Stealth Rock on the field. Stealth Rock is another fringe option for this last slot; however, locking into Stealth Rock can be risky, as it necessitates that Landorus-T switch the following turn to avoid losing momentum.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Power and Speed are maximized with a Modest nature to help this set thrive as a fast attacker and a Choice Scarf further augments its Speed. Some teams may prefer a Timid nature on Choice Scarf Landorus-T, as this ensures the set will outspeed Deoxys-A and fully invested Zeraora; however, it already gets the jump on every other relevant foe, and the power dropoff is fairly significant, giving Mega Manectric a chance to survive Earth Power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T works great as a lead thanks to its ability to pivot out quickly with U-turn and weaken incoming attacks from the get-go. The timing of Intimidate's activation also allows you to check for other potential Choice Scarf users, most of which will outspeed this set. For example, if Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge or Genesect's Download activates before Landorus-T's Intimidate, they are guaranteed to also be carrying a Choice Scarf. However, this can also reveal Landorus-T's set to your opponent, so if this information is best kept secret, it may be best to avoid leading with Landorus-T. This way, it can be used for a surprise KO on a threat that would normally outspeed and threaten Landorus-T, such as Mega Manectric or Mega Charizard Y, if carrying Stone Edge. Be careful to avoid locking Landorus-T into a move that's easily taken advantage of by the opponent, especially if that opponent has Gothitelle to potentially trap Landorus-T on the field using an unhelpful move. Without any defensive investment, this set isn't particularly bulky, so avoid trying to use it as a defensive check if it's needed later on to outspeed and take down a particular enemy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teams that appreciate Landorus-T's offensive matchups but need it especially for faster foes will benefit most from this set. However, with mediocre defenses, Landorus-T will need additional teammates to patch up holes against foes that it would normally be able to handle alone. Incineroar is the most notable example, as Landorus-T will fear losing its Choice Scarf to Knock Off and is hit fairly hard by -1 Flare Blitz. Volcanion and Tapu Fini are valuable teammates for this reason; they both also appreciate Landorus-T's ability to handle Mega Manectric and Tapu Koko. Teammates that take advantage of typical switch-ins to Landorus-T are excellent for retaining momentum if Landorus-T hits these switch-ins with U-turn as they enter the field. Tapu Koko and Kartana prey on bulky Water-types, while Mega Charizard Y takes out Kyurem-B with Overheat and easily handles Grass-types. Mega Charizard Y also benefits from Landorus-T's ability to spare a moveslot for Defog support.</p> "

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Ice Beam, Earth Power, and Fusion Bolt gives Kyurem-B a unique set of moves that can strongly damage a lot of common Pokemon in the metagame, especially those used on bulky offense, such as Landorus-T, Incineroar, Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, Zapdos, and Zygarde. Kyurem-B can be unpredictable, with incredibly potent Life Orb and Icium Z sets. Icium Z, in particular, allows Kyurem-B to harness the sheer power of its otherwise unusable signature move Freeze Shock and its underutilized base 170 Attack, which in combination output a ton of damage and can easily take OHKOs even on neutral hits, letting a player easily remove key threats on opposing teams. On top of its offenses, Kyurem-B has very solid defenses and access to Icy Wind, which allows it to also effectively run a more supportive role with an Assault Vest. This ability to effectively run a variety of powerful sets, along with the ease with which it fits on teams, gives Kyurem-B a solid place in the metagame. However, Kyurem-B's very unfortunate Speed tier leaves its offensive sets outsped by fast attackers such as Mega Metagross and Kartana and the Assault Vest set slower than some bulkier foes it wants to threaten such as Zygarde and Zapdos. Because of its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of a recovery option, Assault Vest Kyurem-B is easily chipped down and is rarely at full health to take on all the foes you want it to. Additionally, even if it lands a super effective hit, Kyurem-B won't be doing very much damage against bulkier Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Aegislash.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In terms of alternative items, an Electrium Z set can be used to bluff another item while giving Kyurem-B access to a powerful Electric-type attack that can OHKO Celesteela and Tapu Fini, while a Choice Scarf set allows Kyurem-B to outrun and get a surprise KO on notable Pokemon, such as +1 Zygarde, Deoxys-A, Mega Salamence, and Tapu Koko. Kyurem-B's expansive movepool offers it a wide range of options for moves too. Draco Meteor provides Life Orb Kyurem-B a strong hit on Gothitelle, opposing Kyurem-B, and a majority of the metagame provided that Misty Terrain isn't set. Substitute is a decent set that can offer Kyurem-B safety and provide its team a bit of momentum, losing out on the ability to threaten Tapu Fini and Celesteela in exchange for improved positioning while it can still threaten a majority of the metagame with only Ice Beam and Earth Power. Focus Blast, especially paired with a Fightinium Z, allows Kyurem-B to punch through some walls that it otherwise wouldn't be able to strongly damage such as Incineroar and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Despite having Earth Power, Kyurem-B won't be doing very much damage to Steel-types, bar Heatran, because of the lack of a STAB boost and Kyurem-B's low Special Attack stat. Aegislash can tank an Earth Power and threaten Kyurem-B with Flash Cannon, while Mega Metagross and Genesect can both outrun and threaten Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Scrafty takes any of Kyurem-B's attacks with ease and can remove its Assault Vest with Knock Off or deal heavy damage with a Fighting-type STAB move. Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Hoopa-U, and Landorus-T are often threatened by Kyurem-B, but with the right Speed control and chip damage, they can take it down.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Gardevoir can outrun Kyurem-B and do massive damage to it with Hyper Voice, while Tapu Lele can tank any hit other than Subzero Slammer from Kyurem-B and also do massive damage to it with Moonblast. If using a Life Orb, Kyurem-B also has to risk a potential Speed tie against Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon with high Special Defense stats, most notably Tyranitar and Chansey, can shrug off most of Kyurem-B's attacks. Tyranitar can threaten Kyurem-B with a Rock-type attack, while Chansey can chip away at Kyurem-B or heal up.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Icium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Freeze Shock acts as the base move for Kyurem-B's Subzero Slammer and is the main driving force behind its power, becoming a one-use 200-Base Power move capable of breaking down or outright KOing a wide range of opposing threats. Fusion Bolt gets excellent coverage with Kyurem-B's Ice-type STAB moves and allows it to deal heavy damage to the Water-types that resist its Z-Move, such as Tapu Fini and Milotic, while Ice Beam grants Kyurem-B a consistent Ice-type STAB move to use even after its Z-Move has been expended. Finally, Protect rounds out the set, allowing it to maneuver around potential deadly attacks to give it a greater chance to successfully fire off its Z-Move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set utilizes Icium Z to turn Kyurem-B's Freeze Shock into an extremely powerful but one-use attack, so speed and power are maximized. A Hasty nature is used instead of a Naive nature to slightly bolster Kyurem-B's matchup against Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main selling point is Subzero Slammer, which is great for removing a key threat from an opposing team. Generally, semi-bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar, Tapu Lele, and Gothitelle don't expect to be OHKOed by Kyurem-B and can thus be good targets to remove early due to their tendency to stay in against Kyurem-B. On the other hand, don't use Subzero Slammer carelessly, and try to avoid using it into a Protect or a resisting switch-in, since it's this set's main form of damage output, with the set becoming significantly weaker once it's used. The set is also far less bulky than an Assault Vest set, so Kyurem-B should stay away from potential super effective hits unless it's definitely able to remove the transgressor before it takes a hit itself. In a similar vein, attempt to bring Kyurem-B in before Stealth Rock goes up in a game, since the number of hits it can reasonably take is greatly hindered by the 25% chip damage from Stealth Rock. As long as it's not in direct danger of being KOed, though, Kyurem-B can almost always do significant damage each turn, so it's generally beneficial to play it aggressively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Icium Z Kyurem-B is mainly used to chunk or KO key threats on an opposing team and thus is often used over other Kyurem-B sets alongside typical strong cleaners and endgame sweepers: Choice Band Zygarde, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Calm Mind Tapu Fini are all great examples of Pokemon weak to a small group of specific threats that appreciate Kyurem-B's ability to outright remove those threats. In terms of supporting Kyurem-B itself, offensive Tailwind setters like Zapdos and Kartana are great options to ameliorate Kyurem-B's rather medicore Speed tier while keeping up with the offensive pressure it exerts. Tapu Koko can further enhance Kyurem-B's offensive presence, boosting Fusion Bolt's power by setting Electric Terrain and heavily threatening the bulky Water-types that tend to try to switch in to resist Kyurem-B's Ice-type moves.</p> <p>A number of Pokemon also synergize well with Kyurem-B offensively. Volcanion can offensively threaten Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn, which can deal large amounts of damage to Kyurem-B and doesn't take much from its attacks, while it also appreciates Kyurem-B's tendency to force out Volcanion's largest threats in opposing Landorus-T and Zygarde. On the other hand, a Landorus-T and Zygarde alongside Kyurem-B are also good options to check Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Tapu Koko, which offensively threaten Kyurem-B; Landorus-T's Intimidate also makes Kyurem-B harder to remove in general and gives it more opportunities to fire off its Z-Move. Finally, slow pivots like Landorus-T and Incineroar make it easier to bring Kyurem-B into play safely off the back of a U-turn, preventing it from taking unnecessary damage on the switch in and thus giving it a greater chance of successfully firing off its Z-Move.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's most reliable Ice-type STAB attack and lets it hit common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, Zygarde, and Amoonguss, for super effective damage. Earth Power, alongside Ice Beam, gives Kyurem-B perfect neutral coverage and allows it to hit Heatran and Tapu Koko super effectively. Fusion Bolt rounds out the set by allowing Kyurem-B to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, such as Tapu Fini and Mega Charizard Y, for super effective damage. Icy Wind adds to Kyurem-B's utility by giving it a speed control option. Hidden Power Fire is an option over Earth Power or Ice Beam, as it allows Kyurem-B to threaten Kartana, Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs with 48 Defense EVs allows Kyurem-B to switch in on a Choice Band Zygarde's Thousand Arrows, even with Stealth Rock on the field, and avoid the KO from a second Thousand Arrows so that it gets the chance to attack. In addition, Kyurem-B is guaranteed to take an opposing Icium Z Kyurem-B's Subzero Slammer. 96 Attack EVs allow Kyurem-B to OHKO mimimally invested Mega Charizard Y and 2HKO standard Tapu Fini with Fusion Bolt. 80 Speed EVs ensure that, even with a Speed-reducing nature, Kyurem-B outruns Landorus after an Icy Wind drop. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack; in conjunction with a Quiet nature, this allows Kyurem-B to remain an offensive threat. Those wanting to use a faster Kyurem-B should note that Speed may not be the most efficient stat to reduce with Kyurem-B's nature. Assault Vest takes advantage of Kyurem-B's high natural bulk by boosting its Special Defense and allows it to tank attacks that it normally wouldn't, such as taking Life Orb Tapu Lele's Moonblast and surviving two hits from Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam. Teravolt further adds to Kyurem-B's utility, as it is able to ignore abilities and get a \"true\" super effective hit on Pokemon like Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set takes advantage of Kyurem-B's high base defensive stats by investing more in its bulk. While it tends to miss out on KOs that more offensive sets can get, such as against Celesteela and Mega Charizard Y, the added bulk that this set provides allows Kyurem-B to survive more attacks, and Icy Wind gives it added utility. Additionally, with Kyurem-B's high base offensive stats, it will still usually 2HKO those Pokemon even without extra investment. Despite this set's focus on bulk, Kyurem-B is still able to KO key Pokemon, such as Zygarde and Landorus-T. Unlike more offensive variants, the point of this set isn't to snipe common Pokemon in the metagame and punch holes, but rather to support the team with Icy Wind while still being able to weaken common bulky Pokemon, such as Tapu Fini and Celesteela. Don't attack unless using a super effective move because this set won't be doing much damage otherwise. Icy Wind as speed control is almost always the better option unless you need more chip damage on a Pokemon for Kyurem-B's teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B can work on a multitude of teams. Pokemon that benefit from speed control, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Tapu Lele, are great partners for this set. Mega Gardevoir and Tapu Lele, while both adding to the Steel-type weakness, are powerful Pokemon that can deal massive damage to the opponent's team. They can also both threaten Fighting-types while Kyurem-B can threaten certain Steel-types, such as Heatran and Celesteela. Mega Diancie benefits greatly from Kyurem-B's ability to threaten common Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Salamence, which lower the power of its main move, Diamond Storm. Most teams also lack solid Rock-resistant Pokemon, so Diancie benefits greatly from the speed control that Kyurem-B provides. Fire-types, such as Volcanion, can take out Steel-types that pressure Kyurem-B, such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Kyurem-B, in return, can switch into Tapu Koko easily and threaten it out while also beating Landorus-T and Zygarde. Both must be wary of Rock-types, however. Despite the added Special Defense boost from Assault Vest, Kyurem-B will still take massive damage from Fairy-type attacks and can't do much back to them, so Steel-types, such as Genesect and Mega Metagross, are great partners to take out common Fairy-types. Kyurem-B becomes a solid check to rain teams when paired with Tapu Fini because Misty Terrain weakens the power of Kingdra's Dragon-type attacks. Tapu Fini also has access to Heal Pulse, which can increase Kyurem-B's longevity and mitigate its lack of a solid recovery option.</p> "

        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's best Ice-type STAB attack and allows it to hit common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, Tapu Bulu, and Amoonguss, for super effective damage. Fusion Bolt greatly threatens Pokemon that would otherwise wall Kyurem-B, such as Tapu Fini and Suicune. Earth Power completes Kyurem-B's perfect neutral coverage while also allowing it to hit Incineroar and Tapu Koko super effectively. Protect shields Kyurem-B from a potential fatal hit and can allow its partner to deal with the threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Hasty nature allows Kyurem-B to outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Speed tie with Tapu Lele. A Hasty nature is used over a Naive nature because Kyurem-B's typing makes it a passable switch-in to Electric- and Water-type attacks, which are primarily special. With a Life Orb and 144 Special Attack EVs, Kyurem-B can OHKO Tapu Koko with Earth Power; dumping the rest into Attack allows Kyurem-B to 2HKO even the bulkiest Tapu Fini with Fusion Bolt. If Kyurem-B has Stealth Rock support, it can instead use 180 Special Attack EVs to OHKO Mega Manectric after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem-B works best early- and mid-game to punch holes in the opponent's team. However, it gets worn down easily due to Life Orb, so try to bring it in on free switches or weaker resisted hits, such as Tapu Fini's Muddy Water or Zapdos's Thunderbolt. It is best to retain as much health as possible so that Kyurem-B can pressure the opponent's team more. Because Kyurem-B gets worn down easily, try to not attack foes unless through a super effective hit or if they're about to faint. Due to Kyurem-B's threatening presence, it is common for the opponent to switch around their Pokemon to wear it down, so sometimes it is better to go for a read rather than a super effective hit, especially against Pokemon that can't do much damage to Kyurem-B, such as Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B is very widely usable. Aegislash has access to Wide Guard so it can shield Kyurem-B from common threatening spread moves, such as Diamond Storm, Dazzling Gleam, and Icy Wind. Aegislash can also switch into Fighting-, Fairy-, and Steel-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-B. It can then force out Pokemon that threaten Kyurem-B, such as Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele. Kyurem-B, in return, can threaten common Aegislash answers, such as Volcanion and Landorus-T. Kyurem-B works great on rain teams, as it can threaten common rain answers, such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, and Amoonguss. Rain teams also make great use of Kyurem-B's ability to punch holes in the opponent's team by allowing Kingdra to spam Muddy Water late-game. Pokemon with speed control work well with Kyurem-B, since this allows it to outrun threats such as Mega Salamence and Tapu Koko and KO them. Kartana has access to Tailwind while also benefiting greatly from Kyurem-B's ability to remove Zapdos and dent Incineroar. Tapu Koko can provide Electric Terrain, which helps Kyurem-B by further boosting the power of its Fusion Bolt.</p> "

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect has a nice niche in Doubles OU as a strong offensive pivot with great coverage that can OHKO prominent threats such as Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Mega Salamence. It can also OHKO what is arguably the best Trick Room setter in Diancie while denting others with its STAB U-turn and gaining momentum easily. While Genesect does have a lot going for it, it has a poor matchup against common Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcanion. Genesect's awkward base 99 Speed means that it's often reliant on a Choice Scarf, which makes Genesect very weak to opposing speed control and also locks it into one move, though it does allow Genesect to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. Despite having good defenses and a solid typing, Genesect's bulk is surprisingly poor; it even struggles to switch into some resisted moves such as Tapu Lele's Psychic, and being a mixed attacker forces it to run a Hasty or Naive nature, further lowering its bulk. This can be somewhat circumvented by opting for an Assault Vest set, but that leaves Genesect slower than many of the threats it wants to check. Overall, Genesect is a solid choice for teams needing a fast answer to Fairy- and Psychic-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Electroweb can be used on the Offensive Pivot set for a means of reliable Speed control. A Life Orb, Z-Crystal, or Expert Belt set can give Genesect more power, but the other item options are strong enough that these niche picks are rarely worthwhile. Explosion can be used for powerful spread damage, especially if Genesect gets an Attack boost from Download. Thunderbolt is an option to hit Mega Charizard Y and Volcanion for good damage, with 124 Special Attack EVs guaranteeing a 2HKO on minimally invested Mega Charizard Y without the Download boost. Energy Ball is a good option to hit Adamant Mega Swampert in rain, as Genesect with a Choice Scarf can outspeed it. Bug Bite can be useful on Assault Vest sets for its ability to punish Incineroar or Volcanion on the switch and heal up while also improving some of Genesect's more neutral matchups against foes like Tapu Fini. Genesect has considerably more solid options than available moveslots or itemslots, so make sure your choices work best for the team it's found on.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Genesect does pitiful damage to Fire-types such as Incineroar, Volcanion, and Mega Charizard Y and is OHKOed by them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: If running Gunk Shot, Genesect is walled by all Steel-types. Although it can strike back somewhat if running Flamethrower, Genesect is still walled by Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis, Trick Room, and Tailwind: Choice Scarf Genesect's biggest draw is its very high Speed.

However, its damage output is not completely neutered by these, as Genesect can also still use U-turn to gain momentum. Other Intimidate users Landorus-T and Salamence also cannot reliably answer Genesect due to Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn is STAB boosted and allows Genesect to quickly pivot out of poor matchups and gain momentum on opposing switches. Iron Head allows Genesect to hit Fairy-types hard, notably scoring an OHKO on Tapu Lele and a 2HKO on Tapu Koko. Ice Beam is used to threaten common Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Zygarde and Mega Salamence. Flamethrower covers many Fire-weak foes like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and opposing Genesect, but Gunk Shot can OHKO Tapu Koko and does considerably more damage to Tapu Fini than Iron Head.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Genesect can outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame, including key threats such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Tapu Lele, and hit them hard with a strong super effective move or pivot out with U-turn before being hit. The 252 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature allow Genesect to outspeed Landorus-T and Tapu Lele, as well as Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Genesect. 96 Special Attack EVs ensure that Ice Beam will KO standard non-Yache Berry Landorus-T, even without a Download boost. With this investment, +0 Flamethrower is also guaranteed a 2HKO on Mega Metagross. The remaining investment goes towards powering up Genesect's Iron Head and U-turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>U-turn should be used during the early and middle stages of the battle to scout the foe's moves and to punch holes in the opposing team while keeping Genesect healthy for later in the battle. Make the most of U-turn's ability to let you pivot into a good matchup. Genesect makes for an excellent revenge killer due to its high Speed and Download-boosted attacks, but only bring it in on weak resisted attacks or when a teammate has fainted, as Genesect has relatively low bulk. It is important to remember that Genesect is 2HKOed by some of the threats it is meant to check, such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Genesect's pivoting capabilities make for good partners, such as Mega Salamence and Heatran. Mega Salamence and Heatran can set up a Dragon Dance and Substitute, respectively, on the Steel- and Fire-types that Genesect typically lures in. Other good partners are Dragon- and Fighting-types that appreciate Genesect's ability to check Fairy- and Psychic-types like Deoxys-A and Tapu Lele. In return, Dragon-types can resist Fire-type attacks and Fighting-types can greatly weaken Steel-types to help Genesect.</p> <p>Genesect's most important trait is its high Speed with a Choice Scarf equipped, so Pokemon that can shut down opposing speed control pair well with it. This includes Taunt users, such as Tapu Lele, Gyarados, and Tapu Koko. Genesect also appreciates speed control from its own team in the form of Icy Wind, Tailwind, or Thunder Wave. Solid Trick Room checks are also necessary, as Genesect's high Speed and low bulk make it particularly vulnerable to Trick Room. As Genesect usually lures in Fire-types, it appreciates partners that are capable of taking advantage of them; examples include Volcanion, Hydreigon, Terrakion, and Landorus-T.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn allows Genesect to be an effective pivot, dealing considerable damage while generating momentum. It can hit neutral foes surprisingly hard, especially after a Download boost. Iron Head is capable of dealing big damage to targets weak to it, such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Bulu, Tyranitar, and Tapu Lele, as well as to neutral foes such as Tapu Koko at +1. Ice Beam hits Landorus-T, Zygarde, Zapdos, and Amoonguss, all of which wouldn't really mind any of Genesect's other moves. Its last move is quite flexible, depending a lot on the team's composition. Flamethrower is Genesect's best bet against the likes of Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Steel-types in general. Meanwhile, Gunk Shot deals reliable damage to Tapu Fini and guarantees a KO on Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko. Lastly, Extreme Speed lets Genesect pick off weakened targets at +1 and outright KO Deoxys-A with the correct Terrain management.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest doesn't restrict Genesect to one move like Choice items do and also provides a useful bonus to its Special Defense, which makes it a better switch-in to Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Deoxys-A. Alternatively, Genesect can use a Wiki Berry for a boost of health; with the amount of pivoting it tends to do, it's common to have Genesect chipped into low health, especially factoring Stealth Rock damage. The Speed investment alongside a Hasty nature lets Genesect get the jump on Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, while the Special Attack EVs let it 2HKO Mega Metagross with Flamethrower regardless of its Download boost. The rest of the EVs are allocated to its Attack stat to maximize U-turn and Iron Head damage. A Hasty nature is preferred to boost Speed, as Genesect can't afford to lower any other of its stats. A bulkier EV spread of 136 HP / 112 Atk / 36 SpD / 224 Spe with the same nature keeps the same Speed benchmark while maintaining enough Attack to OHKO Tapu Lele without a Download boost and achieving enough special bulk to avoid an OHKO from Kingdra's Hydro Pump-based Hydro Vortex in rain. Alternatively, Genesect could use a Naive nature with 72 HP and 4 Defense EVs to ensure its survival of Kartana's All-out Pummeling. Download gives Genesect boosts to either attacking stat, letting it step up its damage output considerably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to the added bulk provided by Assault Vest, Genesect can withstand some hits from Kyurem-B and Tapu Lele and offensively check them. That doesn't mean you should be reckless while using it; if it is your only method of dealing with faster threats like Deoxys-A, Genesect should be kept healthy to check them. It's usually ideal to hit foes with super effective moves, regardless of the boost granted by Download. If Genesect packs Electroweb, keep in mind it shouldn't really be used for damage, but rather for the Speed drop.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Genesect can force Fire-types to come in, so the likes of Volcanion, Zygarde, and Tyranitar pair well with it to take advantage of them. Physical attackers appreciate the fact that they can come in via Genesect's U-turn, as the opponent's Intimidate user would likely already be on field to neutralize Genesect before it pivots into them. Methods of speed control are appreciated to make up for Genesect's only decent Speed. Tailwind from the likes of Zapdos and Suicune is an excellent method of doing so, but Icy Wind users such as Tapu Fini and Kyurem-B are also noteworthy. Finally, countermeasures against Trick Room are quite important considering how vulnerable Genesect is to it. The aforementioned Suicune can phaze Trick Room setters with Roar, whereas Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Fake Out users such as Incineroar also stand out.</p> "

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>Spread attacks are extremely valuable in Doubles, and Zygarde possesses a fantastic one in Thousand Arrows, which allows it to hit even Flying-types and Levitate users with its Ground-type STAB attack. This leaves Zygarde with only a few Pokemon that can reliably take its attacks due to many otherwise resistant Bug- and Grass-types having a secondary typing weak to Ground. With such a fantastic spread move in its arsenal, Zygarde makes a great user of either Choice Band or Dragon Dance sets, with the former using Zygarde's tendency to need only Thousand Arrows for damage to its advantage and the latter taking advantage of the strong spread damage to clean the opposition. Zygarde's offensive stats aren't anything overly impressive, but its bulk provides it many chances to get attacks off or boost up with Dragon Dance, and access to Extreme Speed weakens the impact its mediocre Speed would otherwise have on its effectiveness. However, with an already average Attack stat and a primary STAB attack weakened by nature of being a spread move, Zygarde's damage output is quite dependent on it avoiding Intimidate, a difficult task with most teams carrying threats with that ability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Choice Band sets' flexibility, a variety of other moves have some niche on select teams. Stone Edge offers extra coverage, Stomping Tantrum hits Wide Guard Aegislash, and Iron Tail surprises Tapu Bulu, which would otherwise be a fantastic check to Zygarde. Iron Tail can also be used on Dragon Dance sets along with Steelium Z, as Corkscrew Crash allows Zygarde to do significant damage to erstwhile answers like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Lele. Leftovers offers Substitute Zygarde sets passive recovery after it cuts its own HP, and Protect also helps Zygarde stall for recovery. Zygarde's impressive bulk for such an offensive Pokemon makes a Weakness Policy set worth consideration, as the +2 boost following its ability to take a super effective attack makes Zygarde especially threatening. With the popularity of various metagame threats that are 4x weak to Ice, Ice-type coverage is everywhere; a Yache Berry provides a bit of security there, most notably improving Zygarde's matchup against Mega Metagross and Kyurem-B. Fightinium Z with Superpower offers Zygarde a way to take out Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Kyurem-B, which may be helpful for some rain teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Kyurem-B and Alolan Ninetales easily take out Zygarde with their Ice-type STAB attacks. Ice-type coverage is also fairly common thanks to the popularity of Zygarde and Landorus-T, so various other threats can scare out Zygarde. Most notably, this list includes Choice Scarf Genesect and Ice Punch Mega Metagross, which can outrun and OHKO most variants of Zygarde, with the former even taking on +1 Zygarde.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Thousand Arrows circumvents Ground-type moves' inability to hit Flying-types, but Grass-types still take the attack easily thanks to their resistance. Thus, Tapu Bulu and Ludicolo are two of the few reliable switch-ins to Zygarde, with both also commonly carrying ways to deal with Zygarde offensively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Even without a Dragon-type move in its arsenal for them to take advantage of, Fairy-types still tend to have the bulk to stomach at least one hit from Zygarde, and their STAB attacks hit it hard. Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini are two of the most prevalent examples in this category, with the former even blocking Extreme Speed thanks to Psychic Surge.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Tailwind and Trick Room circumvent especially Dragon Dance Zygarde's ability to move first, removing that advantage and lessening Zygarde's effectiveness. Kartana and Mew are common users of the former, while the latter is especially threatening from Porygon2 and Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Intimidate users including Landorus-T and Scrafty are threatening for every physical attacker, and Zygarde is no exception. Their effect is somewhat mitigated by Dragon Dance, but each time an Intimidate Pokemon enters the field, Zygarde is forced to use Dragon Dance again to regain its previous power levels.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Thousand Arrows is by far Zygarde's most useful attack, and Wide Guard users, especially Araquanid and Celesteela, block it. They are especially powerful against Choice Band Zygarde sets, as those are unable to circumvent Wide Guard.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thousand Arrows operates as Zygarde's primary attack and the main reason its Choice Band set is effective, offering powerful spread damage that hits every foe. Extreme Speed picks off weakened foes and adds to Zygarde's late-game cleaning ability, hitting decently hard thanks to the Choice Band boost. The remaining moveslots are largely filler, and thus they are used for very specific targets or matchups that the team struggles with. Unlike Thousand Arrows, Superpower OHKOes Tyranitar, and it also hits Ferrothorn harder and takes a chunk out of Kyurem-B. Dragon Tail forces the target to switch, making it useful for preventing opposing setup—primarily of Trick Room. Thousand Waves offers redundant coverage with Thousand Arrows and can't hit Flying-type foes, but it is a superior move in some situations due to its ability to trap targets.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Choice Band offers impressive power behind Zygarde's moves without the need to set up, which is especially useful thanks to Zygarde's rare need to use any attacks other than Thousand Arrows. Zygarde's Attack is maximized to go along with this goal. With the given spread, Zygarde is guaranteed to outspeed Modest Kingdra in neutral conditions, either with its own Tailwind up in the rain or with no field effect present. The split between HP and Special Defense EVs prevents Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Moonblast from OHKOing Zygarde.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The only move Zygarde should be using most of the time is Thousand Arrows, with its other moves best reserved for specific threats. With its other moves, Zygarde risks being locked into a move the opponent can take advantage of later. If this happens, you should switch Zygarde out to regain momentum. After incurring Intimidate drops, Zygarde's damage output will become very disappointing, so it should be switched out to reset those drops. This particular set works during all points in the game, either breaking down threats for a teammate to close out the game or cleaning up weakened foes. Retaining Zygarde's HP isn't overly important for this set to do its job, but playing too recklessly is never advisable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Ludicolo are some of the few foes that resist Thousand Arrows, so Kyurem-B and Genesect are solid partners. Since sets lacking Dragon Dance have mediocre Speed, Tailwind support from Zapdos or Suicune allows Zygarde to take on faster foes without resorting to Extreme Speed. With Choice Band locking Zygarde into an attack, it will need teammates to pivot in; Steel-types, such as Genesect, Mega Metagross, and Mega Scizor, are the best options for this role, as they can take the Ice- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Zygarde. Milotic helps preserve Zygarde's power by deterring Intimidate users from switching in, also appreciating Zygarde's handling of Electric-types. Tapu Koko and other Electric-types take out bulky Water-types, which often carry an attack that will hit Zygarde for significant damage. They also help Zygarde out against Araquanid, which boasts a resistance to Thousand Arrows and access to Wide Guard to stop a locked Zygarde from doing its job.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thousand Arrows provides Zygarde with a fantastic tool for dealing damage to both foes, even circumventing Ground-immune targets. That alone serves as Zygarde's best way to attack, so the next moveslot is dedicated to patching up a few issues to make cleaning with Thousand Arrows easier, with Substitute shielding it from status and ensuring survival of most hits and Extreme Speed allowing Zygarde to pick off frail faster foes. Dragon Dance boosts Zygarde's power and Speed, making up for its mediocre Speed tier and the spread reduction on its main attack. Protect shields Zygarde from damage while it stalls out opposing field effects, scouts for the foe's attack, or waits for its teammate to take out a threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With the given spread, Zygarde is able to outrun Mega Manectric and anything slower after using Dragon Dance. After maximizing Attack for general damage output, the remaining EVs are dumped into HP. The choice between Groundium Z and Mago Berry either gives Zygarde the ability to plow through a tanky target or gives it increased survivability. A Mago Berry is typically only used on Substitute sets; however, the reverse isn't necessarily true, as Substitute Groundium Z sets can be quite successful. A variety of bulkier sets are also viable. A spread of 96 HP / 224 Atk / 8 SpD / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature ensures Zygarde can take Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Moonblast. An Impish spread using 144 HP / 96 Atk / 92 Def / 12 SpD / 164 Spe retains that benchmark and also allows Zygarde to beat Mega Metagross in a one-on-one situation by guaranteeing Zygarde's ability to take Mega Metagross's Ice Punch and OHKO in return with Tectonic Rage. This leaves Zygarde outsped by Mega Manectric but still faster than Tapu Koko and neutral-natured Deoxys-A after a Dragon Dance. For Substitute sets, 188 HP and 4 Defense EVs ensure that opposing Zygarde can't break its Substitute with an unboosted Thousand Arrows.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zygarde is best used late-game when it can set up and clean with its counters removed. However, Dragon Dance is also effective earlier on to apply pressure and either negate Intimidate drops or force a response from the opponent. If Zygarde isn't in a good position to clean, don't be afraid to switch Zygarde out of the field for another chance later, especially if the opponent's Intimidate users have left Zygarde with only its Speed boosted. As much as Dragon Dance helps Zygarde be more effective, sometimes simply attacking is the better play. If Zygarde is carrying Substitute, set that up to shield Zygarde from Intimidate and a potential stronger hit knocking it out. This is best done on a predicted status move or switch or against foes unlikely to be able to break it. In any other situation, this simply wastes Zygarde's valuable HP. Try to keep Zygarde's health high if it's your best way to win in the endgame, as its bulk is invaluable in aiding eventual setup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users help Zygarde get in safely, with many popular users also offering added benefits. Genesect beats Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, and Tapu Bulu, Mega Manectric eases setup through Snarl and takes on Tapu Fini and Araquanid, and Incineroar threatens multiple of Zygarde's checks including Wide Guard Aegislash and Celesteela as well as Choice Scarf Genesect. Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Aegislash are among the most valuable teammates for Zygarde, as they take on threatening Ice- and Fairy-types and benefit from Zygarde's removal of opposing Fire- and Steel-types. To ease setup pressure, a redirection user such as Amoonguss or Volcarona can prevent a super effective attack from hitting Zygarde. Gothitelle offers a different kind of support for setup variants of Zygarde, ensuring the foes that would prevent it from safely setting up are unable to switch in. Gothitelle takes a more passive route in aiding Zygarde through its access to Heal Pulse and Helping Hand. Milotic deters Intimidate users from switching in and removing Zygarde's boosts. Tapu Fini pairs especially well with Dragon Dance Zygarde, benefiting from Zygarde's ability to take on Tapu Koko while also offering Heal Pulse support and some safety from Dragon-type moves, most notably Kommo-o's Clanging Scales and its Z-Move counterpart.</p> "

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie's prowess in DOU is very heavily predicated on the immense strength of Diamond Storm. The option to dish out big chunks of damage while also boosting Defense makes Diancie very hard to break once the ball starts rolling. In its base forme, Diancie is one of the tier's best offensive Trick Room setters thanks to its impressive bulk and consistent damage output. Additionally, its phenomenal ability Clear Body means that teams that rely on Intimidate users to check Rock-types will greatly struggle to contain Diancie's damage output. The biggest weakness Diancie faces is its vulnerability outside of Trick Room; Diancie typically has enough bulk to stomach one big hit but rarely two, so pinning it down when it does not hold the Speed advantage can spell doom for it. Mega Diancie struggles to find a niche due to its frailty, but it can still punch holes in unsuspecting teams in favorable positions. While Diancie can be reduced to a Diamond Storm bot at times, the flexibility it can provide to a large swath of team archetypes solely because it can both set and take advantage of Trick Room should not be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The Trick Room set can make use of a pinch Berry to boost Diancie's already impressive longevity. Hard Stone is an option over Rockium Z if greater damage output is desired but the team's Z-Move is already taken. Helping Hand and Stealth Rock can replace Trick Room on teams that don't need it set up, but keep in mind that this restricts Diancie's ability to offensively threaten opposing teams itself. Mega Diancie can use Earth Power in its third moveslot to give it a positive matchup against non-Z-Move Tapu Koko and a last-ditch option against Mega Metagross. If Earth Power is used, an alternate EV spread of 52 HP / 168 Atk / 36 SpA / 252 Spe should be used to survive a Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt from Tapu Koko in Electric Terrain and KO in return.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Most common Steel-type Pokemon resist both of Diancie's attacks and threaten to OHKO it in return. Mega Metagross and Genesect both OHKO Diancie with Iron Head, Kartana will OHKO it with Bloom Doom, and Aegislash can OHKO it with Flash Cannon. None of these Pokemon have a chance at being OHKOed by anything but Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T and Zygarde both OHKO base Diancie with Tectonic Rage and Mega Diancie with their respective Ground-type attacks. Bulky Landorus-T will 2HKO regular Diancie with Earth Power, but it must be wary of activating Weakness Policy in the process. Choice Scarf Landorus-T will outspeed and OHKO Mega Diancie, while Dragon Dance Zygarde can outspeed and OHKO Mega Diancie at +1 but must dance around Moonblast. Keep in mind that threats from both Zygarde and physical Landorus-T can be somewhat mitigated by Diamond Storm boosts and Intimidate, especially if they are a team's main answers to Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon can reliably take hits from either Diancie forme and threaten to chip away at its health. Tapu Fini can use Moonblast or Nature's Madness to put Diancie in KO range of a Water-type attack, but Gastrodon that don't carry either Tectonic Rage or Toxic must play around a possible Weakness Policy, lest they risk being smacked by a +2 Moonblast. Water-types with Swift Swim, including Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Ludicolo, will all outspeed and OHKO either Diancie forme in the rain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur are able to tank Diancie's moves and beat it with their own STAB moves. Amoonguss's terrible Speed enables it to outspeed Diancie under Trick Room, use Clear Smog to get rid of Diancie's stat boosts, and spam Spore.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon that are faster than Mega Diancie are generally able to do a lot of damage, if not outright OHKO, given Mega Diancie's poor bulk. Such Pokemon include Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Choice Scarf Genesect, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: If Mega Diancie loses the speed control battle, it will have a very hard time remaining healthy. Tailwind Suicune and Icy Wind Tapu Fini will both take minimal damage from any of Mega Diancie's attacks and can reliably use their speed control options and threaten it with a Water-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Preventative Measures for Trick Room: Standard means of blocking Trick Room like Taunt and Roar limit regular Diancie's ability to control the game. Inner Focus Roar Suicune is a particularly problematic presence for Diancie, while Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele can both Taunt Diancie and threaten it with a strong neutral attack.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diancie is one of the best Trick Room setters in the tier thanks to the many tools it has under its belt, so it will naturally carry Trick Room due to its bulk being artificially magnified when attacking first. Diamond Storm is its primary attack, as it provides Diancie with a means of significantly damaging both foes and raising its Defense, thereby bolstering its already above-average bulk. Moonblast is Diancie's secondary STAB attack, granting it both a move that cannot miss when a 5% risk cannot be taken and a way to smack some Pokemon that resist Rock-type attacks, like Zygarde and Kommo-o. Protect rounds out Diancie's set as a staple in DOU, allowing Diancie a turn of safety.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Special Attack investment on this set ensures that Diancie will always OHKO Kommo-o with Moonblast, even after the Special Defense boost from Clangorous Soulblaze. When combined with maximum HP investment, 52 EVs in Defense allows Diancie to always survive a Leaf Blade from Jolly Kartana and activate its Weakness Policy. Diancie is one of few Pokemon that can make good use of Weakness Policy because its unique typing means that the best ways to damage it are through super effective moves. There are few neutral attacks in the tier that can dent Diancie, and its massive bulk means that it can usually afford to take one super effective attack without much trouble, especially considering that some super effective attacks in the tier, such as Tapu Fini's Muddy Water, are pretty weak. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack, which, in conjunction with an Attack-boosting nature, allows Diancie to reliably 2HKO Incineroar without risk of activating its pinch Berry as long as there is no interference from Stealth Rock. Clear Body's biggest application is preventing Attack drops from Intimidate, making Diancie one of the best Incineroar checks in the tier, but it also prevents other annoying stat drops from attacks like the aforementioned Tapu Fini's Muddy Water. To make best use of Trick Room, Diancie uses 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature. If using a slow Pokemon that carries Knock Off like Scrafty or Incineroar alongside Diancie, it can be valuable to make Diancie one point faster than its partner so that the partner can remove a potential pinch Berry before Diancie activates it in Trick Room; this can be done by setting Diancie's Speed IV to an appropriate value. Rockium Z is a viable option over Weakness Policy for increased damage output that does not rely on being hit first, but Diancie's partners usually make better use of Z-Moves and Weakness Policy makes Diancie an offensive threat for more than one turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Diancie's Weakness Policy can be thought of as insurance, since it essentially prevents the foe from hitting Diancie with a weaker super effective attack as it sets up Trick Room. If possible, try to avoid letting Weakness Policy activate until Diancie is in a position to start sweeping. The optimal situation would be to activate it on the same turn that Trick Room is set up, but if Diancie can manage at least a couple turns of boosted attacks under Trick Room, you will likely be in a good position. Be wary of foes chipping Diancie into KO range with weaker neutral attacks—this is generally the best way to handle Diancie. In most scenarios when Diancie is attacking, Diamond Storm should be the attack of choice. Defense boosts and spread damage are Diancie's bread and butter, so Moonblast should only be used when you need to hit a specific target that resists Diamond Storm or be absolutely sure Diancie does not miss. Diancie's low Speed allows it to take advantage of its own Trick Room, but you must be wary of Pokemon that can underspeed and threaten Diancie with huge damage. Mega Camerupt, Gastrodon, Araquanid, and Lurantis all fit this description, so play conservatively with your Diancie until these Pokemon are neutralized.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Given Diancie's penchant for both setting up and taking advantage of Trick Room, any Pokemon than can facilitate Trick Room setup makes for a good Diancie partner. Given that Fake Out and Intimidate are both excellent means to a Trick Room end, Incineroar and Scrafty find themselves next to Diancie on a number of teams. Incineroar specifically can weaken the foe with Intimidate and then pivot into a partner that will also take advantage of Trick Room or threaten problematic Steel-types with a powerful Flare Blitz. Multiple checks to Steel-types are mandatory with Diancie, as its coverage and typing leave it quite vulnerable to Steel-types both offensively and defensively. Such checks can range from Fire-types, like Mega Charizard Y and the aforementioned Incineroar, to Ground-types, like Landorus-T and Zygarde. Mega Camerupt combines both of these types and its incredibly low Speed to make for a fantastic Diancie partner, capable of dealing huge damage to the Steel- and Grass-types that threaten Diancie while being possibly the best Trick Room sweeper in the tier. Teams that carry both Diancie and Mega Camerupt tend to be full Trick Room teams. Bulky Water-types are a nuisance for Diancie, as they are capable of sponging any of Diancie's attacks while Trick Room is up and weakening Diancie to the point of preventing a second use of Trick Room. Tapu Bulu is often the Island Guardian of choice on these teams given its relatively low Speed and ability to smack said problematic bulky Water-types, as well as Ground-types, that threaten Diancie while providing Diancie with passive recovery. Nature Power Mega Camerupt also often finds itself on teams that carry Diancie and Tapu Bulu as a means of eliminating unsuspecting Water-types. Additional Trick Room setters that can be used to support Diancie include Porygon2 and Bronzong, both of which can reliably set Trick Room in the face of most of the metagame. However, using Diancie on a team does not necessitate a hard emphasis on Trick Room. Diancie is arguably the best Trick Room setter on \"semiroom\" teams, which usually have an additional means of speed control like Tailwind to ensure an advantage in any scenario. Mega Charizard Y, Kartana, and Zapdos can all effectively fill this role and have symbiotic relationships with Diancie thanks to there being very few overlapping checks between any of these Pokemon and Diancie itself.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diamond Storm is the premier attack for Mega Diancie, boasting high power for a spread move and a high chance of a Defense boost to patch Mega Diancie's poor bulk. Moonblast's damage output is surprisingly high, and it can be used in situations where a particular foe would be hit significantly harder by a Fairy-type attack. Given Mega Diancie's propensity for forcing switches and other defensive plays, Substitute can be used to buy Mega Diancie free turns in such instances. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option on Mega Diancie, as many teams rely on Kartana as their only Diancie check; sniping a Kartana with Hidden Power Fire can pave the way for Mega Diancie to make an even greater impact. Protect is especially important on a Pokemon as frail as Mega Diancie, giving it temporary safety while its partner can improve its position.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Diancie's Speed tier necessitates maximum investment given the other Pokemon in the tier that lie next to and just below it, so 252 EVs and a boosting nature are employed. Hasty is chosen over Naive because Diamond Storm will likely be boosting Mega Diancie's Defense, making up for the slight initial Defense drop. The given Special Attack investment means that Mega Diancie will 2HKO standard bulky pivot Landorus-T with Moonblast. If Mega Diancie manages to set up Substitute on a turn when Landorus-T pivots onto the field, Mega Diancie can KO it before Landorus-T can damage Mega Diancie at all. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack to power up Diamond Storm and give Mega Diancie a 94% chance to 2HKO standard Incineroar with Diamond Storm at -1 Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Diancie's base forme has such a fantastic ability in Clear Body, you should be deliberate about when you choose to Mega Evolve Diancie. If your opponent has Pokemon that employ Intimidate or stat-dropping moves like Icy Wind, it can be advantageous to keep Diancie in its base forme until those Pokemon are out of the way. Similarly, if facing a Pokemon faster than Mega Diancie that threatens to deal a lot of damage, consider keeping it in its base forme to take the hit if increased damage isn't necessary. Once Diancie has Mega Evolved, Diamond Storm should be the move of choice in most cases. Moonblast hits pretty hard neutrally and will do more damage to one target than a spread Diamond Storm, so this move is the better choice if you need more damage against one specific opposing Pokemon. Try to always be attacking first with Mega Diancie; relying on taking a hit and firing back can be very risky because of Mega Diancie's frailty.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control is very important with Mega Diancie. Tailwind Kartana is a good partner thanks to its ability to threaten opposing Water- and Ground-types, and Tailwind Zapdos, Tailwind Suicune, and Icy Wind Kyurem-B also combine speed control and offensive synergy. Mega Diancie also appreciates Pokemon that can eliminate Steel-types. Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcanion fit this role, and Volcanion in particular also appreciates the speed control that often accompanies Mega Diancie. Mega Diancie also needs a partner to cover Ground-types, but answers to Landorus-T are more important than answers to Zygarde, since Mega Diancie can smack Zygarde with Moonblast. Kyurem-B, Tapu Fini, and your own Landorus-T are all solid choices to improve the opposing Landorus-T matchup. Grass-type Pokemon make for good partners given Mega Diancie's ability to beat most relevant Flying- and Fire-types handily. Tapu Bulu gives Mega Diancie passive recovery and can eliminate Water-types, while Amoonguss can give Mega Diancie some breathing room with Rage Powder and Spore.</p> "

  "Hoopa-Unbound": {
    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U's absurd offensive stats and ability to break Protect for both itself and its partner with either of its signature STAB moves gives it a niche in the Doubles metagame for Trick Room-focused teams that need to deal damage quickly to take advantage of limited turns. Thanks to its good special bulk, Hoopa-U does well in a fairly specially oriented metagame. However, a select number of flaws hold Hoopa-U back from being a dominant Pokemon. Its pitiful physical bulk leaves it open to being knocked out by almost any strong single-target physical attack, especially the very common U-turn. Furthermore, a middling Speed tier means Hoopa-U needs speed control support to function as effectively as possible, and when providing that support itself, it is generally outclassed as an offensive Trick Room setter by Pokemon like Diancie. Finally, it is outclassed as a Dark-type by Incineroar, which also happens to be Hoopa-U's number one counter. With its access to Intimidate, Knock Off, and U-turn and its very high usage rate, most teams will naturally have a strong Hoopa-U counter. With the right support, Hoopa-U can be a very threatening offensive presence, but it requires a considerable amount of support to do so.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Blast along with Fightinium Z can give Hoopa-U a way to deal with opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Tyranitar that would otherwise wall it. A faster Life Orb set with both Hyperspace moves and Gunk Shot can deal significant damage to a large chunk of the metagame, but Hoopa-U's frailty, awkward speed tier, and difficulty hitting a few popular threats like Incineroar and Diancie makes this set less successful than it may seem. Hidden Power Ice, along with 84 Special Attack EVs, allows Life Orb Hoopa-U to get the OHKO on opposing Zygarde. Choice Scarf can be used over Life Orb on offensive sets to make up for Hoopa-U's poor Speed, but being unable to switch moves can really hurt Hoopa-U's offensive presence, and Protect is a vital move for preserving Hoopa-U's health. A Terrain Seed such as Misty or Psychic Seed can be run over Sitrus Berry on Trick Room sets to boost Hoopa-U's Special Defense. This has the added benefit of letting Magician activate immediately, but the recovery of Sitrus Berry is usually more reliable for setting up Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Common Dark-types like Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Scrafty all wall Hoopa-U and threaten large amounts of damage with strong physical moves. They only need to fear the rare Fightinium Z with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Any set without Gunk Shot cannot do very much damage to Fairy-types like the omnipresent Island Guardians, and they all threaten large amounts of damage on Hoopa.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Incineroar and Landorus-T can leave Hoopa-U reliant on its weaker Hyperspace Hole to do damage, with Incineroar switching into Hoopa-U virtually any time it wants to.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Bug moves are almost certain to KO Hoopa-U, but they are relatively rare, with only U-turn users and Volcarona commonly carrying them.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Hoopa-U's middling speed tier leaves it reliant on its own speed control to perform at its best, so opposing Tailwind or Trick Room can leave Hoopa-U wide open to getting knocked out thanks to its frailty and render it unable to fire off its extremely strong attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's main attack and the move it will want to click most often. It covers opposing Psychic-types like Bronzong and Cresselia and Ghost-types like Aegislash. Hyperspace Hole nails Amoonguss, which is a very good Trick Room check, as well as offering decent damage after Hoopa-U has incurred Attack drops from Intimidate. Both of these moves have the unique property of breaking Protect, which is especially valuable in Trick Room, as opponents want to use the move to stall out Trick Room turns. Trick Room allows Hoopa-U and its slower teammates to move first for four turns, which can really turn the tables on any team that relies on the Speed of its Pokemon. Protect allows Hoopa-U to shield itself from damage while its partner handles a threat, or to stall out opposing field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Brave nature is used to lower Hoopa-U's Speed for Trick Room as well as power up Hyperspace Fury. Hoopa-U can also run 0 IVs in Speed to ensure it is even faster in Trick Room. The given HP and Defense EVs allow Hoopa-U to survive a U-turn from Choice Scarf Victini or an Overheat from Mega Charizard Y in sun. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to boost the power of Hyperspace Fury. Sitrus Berry is used to indirectly improve Hoopa-U's bulk by allowing it to survive a double target if necessary; oftentimes Hoopa-U will take about 60% damage from both opponents, so Sitrus Berry can prevent those attacks from knocking it out. Sitrus Berry is also useful with Magician, as after it activates, Hoopa-U will be able to steal opposing Pokemon's items.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hoopa-U is usually at its best when it is not the lead Trick Room setter, regardless of whether the team needs Trick Room set up to function. If the team is reliant on Trick Room, a bulkier and more defensive setter is usually a better lead. If Trick Room is not vital to the team's success, it is preferable to wait until the optimal time to set Trick Room presents itself, usually in front of opposing speed control or with the appropriate supporting teammate. Hoopa-U punishes any team that wants to use Protect often, but it works especially well when Trick Room is up, as one of the main ways opposing teams want to stall out Trick Room turns is by using Protect a lot. Hoopa-U essentially prevents opposing teams from doing so, so the opponent has to rely on making defensive switches, which is punishable by making an offensive switch at the same time or by getting off a powerful double target. Keep in mind that firing off Hyperspace Fury will lower Hoopa-U's Defense; however, once Trick Room is set, Hoopa-U is a lot less worried about its Defense stat. Hoopa-U will have a very tough time setting Trick Room if there is no support beside it, such as a Fake Out or redirection user, as the opponent can generally just double target Hoopa-U to prevent its setup. To work around this, try to get Hoopa-U and a supportive Pokemon in as Trick Room is running out so you're immediately ready to set Trick Room again.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hoopa-U benefits a lot from a Fake Out partner like Scrafty. Fake Out will make setting up Trick Room easier, as it can stop an incoming target or an attack that could knock out Hoopa-U. Scrafty has the added benefit of threatening opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Tyranitar, both of which wall Hoopa-U. Any team that is reliant on Trick Room will need a defensive setter to pair with Hoopa-U like Diancie or Porygon2. Diancie is an especially good option, as it has a fantastic matchup versus Incineroar and other opposing Dark-types. Amoonguss can also provide a lot of support for Hoopa-U, as it can redirect moves that would stop Trick Room, as well as spread fast Spores while Trick Room is active. Any team with Hoopa-U will need multiple checks for opposing Dark-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Tyranitar. Mega Camerupt, Scrafty, and Tapu Fini are all good options that have the added benefit of being able to function effectively in Trick Room. Hoopa-U will not be able to do much damage to any of the Island Guardians, except for Tapu Lele, so a Poison-type like Amoonguss or a Steel-type like Bronzong or Stakataka can shore up that matchup considerably.</p> "

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion is one of the most reliable Fire-types in Doubles OU thanks to its great defensive Fire / Water typing, good bulk, and high Special Attack stat. In stark contrast to most Fire-types, Volcanion is able to wall most opposing Water-types thanks to its Water Absorb ability, although it still struggles to do meaningful damage back to them. Volcanion sits at a middling Speed tier, so it's usually forced to absorb attacks before dealing its own in return. Its good bulk allows it to do this reasonably well, but it thrives best when it's supported by speed control like Tailwind or Trick Room. Offensively, Volcanion's typing offers decent STAB coverage but still leaves it walled by certain foes, including Water-types like Tapu Fini and Dragon-types like Mega Salamence. Volcanion can carry coverage moves to address some of its checks, but it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome in that it doesn't have enough room to pack all of the coverage moves it wants to run. Despite all of this, however, Volcanion can easily become a staple Pokemon for teams that otherwise struggle to break down opposing Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wacan Berry can be used in place of Shuca Berry on teams that need added insurance against Tapu Koko. Roar allows Volcanion to check setup users like Cresselia and Mega Latias, with additional utility in preventing Trick Room. Firium Z is an option to turn Heat Wave into a stronger single-target move to hit hard against bulky targets like Amoonguss, which are likely to survive a Heat Wave. Such sets can also use Overheat for a stronger Inferno Overdrive and a decently powerful attack even after the Z-Move is burned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W can all outspeed Volcanion and threaten it with super effective Electric-type attacks. Rotom-W also walls Volcanion's STAB attacks, while Misty Seed or Psychic Seed Zapdos just has generally high Special Defense that allows it to comfortably take Volcanion's attacks. Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt also inflicts severe damage to Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types like Mega Salamence and Kingdra resist both of Volcanion's STAB attacks and can hit back reasonably hard. Kyurem-B lacks a Fire resistance, but variants carrying Assault Vest still take relatively little damage from Volcanion's Heat Wave. Hidden Power Ice can be used to address Mega Salamence, but Volcanion remains relatively helpless against Kyurem-B and Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde outspeed Volcanion and threaten it with super effective STAB attacks, although Shuca Berry can be used to mitigate this weakness. Zygarde in particular can be a problem for Volcanion, as it only takes neutral damage from Steam Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-type attackers like Tyranitar and Diancie threaten Volcanion with super effective damage, but Volcanion threatens them back if it survives long enough to strike with Steam Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Volcanion's Special Defense is passable but nothing extraordinary for a bulky attacker. Pokemon with strong special attacks, like Deoxys-A and Tapu Lele, are able to threaten significant damage, if not an outright KO, before Volcanion has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Without speed control on its side, Volcanion is outsped by a significant portion of the metagame, including many of the threats mentioned above. Pokemon ranging from super effective attackers like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie to strong neutral attackers like Tapu Lele and Mega Salamence are able to use their speed advantage to either pressure or revenge kill Volcanion.</p> ",

        "name": "All-out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Steam Eruption serves as Volcanion's strongest and most reliable single-target STAB attack. Heat Wave is Volcanion's preferred secondary STAB attack, offering spread coverage and a reliable way of dealing with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Sludge Bomb takes on Tapu Koko, as well as several Pokemon that Volcanion generally has a positive matchup against but can't really deal significant damage to, such as Tapu Fini. Earth Power is mainly used to beat Volcanion mirrors but also serves a few other minor niches like hitting checks such as Tapu Koko or Mega Manectric on a predicted switch or with speed control. Hidden Power Ice is another coverage option that allows Volcanion to reliably hit Dragon-types like Zygarde; this works especially well in tandem with a Shuca Berry to take Zygarde's attack. Protect keeps Volcanion safe while its partners deal with any possible threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With a Wiki Berry, Volcanion retains the ability to pivot in on weaker attacks and threaten foes throughout the match, as chipping it low will only result in Volcanion's return to health. A Wiki Berry is also its best answer to the prevalence of Stealth Rock. Shuca Berry is another decent item, allowing it to survive strong Ground-type attacks from foes like Landorus-T and Zygarde and retaliate with Steam Eruption or Hidden Power Ice. Alternatively, Waterium Z provides Volcanion with a one-time nuke attack. A Modest nature with the given EV spread allows Volcanion to survive Earth Power from any non-Life Orb Landorus-T, outspeed uninvested Tapu Fini, and hit as hard as possible, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack. Shuca Berry sets can still use the same EV spread, though they gain the ability to take two Stomping Tantrums from Mega Metagross—one weakened by Shuca Berry and one regularly.</p> <p>Volcanion's EV spread options are pretty flexible overall; the HP, Special Attack, and Speed EVs can be redistributed as you see fit. On teams with Trick Room support, a Quiet nature is usable over Modest to minimize Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcanion is good at applying offensive pressure in the mid- or late-game, after checks and faster attackers like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T have been dealt with, because its Fire / Water STAB coverage and coverage move allow it to clean up against many targets. This isn't to say that Volcanion can't be used as a lead or early-game pivot; its good bulk and defensive typing allow it to do this with relative ease; however, with a middling Speed tier and predictably linear movepool, Volcanion can be easy to play around and force out. Ideally, it wants to pivot in on Water-type attacks, since Water Absorb allows it to recover HP from them. That said, it can end up in a stalemate versus bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Volcanion mirrors if it doesn't have the appropriate coverage moves to deal with them. If you do deploy Volcanion early on in the game, try to preserve its HP, since it loses its effectiveness as a late-game cleaner if its HP is too low to withstand opposing attacks. Where possible, make use of speed control tactics like Tailwind, Icy Wind, and Trick Room so Volcanion can get the upper hand on faster Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Tyranitar; foes that Volcanion checks when it has the speed advantage but loses to when it doesn't.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teams that struggle to beat bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Aegislash appreciate Volcanion's presence. Speed control users allow Volcanion to overcome its middling Speed to become a threatening attacker: Zapdos and Mega Salamence can reliably set Tailwind and have decent type synergy with Volcanion, notably being able to deal respectable damage to bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and opposing Volcanion mirrors; Kyurem-B can reliably use Icy Wind and also hit opposing Water-types with Fusion Bolt; and Trick Room setters such as Hoopa-U, Mega Gardevoir, and Bronzong can give Volcanion the speed control it needs if its EV spread minimizes its Speed investment. Volcanion is threatened out by Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos, Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde, and Rock-types like Tyranitar, so checks to these such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Metagross are always appreciated. Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Volcanion, and Milotic essentially wall Volcanion (though coverage moves can mitigate this a bit), so strong Electric- and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Tapu Bulu make for great partners. Tapu Bulu is a notably great partner for Volcanion; the duo form a solid Fire / Water / Grass core, and Grassy Terrain mitigates Volcanion's weakness to Earthquake.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Steam Eruption gives Volcanion a strong single-target STAB attack, and Heat Wave gives it a strong spread STAB option. Substitute is especially viable on Volcanion due to its good defensive typing, ability to force switches, and access to strong STAB moves. When executed successfully, Substitute can give Volcanion a lot of momentum to either pressure the foe into attacking it or stall time with Protect for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Volcanion to outspeed uninvested Tapu Fini and to ensure its Substitute is never broken by Amoonguss's Giga Drain; the remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack with a Modest nature to make Volcanion hit as hard as possible. That said, the EVs can be shifted around to meet your team's specific requirements for bulk, power, and speed. On Trick Room teams, a Quiet nature is usable over Modest to minimize Speed. Most of the time, Volcanion will prefer to have a Wiki Berry equipped, as this is easily activated through Substitute and provides enough healing to make Volcanion a relevant defensive check to the threats it needs to answer. With the given HP, two uses of Substitute and a switch-in with Stealth Rock on the field will always activate Volcanion's Wiki Berry. Waterium Z may be more useful on some teams, as this weakens Incineroar's Knock Off to ensure Volcanion's Substitute isn't broken and offers a strong attack. Alternatively, Leftovers provides a consistent recovery option that can be repeatedly taken advantage of by cycling through Protect and Substitute turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The main goal of this set is to position Volcanion into a situation where it can comfortably get behind a Substitute. To accomplish this, take advantage of predicted switches, passive plays, or matchups where the opposing Pokemon simply don't pose a threat to Volcanion. Similarly to more offensive sets, Substitute Volcanion is most effective mid-game after its checks have been dealt with. However, once behind a Substitute, Volcanion has more freedom to stay in on its would-be checks to fire off strong STAB attacks in retaliation. Use Protect liberally once Substitute is up to take advantage of free Leftovers recovery turns and to play mind games with the opponent, who will likely feel pressured to double target Volcanion. Water Absorb allows Volcanion to effortlessly pivot in on Water-type attacks, although Volcanion ends up in a \"stalemate\" situation against bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Volcanion mirrors, and Substitute Volcanion lacks the coverage moves to hit these Pokemon back. Sometimes you can take advantage of these situations to attack the Water-type's partner, but if Volcanion is feeling like dead weight, you're best off preserving it for later in the match. Volcanion has good bulk and a decent defensive typing, so it can be used as a pivot into neutral and resisted attacks. However, you generally should preserve Volcanion's HP as much as possible so it can clean up late-game or retain enough HP to use Substitute more effectively later on. Where possible, make use of speed control tactics like Tailwind, Icy Wind, and Trick Room so Volcanion can get the upper hand on faster foes like Mega Tyranitar and Landorus-T that it wants to check but can't quite outpace.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu is an excellent partner for Substitute Volcanion; Grassy Terrain compounds the turn-by-turn recovery Volcanion already receives from Leftovers and also mitigates Volcanion's weakness to Earthquake. Teams that struggle to beat bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Aegislash also appreciate Volcanion's presence. Speed control users allow Volcanion to overcome its middling speed to become a threatening attacker: Zapdos and Mega Salamence can reliably set Tailwind and have decent type synergy with Volcanion, notably being able to deal respectable damage to bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and opposing Volcanion; Kyurem-B can reliably use Icy Wind and also hit Water-types with Fusion Bolt; and Trick Room setters such as Hoopa-U, Mega Gardevoir, and Bronzong can give Volcanion the speed control it needs if its EV spread minimizes its Speed investment. Volcanion is threatened out by Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos, Ground-types like Landorus-T and Zygarde, and Rock-types like Tyranitar, so checks to these such as Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Metagross are always appreciated. Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Volcanion, and Milotic completely wall Substitute Volcanion, so strong Electric- and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Tapu Bulu make for great partners.</p> "

  "Incineroar": {
    "overview": "<p>Incineroar is one of the most widely used Pokemon in Doubles, as its unique access to the combination of Intimidate, Fake Out, and U-turn aids every team in the difficult task of maintaining a positive board position. Aside from its perks in momentum management, Incineroar does well both offensively and defensively due to a solid typing and set of stats that allow it to take on prominent threats like Mega Metagross, Tapu Bulu, and Amoonguss relatively safely. Its utility, which is further augmented by access to Knock Off, ensures that Incineroar will almost never be dead weight, as the ability to pivot, lower Attack, and remove items can always come in handy. This constant and assured utility leads Incineroar to fit easily onto most teams and team styles. However, Incineroar can be slightly passive against Fire-resistant or bulky targets like Zygarde, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T due to its low Speed and not especially notable Attack; the former trait also makes Incineroar prone to being worn down over the course of the match, especially when paired with its weakness to Stealth Rock and inability to fit Protect on most movesets.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect offers significant benefits on most every moveset, so Incineroar may opt to use it in place of U-turn to capitalize on its usual merits as well as the potential surprise factor of carrying Protect on a Pokemon that rarely uses it. U-turn may also be dropped in favor of another utility move like Roar or Snarl, but this support is typically best left to teammates. Incineroar's signature Z-Move, Malicious Moonsault, is somewhat appealing for the OHKO on Bronzong, Gothitelle, and Mega Metagross. Its base move, Darkest Lariat, is also slightly stronger than Knock Off against Mega Evolutions and Z-Move users, though Incineroar would usually rather have Knock Off's utility. Low Kick is usable on teams that struggle to beat Tyranitar and Stakataka.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types in Doubles tend to be bulky, so they can all take hits from Incineroar quite well and retaliate with STAB attacks. Milotic also has Competitive, which lets it benefit from Incineroar's Intimidate by boosting up. Volcanion can run a Substitute set with a Z-Move, which will leave Incineroar as setup bait, as Knock Off won't break its Substitute. Tapu Fini resists both Incineroar's STAB attacks and will be found on many teams. Politoed and Pelipper stand out as answers due to their summoned rain weakening Incineroar's Flare Blitz against all targets. Suicune's Inner Focus lets it ignore Fake Out and set Tailwind or hit Incineroar with a super effective Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T and Zygarde are two prominent threats in Doubles, and their Ground-type STAB attacks, especially a potential Tectonic Rage, sharply cut into Incineroar's health. Zygarde even has the bonus of resisting Flare Blitz, as does Mega Camerupt, which can hit Incineroar really hard with Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar resist all Incineroar's attacks aside from the relatively weak U-turn and hit it hard with Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Diancie resists all Incineroar's attacks and has Clear Body to protect it from Intimidate, so its Diamond Storm will always hit at full power.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o takes little from any of Incineroar's attacks and uses it to set up with Clangorous Soulblaze. Some sets also carry Close Combat, which will severely dent or KO Incineroar, especially when boosted.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Though dealing damage isn't Incineroar's main job, Intimidate users including Landorus-T, Scrafty, and even opposing Incineroar can be troublesome if it needs to remove a threat. Scrafty is especially notable for also being able to hit Incineroar with a Fighting-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock cuts into Incineroar's ability to enter the field; losing a quarter of its health is hugely detrimental to its role as a bulky pivot.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out offers Incineroar's teammates a turn of safety from a threat, allowing them to safely boost or set up speed control rather than having to use Protect. Flare Blitz acts as Incineroar's primary method of dealing damage, and it is useful due to Incineroar's decent Attack stat despite the recoil damage it inflicts. Knock Off mainly operates as a method to remove items from the opposition, though it also hits fairly hard due to the STAB boost. U-turn provides Incineroar the ability to pivot out of mediocre matchups and maintain momentum, also offering its teammates a safer switch. Taunt offers a different form of utility that's particularly useful to Trick Room teams, which need a way to prevent phazing moves like Whirlwind and Roar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Intimidate is crucial to Incineroar's success in Doubles, weakening incoming attacks and keeping Incineroar useful throughout the game. A Figy Berry provides a boost of health when Incineroar needs it most, and Incineroar's bulk allows it to often survive long enough to take advantage of this. With the given EV spread, Incineroar can take a Modest Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt even after Stealth Rock and avoids the 2HKO from -1 Kartana's Sacred Sword. The 12 EVs in Speed allow Incineroar to move before uninvested Celesteela. A Sassy nature with a minimized Speed IV and the 12 Speed EVs moved to Special Defense is also viable, as this improves Incineroar's ability to function as a slow pivot, giving its allies a better chance of entering the field unharmed after it brings them in with U-turn. However, this makes it a bit tougher for Incineroar to get its attacks off against some threats in a similar Speed tier. Alternatively, a more offensive spread of 252 HP / 120 Atk / 20 Def / 116 SpD with an Adamant nature retains enough bulk to take two Stomping Tantrums from -1 Mega Metagross, Superpower from +0 offensive Landorus-T, or a Thunderbolt-based Gigavolt Havoc from Tapu Koko with as much power as possible. The Speed investment on Incineroar is flexible; some teams with Tailwind support may use 80 EVs in Speed to allow Incineroar to outpace Mega Metagross in Tailwind, though this will cut into its bulk a bit. An Assault Vest allows Incineroar to take some special hits that would otherwise knock it out, but the chip damage incurred from operating as a pivot, both from Stealth Rock and incoming attacks, often prevents this from coming into play.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Incineroar works as a fantastic lead by providing a free initial turn with Fake Out and weakening incoming attacks; U-turn improves on this even more by enabling it to fix any potential poor matchup and keep the pressure on. Knock Off is a fantastic move to use a majority of the time, as even targets that will take little damage from the move won't appreciate their items being removed. However, if Incineroar really needs to do damage or take something out, Flare Blitz is far more reliable, as Knock Off can be fairly weak against targets carrying a Mega Stone or Z-Crystal. Keep Incineroar's teammates healthier by switching out primarily with U-turn, but you can switch directly to avoid letting Incineroar take unneeded damage if that could put you in a poor spot later in the game. Even if Incineroar is unable to damage most of the opponent's remaining team, don't undervalue the support it provides for late-game positioning in the form of Intimidate, Fake Out, item removal, and pivoting. If Stealth Rock has been set on your side of the field, avoid sending Incineroar onto the field too much, as that will cut into its longevity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nearly every team can benefit from Incineroar's positive matchups and support; however, some teammates have notable synergy with it. Setup Pokemon such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini, Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, and Trick Room Stakataka seize free turns provided by Fake Out especially well. Frailer teammates greatly appreciate the safer switches through U-turn and weakening of incoming attacks with Intimidate, so Nihilego, Kartana, and Mega Gardevoir are solid options. Diancie, Kyurem-B, and any other Pokemon that struggle to break through Steel-types tend to benefit most from Incineroar's positive matchups. Water-types like Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and Suicune are best handled by a teammate, making Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, or Kartana quite useful.</p> "

  "Araquanid": {
    "overview": "<p>Above average special bulk coupled with a good defensive typing allows Araquanid to take most neutral STAB attacks comfortably, making it a good offensive tank. Thanks to Water Bubble, Araquanid can deal reasonable amounts of damage with its Water STAB attacks despite its low base Attack, and check common Intimidate users such as Incineroar and Landorus-T and Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y. It is also able to provide permanent speed control with Sticky Web and protect its allies with Wide Guard support. Unfortunately, Araquanid's low Speed stat means it almost always takes damage before doing anything useful. It also competes with other more popular bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Volcanion, and Suicune for a spot on teams. Furthermore, a shallow movepool and a lack of coverage options also make Araquanid a rather predictable Pokemon. Its low base Attack also means that Araquanid cannot deal any significant damage besides with Liquidation.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic is a solid option for a filler move that puts a timer on bulky walls such as Chansey and Cresselia as well as Water-types such as Volcanion and Gastrodon that Araquanid cannot hit. Mystic Water can also be used over a pinch Berry for a more offensive Araquanid variant with maximized Attack, which lets Araquanid OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Liquidation even in sun. When using Waterium Z, 160 EVs can also be moved into Speed, letting Araquanid outspeed standard Incineroar and dispose of it easily with a Hydro Vortex. Icy Wind can be used as another form of speed control to slow down targets that are not affected by Sticky Web, such as Landorus-T and Zapdos. Poison Jab may be chosen as a coverage option when hitting Tapu Bulu is desired or Araquanid is used on Trick Room teams. However, Araquanid is a tough fit on Trick Room teams and does not contribute as much value as it provides with Sticky Web on faster teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos are able to 2HKO Araquanid with their STAB attacks, and Pokemon carrying Electric coverage such as Fusion Bolt Kyurem-B may be a problem as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu and Kartana both are able to take Araquanid's attacks comfortably and deal severe damage back with their Grass-type STAB attacks. Ferrothorn can also check Araquanid well defensively and slowly wear it down with Power Whip and Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Volcanion can also take Araquanid's attacks reliably, often forcing Araquanid to switch out. However, these Pokemon need to watch out for Bug Bite, as they do not appreciate having their Berries removed.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Araquanid needs to watch out for faster offensive Rock-types such as Diancie and Tyranitar, which can both deal significant damage with their STAB attacks. However, should Araquanid carry Wide Guard, its Rock-type checks may struggle to deal damage to Araquanid without a single-target STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Due to Araquanid's mediocre Defense, it is prone to taking huge chunks of damage from strong physical attacks such as Tectonic Rage from Landorus-T or Zygarde and even Tapu Lele's Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon: Gastrodon completely walls Araquanid thanks to Storm Drain and its defensive typing and can freely set up Substitutes against it, thus making Araquanid deadweight on the field outside of its utility moves.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Sticky Web",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Liquidation is Araquanid's main form of damage output and benefits from Water Bubble and STAB, allowing Araquanid to hit Landorus-T and Incineroar fairly hard even after an Intimidate drop. Bug Bite helps to remove Berries from opposing Pokemon, most notably Amoonguss and Tapu Fini, and regain its HP at the same time. Sticky Web allows teammates to outspeed and check faster and somewhat frail offensive threats. Protect is always valuable and can help scout for opposing sets or moves. Wide Guard can be used as an alternative to Bug Bite or even Protect, helping improve the team's matchup against common Pokemon such as Zygarde and Mega Charizard that like to spam spread moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense investments allows Araquanid to take Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer in Grassy Terrain. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack, which lets Araquanid hit as hard as possible and 2HKO Incineroar or Landorus-T with Liquidation after an Intimidate Attack drop. Waterium Z over Figy Berry provides the additional power that Araquanid needs to OHKO Incineroar or Landorus-T even after an Intimidate, also offering a very strong attack for threats that would take neutral damage like Mew or Zygarde. A Brave nature is preferred on sets running Bug Bite to prevent confusion upon consuming a Wiki Berry; however, if Araquanid does not carry Bug Bite, an Adamant nature can be used instead, which allows Araquanid to outspeed faster Incineroar variants after Sticky Web. Wacan Berry is also another option that can be used with maximum HP investment and 48 Special Defense EVs; this enables Araquanid to take a Gigavolt Havoc from a Modest Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain or a Life Orb-boosted Fusion Bolt from Kyurem-B in Electric Terrain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Liquidation should be Araquanid's main form of damage output; Bug Bite should only be used for removing Berries from foes. Araquanid is usually brought out early-game or used as a lead to set up Sticky Web, helping the team gain momentum as the game progresses. It can also be brought in directly to sponge a Fire-type attack thanks to Water Bubble. That being said, it is fine to switch Araquanid in any time during the game to sponge special attacks thanks to its above average special bulk. Araquanid can also be pivoted in to check and force out opposing spread attackers with Wide Guard, most notably Choice Band Zygarde and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with awkward Speed tiers benefit from Sticky Web the most, such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Volcanion, and Landorus-T. Steel-types and other Pokemon weak to Fire or Ground such as Mega Metagross, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana benefit tremendously from Araquanid's Wide Guard support and offensive pressure protecting them from common super effective spread moves such as Thousand Arrows and Heat Wave, and also appreciate its Water coverage. Araquanid appreciates Ground-type partners such as Zygarde and Landorus-T that can force out opposing Electric-types to help prolong its longevity and let it set up Sticky Web successfully; Araquanid in turn can also support Zygarde and Landorus-T by protecting them from a potential Icy Wind with Wide Guard. Mega Charizard Y also makes a great partner for Araquanid thanks to Araquanid's ability to remove Landorus-T and Incineroar and shield Mega Charizard Y from opposing Diamond Storm and Rock Slide with Wide Guard, while Mega Charizard Y helps Araquanid remove bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss. However, it is worth noting that sun halves Liquidation's damage output, losing out on 2HKOs against Incineroar and Landorus-T, meaning careful positioning is important. Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Mew also help support Araquanid greatly, allowing Araquanid to set Sticky Web freely in the face of threats such as Tapu Koko. Zeraora stands out as another Fake Out user due to its ability to take on Electric-types and remove bulky Water-types that could otherwise sit on Araquanid freely.</p> "

Additionally, Lurantis's Grass typing makes it immune to Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, although Lurantis still loses to Sludge Bomb. However, Lurantis's low base Speed means that it fits only on semi- or full Trick Room teams, and its poor movepool leaves it pretty one-dimensional and predictable.</p> ",

Superpower in conjunction with Contrary lets Lurantis set up and gives it nice neutral coverage alongside Leaf Blade, only resisted by Flying- and Poison-types. Knock Off hits bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types like Gothitelle, Mega Latias, and Aegislash and provides additional utility in removing items like Berries and Assault Vest. Protect is used for scouting foes' moves, surviving a double target, or waiting for a teammate to set Trick Room up. Substitute can be used over Knock Off to take advantage of typical methods of stalling out Trick Room, such as Protect and defensive switches.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Figy Berry heals Lurantis for 50% of its maximum HP when it's at low HP, thus increasing its longevity and improving its chance to successfully sweep an opposing team. Contrary allows Lurantis to set up via Superpower and deter Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar, Landorus-T, and Mega Manectric. The given EV spread along with 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature makes Lurantis as powerful and slow as possible and gives it decent bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lurantis is good as a mid-game sweeper, when its answers are eliminated or weakened enough to be in range of its boosted attacks. Lurantis is also able to soften up its checks by spamming Knock Off and Leaf Blade early-game. You can take advantage of opposing Intimidate users by aggressively double switching Lurantis in on them or keeping it on the field alongside another physical attacker.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Lurantis is very slow, Trick Room setters like Porygon2, Gothitelle, and Hoopa-U are mandatory teammates. Physical attackers that fit on Trick Room teams like Stakataka and Incineroar appreciate Lurantis's Intimidate-deterring capabilities. The former also sets Trick Room, and the latter provides Fake Out and Intimidate support. Other Trick Room attackers like Mega Camerupt and Diancie also usually fit on teams featuring Lurantis thanks to their nice offensive synergy. Pokemon such as Volcanion and the aforementioned Stakataka help Lurantis deal with troublesome Pokemon like Celesteela, Mega Charizard Y, and Amoonguss.</p> "

Tsareena's entire modus operandi is to prevent its enemy from disrupting its partners; it can block Fake Out and other priority attacks with Queenly Majesty, give its partners safe switches with a relatively slow U-turn, eliminate Stealth Rock for its partners, or even pick up valuable KOs against some problematic Pokemon. Grass typing makes it a good partner to common Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona while complementing rain teams with a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Unfortunately, mono-Grass typing also means that Tsareena is weak to many types and only has one commonly resisted STAB attack. Common threats like Mega Charizard Y, Genesect, and Mega Salamence all fear nothing from Tsareena while threatening huge amounts of damage to it or its partner.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest might be a tempting item choice on Tsareena, especially if Feint has already been chosen for the final move, but Figy Berry is almost always better because Tsareena is most effectively used as a pivot, and switching into Stealth Rock is an easy way to make sure Tsareena gets to chow down. Knock Off and Protect are both viable choices in the fourth moveslot as well, but they struggle to make the most of Tsareena's turns on the field in a wider variety of situations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Resisting Power Whip, threatening huge damage, and switching into a predicted non-U-turn are traits shared by all relevant Fire-types not named Volcanion, making them excellent checks to Tsareena. Incineroar is perhaps the best man for the job given its ability to lower Tsareena's Attack with Intimidate, especially if Tsareena is not packing High Jump Kick, but Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona both do the job excellently as well.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Common Flying-type Pokemon like Zapdos and Mega Salamence take very little damage from any of Tsareena's attacks and can generally ignore its presence altogether in favor of setting up Tailwind or firing attacks into Tsareena's partner.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types are largely not threatened by Tsareena, since most relevant Steel-type Pokemon resist Power Whip and are take neutral damage from High Jump Kick, with the notable exception being Kartana.

U-turn allows Tsareena to function as a pivot, absorbing attacks and providing safer switches for its partners. High Jump Kick is most effective on teams that appreciate more options for damaging Kartana and Incineroar, such as rain teams, while Rapid Spin is a necessity on teams packing Pokemon that take significant damage from Stealth Rock, like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Helping Hand gives Tsareena the ability to boost its partners' attacks, while Feint is handy for preventing opponents from stalling out field conditions like Tailwind and rain.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense investment allows Tsareena to survive a U-turn from standard Genesect with an Attack boost from Download. An Adamant nature alone provides enough power for Tsareena to 2HKO standard Tapu Fini with Power Whip at -1 Attack, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense. Figy Berry is especially useful given Tsareena's tendency to switch into attacks and pivot back out frequently.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The combination of serviceable bulk, the usefulness of Queenly Majesty, and access to U-turn means that Tsareena is a great pivot. Switching into and blocking a Fake Out for its partner can buy Tsareena's team so much momentum, and the threat of doing so will cause opponents to second guess their actions. Be careful not to make too many telegraphed switches, as many Pokemon with access to Fake Out have options that can punish a predicted Tsareena switch quite effectively. When not acting as a switch and U-turn bot, Tsareena can chunk many common Pokemon with Power Whip or provide valuable support in the form of Helping Hand or Feint. If using Rapid Spin, be sure to preserve Tsareena until entry hazards are gone or opposing hazard setters are KOed; this ensures the partners that need Stealth Rock off the field will not be severely weakened for the rest of the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>There are two main types of Pokemon next to which Tsareena finds a niche: Pokemon that flourish on rain teams and Pokemon with a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. On rain teams, Tsareena should opt for High Jump Kick to chunk Kartana and prevent it from setting up a Substitute for free. Feint is often chosen over Helping Hand to prevent opponents from stalling out rain, but Helping Hand can still be useful for further boosting powerful attacks already given a boost by the rain. Power Whip's ability to eliminate Tapu Fini also makes it immensely valuable for rain teams that pack Kingdra as a sweeper. In return, rain teams easily handle Fire-types that can threaten Tsareena. Examples of such Fire-types include Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y, both of which also happen to value the support Tsareena can provide. When used in conjunction with either of these Pokemon, Tsareena should opt to use Rapid Spin to keep its partners safe from Stealth Rock. Helping Hand is especially useful to boost the powerful Heat Waves being fired by both Charizard and Volcarona, but High Jump Kick is still a viable option given its ability to significantly damage the somewhat problematic Incineroar.</p> "

Additionally, Togedemaru has access to Fake Out, which can help a partner set up Trick Room, as well as a decent pool of utility moves such as Encore.</p> <p>There is little room for error when using Togedemaru, however; with its non-existent bulk, Togedemaru is fodder to double targeting and also struggles to find a clean opportunity to switch into the field. Furthermore, chip damage from Stealth Rock and hail is fatal to Togedemaru, as this invalidates its Sturdy ability and makes any incoming hit an OHKO. Togedemaru is also generally a less effective Fake Out supporter compared to Incineroar and Scrafty, both of which are much better at taking hits and getting into a good position to provide support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Togedemaru is a pretty one-dimensional Pokemon, and the given set listed above is usually the most effective. However, Helping Hand can be used to boost the move used by Togedemaru's partner, which gives Togedemaru a bit more utility outside of Trick Room and could also situationally be more effective inside of Trick Room for breaking through a target wielding a pinch Berry. After You can also be used to allow Togedemaru's partner to move before virtually anything else when inside of Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Literally Any Damaging Move</strong>: At Level 1, Togedemaru relies entirely on its Sturdy ability and recovery item to stay alive, so double targeting Togedemaru with damage-dealing moves of any kind is highly effective when possible.</p> <p><strong>Teravolt and Photon Geyser</strong>: Kyurem-B and Necrozma are able to ignore Togedemaru's Sturdy ability with their Teravolt ability and Photon Geyser attack, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Targets with Recovery Berries: Togedemaru's strategy largely relies on bringing its target down to KO range fast so its partner can finish the KO. Targets holding a recovery Berry such as Wiki Berry or Figy Berry can take an Endeavor and still retain more than half their HP, which can allow them to survive a subsequent attack and bring Togedemaru's sweeping momentum to a halt.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Aegislash are immune to Endeavor and can freely play around Togedemaru's antics.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Togedemaru loses its ability to recover to full HP if its held item is lost to Knock Off from Pokemon such as Incineroar and Landorus-T, making Togedemaru far easier to take down on the following turns.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: If Togedemaru switches into Stealth Rock, its Sturdy ability will be invalidated and it will faint if struck by a single hit.

        "name": "Endeavor Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out buys a turn of momentum for Togedemaru's partner and can often be used to ensure its partner is able to set up Trick Room. Endeavor allows Togedemaru to whittle a target's HP down to near-zero, softening it up to be KOed by Togedemaru's partner. Encore is mostly just a filler move, as Togedemaru should be using Endeavor most of the time, but Encore can be used to lock a target into a passive move such as Protect, thereby allowing Togedemaru and its partner to focus on the other enemy slot. Spiky Shield is used to protect Togedemaru from an incoming attack for a turn so its partner can deal with Togedemaru's threats or get into a better position. Spiky Shield is preferred over Protect for its added ability to inflict chip damage to foes that use contact attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>At Level 1, Togedemaru's EVs and IVs have no effect on any relevant stats other than its Speed. The given set uses 0 IVs in Speed to drop the stat by one point, ensuring that Togedemaru moves first inside of Trick Room. Berry Juice, when used in tandem with Togedemaru's low HP stat and its Sturdy ability, ensures that Togedemaru will always recover to 100% HP after taking its first hit. In essence, Berry Juice ensures that Togedemaru needs to be attacked three times in order to be KOed. Shell Bell, on the other hand, when used in tandem with Togedemaru's low HP stat and its Sturdy ability, allows Togedemaru to recover to 100% HP every time it uses Endeavor on a healthy target, essentially creating an endless loop of recovery until the opponent is able to double target Togedemaru.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Togedemaru can easily be KOed by double targeting, especially before Trick Room is set, so it is crucial to protect or switch out Togedemaru on turns where its partner can't deal with at least one of the opposing Pokemon. Outside of Trick Room, Togedemaru can provide Fake Out support to allow a partner to set up Trick Room. However, it needs to be wary of faster Fake Out users like Incineroar and Mew as well as Tapu Lele, which can block Fake Out with Psychic Surge.</p> <p>Inside of Trick Room, Togedemaru's general strategy is to use Endeavor on a target, bringing them into KO range for Togedemaru's partner. Be wary of targets holding a pinch Berry, such as Tapu Fini with Wiki Berry and Incineroar with Figy Berry; targeting these Pokemon with Endeavor will only drop them to 50% HP after the berry activates, which may not be low enough for Togedemaru's partner to score a KO. It is also worth emphasizing that Togedemaru is incapable of finishing off a foe due to its weak Level 1 stats (aside from using Fake Out on a target with 1 HP), so it always will rely on its partner to score the finishing blows.</p> <p>Togedemaru's item of choice has implications on how it should be played. Berry Juice makes Togedemaru a bit more forgiving to play, as it can survive one turn of double targeting; for example, Togedemaru can switch into an attack on Turn 1, use Fake Out on Turn 2 to support a Trick Room setup, and still be alive on Turn 3 to get off an Endeavor. Shell Bell, on the other hand, makes Togedemaru less forgiving to play outside of Trick Room but makes Togedemaru considerably harder to KO inside of Trick Room, as it can continuously recover to 100% HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Togedemaru requires Trick Room to be effective, so it should be accompanied by Trick Room setters like Stakataka and Diancie. Stakataka has notably great synergy with Togedemaru, as it can activate its Beast Boost ability repeatedly by picking off the targets that Togedemaru whittles down with Endeavor. Hoopa-U is also a great partner for Togedemaru, as it can dissuade foes from stalling out Togedemaru's Endeavor attacks with Protect. Other low-speed Trick Room attackers such as Mega Camerupt and Lurantis also work well with Togedemaru, as they generally move before their foes inside of Trick Room and can finalize the KO on targets that have been weakened by Endeavor. Priority attackers, such as Extreme Speed Zygarde and Bullet Punch Scizor, can situationally make Togedemaru a threat even outside of Trick Room by threatening to finish off an Endeavor-weakened target while Togedemaru attacks the other foe with another Endeavor.</p> "

While there are other Pokemon that use setup moves in order to win games, such as Dragon Dance Zygarde, Kommo-o is unique in that it actually increases pressure and gains momentum when it sets up, as opposed to losing momentum while taking a turn to use Dragon Dance, thanks to Clangorous Soulblaze's large damage output. On top of this, Kommo-o's access to a very strong STAB spread move and a wide variety of coverage options gives it ample ways to finish games after successfully boosting. The DOU meta is not especially kind to Kommo-o, however, as it is dominated by the Fairy-type Island Guardians. Tapu Fini in particular isn't very good for Kommo-o due to the effect of Misty Terrain weakening Dragon-type moves. Kommo-o is also totally reliant on successfully using Clangorous Soulblaze to be viable, so without boosting, it is at the mercy of almost every powerful threat. Because of this, Kommo-o often requires well-placed support in order for it to function effectively. As Kommo-o is reliant on its Z-Move, any opposing player will automatically be able to identify a Kommo-o team's win condition and will be able to adjust their plays accordingly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse is a usable option for Kommo-o that can be used to hit other Kommo-o or get around Wide Guard, but Clanging Scales is usually more than enough, and missing out on coverage moves can really hurt Kommo-o. Stealth Rock can be used to put more foes into range of Clanging Scales and also gives Kommo-o a move to click if it is not ready to boost but doesn't need to use Protect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: DOU is dominated by the Island Guardians and other Fairy-types, which are all immune to Clangorous Soulblaze, and most can send back a very strong Fairy-type attack that will KO Kommo-o.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is a particularly great check, as it outspeeds +1 Kommo-o. Pokemon such as Mega Metagross and Deoxys-A also threaten large amounts of damage before Kommo-o boosts.</p> <p><strong>Misty Terrain: Misty Terrain from Tapu Fini's Misty Surge is bad news for Kommo-o, as it will weaken the move Kommo-o wants to spam the most, as well as the power of Clangorous Soulblaze. Tapu Fini itself can easily take any hit from Kommo-o and KO it with Moonblast, even after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: Kommo-o will be in a lot of trouble if it's not the fastest Pokemon on the field. Opposing Trick Room teams are especially bad because they will generally have quite a few ways to damage Kommo-o and avoid taking too much damage from it, and opposing Tailwind can outright ignore Kommo-o's +1 Speed boost.</p> ",

        "name": "Clangorous Soulblaze",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Clanging Scales is a very strong spread STAB move and the move Kommo-o wants to be using most often after it boosts. It also functions as the base move for Kommonium Z. Flamethrower is for Steel-type targets like Mega Metagross, Ferrothorn, and Genesect. Substitute improves Kommo-o's matchup versus Amoonguss or Toxic users and allows it to burn some extra turns after a boost while a partner handles a specific threat. Alternatively, Close Combat allows Kommo-o to deal large amounts of damage to Dark-types like Incineroar and Tyranitar as well as bulky Normal-types like Porygon2. Flash Cannon or Poison Jab are usable options in this third slot to hit Fairy-types harder, with Flash Cannon offering an immediate reversal of an otherwise automatic loss matchup to Diancie. Still, Kommo-o's teammates should be handling opposing Fairy-types, so the other moves slashed are often preferable. Protect is important because there are often situations where Kommo-o's health needs to be preserved so its partner can deal with a threat and ensure Kommo-o can effectively act as a wincon. It is also useful for stalling out opposing speed control and field conditions.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Kommonium Z turns Kommo-o's Clanging Scales into Clangorous Soulblaze and thus allows Kommo-o to do a lot of spread damage while boosting all of its stats. Soundproof is used in order to prevent moves like Snarl and Roar from affecting Kommo-o, as well as allowing Kommo-o to be immune to an opposing Kommo-o's Clanging Scales. A Timid nature coupled with maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs allows Kommo-o to set up before as many Pokemon as possible and ensures it can do as much damage as possible after boosting, but if Kommo-o is running Close Combat or Poison Jab, it can instead opt for a Hasty nature to avoid lowering their damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is very important to use at least one Pokemon with Kommo-o that functions as a pivot, such as U-turn Incineroar or Volt Switch Tapu Koko, as this creates many more opportunities for Kommo-o to safely get on the field and boost. Incineroar's rather slow U-turn is especially useful, as Incineroar will soak up the damage before getting Kommo-o safely onto the field. Kommo-o can use Clangorous Soulblaze early in the game in order to apply pressure on a favorable matchup, though it is generally easier to boost mid- or late-game when Kommo-o's checks have been weakened to the point where Kommo-o can act as a wincon. Kommo-o should never be taking significant damage before it is ready to use its Z-Move, as it will generally be the team's wincon. Once boosted, Kommo-o should be attacking to apply pressure as much as possible, and when it is at low health, it is usually not worth it to preserve Kommo-o, as it has already used its Z-Move, so firing off that last bit of damage will be more beneficial. Be sure that any opposing Tapu Fini is either KOed or severely weakened before boosting, as Misty Terrain takes away most of Kommo-o's damage output, and Tapu Fini easily soaks up any attack from Kommo-o and will return a KO with Moonblast. If the opposing team has two Pokemon immune to Clangorous Soulblaze, either in the form of two Fairy-types or a Fairy-type and opposing Kommo-o, they can prevent Clangorous Soulblaze from working by having both on the field to block the attack, thereby nullifying the boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Incineroar, Genesect, and Tapu Koko, are essential teammates, as they allow Kommo-o to get on the field to boost safely. Incineroar in particular is also helpful thanks to Fake Out, as that can prevent Kommo-o from taking some damage as it sets up and let it use that boost to deal with the threat. Kommo-o will need partners that comfortably switch into Fairy- and Ice-type attacks; Steel- and Fire-types like Genesect and Volcanion can perform this role easily. More than one of Kommo-o's teammates should be more than well equipped to deal with all of the opposing Island Guardians, but Tapu Fini in particular. Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu can easily beat opposing Tapu Fini and override its Misty Terrain, while Kartana and Suicune can handily do well against some opposing Fairy-types, with the added benefit of providing speed control through Tailwind. Mega Charizard Y gets a special mention here, as it can run Tailwind, boosts Kommo-o's Flamethrower with Drought, and handles most of the opposing Fairy- and Grass- types that Kommo-o doesn't threaten very much. Redirection can be very helpful to allow Kommo-o both to boost and then avoid damage while it tries to sweep. Rage Powder Amoonguss is a good option that also deals with opposing Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Koko, while Volcarona can also provide Tailwind support.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nihilego's base 103 Speed stat allows it to outspeed common foes such as Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B with ease, which, when paired with Beast Boost, gives Nihilego the ability to quickly get out of hand. This, combined with a unique offensive typing and an excellent Special Attack stat, lets it function as an anti-metagame breaker that excels at dismantling Mega Charizard Y balance teams along with other bulkier control-oriented teams containing Pokemon such as Incineroar, Zapdos, and Tapu Fini. Despite these upsides, Nihilego may find itself struggling to pick up KOs due to the presence of many specially defensive Pokemon in the format. Furthermore, Nihilego is also easily forced out by Steel-types and strong physical attackers, as it is very frail.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Wiki Berry set with Trick Room in the Stealth Rock moveslot helps against faster offensive teams. A bulkier spread of 48 HP / 152 Def / 116 SpA / 192 Spe with a Timid nature lets Nihilego take a Gigavolt Havoc from Tapu Koko after Stealth Rock and outspeed Kyurem-B while retaining enough Special Attack for the right Beast Boost. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, allowing Nihilego to take a -1 uninvested Kartana's Bloom Doom. Life Orb helps make up for Nihilego's inability to get immediate KOs due to its lack of power and is best used with Stealth Rock to push many of Nihilego's targets such as Tapu Fini and bulky Tapu Lele variants into OHKO range. With Hidden Power Fire, Nihilego can lure in Kartana or Mega Scizor to OHKO or severely dent them, although its not recommended because Mega Scizor can easily OHKO Nihilego with Bullet Punch, while faster Kartana variants OHKO it with Leaf Blade.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types in general are able to check Nihilego really well because most of them, in particular Mega Metagross and Kartana, resist both of Nihilego's STAB moves and can switch in pretty comfortably against it and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T and Zygarde are able to effectively check Nihilego variants not carrying Hidden Power Ice. Gastrodon and Mega Camerupt can also easily threaten a KO due to Nihilego's 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rain sweepers such as Kingdra and Mega Swampert are able to outspeed Nihilego and OHKO it with their boosted STAB attacks. Suicune is also able to slowly chip Nihilego down with either Snarl or Scald, while Araquanid can take a Power Gem and OHKO Nihilego with Liquidation in return.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Tapu Lele and Mega Latias are both free to deal huge damage to Nihilego with Psychic and Psyshock. Gothitelle and Cresselia, on the other hand, are bulky enough to take a few hits from Nihilego while slowly chipping it down with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Pokemon such as Diancie, Kartana, and Tyranitar chunk Nihilego with their STAB moves due to Nihilego's practically nonexistent physical bulk.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb and Power Gem provide valuable Poison- and Rock-type coverage , allowing Nihilego to hit a plethora of metagame threats like Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Incineroar super effectively. Stealth Rock chips many of Nihilego's targets, such as Tapu Lele and Volcanion, into OHKO range of its STAB moves, while Hidden Power Ice hits both Landorus-T and Zygarde, which otherwise wall Nihilego. Protect is useful for stalling out turns while Nihilego's ally helps get rid of opposing Steel-types or scouting out potential sets the foe is running.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment ensures that Nihilego outspeeds both Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B while being able to hit as hard as possible. Rockium Z provides the extra boost needed to OHKO bulkier targets such as Incineroar while acting as a one-time nuke to help Nihilego get going with Beast Boost. Focus Sash is also an alternative if the team has another Z-Move user, as it guarantees that Nihilego is able to get off a few attacks or set up Stealth Rock even in the presence of its checks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Nihilego best functions as an offensive Stealth Rock setter that can blanket check a range of prominent threats thanks to its unique offensive typing. However, its Special Attack may be lacking at times and miss important OHKOs; thus, it is beneficial to try to set up Stealth Rock early to chip its targets into KO range of its attacks. If Nihilego finds itself lacking an opportunity to do so, it can choose to utilize its Z-Move instead to secure the KO. It's also a good idea to try to bring Nihilego onto the field with the help of slow pivots, such as Incineroar, to extend its longevity so it is able to fully utilize its wallbreaking potential. Alternatively, it is also fine to hard switch Nihilego into Fire-types or other Pokemon that are unable to retaliate against it, such as Volcarona and unboosted Tapu Fini. Finally, it is advisable for Nihilego to always switch out when an opposing Steel-type hits the field, since Nihilego cannot do much against them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y teams in particular appreciate Nihilego's presence, since the two have great offensive synergy together, with Nihilego being able to remove Fire-types such as Incineroar and Volcanion that otherwise wall Charizard while Charizard removes Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Kartana. Steel-type checks such as Incineroar, Landorus-T, and Volcanion are absolutely mandatory for teams featuring Nihilego, as it will find itself struggling to deal any damage at all against such foes. Nihilego values teammates such as Kartana and Tapu Fini, as they are able to check Ground-types such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon, which Nihilego struggles against. Dragon-types such as Kommo-o and Kyurem-B benefit from Nihilego's ability to threaten and get rid of the Island Guardians along with other Fairy-types, allowing them to plow through teams with their respective STAB attacks. Common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Incineroar also work well with Nihilego, as they help make up for Nihilego's poor physical bulk through constant Intimidate shuffling. Lastly, Nihilego benefits tremendously from allies like Incineroar and Mega Metagross that are able to force out specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Amoonguss.</p> "

  "Pheromosa": {
    "overview": "<p>Pheromosa can be a threatening attacker in the right conditions, usually on hyper offensive teams, with powerful attacking stats, colorful coverage, and a deadly All-Out Pummeling that helps with weakening Steel-types for its allies as well as dealing a huge blow or even threatening an OHKO against many Trick Room setters such as Diancie, Bronzong, and Porygon2. Its ability to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame naturally is also very positive, and this holds especially true when Pheromosa is backed up with Tailwind support. U-turn is also a very helpful tool, letting it pivot out of rough matchups while still doing notable amounts of damage. However, non-existent bulk makes Pheromosa susceptible to drop to nearly any hit it takes; U-turn and Protect help mitigate this issue, but it's still not enough to make up for it. This is especially glaring when the opponent manages to successfully use up their method of speed control, be it Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Trick Room, as an outsped Pheromosa is a fainted Pheromosa most of the time.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Sash mitigates Pheromosa's frailty, but a decent chunk of Pheromosa's niche comes from Fightinium Z, so you often want to keep the Z-Move slot for it. Rapid Spin is a plausible option for Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona teams, but missing out on an attacking move with Pheromosa is a bit undesirable. Poison Jab can be run to target Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele, but missing out on any of the four above moves have massive drawbacks and implications for Pheromosa's viability. High Jump Kick with Fightinium Z can be used for a stronger hit on Chansey, but High Jump Kick is extremely unreliable, and the Z-Move is extremely prone to Intimidate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Most Attacking Moves: Pheromosa's complete lack of bulk and terrible defensive typing means it's very vulnerable to nearly any attack, meaning it should often be pivoting with U-turn or using Protect.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Sticky Web, opposing Tailwind, Trick Room, Icy Wind, and Electroweb are all massive issues for Pheromosa, as it is likely getting KOed if it is outsped.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Genesect can be a big issue to Pheromosa, as they outspeed it without any need for speed control. Priority users like Mega Scizor and Zygarde can also be a notable issue provided that Psychic Terrain isn't up. Lastly, Mega Swampert, Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Excadrill can also outspeed Pheromosa under their respective weather and threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types resisting Pheromosa's dual STAB combo and not minding Ice Beam make them a big annoyance. Tapu Fini is the most notable one, stomaching hits with ease and threatening to OHKO back, but Electroweb Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can also diminish Pheromosa's Speed. Additionally, Mega Gardevoir, with spread Hyper Voice, avoiding redirection, and Trick Room in its arsenal, can be deadly as well.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Focus Blast can be powered up into a devastatingly strong All-Out Pummeling that achieves impressive feats such as OHKOing Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Volcanion after Stealth Rock. It also helps tear apart Steel-types, as the type of team Pheromosa commonly finds itself on, Psychic-type spam, really appreciates Steel-types being taken care of. Ice Beam is important for Flying-types that resist Pheromosa's STAB combination, such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Mega Salamence. U-turn lets Pheromosa pivot out of rough matchups and pressure the likes of Cresselia and Mega Latias. Protect is mandatory, as Pheromosa's complete lack of bulk would make it very easy to deal with otherwise; for example, Fake Out, other priority moves, and double targeting makes it not hard to beat it. It's also great for stalling out the opponent's field conditions should they go up, such as Trick Room, rain, or opposing Tailwind.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Speed makes Pheromosa capable of outspeeding several other Pokemon that could OHKO it otherwise, with a Naive nature being preferred to outspeed Naive Deoxys-A and Mega Manectric as well as reduce damage taken from Fake Out and tank a hit from Kartana when compared to a Hasty nature. The investment in Special Attack guarantees more damage on Steel-types with Focus Blast and Flying-types with Ice Beam. A Rash nature can be run, however, for even more power in that department, especially if your own Deoxys-A is an ally to Pheromosa, giving it a notable damage boost that allows it to guarantee OHKOs on the likes of Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor without prior chip damage and providing very useful Special Attack boosts thanks to Beast Boost. Beast Boost grants Speed boosts with a Naive nature, giving Pheromosa a way to circumvent Choice Scarf users and some middling-Speed Pokemon when opposing Tailwind is set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pheromosa is a great choice for a lead more often than not, matching up well against common leads like Incineroar and Landorus-T and being able to pivot out if necessary. To use Pheromosa effectively, it's important to make good use of Protect and redirection to keep it safe from attacks. You can also use U-turn to switch out of rough matchups, but be careful to not be stopped by a Protect, as that will stop Pheromosa from switching out. Use your Z-Move on Steel-types to open up room for teammates such as Tapu Lele and Deoxys-A to clean up, but be careful of Protect from the likes of Mega Metagross and Mega Scizor, as they can reduce the damage of Pheromosa's Z-Move. Also, be wary of priority if Psychic Terrain isn't up and Choice Scarf users, as they can outspeed and knock out Pheromosa.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pheromosa requires very specific team support in order to work to its fullest potential. Tapu Lele is a notable teammate, not only shielding Pheromosa from occasional priority moves, but also denying Trick Room via Taunt. Deoxys-A works rather well with the core of Pheromosa and Tapu Lele, as it appreciates Pheromosa's ability to threaten Steel-types and prey on each other's checks, but keep in mind both are rather frail. Tailwind users are very helpful in order to help Pheromosa and its team against opposing Tailwind teams, with notable setters including Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Suicune. Zapdos is a very reliable setter, Mega Charizard Y helps pressure Steel-types for the Psychic-type spam core, and Suicune helps to prevent Trick Room with Roar. Trick Room prevention is very important with Pheromosa. Zapdos and Suicune can use Roar to help prevent Trick Room, with the latter being even better at doing so thanks to Inner Focus blocking Fake Out. Taunt users like Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and the aforementioned Tapu Lele and Fake Out users like Incineroar help as well. Redirection is also very useful for supporting Pheromosa courtesy of its frailty. Amoonguss doubles up as a Trick Room check with a very slow Spore, whereas Togekiss and Volcarona also provide Tailwind.</p> "

Although Steel is generally seen as a poor offensive typing, the influx of Fairy-types in the metagame and Celesteela's 999kg weight make Heavy Slam surprisingly reliable as its sole attack. Sadly, Celesteela struggles tremendously with opposing Electric-types and the incredibly popular Fire-types and falls flat against most opposing Substitute users due to its reliance on Leech Seed. This sometimes leaves Celesteela as a detriment to its team's ability to maintain momentum, though other times it serves as a late-game wincon by wearing down various threats while passively recovering health.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Acrobatics offers Celesteela a decently strong Flying-type STAB attack when paired with a Terrain-activated Seed, giving it the tools to hit Amoonguss and Kommo-o much harder. Hidden Power Ice deals super effective damage to Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence, but all of them are typically checked by Celesteela anyway. Celesteela has access to many other attacks, including Stomping Tantrum, Flash Cannon, Air Slash, Superpower, Stone Edge, and Giga Drain, but its role is typically better suited towards tanking hits as opposed to aiming for coverage. Celesteela's EV spread is highly customizable, with more Speed EVs for specific Tailwind benchmarks, enough Attack EVs to gain an Attack boost after each KO, and higher mixed bulk all being somewhat viable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon resist Heavy Slam and hit Celesteela super effectively with their STAB moves. Volcanion can also use Substitute to block Leech Seed, and Incineroar doesn't mind potential Special Defense boosts because it hits for physical damage.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heavy Slam is Celesteela's best attack, granting it super effective damage on some Fairy- and Rock-types and activating Beast Boost with each KO. Despite the low Attack investment, Heavy Slam is fairly strong due to Celesteela's high weight making it 120 Base Power against almost all foes. Leech Seed provides recovery and chip damage on Celesteela's foes at the end of each turn, which helps recover health lost from acting as a defensive switchin and to whittle down threats until they can be KOed by Heavy Slam. Flamethrower allows Celesteela to patch up matchups against Kartana and Genesect that would otherwise be near-stalemates. Alternatively, Substitute turns Celesteela into a late-game wincon, making it very difficult to break after Special Defense boosts and shielding it from possibly fatal attacks, status effects, and secondary effects accompanying weaker attacks like Fake Out and Knock Off. Lastly, Protect allows Celesteela to stall for recovery from Leftovers and Leech Seed, scout movesets, and wait out threatening field effects. Wide Guard may be used instead to turn Celesteela into a more supportive threat, which is often appreciated by its teammates due to the move's poor distribution.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 12 Defense EVs guarantee that Celesteela will survive Mega Metagross's Thunder Punch in Electric Terrain. 120 EVs are placed in Attack to ensure that Celesteela can hit slightly harder, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO on bulky Tapu Lele sets. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to patch up Celesteela's special bulk. Leftovers are crucial to keep Celesteela healthy and restore any HP lost from using Substitute. Beast Boost raises Celesteela's Special Defense one stage each time it gets a KO with Heavy Slam, making it bulkier and more difficult to break. If Celesteela isn't using Flamethrower, it may opt for a Calm nature instead as its Special Attack stat would be inconsequential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With its solid bulk and solid defensive typing, Celesteela makes a fantastic pivot into resisted attacks from foes such as Tapu Lele and Mega Metagross; it can recover any health lost while switching in from Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery and keep various hard-hitters in check. Use Leech Seed against any foes that do not pose an immediate threat, as the additional recovery is instrumental to Celesteela's success. Although Heavy Slam typically has high Base Power and Celesteela's Attack stat is decent, it should really only be used against foes weak to Steel or foes that Celesteela can KO to get a Special Defense boost. Otherwise, dealing passive damage with Leech Seed and applying pressure by setting up Substitute is usually far more effective. Substitute is safe to use against anything that can't break it or on a predicted switch, but avoid using it too often, as Celesteela appreciates being at high HP to check the threats it's needed to. If Celesteela has used Leech Seed, Protect will allow it to recover a lot of health between the Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery. Try to avoid being hit by Knock Off, as Leftovers hugely helps Celesteela's longevity. If carrying Wide Guard, use the move whenever Celesteela or its partner is threatened by a spread move and the extra protection can help its ally take out a threat or set up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any teammates that struggle with Psychic spam from the likes of Deoxys-A and Tapu Lele appreciate having Celesteela on their side. Celesteela struggles with both Electric- and Fire-types, so teammates to take on those, such as Tyranitar or Kyurem-B and Volcanion or Zygarde, respectively, help it out a lot. Ground-types in general are solid teammates for Celesteela, as its secondary Flying typing leaves it immune to Earthquake and Celesteela can hit Ice-types with Heavy Slam. Landorus-T in particular appreciates having an Earthquake-immune teammate and provides Intimidate support, which makes Celesteela's Substitute even more difficult to break, especially if it has accrued a Special Defense boost or two. Zygarde also deserves a special mention, as its checks are almost universally beaten by Celesteela, with Heavy Slam taking on Fairy- and Ice-type foes, while Zygarde sets up on and defeats most of Celesteela's checks. If Celesteela is using Wide Guard, pair it with teammates that are weak to spread moves such as Mega Charizard Y and Landorus-T.</p> "

Kartana's access to Tailwind further allows it to effectively bridge the gap between support and offense. Thanks to its viability as an offensive Grass-type, Kartana forms a very effective Fire / Water / Grass core with Incineroar and Tapu Fini. However, Kartana's defensive stats sadly betray its defensive typing, so its defensive capabilities are mainly limited to neutral physical attacks or resisted special attacks at best. As long as its paper-thin defenses are not tested, Kartana can snowball its way to a clean-cut victory.</p> ",

Such a set should employ a moveset of Leaf Blade / Smart Strike / Sacred Sword / Knock Off with a Jolly nature and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 72 SpD / 184 Spe. Focus Sash can be used if one desires to run a fast and offensive Kartana a bit more brazenly, as it can lean on its Focus Sash to either fire off a powerful attack or set Tailwind without fear. Flyinium Z can be used in conjunction with Tailwind to not only put Kartana's team at a Speed advantage, but to also guarantee critical hits with Leaf Blade. Night Slash is often used over Sacred Sword on such a set, as it is also guaranteed to score a critical hit after the Z-Tailwind boost. Smart Strike can realistically be used in place of Tailwind or Substitute on either the Offensive or Bulky sets if the extra coverage for Tapu Bulu is desired, but it often is not worth the loss of a utility option. The Offensive set can make use of Swords Dance to further boost Kartana's Attack, but such a set requires slightly more team support in order to make the best use of the boost. When Choice Scarf Kartana is used with Pokemon that need to avoid Stealth Rock like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, Defog can replace either Smart Strike or Knock Off. Finally, Normalium Z and Giga Impact can be used on offensive sets to score a surprise KO against frailer Fire-types that otherwise threaten Kartana like Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona, as well as Zapdos after some prior damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: A double weakness to Fire and notably bad HP and Special Defense stats mean that Kartana must avoid Fire-type attacks at all costs; you would be hard-pressed to find a Fire-type attack that fails to OHKO Kartana. This includes coverage moves from the likes of Genesect, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric, which commonly run Flamethrower, Heat Wave, and Overheat, respectively. Incineroar deserves a special mention as a Fire-type with Intimidate, which checks Kartana both offensively and defensively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types generally resist both of Kartana's common attacks in Leaf Blade and Sacred Sword and can match Kartana's Tailwind while threatening with either a powerful STAB attack or Fire-type coverage. A prime example is Zapdos, which easily switches into Kartana and has the added bonus of a chance to paralyze it with Static.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate is a semi-reliable way to mitigate Kartana's damage output, only failing to be effective if Kartana is behind a Substitute. Too many Intimidates can turn Kartana into deadweight, as its only non-damaging options are generally unable to make up for an inability to do damage. Landorus-T and Incineroar are the main users of Intimidate, and both can greatly aid teammates in checking Kartana. Mega Salamence is also a very effective check to Kartana thanks to its access to Intimidate in regular forme and ability to take any attack from Kartana with ease while threatening with a powerful Hyper Voice or Fire-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: While mentioned in other sections, it bears repeating that Zapdos is Kartana's best counter in the tier. Zapdos resists both of Kartana's STAB moves and its best coverage option in Sacred Sword while usually taking insignificant damage from Knock Off due to its tendency to use items that consume themselves such as Seeds or Berries. Zapdos very regularly carries Heat Wave to OHKO Kartana, but still comprehensively beats Kartana if lacking Heat Wave due to its ability to stomach any attack Kartana can throw at it and Roost off the damage. Finally, Static means that Kartana has to be careful about contacting Zapdos lest it be paralyzed and therefore neutralized.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Even when its Special Defense is bolstered with EV investment, Kartana does not take strong special attacks well, especially when they are boosted in some way. For example, Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele both deal heavy damage with their Terrain-boosted STAB attacks and can even knock it out in one hit with a Z-Move. Deoxys-A also outspeeds and knocks out all but Choice Scarf Kartana with Psycho Boost when Psychic Terrain is active.</p> ",

        "name": "All-out Offense",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Blade is Kartana's best attack, boasting consistently reliable damage output against common Pokemon like Tapu Fini and an increased critical hit chance to boot. Sacred Sword combines with Leaf Blade for sufficiently wide-ranging coverage and provides Kartana with a way to hit Steel-types and a common would-be counter, Incineroar, for significant damage. Substitute is great at taking advantage of the switches and Protects that Kartana tends to force with its monstrous offensive presence and can buy Kartana an extra turn if executed correctly. Substitute also comes with the bonus of blocking detrimental Intimidates that would otherwise lower Kartana's damage output. Tailwind can be used over Substitute if an element of team support is desired, but offensive sets tend to prefer the safety net of Substitute, especially on teams with another Tailwind setter. Protect is preferred over Detect due to its higher PP, but Detect can be used in its stead if Fightinium Z is chosen to provide Kartana with a last-ditch evasion boost via Z-Detect.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature and 192 EVs in Speed allow Kartana to outspeed all Landorus and anything slower. 252 Attack EVs are used to maximize damage output and also happen to be the exact investment required to OHKO the standard 252 HP / 44 Def Landorus-T with Bloom Doom. The remaining EVs are simply funneled into Kartana's weakest stat—Special Defense. Grassium Z is the best option for Kartana overall, as Bloom Doom is able to OHKO a large number of targets, including Tapu Koko, Araquanid, and the aforementioned bulky Landorus-T at neutral, as well as Tapu Fini at -1 Attack. However, Fightinium Z can be useful if Kartana needs the capability to knock out certain targets while sacrificing wider applicability of its Z-Move. All-Out Pummeling will always OHKO opposing Kartana, Incineroar, and offensive Kyurem-B at neutral, and even has a chance to OHKO standard Incineroar at -1 and Assault Vest Kyurem-B at neutral.</p> <p>This set can also run more bulk if the team calls for it, as Kartana can be successful with a variety of spreads and has many reasonable benchmarks within reach. However, Fightinium sets should avoid using less than 160 EVs in Attack, as they then lose the ability to always KO standard Incineroar with -1 Leaf Blade into -1 All-Out Pummeling.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kartana is best used to blow a hole in an opposing team with its Z-Move or clean up later in a game with its snowball-inducing Beast Boost. Making aggressive use of Substitute can result in Kartana finding itself with a free turn or two, which increases its capability to run away with a game. At the risk of sounding too obvious, Fire-type attacks should be avoided at all costs or else Kartana might find itself quickly incinerated. Even resisted yet strong special attacks like Tapu Lele's Psychic should be avoided; do not overestimate the value of a resistance on a Pokemon as frail as Kartana. Offensive Kartana is best treated as a Pokemon that appreciates free switches and not as a Pokemon that can switch in to take a hit and then attack; its poor defenses with little investment and no means of healing mean that Kartana can't comfortably take many attacks and still find itself in a position to sweep. If Tailwind is chosen over Substitute, it is important to note that this Kartana set cannot function like other Tailwind setters. It still must be treated as an offensive Pokemon that happens to have the option to support itself and its teammates if the opportunity presents itself.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, any Kartana set pairs well with Incineroar and Tapu Fini—the former for its ability to buy Kartana free turns with Fake Out and protect it with Intimidate, and the latter for its ability to keep Kartana healthy with Heal Pulse and ensure it attacks first with Icy Wind. Additionally, Tapu Fini is one of the best checks to the Fire-types that heavily threaten Kartana, while Kartana and Incineroar can check Grass-types that threaten Tapu Fini. Additional checks to Fire-types such as Zygarde are also appreciated, especially since Zygarde thrives with a partner like Bloom Doom Kartana that can threaten Tapu Fini. If not running Tailwind itself, Kartana appreciates teammates that provide speed control, such as Mega Charizard Y or Zapdos, so it does not have to rely on surviving an attack to dish out big damage. Speaking of Zapdos, Kartana quite desperately needs teammates that can take care of Zapdos, which resists any attack Kartana throws its way while threatening to match its Tailwind, paralyze it with Static, or OHKO it with Heat Wave. Such teammates include Kyurem-B or Tyranitar, both of which threaten Zapdos with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Blade and Sacred Sword are staples on Kartana because the coverage provided by these two moves is the best Kartana can achieve with just two attacks, making them worth using on any Kartana set. Tailwind is typically the reason a bulkier Kartana set is chosen, as it turns Kartana from a one-dimensional powerhouse into a slightly more defensive utility Pokemon. However, if the team around Kartana is built such that Tailwind is unnecessary, Substitute can still be used to protect Kartana from damage and possibly buy free turns, though it should be noted that bulky Kartana sets take less advantage of Substitutes due to their less offensive nature. Protect is used in order to keep Kartana safe from strong attacks and preferred over Detect due to its higher PP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The gratuitous investment in bulk allows Kartana to survive a surprising number of attacks that would otherwise knock it out, such as Psycho Boost outside of Psychic Terrain from Naive Deoxys-A and Hammer Arm from Mega Metagross. If using Substitute, the investment in HP also ensures that Kartana's pinch Berry will activate after three uses of the move. Investing 144 EVs in Speed with a Jolly nature allows Kartana to outspeed all variants of Kyurem-B. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack to retain some of the damage output for which Kartana is so well known. A pinch Berry is the item of choice and provides Kartana with a means of healing itself. Realistically, any of the Berries not named Wiki could be used, but Mago is typically chosen due to its ability to confuse Araquanid and Trick Room Hoopa-U if they steal Kartana's Berry.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unlike its offensive counterpart, bulky Kartana is capable of switching into some specific Pokemon, such as Tapu Fini or Mega Metagross, and absorbing their attacks well. It can typically set Tailwind for its team and then threaten some solid damage output with either of its attacks. This set is much more forgiving when used as a switch-in thanks to its increased defenses and employment of a pinch Berry. Finding ways to activate its Berry when its health is low, such as switching out and back in if Stealth Rock is up or baiting a weak attack, can pay dividends by allowing Kartana more turns on the field. However, it is important to remain vigilant and not be careless. Bulky Kartana is still a Kartana, complete with the same set of weaknesses and pitfalls.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The more defensive nature of this set allows Kartana to play a more defensive role in the Fire / Water / Grass core it forms with Tapu Fini and Incineroar. Bulky Kartana can more freely be used as a pivot to absorb Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Incineroar, Tapu Fini, or any of its teammates. This set is far more effective on teams that require speed control, as this Kartana is a much more reliable Tailwind setter than its offensive counterpart. Additionally, teams that need their Steel-type or Grass-type to perform a more defensive role will appreciate the bulkier Kartana set. The most beneficial partners for bulky Kartana are those that can take advantage of its Tailwind while threatening opposing Fire-types, such as Zygarde, Life Orb Earth Power Kyurem-B, or offensive Landorus-T.</p> "

Access to Prism Armor and reliable recovery in Moonlight improve its longevity and ease in setting up. Additionally, Necrozma's great movepool makes it less predictable and enables it to provide nice support to its team or pick up an unexpected KO. However, Necrozma's typing isn't great defensively because it lacks a useful resistance aside from Psychic and is weak to fairly common Dark-type attacks. Also, Necrozma faces competition as a Calm Mind sweeper from Tapu Fini, Cresselia, and Mega Latias.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive Trick Room set with Photon Geyser, Earth Power, and either Protect or Stealth Rock is an option for Trick Room teams, though this set lacks power and longevity as opposed to the Calm Mind set. Heat Wave hurts Pokemon that don't fear Earth Power or Tectonic Rage like Assault Vest Genesect and Mega Scizor. However, the inability to beat Incineroar makes Heat Wave inferior to Earth Power. Electric Seed or Grassy Seed with their respective Terrain setters can make Necrozma's setup easier, but this set is outclassed by Calm Mind Cresselia because it is a lot bulkier than Necrozma.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Pokemon like Incineroar, Hoopa-U, and Tyranitar are immune to Photon Geyser and capable of dealing big damage with their super effective Dark-type STAB moves. They're pretty vulnerable to a boosted Tectonic Rage, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: The likes of Mega Metagross, Genesect, and Celesteela resist Photon Geyser but usually struggle to take on a boosted Tectonic Rage. Celesteela is one of the most sturdy Necrozma counters because it's immune to Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Pokemon like Genesect and Volcarona are capable of dealing heavy damage to Necrozma with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks: Necrozma isn't very bulky, so powerful attacks like Kyurem-B's Subzero Slammer and item-boosted Thunderbolt from Tapu Koko inflict big damage on Necrozma. Note that strong neutral attacks are almost as dangerous as super effective ones.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Status from the likes of Porygon2 and Chansey cuts Necrozma's longevity and prevents it from successfully setting up.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Photon Geyser is Necrozma's best STAB option thanks to its power and accuracy. Earth Power is a coverage move for grounded Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Aegislash as well as for other Pokemon weak to it such as Incineroar and Victini. Calm Mind allows Necrozma to become a powerful and bulky offensive threat. Protect helps Necrozma survive strong attacks and double targets as well as scout for foes' moves. Moonlight is an option over Protect that increases Necrozma's longevity and gives it more setup opportunities.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Groundium Z turns Earth Power into a strong Tectonic Rage, KOing threats like Incineroar, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash. Alternatively, Wiki Berry improves Necrozma's longevity by healing it when it's on low HP at the cost of a powerful nuke. Prism Armor is Necrozma's only ability and is a useful one, reducing damage from super effective attacks. The given EV spread and a Modest nature give Necrozma decent bulk, allowing Necrozma to outspeed Mega Manectric in Tailwind and OHKO standard non-Assault Vest Incineroar with Tectonic Rage. If you're using Necrozma on a Trick Room team, maximize HP and Special Attack EVs at the cost of Speed EVs, change its nature to Quiet, and set its Speed IV to 0.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Necrozma early-game to apply offensive pressure on the opponent's team with boosted attacks and soften it up for teammates. Tectonic Rage is useful if you need to immediately destroy a foe or lure in and KO Necrozma's checks like Incineroar and Mega Metagross. Since Moonlight has low PP, don't use it too recklessly. Be careful with bringing Necrozma directly in on strong attacks from the likes of Kyurem-B and Mega Salamence because Necrozma isn't very bulky and is pretty slow. Necrozma's ability to take super effective hits well can make it seem bulkier than it actually is, so don't overestimate Necrozma's bulk, and avoid strong neutral hits.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-type checks like Mega Charizard Y, Zygarde, and Volcanion are nice teammates for Necrozma because they can remove Steel-types like Genesect and Celesteela that give Necrozma trouble. Mega Charizard Y is an especially notable ally because it increases Moonlight's recovery with Drought and gives Necrozma a form of speed control. Strong physical attackers like Kartana and Lurantis can scare off special walls like Chansey and Tapu Fini, which Necrozma struggles to beat. Since Necrozma is slow, it appreciates speed control like Tailwind and Icy Wind. Some Pokemon that can provide it are the aforementioned Mega Charizard Y, Kyurem-B, and Zapdos. Alternatively, you can take advantage of Necrozma's fairly low Speed by using it in a Trick Room team alongside setters such as Porygon2 and Diancie. Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar, Landorus-T, and Mega Manectric eases Necrozma's setup and lets it rely on Moonlight less, as the move has low PP. Heal Pulse from the likes of Tapu Fini and Chansey helps Necrozma set up too. Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu appreciate Necrozma's ability to lure in and KO Fire- and Steel-types like Incineroar and Mega Metagross. The former also patches up Necrozma's poor Speed with Tailwind, and the latter provides it with passive recovery from Grassy Terrain.</p> "

  "Naganadel": {
    "overview": "<p>Outside of its relatively high Speed, decent coverage, and nifty access to Tailwind for a fast attacker, Naganadel leaves a lot to be desired, relegating it to being a mere niche pick for hyper offense teams. With its noteworthy Special Attack, base 121 Speed that allows it to get the jump on numerous key threats, and Dragon / Poison / Fire coverage that lends it the ability to hit virtually everything in the metagame, Naganadel can be an easy way of applying pressure to numerous high-profile Pokemon in DOU such as Mega Metagross, Tapu Fini, Zygarde, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Bulu. Naganadel relies on its Speed to do its job quite heavily, and it even has an ability in Beast Boost that supplements that, as it gets a Speed boost for every KO; this reliance, however, is also easily punishable, as its frailty can leave it helpless when facing opposing speed control in Tailwind or Trick Room, though Beast Boost can help against the former somewhat. Naganadel's frailty also means it has no defensive value whatsoever, being unable to safely switch in most of the time, and at times, it has an overreliance on its coverage to get KOs. Often, unless on a team bent on applying overwhelming pressure, Naganadel is simply overshadowed by other threats such as Tapu Koko that provide more utility and flexibility to their teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flamethrower can be used, as its 100% accuracy makes it usable as a strict coverage move over Fire Blast, but the loss of damage output is unappealing because it lessens Naganadel's ability to punish switches. Similarly, Hidden Power Ice can be used over Draco Meteor, as it still hits Landorus-T, Zygarde, and Mega Salamence without the risk of a miss and without being weakened by Misty Terrain, but Draco Meteor's ability to significantly dent neutral targets is much more useful in general. If desired, Naganadel can run a Choice Scarf set, which would allow it to outrun virtually the entire metagame and check numerous offensive threats, including most opposing Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele and Genesect. An EV spread aimed at giving Naganadel a Special Attack raise with Beast Boost can be used, though this comes at the cost of being unable to outrun Mega Salamence, which can heavily punish the teams Naganadel usually fits on with Tailwind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele both outrun Naganadel and OHKO it with their STAB moves, though they have to watch out for Tailwind and Beast Boost, as they can easily be KOed if Naganadel has the Speed advantage. Both Necrozma and Cresselia can significantly dent Naganadel with their STAB moves, are generally capable of taking a hit if healthy, and can take away Naganadel's Speed with Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Icy Wind, Tailwind, and Trick Room: Naganadel does not want to lose its Speed advantage, as this is how it maintains its effectiveness and it is quite easy to pick off otherwise. Tailwind from the likes of Zapdos and Suicune and Trick Room from foes such as Stakataka and Hoopa-U can turn the tables on Naganadel's harassment. Icy Wind is super effective against Naganadel and slows it down, though a notable user in Assault Vest Kyurem-B has to be careful, as it can drop to Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Naganadel can see its ability to be a threat wane when threatened by faster foes, as its frailty leaves it easy to pick off, especially with Life Orb racking up recoil. Deoxys-A, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Genesect can dispatch Naganadel by virtue of their Speed, though they can easily become the hunted if Naganadel gets extra Speed from Beast Boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Generally speaking, Pokemon that can take an attack from Naganadel can punish it hard due to its frailty and its reliance on its Speed. Bulky supporters Incineroar and Scrafty can use Knock Off, weakening Naganadel's damage output while also significantly hurting it. Zapdos and Stakataka can generally take Naganadel's attacks and use their respective speed control options in return, though the former needs a boost from either Misty Seed or Psychic Seed to be comfortable. Tyranitar can shrug off Naganadel's blows with its sand-boosted Special Defense and decimate it with Stone Edge.</p> ",

        "name": "Fast Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is Naganadel's most reliable attack: a STAB move that does generally good damage and is also notably useful for hitting key threats in Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu super effectively. Fire Blast allows Naganadel to smash Steel-types, primarily Mega Metagross but also Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which can take on Naganadel relatively unopposed otherwise. Tailwind lets Naganadel provide speed control support, helpful in keeping up the pressure its team applies, letting them outrun most foes unabated. Protect lets Naganadel defend itself, which is useful for positioning and stalling field effects; alternatively, Draco Meteor offers a secondary STAB move that provides Naganadel extra damage at a cost, hitting Kyurem-B and Ground-types like Zygarde and Landorus-T hard.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment and a Timid nature are used to maximize Naganadel's offensive capability, notably also allowing it to outrun Mega Metagross and Mega Salamence. Life Orb is used in order to boost Naganadel's damage output, which is handy in getting KOs and generally pressuring threats.</p> <p>Naganadel can also take a slightly different route, instead utilitizng an Assault Vest set with U-turn in place of Tailwind. This sacrifices some field conditioning ability and damage in favor of pivoting utility. Even with an Assault Vest equipped, however, Naganadel isn't particularly bulky, and if it wants to invest enough to survive relevant attacks like Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam or Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic without Terrain support, then Naganadel will have trouble getting KOs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As much as possible, Naganadel should be put in a position where it can threaten foes in an aggressive manner, as its role is to apply pressure and nothing else. In the early- to mid-game, it can be used as a way of putting instant pressure and momentum thanks to its high Speed and vast coverage. Later on, as the opposing team gets weakened, it can also be a handy way of cleaning up an opposing team. When Naganadel can't quite get the KO it needs or has done its job and is in a bad position, Tailwind is an option to fall back to; it doesn't matter if Naganadel gets KOed in the process, as this also provides a free switch, often giving you back the momentum as you get the chance to respond with the appropriate threat for free while also being considerably supported by Naganadel's last-ditch Tailwind effort. As Naganadel is quite frail and is chipped down over time by Life Orb recoil, care should be applied when it comes to its health, as it can get KOed easily; one should try to bring it in only on free switches or predicted weak hits such as Tapu Fini's Muddy Water. At times, it can be important to pay attention to Naganadel's Beast Boost ability, as it can be useful in allowing Naganadel to outrun otherwise faster key threats such as Tapu Koko, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele; occasionally, this ability can also be nifty in allowing Naganadel to outrun opposing teams even if their Tailwind is up, so take note.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Naganadel fits well in a team composition heavily based on applying overwhelming offensive pressure to win. With that in mind, Deoxys-A, the quintessential hyper offense Pokemon, works well with Naganadel, as it is capable of pressuring teams and handling the few unboosted threats faster than Naganadel, such as Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric, and has the coverage that lets it hit Tyranitar hard. On another note, Pokemon that generally appreciate having Tailwind support for their offensive jobs are good teammates, with generally strong attackers like Tapu Bulu, Choice Band Zygarde, and Mega Metagross all fitting the bill. Fire-type teammates are also good to have, as they can reliably punch through Steel-types, allowing Naganadel to use its STAB attacks more often; Mega Charizard Y is a good pick, as it also appreciates Naganadel's Tailwind allowing it to use its powerful sun-boosted Heat Wave more freely, while Volcanion can be nifty for also being able to threaten Tyranitar, Stakataka, and Heatran. Any checks to opposing Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele are welcome additions; Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Aegislash, and Genesect can reliably take their STAB moves quite handily and easily KO in return, while having your own Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can be useful enough in checking opposing Deoxys-A as well as other fast threats like Tapu Koko. As Naganadel is a liability in Trick Room, having teammates that can deal with the field condition are huge boons. Taunt users such as Tapu Koko and phazers such as Suicune can be handy to have for stopping Trick Room from being set up. However, if it does get set up, some handy bulky pivots such as Aegislash and Zygarde can be useful for playing around Trick Room and stalling it out. Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele can make good partners for Naganadel, as they can remove the Misty Terrain that weakens its Draco Meteor.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Stakataka sets itself apart from the wide array of viable Trick Room setters in DOU thanks to its ability to be not only a setter but also an exploiter of this battle condition. Its Gyro Ball is devastatingly strong thanks to a combination of an abysmal Speed stat and a notable Attack stat, dealing good damage to the likes of Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko. It can set up its very own Trick Room with the ideal support and demolish offensive archetypes with full-powered Gyro Balls. Stakataka's rock-bottom Speed stat is key for getting the jump on the likes of Diancie, Hoopa-U, and Amoonguss in Trick Room and making it nearly impossible to outrun under said conditions.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Stakataka is somewhat one-dimensional, relying a bit too much on Trick Room to succeed, so if its foes manage to prevent Trick Room with Taunt, Fake Out, Spore, or anything similar, Stakataka will have a tough time. It also mandates a considerable amount of support, as it often struggles to reliably set up Trick Room on its own. Its poor special bulk also prevents it from setting up Trick Room on notable special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Volcanion. Finally, Stakataka faces considerable competition from Diancie as an offensive Trick Room setter.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ally Switch is yet another option that allows Stakataka to create mind games that may help Trick Room go up, but Stakataka is a bit strapped for moveslots, so other moves usually take priority. Chople Berry could be an option to better handle Kommo-o and Fighting-type coverage from the likes of Deoxys-A and Tapu Bulu, but the protection offered by a Shuca Berry is more widely applicable. Stomping Tantrum gives Stakataka a way to hit Mega Metagross for considerable damage, and Superpower may be useful for Kartana and Ferrothorn, but Stakataka struggles to find room for an extra attack. Bulkier sets can prove very difficult to take down, especially after a few stat boosts, though Stakataka will have to be okay with dealing much less damage and losing its snowballing potential.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T, Stomping Tantrum Mega Metagross, Mega Swampert, Zygarde, and Excadrill can either OHKO or heavily damage Stakataka, and all 2HKO through Shuca Berry.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Incineroar pack the Intimidate ability, making Stakataka a lot easier to deal with and pivot into.

It is generally preferred on Lonely sets, as it can usually nab more KOs. Trick Room is key to Stakataka's niche, as it enables the Ultra Beast to outspeed the entire metagame from a couple of turns. Protect allows Stakataka to not take damage when a partner sets up Trick Room and in general keeps it safe when it's needed to. Wide Guard, on the other hand, provides a way to block spread moves such as Heat Wave from Mega Charizard Y and Muddy Water from Kingdra and Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Lonely nature and 15 Defense IVs along with 252 Attack EVs make Stakataka's Attack and Defense stats identical, providing Attack raises from Beast Boost, which are preferred most of the time to allow Stakataka to become much more threatening and snowball with much more ease. Nonetheless, a Brave nature can also be used to provide Defense boosts from Beast Boost, making Stakataka a more reliable setter of Trick Room, notably enabling it to avoid the OHKO from uninvested Landorus-T's spread Earthquake when compared to its Lonely counterpart. Rockium Z is the preferred item, as it enables Stakataka to use a powerful move that often nabs it a KO on a Pokemon such as Amoonguss or a weakened Celesteela, giving it a coveted Attack raise; Rockium Z should be used alongside Stone Edge. However, Shuca Berry can be used instead to allow Stakataka to better handle the likes of Landorus-T and Zygarde. Life Orb is also an option for a more offensive set in case the Z-Crystal slot is already taken.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most cases, Stakataka's goal is to exploit Trick Room turns and tear through its opponent's team. Thus, it is often optimal to save Stakataka for late-game, when its checks have been successfully weakened. It's also a decently reliable setter of Trick Room, so it is often important to make use of redirection, Fake Out, or Wide Guard from Stakataka's ally to help it get Trick Room up, as oftentimes, an opponent double targeting Stakataka will likely knock it out. Having another Trick Room setter on the field also mitigates this, as the opponent can only double target one of them, creating some mind games. Similarly, punishing the opponent for double targeting Stakataka is also nice, with a partner wielding great offensive presence and by using Protect on Stakataka. This is especially useful because players are compelled to double target Stakataka in an attempt to prevent Trick Room. Finally, switching into an Intimidate user to limit damage from Ground- or Fighting-type moves is also a great strategy. Against Taunt users such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Gothitelle, it might be a smart idea simply to Gyro Ball them as they Taunt Stakataka. Under Trick Room, though, it's important to always give Stakataka the KO instead of its ally, if at all possible, in order to trigger Beast Boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pairing Stakataka with another Trick Room setter is a great idea, because Stakataka isn't the most reliable setter out there. Porygon2 takes out Landorus-T and Zygarde that may try to remove Stakataka with their Ground-type attacks, and Necrozma deals with most of the Steel-types that annoy Stakataka with its Ground coverage or even a potential Tectonic Rage. Tapu Bulu can take on bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Suicune and provides Grassy Terrain as a bonus for Stakataka. Other slow attackers such as Mega Camerupt, Torkoal, and Lurantis really appreciate the Trick Room provided by Stakataka.</p> "

  "Zeraora": {
    "overview": "<p>Zeraora's access to a wide range of support moves such as Fake Out and Snarl coupled with its blistering speed makes it a decent offensive support Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. While it faces fierce competition from other Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric, which can all provide either more power or better utility than Zeraora, it is a fantastic check to all of these Pokemon, as it can heal itself by switching into Electric-type attacks and can weaken their attacks with Snarl. However, while Zeraora provides fantastic role compression, even non-Electric-types like Incineroar can generally perform the same supportive role while adding more offensive pressure and providing a better defensive typing. Furthermore, many of the Pokemon that dominate the Doubles metagame comfortably switch into and stay in front of Zeraora. For example, Zygarde can freely set up Dragon Dance, Soundproof Kommo-o can use Clangorous Soulblaze while ignoring Snarl, and Incineroar and Landorus-T safely pivot in on Zeraora and weaken it with Intimidate.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an option to give Zeraora a way to deal some serious damage to foes like Kartana and Mega Scizor, while Hidden Power Ice gives Zeraora a way to damage opposing Zygarde and Landorus-T. With either of these moves, which would typically replace Plasma Fists, Zeraora should switch to a Timid nature and shift its Attack EVs to Special Attack. A set with Taunt over Volt Switch or Plasma Fists and a Mago Berry over Assault Vest is also usable, as Taunt gives Zeraora the ability to stop opposing Pokemon from setting up or employing speed control, while a Mago Berry gives Zeraora some longevity through recovery. However, the added bulk from Assault Vest and the pivoting of Volt Switch are generally preferred, as that is how Zeraora provides the most momentum for a team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Zygarde and Landorus-T wall any Zeraora not carrying Hidden Power Ice, as they are immune to Electric-type attacks and do not mind Snarl.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Zeraora can't do much to any Grass-type like Tapu Bulu or Amoonguss, as they easily take a Plasma Fists, and Amoonguss can still use Rage Powder and Spore despite Snarl lowering its Special Attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Deoxys-A and Pheromosa are the only Pokemon that naturally outspeed Zeraora in the Doubles metagame, but common Choice Scarf users like Genesect or Tapu Lele can also deal with Zeraora, as it relies heavily on being the fastest Pokemon on the field to affect momentum.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Speed Control: While Zeraora will often be the fastest Pokemon on a neutral board state, opposing Tailwind or Trick Room will take away its role completely, as it will no longer be the quick pivot it is supposed to be.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out provides a partner with a chance to set up or take out an opposing threat, potentially providing a heavy momentum swing in your direction. Plasma Fists is Zeraora's main way of dealing damage; though it also neutralizes most Normal-type moves, this interaction rarely happens in DOU play. Snarl supports Zeraora's partners by weakening opposing special attacks, which is especially effective because Zeraora outspeeds most notable special attackers, including Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric. Knock Off can also be used to remove Berries or other crucial items like Chansey's Eviolite. Volt Switch allows Zeraora's partners to get on the field in a more favorable position and allows Zeraora to come back in at a later turn and apply more pressure with Fake Out and Snarl.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest is used to bolster Zeraora's special bulk, as it benefits most from using four attacking moves anyway. 192 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature ensure Zeraora will always outspeed Mega Manectric. The EVs invested into bulk allow Zeraora to take either a Stomping Tantrum from Mega Metagross or a rain-boosted Hydro Vortex from Kingdra. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to boost the damage output of Plasma Fists.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zeraora functions well as a lead, as it can usually pivot out if you find yourself in a bad position, and its faster Fake Out means you can generally control opposing Trick Room or other setup leads. However, do not misinterpret this as Zeraora being a dedicated lead — such a thing does not exist in Doubles, and Zeraora can also perform successfully when it is kept in the back and used to set up a partner Pokemon mid- or late-game. Pivoting with Zeraora often is crucial, as it is highly beneficial to get it on the field at the same time as a setup Pokemon like Zygarde, allowing it to provide a free turn with Fake Out or weaken opposing Pokemon with Snarl to get Zygarde ready to set up Dragon Dance. Generally you are not saving Zeraora for late-game unless you have weakened the other team significantly. While Zeraora is fast, its attacks won't hit particularly hard, so it is very difficult to use as a cleaner.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that would generally lose momentum trying to set up pair well with Zeraora. Zygarde comes to mind, as both Fake Out and Snarl can put it in more favorable positions to set up Dragon Dance. Suicune fits on this point as well, as the free turn from Fake Out to set up Tailwind can be very beneficial. Landorus-T, another Ground-type, pairs extremely well with Zeraora, as it provides Intimidate and both Pokemon cover each other's checks fairly well. On the same token, you will need to be able to deal with opposing Ground-types like Zygarde and Landorus-T, as they completely wall Zeraora and don't care much about Snarl. Good options for dealing with those Pokemon include Tapu Fini and Kyurem-B. Zeraora cannot do anything to deal with Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss, so Pokemon like Incineroar or Kyurem-B are fantastic partners for it. Zeraora is a good option to place on teams that might be threatened by fast special attackers like Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric so Pokemon like Kommo-o and Zygarde feel more safe to set up. Since Zeraora is not really used as an offensive Pokemon, it is necessary to keep in mind during building that you may not want too many passive Pokemon on your team; while Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn are solid partners for Zeraora, you do not want your team to be stuck with not enough offensive firepower. However, this can be mitigated by opting for more offensive sets on them, like Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Curse Ferrothorn. Zeraora teams can also really benefit from having a Shadow Tag Pokemon like Gothitelle, which can keep foes on the field that have been weakened by Snarl while Zeraora pivots out to get in a Pokemon to potentially set up more safely in front of them.</p> "
