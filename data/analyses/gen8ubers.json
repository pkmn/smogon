  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great bulk and good offensive stats, Giratina-O acts as a good attacker that threatens many top-tier threats, including Necrozma-DM, Groudon, Eternatus, Calyrex-S, and Calyrex-I. With strong physical and special Ghost-type STAB moves and Griseous Orb, it's one of the tier's few attackers to succeed both physically and specially. Levitate makes Giratina-O a good check to Ground-types such as Groudon, Landorus, and Landorus-T. Even though its bulk is great, however, Giratina-O has no reliable recovery and is vulnerable to chip damage from Stealth Rock and status. As a base 90 Speed Pokemon, Giratina-O can be outsped by defensive staples like Ho-Oh, and the special set is outsped by non-invested offensive threats like bulky Groudon and Kyogre. It also faces competition as a Ghost-type from Lunala and Calyrex-S; Lunala is a defogger that possesses better bulk with Shadow Shield and reliable recovery, which let it better check threats like Zekrom, while Calyrex-S hits harder, can severely cripple Yveltal with Trick, and sweeps weakened teams better with As One and Astral Barrage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giratina-O can opt for Roar or Dragon Tail to deal with bulky setup sweepers like Zygarde and Groudon. However, as it has no means of recovery, Giratina-O can struggle late-game to deal with these threats. Dragon Pulse can be used instead of Draco Meteor to avoid the Special Attack drop while still OHKOing Zygarde before Power Construct activates. However, it lacks power against non-Dragon-type foes. Outrage is an option over a status move on the physical set to let Giratina-O lure in Chansey, Blissey, and Zygarde. However, being locked into the move means Giratina-O will easily be revenge killed. Finally, a fully offensive set with Hone Claws alongside an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used on Sticky Web teams. However, Giratina-O struggles to set up due to its lack of recovery and mediocre defensive typing; it also has a difficult time breaking through defensive cores even with the boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Zarude, and Yveltal are bulky enough to take any hit from Giratina-O, heal back the damage, and heavily threaten it with their Dark-type attacks. Jungle Healing Zarude can even use Giratina-O as a setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas heavily threatens Giratina-O with Moonblast. Defensive Xerneas can use Giratina-O to support its team with Aromatherapy, while the offensive variant can set up with Geomancy without caring about it much. However, being 2HKOed by status-boosted Hex means Xerneas can't be switched in blindly, especially if it is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Both Chansey and Blissey completely wall all variants of Giratina-O, barring its Hone Claws variant, with their immense bulk. Plus, they cripple Giratina-O with either Toxic or Thunder Wave and can absorb status with ease thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Ghost- and Dragon-types</strong>: While they can't switch into Giratina-O, the Ghost- and Dragon-types of the tier such as Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Zekrom, Eternatus, and Zygarde offensively check it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Both burn and poison heavily reduce Giratina-O's longevity and power, while paralysis means Calyrex-I and defensive Kyogre can take advantage of it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Giratina-O's great Special Attack and Griseous Orb to pressure common bulky threats such as Zygarde, Groudon, and Necrozma-DM. Shadow Sneak allows Giratina-O to safely revenge kill weakened, faster threats like Calyrex-S, Lunala, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. 28 Speed EVs allow Giratina-O to outpace Adamant Calyrex-I, while 12 Attack EVs ensure the OHKO on Calyrex-S with Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock. The remaining Defense investment helps Giratina-O handle foes like Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Zamazenta-C, and Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Pairing Giratina-O with another Ghost-type is valuable to exploit the tier's lack of switch-ins to Ghost-types. Calyrex-S and Marshadow greatly benefit from Giratina-O crippling Dark-types like Yveltal, Zarude, and Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp or weakening them with Draco Meteor, allowing both Ghost-types to overwhelm them. Calyrex-S can further cripple these Dark-types with Trick + a Choice item, while Marshadow can take advantage of them with Bulk Up; both Ghost-types also help Giratina-O by KOing Blissey. Due to Giratina-O lacking recovery, having defensive switch-ins is valuable for it; Necrozma-DM offers a Fairy-resistant partner and utility with Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave, while Yveltal resists Ghost and Dark while offering Defog and U-turn support. Clerics such as Calyrex-S, Blissey, and Xerneas help Giratina-O, with Blissey also offering Wish and an answer to special attackers like Xerneas, Kyogre, and Eternatus, and Xerneas providing a Dragon immunity.</p>"

However, it has difficulty beating physical walls like Zygarde, Bulk Up Groudon, Zarude, and Buzzwole due to its inability to boost its Attack. Special wallbreakers like Kyogre and Xerneas are good teammates for Giratina-O, with Xerneas also offering Aromatherapy to prevent status from severely hindering it. Kyogre especially appreciates Defog to keep Water Spout at maximum power.

  "Zamazenta": {
    "overview": "<p>When one first sees Zamazenta's well-rounded stats, it may look like an excellent Choice item user; however, Zamazenta is unfortunately hindered by a poor typing and an even worse movepool. Despite having several serviceable coverage moves, Zamazenta can't piece them together in any threatening combination. Therefore, it can't consistently break through defensive cores using common Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde-C. Zamazenta's STAB Close Combat also has low PP, which common physical walls such as Xerneas, Zygarde-C, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus easily exploit. Despite Dauntless Shield and high stats, Zamazenta is paradoxically fragile and struggles to find defensive utility. Lacking reliable recovery or other support options, it cannot take repeated hits from common physical attackers such as Zekrom, Groudon, and Marshadow. Other Choice item users such as Dracovish, Calyrex-I, and Urshifu-S should be considered long before Zamazenta.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zamazenta does not have any other viable options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Without proper coverage and prediction, Zamazenta fails to break through common walls like Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde-C. Note that these Pokemon can also cripple Zamazenta with a status move. Further, bulky setup sweepers such as Groudon and Buzzwole can use Zamazenta as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Pivots</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Ho-Oh can scout Zamazenta, as it fails to OHKO them. They can then heal off the damage they have taken with Regenerator or Recover and switch into another threat.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Zamazenta hates status. Burn from Toxapex's Scald or Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire negates all damage it may do, paralysis from Zygarde-C's Glare or Ho-Oh's Thunder Wave ruins its great Speed, and poison from Eternatus's Toxic or Toxic Spikes greatly reduces its switch-in opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: While it does not want to switch into a Psychic Fangs, Eternatus doesn't mind any of Zamazenta's other moves. Moreover, its Pressure quickly depletes Close Combat's PP. Dynamax Cannon, even from a defensive variant, can chunk Zamazenta. Eternatus can also poison Zamazenta with Toxic or Toxic Spikes, which puts it on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas's great bulk allows it to ignore any attacks coming from Zamazenta bar Iron Head. It can OHKO Zamazenta with its STAB Moonblast. Finally, Geomancy Xerneas can use Zamazenta as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Kyogre can threaten Zamazenta with their STAB moves.

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>The idea behind this set is pretty straightforward: do as much damage as possible each time Zamazenta can get in. Crunch beats Ghost-types, including Lunala and Calyrex-S, and Psychic Fangs offers a solid answer to Poison-types like Eternatus and Toxapex. The last moveslot depends on what the team needs: Wild Charge is used for Ho-Oh, Iron Head hits Xerneas hard, and Ice Fang pressures Zygarde-C. With great base 138 Speed, Zamazenta is only outsped by Jolly Marshadow, Calyrex-S, offensive Eternatus, and the rare Regieleki and Pheromosa. With a Jolly nature, Zamazenta outspeeds all variants of Marshadow and Eternatus, but an Adamant nature allows it to break through defensive Necrozma-DM more consistently, as well as always 2HKOing physically defensive Eternatus and Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage. While it does have Dauntless Shield, Zamazenta remains fragile, and it should be brought in with a slow pivot or on a non-damaging move. Also, despite it resisting Dark, you should be wary of switching Zamazenta in on Yveltal, since Knock Off cripples it.</p> <p>Because it struggles to break through physical walls, entry hazard support is invaluable for Zamazenta. Spikes is especially good, since premier physical walls such as Zygarde-C and Necrozma-DM resist Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus are all great hazard setters, being able to switch into threats that Zamazenta cannot handle like opposing Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM and Choice Scarf Kyogre. Strong special attackers such as Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus also help pressure Zygarde-C and Necrozma-DM. Eternatus, notably, can also spread poison to Zygarde-C. Finally, because it is very weak to status, clerics such as Blissey and Calyrex-S support Zamazenta well. The former is able to tank special hits that Zamazenta cannot handle, and the latter provides great specially offensive pressure.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although Zamazenta-C does not provide consistent offense due to its middling movepool and attacking stats, it has a unique niche in the tier: its Rusted Shield is the only viable item that can't be removed by Knock Off and Trick. Being resilient against these moves while absorbing status with Rest allows it to checks a decent array of Pokemon with its huge bulk. These include defensive Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM, all Yveltal variants, most Xerneas variants bar Geomancy, Ferrothorn, defensive Lunala, Zarude, defensive or non-Recover Eternatus variants, and most Ice-types. However, with its aforementioned limited movepool, notably lacking a reliable recovery option, Necrozma-DM comes close to outclassing it both offensively and defensively. Necrozma-DM has a superior typing, better movepool, and access to reliable recovery. Nevertheless, Zamazenta-C's distinct niche provides a solid backbone to certain balance and bulky offense structures.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zamazenta-C could theoretically opt for an offensive Howl set with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe, an Adamant or Jolly nature, and the moveset Howl / Close Combat / Behemoth Bash / Wild Charge or Ice Fang; then again, any other offensive threat is far superior to what Zamazenta-C could offensively provide. Wild Charge could be used on the standard set's first or second moveslot to prevent Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Kyogre from switching in freely, although this would mean giving up coverage to chip either Eternatus or other Steel-types beyond Skarmory and Corviknight. Similarly, Ice Fang enables Zamazenta-C to dish out reliable damage against Zygarde, Landorus-T, and Landorus while not having to rely on Behemoth Bash to dent bulkier foes such as Giratina-O and Eternatus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Despite its high Defense coupled with Dauntless Shield's boost, Zamazenta-C is unable to handle physical threats, especially if they've set up, such as Groudon, Zekrom, Landorus-T, Dracovish, and Marshadow.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde</strong>: Any Zygarde set happily comes in on Zamazenta-C to freely set up Substitute + Dragon Dance or Coil, especially the trapper set.</p> <p><strong>Specific Special Attackers</strong>: Although Zamazenta-C is tasked with checking various special threats, the likes of Geomancy Xerneas, Kyogre, and Landorus easily overwhelm it with their tremendous power or super effective hits.</p> <p><strong>Calyrex-S</strong>: Zamazenta-C can barely handle Choice Specs and SubSeed Calyrex-S in the short term, which can either deal heavy damage or wear it down quickly respectively, let alone the long term. However, if Choice Specs Calyrex-S uses Trick, Zamazenta-C gets a free opportunity to switch out or set up with Howl.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh is soft checked by Zamazenta-C but fears little in return, taking even a Metal Burst or Wild Charge before healing with Regenerator, and it can use Defog before switching or chip Zamazenta-C with Sacred Fire. Rare offensive variants of Ho-Oh threaten Zamazenta-C immediately.</p>",

Rest is mandatory to provide longevity and capitalize on its good bulk. The final moveslot could either go to Howl, letting Zamazenta-C set up against bulky threats, Sleep Talk, preventing it from being completely passive while asleep, or Metal Burst, letting it surprise KO opposing Pokemon if it's in pristine condition. However, Metal Burst's heavily prediction-reliant nature could give setup sweepers a free turn. A specially defensive EV spread lets Zamazenta-C soft check certain special attackers, such as unboosted Xerneas's Moonblast and unboosted Eternatus's Flamethrower can't 2HKO. 64 Defense EVs alongside Dauntless Shield avoid the 3HKO from non-Life Orb Zekrom's Bolt Strike. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 132 SpD / 60 Spe with a Careful nature provides similar bulk while outspeeding base 90 Speed threats such as non-Choice Scarf Kyogre and Zekrom.</p> <p>By no means is Zamazenta-C an impenetrable wall; its main role is to absorb Knock Off, Trick, and status attempts while checking specific threats like defensive Necrozma-DM and Yveltal.

Zamazenta-C can relieve Necrozma-DM from needing to run defensive sets, enabling more offensive options like Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, and Trick Room Sweeper. If Necrozma-DM still goes defensive, its Thunder Wave would still benefit Zamazenta-C's Choice item teammates in wallbreaking. Ferrothorn can provide Spikes and paralysis support while blanket checking Pokemon like Kyogre and Zekrom, whereas physically defensive Zarude mitigates Zamazenta-C's issues against physical threats such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde while additionally checking Calyrex-S due to its Dark typing. Zamazenta-C, in turn, helps deal with Zarude's weaknesses against common threats such as offensive Yveltal variants, Xerneas, Eternatus, Weavile, and Choice-locked Kyogre using Ice Beam.

However, its subpar base stats leave it in Xerneas's dust as a defensive Fairy-type, as it fails to check prominent physical attackers such as Groudon, Choice Band Marshadow, and offensive Zygarde.

  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio's sole purpose in Ubers is trapping Eternatus. With Special Defense investment, Dugtrio is able to take a Dynamax Cannon even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can easily dispatch Eternatus after coming in with a smart double switch, on a teammate's U-turn, or when Eternatus is forced to recover. Reliably removing Eternatus lets strong sweepers and wallbreakers such as Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow wreak havoc. Additionally, your own Eternatus can increase the pressure of Toxic Spikes without opposing Eternatus to absorb it. Dugtrio's trapping ability also makes it generally useful for picking off weakened Pokemon, and it has some nifty utility options, such as Memento to give a party member a free turn to set up. However, Dugtrio is very weak and therefore struggles against more offensive builds, and it is generally outclassed by more powerful Choice Scarf users such as Calyrex-S and Galarian Darmanitan. It is extremely frail and relies on teammate support, double switches, and revenge killing to come on to the battlefield. As such, Dugtrio is an extremely niche pick that functions best on teams that are dedicated to sweeping once Eternatus is removed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band can be used for greater power, and it makes targets such as Blissey and Cosmic Power Eternatus much easier to trap. However, the lessened Speed makes Dugtrio lose a lot of utility against offensive Pokemon, and it risks being outsped by its main target, Eternatus. Sucker Punch can be used for its priority, although it is generally not as useful as the moves listed above. The main target would be Choice Scarf Calyrex-S; however, as a Ghost-type, it cannot be trapped. Rock Slide can flinch and is more accurate than Stone Edge; however, Dugtrio generally needs all the power it can get.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Teams Without Eternatus</strong>: Dugtrio doesn't have a check in the traditional sense thanks to Arena Trap trapping foes. However, it is almost useless if there's no Eternatus for it to trap. Offensive teams in particular enjoy the opposing revenge killer being unable to significantly damage most of their sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Draco Meteor Eternatus</strong>: While rare, Eternatus that has Draco Meteor can OHKO Dugtrio. Dugtrio could still KO a weakened Eternatus or come in on one that has already used Draco Meteor, but Draco Meteor does severely limit its ability to trap Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Cosmic Power Eternatus</strong>: If Eternatus has set up Cosmic Power, it will usually have the bulk to tank repeated Earthquakes from Dugtrio. However, Eternatus needs to make sure it has enough HP to do this. Also, if Eternatus is forced to use Recover by one of Dugtrio's teammates, it puts itself at risk of being trapped without being able to set up a Cosmic Power on the switch.</p>",

Stone Edge hits Flying-type Pokemon like Yveltal and Ho-Oh for good damage and has good offensive synergy with Earthquake. Memento is a great move to allow a free turn of setup for one of Dugtrio's teammates. It can also be used in an emergency to stop a setup sweeper in its tracks. For the last moveslot, Toxic can be used to cripple a threat that Dugtrio can't do much damage to, such as Groudon or Zygarde. Beat Up is an interesting option to easily dispatch SubSeed Calyrex-S, which, while rare, can wreak havoc on an unprepared team. Stealth Rock can fit an entry hazard on teams that have a hard time fitting one. Locking into Stealth Rock is not a big concern thanks to Arena Trap preventing a setup sweeper from coming in. The given EVs allow Dugtrio to outspeed +1 positive nature base 90s, such as Zekrom, and always survive a Dynamax Cannon from an uninvested Eternatus after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Dugtrio needs teammates that thrive when Eternatus is gone. Kyogre is the most notable example, as Eternatus is the main answer to its powerful Water Spouts in the tier. Kyogre can significantly damage Eternatus on the switch, forcing it to either use Recover or attack; in either instance, Dugtrio can come in and KO Eternatus. A similar concept can be done with Pokemon such as Dracovish, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow. In general, hitting Eternatus with a strong attack to force it to use Recover is the best way to get Dugtrio on the field, as this prevents Cosmic Power sets setting up on Dugtrio switching in. Bulky teammates such as Buzzwole and Zarude provide nice defensive utility for your team, and both have the potential to sweep with Bulk Up once Eternatus has been eliminated. Toxic Spikes Eternatus makes for a fantastic partner, as the opposing team will have no way to absorb Toxic Spikes with their own Eternatus down. Additionally, Toxic Spikes can somewhat help with Dugtrio's weaknesses against offensive teams. Eternatus can also switch into Kyogre, which Dugtrio can attract. Dugtrio appreciates pivots to let it come into battle safely. U-turn users such as Yveltal and Corviknight and Teleport users such as Blissey can do this.</p>"

Its access to Rapid Spin is also valuable, compacting the role of entry hazard remover. Knock Off users such as Yveltal especially like Spikes because they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which helps them sweep later on. However, Cloyster is held back by its low Speed, making it susceptible to Taunt; also, its poor typing and defensive stats mean that it will be on the field only once most of the time. Finally, it faces severe competition with other leads, with Froslass and Aerodactyl having great Speed and Taunt for more consistent hazard setting, Shuckle having Sturdy + Mental Herb, and Galvantula and Ribombee having great Speed alongside paralysis.</p>",

Toxic Spikes can be chosen as a better option against offensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: With Necrozma-DM's astonishing bulk and Steel typing, Cloyster will do little to no damage to it, even when boosted. Moreover, it can set Stealth Rock easily, and its use of Rocky Helmet can spinblock Cloyster effectively.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Leads like Grimmsnarl and Froslass can use Taunt before Cloyster can do anything, preventing it from setting up Spikes. Froslass is also immune to Rapid Spin and can set several layers of Spikes for its team before being taken down by Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pivots</strong>: Pivots like Regieleki and Pheromosa can break Cloyster's Focus Sash with Volt Switch or U-turn and come back later in the game to use Rapid Spin. Their common use of Heavy-Duty Boots also means that they won't be damaged by Cloyster's Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Kyogre and Calyrex-S can limit Cloyster to a single layer of Spikes before KOing it or forcing it to switch. Calyrex-S also spinblocks Cloyster, and Choice Scarf sets can cripple it with Trick and outspeed it even after Shell Smash.

Fast Taunt users like Yveltal are also great, as they can prevent Spikes from being removed by slow Defoggers; plus, being able to spam Knock Off and thus remove Heavy-Duty Boots is great synergy with Spikes. Finally, Eternatus, especially its offensive set, appreciate Cloyster luring in Yveltal and Ho-Oh, as it severely punishes them with Meteor Beam.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey is a nonconventional pick mostly seen on hyper offense and stall teams. Its immunity to Ghost, combined with its increased physical bulk compared to Blissey, makes Chansey a great switch-in to both of Calyrex-S's STAB moves, which is especially useful for hyper offense teams. Chansey's gargantuan special bulk allows it to switch in on many threats for offensive teams such as Kyogre, Xerneas, and Lunala. Its great utility movepool, including Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, and Healing Wish, also offers a plethora of options to support both offensive and defensive teams alike. Teleport, in particular, grants momentum via a slow pivot, which is extremely beneficial for hyper offense teams. On stall teams, Chansey has higher physical bulk than Blissey and can support its team with Toxic, Aromatherapy, and Stealth Rock. However, that's pretty much all the good with Chansey, as it is inferior to Blissey in almost every other way; having to hold Eviolite means Chansey is easily crippled by entry hazards, which Heavy-Duty Boots Blissey has a better time against, and it can easily fall to Kyogre, whereas Utility Umbrella Blissey does not. Also, even though it has great bulk, it will still fall quickly on hyper offense teams, as the team's fast-paced nature does not give it opportunities to heal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Confide can be used in order to check setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Kyogre, but Blissey is generally a better option for this specific use. Moreover, Confide is incompatible with Natural Cure and Teleport on the same moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt shuts down all of Chansey's support and recovery options, leaving it only able to use Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Chansey's immense bulk is severely lessened if it loses its Eviolite, and it is then unable to check most threats like offensive Calm Mind Kyogre and Meteor Beam Eternatus without it. Knock Off users such as Toxapex and Clefable can lure Chansey in and remove its Eviolite. Additionally, Calyrex-S and Yveltal can cripple Chansey by removing its Eviolite using Trick and Knock Off, respectively, leaving Chansey unable to check them.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers, such as Groudon, Marshadow, and Dragon Dance or Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, can still break through Chansey easily.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom fears nothing from Chansey: it is immune to Thunder Wave and can use Substitute to prevent Chansey from generating momentum. It can also severely damage Chansey with Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Foes with Substitute can use Chansey as setup fodder; examples of Substitute users are Geomancy Xerneas, Calm Mind Kyogre, Bulk Up Groudon, Zygarde, and the uncommon Curse Ho-Oh.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Chansey relies on its bulk to switch in to many special threats such as Kyogre, Eternatus, and Calyrex-S. Teleport lets Chansey generate momentum and allows frail-but-strong teammates such as Marshadow, Rayquaza, and Mewtwo to be brought in safely. Instead of Teleport, Chansey can use Stealth Rock, putting pressure on defensive threats like Kyogre, Eternatus, and Xerneas, which facilitates wallbreaking later in the game. Healing Wish fully heals a partner who lacks recovery or has been crippled by status, including Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Zekrom. Toxic should only be used on stall teams, as it gives up momentum but cripples common switch-ins such as Marshadow, Groudon, Zekrom, and Yveltal by putting them on a timer. Seismic Toss's fixed damage is useful to soften switch-ins, and it helps Chansey not be completely useless against Taunt users. Eviolite is a mandatory item on Chansey, boosting its already high special bulk and granting it decent physical bulk.</p> <p>Chansey pairs well with suicide leads like Froslass, Aerodactyl, and Cloyster on hyper offense teams, as they can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes while keeping momentum. It also appreciates strong attackers like Calyrex-S, Rayquaza, and Zekrom which can use the momentum Chansey provides to immensely pressure the opposing team. Strong Dark-type attackers like specially offensive Yveltal and Swords Dance Weavile appreciate Chansey's ability to switch in on Eternatus and, in return, provide secondary Calyrex-S checks, which is highly appreciated on hyper offense teams. Also, Chansey remains relatively fragile on the physical side, so attackers that are decently physically bulky such as Groudon and Zygarde are greatly appreciated teammates. On stall teams, Chansey is greatly appreciated for its ability to freely switch into Ghost-type attacks from Calyrex-S, as well as taking special attacks from foes such as specially defensive Eternatus, defensive Xerneas, and Lunala. Since Chansey is easily worn down by entry hazards, reliable Defoggers such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina are welcomed to support it. The latter two are especially appreciated, as they keep Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn in check, which are the most common Stealth Rock and Spikes setters, respectively. Despite its high special bulk, Chansey cannot check Choice Specs Kyogre, as it is 2HKOed by Water Spout and can easily lose to Substitute + Calm Mind variants. It should be paired with checks to Kyogre such as Eternatus, which can also act as a Knock Off absorber.</p>"

Additionally, Ditto is not affected by the Speed drop that Sticky Web causes after transforming. Despite this, Ditto cannot reliably defeat bulky setup sweepers thanks to its abysmal HP stat and is also countered by Substitute. It also struggles against non-hyper offense teams and as such can only perform well situationally.</p>",

Because of this, Ditto should be paired with backup checks to them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Threats</strong>: Although Ditto can copy the stat boosts of opposing Pokemon, it cannot successfully defeat bulkier threats like Dragon Dance Zygarde and Calm Mind Kyogre in a one-on-one scenario. Additionally, even though Ditto has the ability to copy virtually any offensive threat in the tier, many teams carry multiple checks to the wallbreakers and sweepers they run. For example, if Ditto copies Calyrex-S, many teams will have checks like Yveltal and Ho-Oh to prevent Ditto from successfully countersweeping. Furthermore, although rare, sweepers running Imprison can prevent Ditto from revenge killing them.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Ditto</strong>: An incoming Ditto cannot transform into an already transformed Ditto via Imposter.

Choice Scarf ensures that Ditto will always either outspeed or Speed tie with the opposing Pokemon. 248 HP EVs minimize damage taken from entry hazards before transforming and guarantees that Ditto will be able to use Struggle up to four times prior to fainting. 252 Defense EVs minimize Struggle damage, which can be especially useful in the rare Ditto mirror match. The last 8 EVs are allocated to Attack to maximize the damage output of Struggle. Finally, a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Imposter will never activate first, thereby guaranteeing Ditto to have more Transform PP in the event of a mirror match.</p> <p>As this set performs best as a revenge killer, Ditto can be utilized in a variety of offense teams. Many teams are often susceptible to a combination of faster threats like Calyrex-S, Marshadow, and Xerneas; Ditto can copy their boosts and outspeed them with Choice Scarf, thereby allowing Ditto to potentially countersweep the opposing team. This is the main reason why Ditto performs best on hyper offense teams. Ditto also has a minor niche of being able to PP stall some bulkier defensive threats like Blissey by repeatedly switching in, using a recovery move, and switching out. It should be noted though that due to the prevalence of entry hazards, unnecessary chip damage may hinder Ditto's ability to sweep. Some useful partners for Ditto are defensive staples like Necrozma-DM and Yveltal, which appreciate Ditto’s ability to prevent wallbreakers and sweepers from overwhelming them. Additionally, as some sweepers opt to utilize Substitute to bypass Imposter, backup checks to the offensive threats mentioned above are beneficial to any type of team Ditto is featured on.</p>"

Spikes is a far superior choice due to bulky threats such as Groudon, Eternatus, and Zygarde taking minimal damage from Stealth Rock. Regardless, Aerodactyl stands out from other hazard setters due to its high Speed stat and decent Attack, threatening other leads such as Galvantula, Froslass, and the aforementioned Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Aerodactyl also outspeeds most multi-hit move users, bar Triple Axel Pheromosa, that would otherwise break its Focus Sash before it has the chance to even set up Stealth Rock. With these decent traits, Aerodactyl manages to carve a solid niche as the fastest Stealth Rock Lead in Ubers.</p>",

However, this means Aerodactyl gives up its far superior options of Rock Tomb and Tailwind in its third slot, as Taunt and Stealth Rock are mandatory.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: If Aerodactyl does not run Rock Tomb, it has to be wary of when using Taunt and Stealth Rock against calculated Magic Bounce switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Slurpuff</strong>: Aerodactyl has to win a coinflip between Slurpuff's Magic Coat that blocks Taunt and Yawn, otherwise Aerodactyl is forced to switch out, allowing Slurpuff to freely set up its Sticky Web.

Rock Tomb provides Aerodactyl some form of speed control and simultaneously breaks other leads' Focus Sashes, particularly Excadrill and Froslass, which lose the ability to retaliate with Rock Tomb and Icy Wind, respectively. Alternatively, Tailwind provides a huge Speed boost before Aerodactyl goes down, allowing heavy hitters with average Speed stats to pose an immediate threat. Defog removes any entry hazards for teams that lack any other form of hazard control, especially against Mental Herb Shuckle after it ignores one Taunt and sets up Sticky Web. It should be noted that Defog makes Aerodactyl very passive in the face of Magic Bounce and Magic Coat users. Ditto switches in freely, removes Stealth Rock, and lays its own Stealth Rock if Tailwind was not set up beforehand. Unnerve stifles any leads that utilize a Berry to function such as Custap Berry Shuckle. Pressure works best against low-PP foes. For example, Sunsteel Strike + Earthquake Necrozma-DM has to burn half its Sunsteel Strike PP to KO Focus Sash Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Aerodactyl should be solely used on hyper offense teams that wish to have a quick and easy form of entry hazard set up against problematic leads. Teams that have a hard time dealing with Spike stacking appreciate Aerodactyl's ability to threaten and outspeed setters such as Froslass even after an Icy Wind, if Aerodactyl previously used Rock Tomb against it. Excadrill gives it some competition in this niche, but fears Calyrex-S predicting and spinblocking it, while Aerodactyl can use Defog freely before easily setting Stealth Rock again. If Aerodactyl does not run Defog, it can be paired with Regieleki or Grimmsnarl to provide dual screens support and pressure opposing Defoggers, such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh, by blocking their Defog with Taunt to keep Stealth Rock up. Regieleki, Zekrom, and Bulk Up / Rock Tomb Marshadow also threaten these common Defoggers and help keep Stealth Rock up. The latter two have the added benefit of hitting the rare Giratina and Giratina-O. Aerodactyl also pairs well with Sticky Web leads that require some counterplay against other Sticky Web leads.

Despite facing competition as a fast special attacker from Calyrex-S, Mewtwo has a far better movepool, isn't reliably checked by the most common answer to Calyrex-S in Yveltal, and can actually synergize well with Calyrex-S because both break down their shared checks, such as Zarude, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal itself. However, Mewtwo is always forced out by Calyrex-S and offers very little defensively, which makes it hard to fit onto teams and bring in repeatedly throughout a game. Mewtwo can also be difficult to make the most of because it can be quite reliant on prediction, and getting a turn wrong can result in Mewtwo being crippled.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stallbreaker Mewtwo with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and Psystrike or Ice Beam can be used, but it is difficult to justify a teamslot on when this set doesn't reliably answer any of the biggest threats in the metagame and freely lets in Calyrex-S. Taunt can be used on certain hyper offense teams that want to avoid letting Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal use Defog, but these structures tend to have a notable weakness to Calyrex-S already, and Mewtwo makes this weakness significantly worse. Thunder provides fantastic damage on Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and physically defensive Kyogre, but the inconsistency is frustrating, so it should only be used with Kyogre as a teammate. Focus Blast is an option that can hit Tyranitar and Heatran, which easily deal with Mewtwo otherwise, but doesn't hit anything else in the tier for meaningful damage that Fire Blast doesn't cover already. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for PP and accuracy reasons, but the difference in power is fairly noticeable, and Nasty Plot sets require Fire Blast for the roll to OHKO Necrozma-DM at +2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Calyrex-S</strong>: Calyrex-S will always force out Mewtwo, and it is not something that any team appreciates giving free turns to.</p> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: Lunala walls any Mewtwo lacking Shadow Ball and can recover easily while wearing it down through Life Orb recoil and potential Ghost-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Heatran and Tyranitar</strong>: Heatran and Tyranitar wall every move on the most common Mewtwo sets and only get beaten by the somewhat niche Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh can pivot into Mewtwo to rack up Life Orb recoil and threaten it with Thunder Wave, and it can easily deal with Expert Belt Mewtwo. However, Life Orb Psystrike may 2HKO it and +2 Life Orb Psystrike may OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM can take any one hit from an unboosted Mewtwo and cripple it with either Thunder Wave or Knock Off or 2HKO it with Sunsteel Strike. However, +2 Life Orb Fire Blast can OHKO Necrozma-DM and unboosted Fire Blast can 2HKO it, so it is risky to bring it in on an unrevealed Mewtwo. Furthermore, Speed-invested Necrozma-DM will never survive +2 Life Orb Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mewtwo is prone to being worn down through entry hazards, status, and particularly Life Orb recoil.

These three moves should be used on every offensive Mewtwo, but the fourth move is more customizable depending on what the rest of the team prefers. Nasty Plot turns Mewtwo into a terrifying sweeper that can OHKO most of the metagame with just the three coverage moves above, but it will still be forced out by common Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Marshadow. Shadow Ball lets Mewtwo dent Lunala for teammates like Groudon and Zekrom and prevents Calyrex-S from switching in on Mewtwo to force it out. Life Orb gives a much-needed power boost, allowing Mewtwo to run Timid to outspeed almost the entire metagame and at worst Speed tie with Eternatus. The recoil eats into Mewtwo's already mediocre bulk, which limits its effectiveness in longer games, but Recover helps offset that if run. Expert Belt can be run over Life Orb, but the decrease in damage output means that Modest is the nature of choice to give favorable rolls against Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Yveltal. The 4 EVs in Defense as opposed to HP allow Mewtwo to always survive Life Orb Adamant Marshadow's Shadow Sneak from full HP.</p> <p>Calyrex-S appreciates Mewtwo's ability to potentially break past a desperate Yveltal and can clean through weakened teams better than anything else in the tier. Calyrex-S also potentially provides cleric support for if Mewtwo gets paralyzed, which will happen most often when Recover Mewtwo is used to check defensive Zygarde. Other sweepers like Zekrom and offensive Groudon likewise appreciate Mewtwo potentially breaking through their checks like Lunala and Zarude. Because of Mewtwo's weakness to opposing Calyrex-S, teammates that can check it like Yveltal, Zarude, and Ho-Oh are required, and having more than one Calyrex-S check is a good idea given how weak Mewtwo is to it. Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory are helpful, as Mewtwo can easily force switches to rack up residual damage, and both of them can come in and set Spikes easily on Necrozma-DM, which Mewtwo doesn't appreciate facing without being boosted already. Groudon both can set Stealth Rock and power up Mewtwo's Fire Blast via Drought, which really helps it threaten Necrozma-DM. Groudon can also help weaken Pokemon like Yveltal, as Yveltal is a fairly common form of counterplay to Groudon. Pokemon with pivoting moves that can bring Mewtwo in freely like U-turn Yveltal and Galarian Darmanitan are appreciated as partners, as Mewtwo struggles to come in by itself frequently.

Teleport also allows Xatu to safely pivot its hard-hitting teammates in, such as Choice Band Ho-Oh. However, for the Ubers metagame, Xatu's bulk is paper thin, and weaknesses to common offensive types such as Ice, Ghost, Dark, and Electric exacerbate this. It has next to zero defensive utility outside of preventing entry hazards from Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, which means that Xatu is hard to fit on teams.

This risks chip damage from Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs, which Xatu often can't afford to take due to its paltry bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Xatu's immense passivity means that setup sweepers that can avoid its status move can easily use Xatu as setup fodder. Substitute setup sweepers such as Xerneas and Zekrom, Lum Berry users such as Groudon, and sweepers that are immune to Xatu's chosen status, such as Groudon and Zekrom if running Thunder Wave or Meteor Beam Eternatus if running Toxic, are all able to easily exploit Xatu's presence on the field.</p> <p><strong>Less Common Stealth Rock Setters</strong>: Some not as common, but still viable, Stealth Rock setters, such as Groudon, Landorus-T, and Landorus-I, can threaten Xatu with huge damage and prevent it from consistently stopping Stealth Rock.

Toxic can also be used to cripple more passive defensive Pokemon, such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Groudon. Teleport allows Xatu to safely pivot out to its teammates. Finally, Night Shade is Xatu's most reliable attacking option, considering its incredibly mediocre offensive stats by Ubers standards. Xatu requires full investment in defense to safely tank hits from the main Stealth Rock setter, Necrozma-DM, and recover with Roost in order to PP stall its Sunsteel Strike. Rocky Helmet chips it for trying to break through Xatu with Sunsteel Strike. Leftovers is also an option to more easily take hits from Necrozma-DM; however, Rocky Helmet is generally preferred to lessen Xatu's passivity.</p> <p>Xatu fits on teams that hate Stealth Rock and its most common setter: defensive Necrozma-DM. Xatu's utter lack of defensive utility beyond Magic Bounce makes using Choice Band Ho-Oh nearly mandatory for it to be worthwhile. Otherwise, it's better to use multiple entry hazard removers to patch up any Stealth Rock weakness. Ho-Oh also appreciates Xatu paralyzing defensive Pokemon such as Eternatus and getting it in safely with Teleport. In return, Ho-Oh's wallbreaking ability makes up for Xatu's passivity, and Ho-Oh spreading burns helps with Xatu's bulk. Because Xatu is unable to stop Stealth Rock from all entry hazard setters, an entry hazard remover such as Defog Yveltal is greatly appreciated. Specially defensive Yveltal also makes for an especially excellent defensive partner, as Xatu is absolutely terrified of Calyrex-S. Xatu also invites opposing Yveltal in, so it appreciates having a Pokemon to absorb Yveltal's Knock Off. Eternatus does a good job in this regard, additionally absorbing Toxic Spikes and acting as a solid Kyogre check.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shuckle is known for being the only Sticky Web setter that's able to run a held item that's not Focus Sash thanks to Sturdy. Additionally, it doubles as a Stealth Rock setter and has good moves conducive to suicide leading such as Encore and Final Gambit. Shuckle also has fairly good bulk, thereby usually requiring an actual offensive Pokemon to have any chance at 2HKOing it. Its niche in providing Sticky Web support turns already threatening offensive Pokemon into nigh-unstoppable behemoths, but unfortunately Shuckle is otherwise disposable and unlikely to play any further role. Because of this, Shuckle requires offense teams to structure themselves using five Pokemon and restricts building, since a spinner and spinblocker are highly desirable. Sticky Web is also a fairly matchup-dependent playstyle that relies upon the opposing team not having enough tools to stop or dispose of the hazard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Custap Berry effectively gives Shuckle an extra move the turn after Sturdy is activated but is typically less consistent than the items previously discussed. Rocky Helmet punishes Rapid Spin and physical attackers and allows Shuckle to function as a slightly more useful death fodder, but it otherwise makes setting and keeping its entry hazards up more difficult. Toxic can surprise and punish bulky attackers and certain defensive Pokemon that may try to use Defog. Infestation traps foes and pairs well with Encore, locking setup sweepers or recovery move users to provide a free turn for a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Magic Bounce deflects entry hazards, and Shuckle has no tools to overcome this matchup.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Although Shuckle has some tools to challenge Defoggers and spinners, they nevertheless eliminate Shuckle's hazards or remain a threat to its hazards throughout a game. Defoggers include Yveltal, Xerneas, Giratina, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Skarmory, and Corviknight, and spinners include Excadrill, Regieleki, Pheromosa, and Cloyster. Teams with two Defoggers can even switch between them to stall out Shuckle's Encore PP.</p> <p><strong>Secondary Move Effects</strong>: There are a few secondary move effects that, while RNG dependent, are capable of preventing Shuckle from setting hazards before being KOed. For example, Yveltal's Dark Pulse and Necrozma-DM's Iron Head can induce flinching.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM and Kyogre</strong>: These are the two most common Pokemon with the power and type advantage to bring Shuckle down to 1 HP in a single turn, thereby preventing it from getting off more than a single move.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Sticky Web</strong>: Pokemon such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza, as well as Ditto and any Pokemon holding Heavy-Duty Boots, are immune to the Speed drop from Sticky Web, increasing their chance to remove Sticky Web or merely threaten Sticky Web teams.</p>",

      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<p>Shuckle's set and spread are designed to optimize chances at setting and keeping Sticky Web and, if possible, Stealth Rock as well. 120 Special Defense EVs allow Shuckle to always avoid the 2HKO from Xerneas's Moonblast, with the remaining EVs put into physical bulk to help defend against the tier's common offensive threats. Mental Herb lets Shuckle ignore the first use of Taunt, allowing it to still get at least one type of hazard up. Alternatively, Red Card forces out an attacker with a good matchup against Shuckle to one that might have a weaker one, which can also help against setup sweepers and spinners. Encore lets Shuckle lock its foe into a singular predictable pattern, which is essential for being able to set hazards and keep them up. Final Gambit ensures Shuckle is allowed to faint and keep momentum into an offensive threat once its purpose of setting hazards is complete.</p> <p>The purpose of Shuckle is to provide Sticky Web support for powerful offensive threats that are exceptionally difficult to check when given a speed advantage; some of the best Pokemon to utilize this support are Calyrex-S, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Zekrom. Due to the nature of maintaining Sticky Web and combating opposing hazards, it is highly desirable to have a spinner such as Regieleki, Excadrill, or Pheromosa for anti-hazard support and a spinblocker such as Calyrex-S or Lunala. Offense teams need to role compress very well to accommodate Shuckle's nigh-irrelevant defensive utility, so Pokemon such as Eternatus and Necrozma-DM are important.</p>"

Skarmory has the movepool to support its team with entry hazards in Spikes, phazing in Whirlwind, and passive damage in Toxic. Sturdy allows it to get a desperation move if the situation calls for it. However, its subpar HP and Special Defense mean it crumbles to practically any special attack. Skarmory also struggles to fit all of its good utility moves and thus is often extremely passive, relying on Rocky Helmet and Body Press to deal any damage. Skarmory's Flying typing is a double-edged sword, making it neutral to Fighting and immune to Ground but a target for Electric coverage such as Zekrom's Bolt Strike and Xerneas's Thunder. It also faces stiff competition from other defensive Steel-types. Necrozma-DM checks Xerneas much better, Ferrothorn is a less passive Spikes setter and answers Kyogre, and Corviknight can be used as a Defogger.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If need be, Skarmory can run Stealth Rock. However, seeing how common other Stealth Rock setters are in the metagame and how difficult it is for Skarmory to find space, it's usually omitted. Defog seems good initially, but Skarmory then competes with Corviknight, which can also Pressure stall the opposition's Stealth Rock PP to come out on top long-term. Moreover, Defog clashes with Spikes. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to hit for significantly more damage with Body Press and counter physical setup sweepers such as Groudon and Necrozma-DM. However, Skarmory's meager base 70 Speed and difficulty finding a move to drop means it's situational at best. Taunt and Toxic can be used in tandem to maximize Skarmory's utility, but running only status moves on a Pokemon this slow means Taunt forces Struggle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Almost any special attacker can overwhelm Skarmory, so threats such as Xerneas, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre can threaten it out with just their presence. None of them enjoy Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom's Teravolt allows it to bypass Skarmory's Sturdy and OHKO with Life Orb Bolt Strike, but it doesn't enjoy the residual damage it takes from Toxic or entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Raquaza can use Fire-type moves to OHKO Skarmory, with the former two carrying a status move to pressure Skarmory's teammates and the latter having a myriad of attacks to break through cores.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus isn't bothered by any of Skarmory's options and can comfortably fire off its strong special attacks to 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Skarmory's reliance on status moves makes it a perfect Taunt target for the likes of Yveltal and Mewtwo. They risk taking Toxic on the switch, though.</p>",

Whirlwind phazes physical setup sweepers, even if they're behind a Substitute. Swords Dance users such as Groudon and Necrozma-DM are prime targets for Whirlwind. Combined with Spikes, it can rack up damage on grounded foes lacking Heavy-Duty Boots. Toxic lets Skarmory punish entry hazard removers such as Yveltal. It also damages common offensive switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and Kyogre. Body Press uses Skarmory's enormous Defense stat, nailing the likes of Yveltal after it uses Roost and Ferrothorn for significant damage.

Rocky Helmet provides some much appreciated damage to most physical attackers and helps with Skarmory's passivity.</p> <p>Skarmory struggles with special attackers like Kyogre and Calyrex-S, so teammates such as Eternatus and Blissey are very appreciated. Stealth Rock setters form an entry hazard setting core with Skarmory. Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock and switch into Ho-Oh and Calyrex-S. Tangrowth and Groudon also pair up nicely, being able to take on some of the physical attackers that Skarmory cannot handle, namely Zygarde and Zekrom. Knock Off users such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing Skarmory's Spikes to put in more work. Despite being a Steel-type, Skarmory can lose to Geomancy Xerneas. Bulky Ho-Oh and other Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn can effectively deal with Xerneas. Xerneas itself can either run a Geomancy set to beat Zygarde and Zekrom and benefit from Spikes or a defensive set with Aromatherapy in case Skarmory gets statused.</p>"

Unfortunately, Trick Room is an inherently unreliable playstyle, and by extension Porygon2's niche is extremely limited. Porygon2 is also extremely susceptible to Knock Off, Trick, and Taunt and as such is often forced out by the ever-prevalent Yveltal.</p>",

Blissey has a huge amount of utility options, including Aromatherapy, Thunder Wave, Stealth Rock, Wish, and Teleport, which are hard to find elsewhere, very valuable, and let it role compress. It makes a great check to offensive Eternatus, Geomancy Xerneas, and Calyrex-S locked into Astral Barrage. Although Blissey is passive, its role compression can allow partners like Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-S to run more offensive sets that cover some of its flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be run instead of Thunder Wave to damage Thunder Wave-immune switch-ins such as Groudon and Zekrom. However, this prevents Blissey from crippling Necrozma-DM and Eternatus, two of the most common Pokemon in the tier. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage, but it makes Blissey redundant when paired with specially defensive Eternatus. Healing Wish is an option to bring back a sweeper from the brink of being KOed, but Chansey does this better. Counter is a unique and potentially strong option that can OHKO Pokemon such as Yveltal. However, this move is inconsistent and is useless if the opponent finds out that you have it. Shadow Ball can be used instead of Seismic Toss as an option to hit Calyrex-S, but generally Seismic Toss is preferred due to Shadow Ball doing little damage to everything else. If Blissey is running Aromatherapy and also wants to be able to damage Calyrex-S, Serene Grace + Ice Beam is a possibility. This combination packs a 20% freeze chance, which can be very annoying for the opponent to deal with, and it also heavily discourages switch-ins such as Zygarde, letting Blissey check it in a pinch. However, this combination is not consistent. Confide can be run with Teleport on the same set, but do note that Blissey has to run Healer as its ability for this combination to be legal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Blissey is forced out by the myriad of strong physical attackers in Ubers as well as Psyshock and Psystrike users as Calyrex-S, Xerneas, and Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Blissey is almost completely shut down by Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Since Blissey will often replace Eternatus on many builds, Toxic Spikes can become a huge threat due to a lack of a Poison-type to absorb them. This can be somewhat managed by having enough Defoggers or Heavy-Duty Boot users, but it is still difficult to manage.

On the other hand, Teleport can be used to pivot in strong but frail wallbreakers such as Marshadow, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and Galarian Darmanitan. It is necessary to pair Teleport Blissey with teammates such as Zekrom and Ferrothorn that can deal with Calm Mind Kyogre. Aromatherapy removes status from the whole team, something that few Pokemon in the tier currently possess. Thunder Wave cripples strong offensive threats on the switch. Stealth Rock provides nice team support, and it pairs particularly well with Thunder Wave, as Blissey can status Yveltal that tries to Defog against it. Blissey can even afford to take Knock Off from Yveltal in exchange for paralysis, unless Kyogre is still present. Wish provides passive healing to teammates, and it is especially notable for teammates that lack reliable recovery such as Groudon and Landorus-T. However, Wish and Confide are incompatible with Teleport. Seismic Toss is Blissey's best attacking option. Utility Umbrella with a Calm nature and maximum Special Defense investment allow Blissey to switch into full HP Kyogre's Water Spout in the rain with no issues. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense to better take hits such as Calyrex-S's Psyshock. Maximum HP can be run to survive full HP, Choice Specs Kyogre's  Water Spout after Stealth Rock, but this is a rare situation, and it is generally better to invest into Defense.</p> <p>Blissey works well with teammates that appreciate the utility it provides, which allow them to run more offensive sets. Necrozma-DM is particularly notable, as Blissey covers the offensive Eternatus and Xerneas, which specially defensive Necrozma-DM normally checks. In return, Necrozma-DM can use a Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set to pressure the opposing team while still checking Ice-types. Choice Specs Calyrex-S can run Nasty Plot when paired with Blissey thanks to it having Aromatherapy. Alternatively, Calyrex-S can run Aromatherapy itself to let Blissey run another utility option such as Stealth Rock, potentially freeing up another teammate such as Groudon or Necrozma-DM. Groudon appreciates the Stealth Rock, cleric, Thunder Wave, and Wish support that Blissey provides. Offensive and physically defensive Eternatus love that Blissey checks Kyogre. In return, Eternatus can absorb Toxic Spikes, which can be threatening to Blissey teams that lack enough Defoggers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Blissey can take Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre for Ferrothorn, which allow it to focus more on physical defense to better check threats such as Zekrom. If it is running Thunder Wave, Blissey can get taken advantage of by Pokemon such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde.

The combination of entry hazard and sand chip damage is effective in deterring switch-ins hoping to force Tyranitar out, such as Xerneas or Marshadow. Rock Blast pressures the Defoggers and defeats Substitute + Leech Seed Calyrex-S. Foul Play OHKOes Calyrex-S and deters Marshadow, Groudon, and Necrozma-DM from switching in or setting up. Thunder Wave is an option, crippling the aforementioned Pokemon, barring Groudon, in addition to Kyogre and Xerneas, on the switch. Rest grants Tyranitar the ability to sponge status and wastes PP from opposing Ho-Oh or Eternatus. Heavy-Duty Boots is the optimal item, given Tyranitar's weakness to the most common entry hazard setters like Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>One of the biggest advantages of running Tyranitar is that it frees teams to use devastating offensive Yveltal sets rather than support sets. Fast Taunt, specially offensive, Choice Band, and Hone Claws Yveltal sets are all good choices in conjunction with Tyranitar. Defog Ho-Oh is a good teammate for handling Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, which otherwise use Tyranitar for free hazards, and also switching into Marshadow and Xerneas; though it should be noted that Geomancy Xerneas KOes Ho-Oh with Thunder after one round of sand chip damage. Eternatus as a teammate is a Marshadow and Kyogre switch-in. Blissey provides clerical support. Ferrothorn forms a formidable entry hazard core with Tyranitar given Tyranitar's good matchup versus common Defoggers, and Ferrothorn also helps switch into Kyogre. Necrozma-DM can also switch into Xerneas and, thanks to Tyranitar, can forego Stealth Rock to run offensive sets. Sand Rush Excadrill can revenge kill Marshadow and Xerneas, hugely benefitting from the sand support Tyranitar provides. Calyrex-S is assisted by the pressure Tyranitar places on opposing Yveltal and provides Aromatherapy support in return. Zygarde, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole also have advantageous matchups versus Groudon, Zygarde, Marshadow, and Necrozma-DM.</p>"

  "Lugia": {
    "overview": "<p>Lugia possesses some of the greatest bulk in the metagame backed up by one of the best defensive abilities in Multiscale. Its access to reliable recovery, a great Speed tier, and an extensive support movepool ensures that it can keep itself healthy with relative ease and effectively check various threats such as Zygarde, Groudon, and Rayquaza. Its walling capabilities, however, are entirely dependent on Multiscale, which makes Lugia very hard to utilize considering it must be kept at full health or else risk being taken down by the multitude of fast and strong wallbreakers in the metagame. Lugia also despises all status ailments and must avoid them at all costs, making cleric support with Lugia important and making it a natural fit on stall teams. While Heavy-Duty Boots is a godsend to rid Lugia of its weakness to Stealth Rock, it also means it lacks passive recovery and can't switch in on certain Pokemon it would otherwise beat, such as Landorus, in fear of Knock Off. Lugia's defensive typing also leaves much to be desired, giving it weaknesses to the extremely common Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. It also cannot deal with the best offensive and defensive threats in the metagame, being completely outclassed by Necrozma-DM and Lunala, both of which share Lugia's Psychic-type but have a much better secondary typing in Steel and Ghost, respectively. On more dedicated stall builds, Giratina is bulkier and can provide more for its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Defog allows Lugia to remove entry hazards so that it can free up a moveslot for another teammate, but since Necrozma-DM, the best Stealth Rock setter in the metagame, doesn't really care about Lugia, it's not advised.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal can often outspeed Lugia and shut it down via Knock Off, Toxic, or Taunt. It doesn't want to switch in on a status move, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Calyrex-S can consistently 2HKO Lugia even through Multiscale, takes little damage from Ice Beam, and can cure itself of status with Aromatherapy. Marshadow can break through Lugia's defenses as well. Giratina can status Lugia with either Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, while Giratina-O can opt for a strong Ghost-type STAB move to deal a ton of damage.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM can hit through Multiscale thanks to Sunsteel Strike, set up Stealth Rock in front of Lugia without fear of much, remove Lugia's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, or cripple Lugia with Thunder Wave or the rare Toxic. Offensive variants can set up with Dragon Dance in front of Lugia and chunk it with a boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Magearna can come in on Lugia and utilize their utility moves for free, whether that's setting up entry hazards, removing them, or providing cleric support, respectively. The former two can even threaten to status Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Multiscale is the only reason Lugia is even remotely viable, so any way to consistently break it effectively cripples Lugia. Tyranitar's Sand Stream or damage from status conditions makes Lugia way less bulky.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Roost is Lugia's most important move, ridding it of its Flying typing and thus its pesky weakness to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks while also providing reliable recovery. Whirlwind allows Lugia to phaze out foes like Zygarde that are trying to set up. Ice Beam hits Ground- and Dragon-type foes for a considerable amount of damage, OHKOing Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and 3HKOing Zygarde-C while Lugia shrugs off their attacks. Toxic is Lugia's main way of dealing with the majority of the metagame; it should be used liberally against foes that are not Steel- or Poison-type to whittle them down and stall them out with Lugia's fantastic bulk. Thunder Wave is an option to incapacitate wallbreakers that try to switch in on Lugia, such as Calyrex-S and Urshifu-S, or the aforementioned Steel- and Poison-types, like Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. 96 Speed EVs are utilized so that Lugia can outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s like Kyogre and Groudon, as well as maximum Speed Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Lugia requires heavy team support, as it is extremely passive and is only seen on more stall-oriented builds. A switch-in to Yveltal is paramount, as it outspeeds Lugia and can cripple it with Knock Off, Taunt, or Toxic. Defensive Xerneas and Eternatus are great teammates, able to deal with anything Yveltal throws their way while also acting as consistent answers to Marshadow, a wallbreaker that Lugia cannot deal with. Ghost-types in general are a problem for Lugia, especially Calyrex-S. As such, Yveltal acts as a good answer to them. Lugia struggles against the premier Steel-types of the metagame in Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, so teammates that can beat them are appreciated. Physically defensive Eternatus can use Flamethrower to beat them both, shrugging off their hits and PP stalling them with Pressure. Ho-Oh can threaten them with Sacred Fire and can also remove entry hazards for Lugia with Defog if Lugia's Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. It also serves as a switch-in to Calyrex-S and Marshadow, scouting their sets. In return, Lugia can deal with Zygarde and Rayquaza, both of which give Ho-Oh trouble. Cleric support is necessary in case Lugia gets statused, so Blissey and Chansey make perfect teammates, removing status and acting as emergency switch-ins to Ghost-type attacks. Status absorbers such as Rest Zygarde and Giratina also work.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots rids Ho-Oh of its most crippling flaw, its Stealth Rock weakness, making it a critical defensive Pokemon in the metagame. Thanks to Regenerator, its huge Special Defense, and its good defensive typing, Ho-Oh is an important glue Pokemon for teambuilding, as it compresses a myriad of roles into one. Ho-Oh is able to check Xerneas lacking Ingrain and Marshadow without a Rock-type move and act as a great backup check to Calyrex-S. It is able to consistently switch into Necrozma-DM, the most common Stealth Rock setter in the tier, and use Defog, giving its team good entry hazard control. Offensively, Ho-Oh is no slouch either, as the Choice Band set is underprepared for and is able to punch serious holes into the vast majority of teams. Ho-Oh has become such a metagame-defining force that it's often specifically prepared for in teambuilding; Ho-Oh's massive weakness to Rock-type attacks can be easy to exploit, and it must constantly be on the lookout for Knock Off and Toxic users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse sets are an option, but they generally just get statused or phazed. They are also easy to revenge kill due to their lowered Speed. Roost provides a more consistent source of recovery, although it is generally not needed thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots and Regenerator. Pressure is an option in combination with Roost to PP stall opposing Pokemon, but the opportunity cost of not having Regenerator is a severe detriment. Life Orb sets can be used similarly to how the Choice Band set is used, with the freedom to choose moves. Do note that, even with Regenerator, Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil can add up quickly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves</strong>: Rock-type moves are often thrown on sets for the sole purpose of taking out Ho-Oh. Meteor Beam Eternatus, Rock Tomb Marshadow, Power Gem Dialga, and Stone Edge Necrozma-DM are a few examples of Pokemon you need to keep in mind when using Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus doesn't mind burns and can stall out defensive sets. Physically defensive sets can typically stomach Choice Band Ho-Oh, but specially defensive sets have to be extremely careful around it.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Defensive Zygarde-C with Rest will take anything Ho-Oh throws at it and status it in return. However, offensive Zygarde-C sets must be wary of status or a Choice Band Brave Bird on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre can come in on Sacred Fire or Defog and then proceed to use its strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom hates status from Ho-Oh, but it is resistant to Ho-Oh's STAB attacks and can threaten it with a powerful Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off + Stealth Rock</strong>: Ho-Oh is limited if Stealth Rock has been set up, as it then needs to be wary of Knock Off from Pokemon like Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth. Certain Stealth Rock setters, such as Groudon and Tyranitar, do not mind Ho-Oh switching in. Stealth Rock heavily limits Choice Band Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: While the threat of Toxic is lowered thanks to Regenerator, its damage can add up, especially in late-game scenarios. The residual damage can prevent Ho-Oh from checking threats it otherwise could. Eternatus, Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and opposing Ho-Oh all can badly poison Ho-Oh.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is the standard Ho-Oh set. Sacred Fire is a great STAB attack, and it has an impressive 50% burn chance. However, you should be careful about using it, as its PP is low—and even lower against Eternatus switch-ins. Ho-Oh is a great user of Defog, as it is able to repeatedly come into Necrozma-DM. Toxic is a good option to stall out Pokemon that don't particularly mind burns or are immune to them, such as Yveltal and opposing Ho-Oh. Thunder Wave is a great option for Eternatus, which is a very common switch-in that is immune to Toxic and not bothered by burns. Whirlwind is to phaze Xerneas, although it also has its uses for other setup sweepers such as Zygarde-C, Cosmic Power Eternatus, and Calyrex-S. However, you need to watch out for Ingrain Xerneas. Brave Bird is a strong secondary STAB option that hits Fire-resistant Pokemon like Eternatus and Kyogre much harder, and it helps with Sacred Fire's low PP. The given EV spread allows Ho-Oh to always survive a +2 Xerneas's Thunder, with the leftover EVs put into Defense to better deal with physical attackers such as Marshadow. If you run Thunder Wave, a spread of 248 HP / 192 Def / 52 SpD / 16 Spe should be used to let Ho-Oh outspeed Choice Specs Calyrex-S after paralysis.</p> <p>Smart switching is the key to using this set, both in terms of Regenerator recovery and scouting for status or Rock-type coverage moves. Marshadow, Xerneas, and Calyrex-S are too threatening to leave Ho-Oh as your only check to them. Choice Band Marshadow can 2HKO Ho-Oh with Poltergeist or Spectral Thief, while Xerneas can threaten to KO Ho-Oh with a boosted Thunder if Ho-Oh has taken damage, or use Ingrain to prevent Ho-Oh from phazing it. Choice Specs Calyrex-S will 2HKO Ho-Oh outright. As such, Pokemon such as Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, Zarude, Buzzwole, Lunala, and Tangrowth make good defensive partners. Necrozma-DM can provide a solid defense against Ice-types, offensive Eternatus, and Xerneas, as well as Stealth Rock and status support, while Yveltal will keep Calyrex-S at bay. Lunala, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth also offer good defense against Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C, while the latter two offer a good pivot against Marshadow. Eternatus and Blissey are excellent teammates for their ability to switch into Kyogre. All of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to serve as a backup check to the tier's biggest sweepers, as well as Defog. Zarude in particular likes Ho-Oh's ability to Defog, as Zarude often replaces Yveltal on teams, and in return, Zarude can role compress a Calyrex-S check and Ground-type check into one. Ho-Oh can consistently switch into entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn and force them out, even if they hit it with Knock Off. However, if Ho-Oh hard switches into these Pokemon every time, it can become predictable and be taken advantage of by double switches. Ho-Oh must be wary of alternative setters of Stealth Rock, such as Groudon and Tyranitar. Having a secondary Defog user, such as Yveltal, can be useful for providing more security against such Pokemon, as well as against Sticky Web and other offensive playstyles, depending on your team structure. Alternatively, Ho-Oh can be used to free up moveslots on Pokemon such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, who now don't need to run Defog or check Xerneas, respectively.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Ho-Oh is one of the best wallbreakers in the tier, with most teams having to resort to offensive pressure, soft checks, and status to try to stop it. Brave Bird does massive damage to anything that resists Sacred Fire, and its recoil is minimized thanks to Regenerator. Earthquake rounds out Ho-Oh's coverage and is its strongest option against Eternatus and Zekrom. The last move is flexible. Whirlwind is generally preferred, as it gives Ho-Oh more defensive utility in phazing opposing Ho-Oh and Zygarde-C in a pinch. Flare Blitz does massive damage and is stronger than Sacred Fire; it also makes up for Sacred Fire's low PP. Defog can be used in emergency situations to clear away Stealth Rock. The given EVs allow Ho-Oh to survive a +2 Xerneas Thunder, with the remaining EVs put into Attack to maximize Ho-Oh's power. 16 Attacks EVs can be moved to Speed to make Ho-Oh faster than a paralyzed Calyrex-S. It's not advisable to go much faster than this, though, because Choice Band Ho-Oh functions best as an offensive tank, and it would rather not lose significant breaking power or the ability to check special threats.</p> <p>While this set is immensely strong, the major flaw is its vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Because of this, Choice Band Ho-Oh is usually a Pokemon that teams specifically build around. At least two Defog users are recommended: Yveltal, Lunala, Xerneas, Giratina, and Corviknight are good possible partners. Xatu is notable for having Magic Bounce and being able to switch into Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma-DM repeatedly. Additionally, teammates that can lure and break through defensive Zygarde-C are appreciated. Groudon is a good partner for this, and it can also provide sun to make Ho-Oh even stronger and to lower Thunder's accuracy. Teammates that like Eternatus being gone, such as Marshadow, synergize well, as this set often breaks through Eternatus.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set combines Ho-Oh's great wallbreaking power with the unique support options it provides. Very few Pokemon are able to withstand Ho-Oh's STAB attacks, with Zygarde and Zekrom being notable exceptions. Sacred Fire's burn chance cripples the aforementioned foes, while Flare Blitz offers greater power and PP at the cost of recoil damage and a much lower burn chance. Notably, Flare Blitz lowers the chance of accidentally burning Eternatus, Ho-Oh's most common switch-in; instead, Ho-Oh can paralyze Eternatus with Thunder Wave, crippling it for the rest of the game. Brave Bird has a good chance to 2HKO Eternatus and is Ho-Oh's best option against opposing Ho-Oh. The last slot is flexible. Defog is extremely useful against Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, and can prevent Shuckle from setting Sticky Web in combination with Defog Yveltal. Meanwhile, Whirlwind lets Ho-Oh phaze out Xerneas, Cosmic Power Eternatus, SubSeed Calyrex-S, and Zygarde in a pinch. Substitute can be used to further pressure Eternatus by blocking its Toxic. The given EV spread outspeeds paralyzed Calyrex-S and lives a +2 Thunder from Xerneas, with the rest dumped into Attack to increase the chance of 2HKOing Eternatus. An alternative spread of 80 HP / 160 Atk / 252 Def / 16 Spe allows Ho-Oh to live +2 Jolly Weavile's Triple Axel and tank Marshadow's attacks better.</p> <p>Ho-Oh is great at crippling Eternatus and thus works well with partners who want Eternatus gone. While Kyogre may seem counterproductive due to Drizzle, it loves Eternatus being paralyzed. Kyogre can take on Zygarde and, in turn, Ho-Oh can prevent Ferrothorn from setting Spikes. Marshadow is another fantastic teammate, as paralysis allows Marshadow to more comfortably run an Adamant nature and 2HKO Eternatus on the switch. Defensive Zygarde works well in combination with Ho-Oh to scout out Marshadow's moves, and Eternatus being paralyzed allows Coil sets to break through it. Zygarde can additionally take on Groudon and appreciates Ho-Oh stopping Weavile. Groudon is an amazing partner for its sun and Stealth Rock support, and it can provide a defensive backbone against Zekrom and opposing Groudon. Haban Berry Eternatus, Ferrothorn, Xerneas, and Zarude also help keep Zekrom at bay.</p>"

Toxic hinders switch-ins such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh and lets Shedinja beat Zygarde-C and Kyogre lacking Rest. Poltergeist is an option over Toxic, as it allows Shedinja to deal greater damage to slower foes such as Necrozma-DM. Protect lets Shedinja scout Choice-locked foes such as Calyrex-S, Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, and Marshadow and lets it scout for status moves.

Lunala is also excellent for checking Groudon, which threatens Shedinja. Eternatus is able to deal with Ferrothorn and Marshadow, while Shedinja can wall Kyogre and thus allow Eternatus to run a more offensive set. Yveltal is a superb partner for Shedinja, being able to deal with Calyrex-S and opposing Yveltal for it. In return, Shedinja can wall Xerneas. Rest Zygarde-C is also a good partner for Shedinja, as it can absorb status for it and use other passive Pokemon that threaten Shedinja, such as Toxapex, as setup fodder.

    "overview": "<p>With an amazing base 150 Special Attack, a great ability in Drizzle, and good bulk, Kyogre remains one of the most dominant Pokemon of the metagame. Drizzle gives its STAB Water-type moves some extra firepower, turning it into an even scarier wallbreaker and providing support for its team by merely switching onto the battlefield. While base 90 Speed is not great, especially by Ubers's standards, Kyogre still outspeeds and breaks past common walls with its strong moves, and it outspeeds offensive threats once equipped with a Choice Scarf. Nevertheless, Kyogre often struggles to beat some of the extremely common Dragon-types that run rampant in Ubers such as Eternatus and Zekrom as well as the rarer Grass-types in Ferrothorn and Zarude, and it also finds Blissey problematic. Drizzle's rain setting also leaves it vulnerable to unavoidable Thunders that can hit it extremely hard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be run on the Choice Scarf set, as it is more accurate and has more PP than Origin Pulse, but the drop off in damage is noticeable and rather large. A more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 248 SpD with a Calm nature ensures that uninvested Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon doesn't break Kyogre's Substitute, but it leaves Kyogre very vulnerable to physical attacks. Sleep Talk can be run in the fourth moveslot on the bulky Calm Mind set, but Kyogre doesn't need to keep itself active so much that it'd run it over the other options. Toxic on the Calm Mind set can beat Shedinja and Gastrodon and whittle down Blissey, but it does not offer nearly as much universal utility as Kyogre's other options and just makes Kyogre even more susceptible to Eternatus. Calm Mind sets can utilize Roar to phaze Cosmic Power Eternatus and opposing Kyogre, but the coverage is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus can take all Water-type moves that Kyogre throws its way and has the potential to phaze a boosted Kyogre with Dragon Tail while consistently outspeeding it. It has to be very wary of Choice Specs Ice Beam, however, as it can deal a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can consistently beat all Kyogre sets if it's holding a Utility Umbrella, but if Stealth Rock is up, it can faint to a healthy Kyogre's Modest Water Spout.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Gastrodon and Shedinja wall Kyogre regardless of its set, with Gastrodon being able to remove Kyogre's boosts with Clear Smog while Shedinja's Wonder Guard protects it from all of Kyogre's options.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zekrom can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Kyogre and OHKO with Bolt Strike while also being immune to Thunder Wave, but it cannot come in on an Ice Beam in fear of being OHKOed or a Scald, as it risks getting crippled by a burn. Regieleki has enough speed to outspeed even Timid Choice Scarf Kyogre and threaten to OHKO with its Electric-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Utility Umbrella Kyurem-W and Palkia can take any hit Kyogre throws their way and retaliate with their strong attacks, but neither one likes being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Kyogre's Water- and Electric-type attacks, only gets hit for neutral damage by Ice Beam, and threatens to 2HKO Kyogre with Power Whip or use it as setup fodder for entry hazards.

Rest keeps Kyogre healthy, lets it absorb status, and makes switching into weaker attackers like Necrozma-DM and defensive Eternatus less punishing long-term. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Grass-type switch-ins super effectively and ensures Kyogre can set up alongside Zygarde-C and then OHKO it. Alternatively, Block traps weak walls, primarily Eternatus, that can normally stop Kyogre and turns them into setup fodder alongside Rest.

Kyogre's Drizzle limits Necrozma-DM's recovery, allowing Xerneas to have a better shot at breaking past it and providing it with perfectly accurate Thunders.

Origin Pulse allows Kyogre to wallbreak even when its HP is low but misses out on the damage benchmarks of Water Spout. Ice Beam lets Kyogre deal with the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist its STAB moves, especially Eternatus, which can outspeed Kyogre and reliably recover any lost HP. Thunder is perfectly accurate under Kyogre's rain, allows it to beat opposing Kyogre, chunks Palkia, and has a respectable chance to paralyze the foe. A Modest nature lets Kyogre 2HKO Ferrothorn and Eternatus after Stealth Rock. Timid sacrifices a bit of power for the ability to Speed tie with other base 90 Speed foes such as Zekrom. It's also mandatory on teams utilizing Sticky Web to outspeed Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kyogre wants to fit on more offensive teams due to its item. Sticky Web support from Shuckle or Slurpuff helps compensate for Kyogre's unimpressive base Speed, allowing it to outspeed Calyrex-S and Pheromosa with a positive Speed nature.

Strong physical attackers such as Swords Dance Groudon can break past Eternatus and Ferrothorn, both of which Kyogre struggles to break. In return, Kyogre can take on Zygarde-C and Lunala, two common checks to Groudon. Calyrex-I is a good partner, as it can break past Eternatus and beat Zekrom while also helping overwhelm Ferrothorn.

Rain-boosted Water Spout is a very scary tool that allows Kyogre to OHKO common threats such as Calyrex-S, Dragon Dance Zygarde before it transforms, and unboosted Xerneas. Origin Pulse is Kyogre's best move once it's too weakened to reliably use Water Spout, consistently 2HKOing Necrozma-DM and Yveltal. Ice Beam nails Dragon-types such as offensive Eternatus, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C. Thunder lets Kyogre beat other Kyogre and forces opposing Ditto to lock into it to beat Kyogre. A Timid nature makes Kyogre faster than Calyrex-S and +1 Zygarde-C.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kyogre can outspeed and revenge kill the vast majority of the metagame if it's healthy. Calyrex-S is a great partner, as it can beat Kyogre's biggest counters in Eternatus and Blissey, while Kyogre scares out Yveltal and Tyranitar, both of which can beat Calyrex-S. Necrozma-DM can set up Stealth Rock for Kyogre and beat Xerneas, which Kyogre often lets in when locking into non-STAB attacks. Ho-Oh can remove entry hazards with Defog so that Kyogre can remain as healthy as possible, and it also severely limits Ferrothorn's capabilities to check Kyogre. It doesn't, however, like the damage drop-off that rain gives to its Sacred Fire. Lunala and Groudon can help beat Zekrom, one of Kyogre's toughest checks.</p>"

      "SubCM": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to set up Calm Minds mid-game to take over the match. Substitute ensures that Kyogre doesn't get statused, as remaining healthy is key to be able to go for as long as possible. It also allows Kyogre to avoid Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and can help absorb weaker hits like Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon after a Calm Mind boost. Thunder Wave alongside Calm Mind and Substitute lets Kyogre beat foes like Eternatus and Blissey, slowing them down and preventing them from PP stalling it. Surf is chosen because it's more accurate and has more PP than Origin Pulse and is stronger than Scald. Also, Scald's burn chance is undesirable because the set aims to paralyze its targets. 116 Speed EVs ensure that Kyogre can outspeed Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Yveltal after paralyzing them. 252 HP EVs mean Blissey's Seismic Toss doesn't break Substitute, with the rest of the EVs put into Special Attack backed up by a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>This set punishes Ground-types especially hard, so Pokemon that want those gone make great teammates. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM likes to have Zygarde-C and Groudon checked by this Kyogre set and provides an answer to Eternatus in return. Cleric support from Blissey or Calyrex-S is appreciated in the instances where Kyogre has to switch in on a status move or if Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire burns it. Xerneas can break through Zarude, a Pokemon that otherwise cares very little about Kyogre's antics. In return, Kyogre's Drizzle limits Necrozma-DM's recovery from Morning Sun so that Xerneas can set up and sweep. Kyogre spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave allows slower wallbreakers such as Urshifu-S and Rayquaza to take over and deal with their offensive checks more easily.</p>"

  "Groudon": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Groudon may not seem to have what it takes to be a defining force in Ubers. However, it's one of the best wallbreakers and sweepers in the whole tier. With its signature move, Precipice Blades, and excellent Attack, offensive Groudon sets can even stop Zygarde from transforming into Zygarde-C through pure force. Defensively, Groudon's typing and excellent physical bulk let it check physical threats such as Zekrom. Good bulk, an immunity to Thunder Wave, and several boosting options in Rock Polish, Bulk Up, and Swords Dance allow Groudon to decimate many common defensive cores, and these traits give it an easy time setting up on common Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM. Groudon does have trouble getting past the few checks it does have, although even these can be dealt with with the right coverage move. Groudon's main flaws are that its attacks often have low accuracy and it has no reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down over time by status, Knock Off, and repeated attacks; additionally, if it lacks Rock Polish, Groudon is slow and prone to being picked off by faster threats such as Calyrex-S.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heat Rock can be used if you pair Groudon with Pokemon to take advantage of sun, such as Weather Ball Zekrom and Ho-Oh. Precipice Blades and Stone Edge can be replaced with Earthquake and Rock Slide on all sets for their higher accuracy, but Groudon loses notable wallbreaking power, especially against Zygarde and Yveltal. Rock Slide's flinch chance can be situationally useful on teams that heavily utilize paralysis. Overheat can be run over Heat Crash, since it will still OHKO Tangrowth and Buzzwole, and it has the advantage of not needing a boost to do so. However, Overheat doesn't offset Groudon's inaccurate attacks like Heat Crash does, and it can be played around should you happen to use it at the wrong time. Rest can be used on defensive sets to have more longevity. Dragon Claw could be used to hit Dragon-types like Giratina-O, but they are sufficiently rare to not make it worth it. Rocky Helmet is a possible item on defensive sets to punish physical attackers, but Groudon needs the recovery from Leftovers much more, since it lacks reliable recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: Lunala can come in on pretty much anything Groudon throws at it and burn Groudon, phaze it, or do massive damage to it with Ice Beam or Moongeist Beam. Lunala doesn't like status, however.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde-C has the bulk to deal with Double Dance Groudon. This pressures Groudon to defeat Zygarde before it transforms. Additionally, Zygarde has the bulk to deal with most bulky Swords Dance Groudon, even before transforming. Against Bulk Up Groudon, defensive Zygarde will typically have the advantage thanks to Coil, Glare, and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Landorus-T can pivot in on Groudon thanks to Intimidate and its immunity to Precipice Blades. However, Landorus-T has no recovery outside of Leftovers, and it must watch out for being weakened over time.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Zarude resist Ground and are neutral against Rock, giving Groudon a harder time breaking past them. However, they will easily be KOed by Heat Crash.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole has great physical bulk and resists Ground, completely walling any Groudon aside from Heat Crash sets.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Calyrex-S has the Speed to outrun Groudon even after a Rock Polish boost. Foul Play Yveltal, Xerneas, and Choice Specs Calyrex-S can do massive damage or KO Groudon if it has not boosted its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: While rare, Giratina and Giratina-O both have the bulk to tank Groudon and either status it, phaze it, or damage it significantly.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Corviknight and Skarmory have little to fear from Groudon apart from Heat Crash, and they can use it to set up Spikes, use Defog, or otherwise gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia with Multiscale up can come in and phaze Groudon with minimal worries. However, Lugia must stay at 100% HP, lest it fall to a boosted Stone Edge.</p>",

      "Bulky Booster": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Groudon's naturally high physical bulk to provide more support for its team, as well as being a terrifying wallbreaker in its own right. Without Rock Polish, Groudon can run another coverage option or a status move to help deal with its normal checks, such as Zarude, Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Lunala. Bulk Up gives a better matchup against Zygarde than Swords Dance, and it gives Groudon superior physical bulk after boosting. Swords Dance facilitates a more defensive EV spread that gives Groudon more bulk without boosting that can be used to lure in and defeat Foul Play Yveltal and better check physical attackers in a pinch. The last moveslot is very flexible. Heat Crash is a great coverage option to KO Buzzwole, Zarude, Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Corviknight, which would otherwise wall Groudon. Notably, Heat Crash under sun will typically do just as much damage as Precipice Blades will to a neutral target, easing Groudon's accuracy issues. Toxic is useful to break down Lunala and Zygarde over time. Thunder Wave provides nice team support and helps patch up Groudon's low Speed. 240 HP EVs improve Leftovers recovery; Leftovers and higher HP investment give this set more bulk to check Zekrom and other physical attackers, and they prolong Groudon's sweeping potential. Maximum Attack investment ensures Groudon will hit hard as possible after a Bulk Up, being able to OHKO Tangrowth with Heat Crash. 16 Speed EVs work well alongside Thunder Wave or paralysis support to outspeed paralyzed Calyrex-S. Another option is to run a spread of 224 HP / 108 Atk / 160 Def / 16 Spe with an Impish nature; it is preferred for Swords Dance sets, notably giving Groudon the bulk to survive a Foul Play from Yveltal even after it has used Swords Dance. The Attack investment is used to always KO specially defensive Yveltal with Stone Edge.</p> <p>Other paralysis spreaders like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde are good teammates to help make up for Groudon's poor Speed. This Groudon will often inflict status onto or KO Yveltal, so Pokemon that can sweep with Yveltal gone, such as Calyrex-S, are great teammates. If you are running Heat Crash, physical attackers that appreciate Tangrowth or Buzzwole being gone, such as Zekrom and Marshadow, make good partners. Clerics such as Xerneas, Calyrex-S, Blissey, and Clefable will be able to keep Groudon status free, which is especially relevant if Groudon is trying to break through Lunala or Zygarde. This set can struggle to break through defensive Zygarde, so switch-ins to Zygarde such as Lunala, Buzzwole, and Xerneas are great partners.</p>"

      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Precipice Blades and Stone Edge give Groudon great neutral coverage. Rock Polish makes Groudon faster than everything in the metagame bar Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Swords Dance makes Groudon incredibly strong and gives it the power to break through most physical walls. For example, +2 Life Orb Groudon has an 81.3% chance to OHKO defensive Zygarde, giving it no chance to transform into Zygarde-C. Life Orb gives Groudon great power with or without Swords Dance. However, Lum Berry can be run to better protect Groudon from status such as poison from Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, burn from Lunala's Will-O-Wisp, and paralysis from Zygarde's Glare. Also, the lack of recoil prevents opponents from switching around to get chip damage on it, which can be critical to defeating a damaged Groudon in a pinch. The given EV spread outspeeds uninvested Yveltal and Xerneas.</p> <p>This set is fairly straightforward to use, and it works well on offensive teams. Groudon will appreciate offensive teammates that can help break down its few checks. Zekrom is fantastic for this, luring in and severely damaging Tangrowth or Buzzwole with Draco Meteor. Marshadow is another good physical partner, as its strong Spectral Thief will take out Lunala. In return, Groudon can KO Zygarde. Xerneas and offensive Eternatus have good synergy with Groudon as well, as Groudon can come in on Necrozma-DM, which they attract in. For hyper offense teams, Froslass and Aerodactyl lay down entry hazards and prevent the opponent from laying their own with Taunt. Grimmsnarl is another fantastic hyper offense partner, switching into Calyrex-S, which may try to revenge kill Groudon, and setting up dual screens, making Groudon terrifyingly hard to KO.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Physically defensive Groudon is one of the best sources of Stealth Rock besides Necrozma-DM in the tier. It also provides a good check to some dangerous setup sweepers such as Zekrom and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Precipice Blades will still do decent damage generally, even without Attack investment. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are great coverage options, and they notably make the most common Defoggers in the tier, Yveltal and Ho-Oh, very afraid of switching into Groudon. Toxic gives Groudon a decent way of punishing switch-ins such as Zygarde and Yveltal. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage. It particularly punishes Zygarde nicely. Thunder Wave is another option that can cripple switch-ins, but you need to watch out for Zygarde. 16 Speed EVs are run to outspeed a paralyzed Calyrex-S.</p> <p>This set's biggest flaws are its lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status. Because of this, you will want to pair it with a cleric like Xerneas or Blissey. Blissey can even provide Thunder Wave support and check Kyogre. Ferrothorn is good to heal Groudon with Leech Seed and provide Spikes support, which helps Dragon Tail sets. Ferrothorn can also switch into Kyogre, which often switches into Groudon. Necrozma-DM has good synergy with this set, as it appreciates Groudon's sun support for Moonlight, and Groudon can provide extra insurance against physical wallbreakers such as Zekrom and Marshadow. This pairing also frees up a moveslot on Necrozma-DM that is normally reserved for Stealth Rock. For example, it could run Knock Off to cripple Ho-Oh, which then cannot use Defog in front of Groudon due to fear of a Rock-type move, thus severely limiting its presence for the rest of the game and keeping Stealth Rock on the field.</p>"

  "Rayquaza": {
    "overview": "<p>Rayquaza is one of the most devastating wallbreakers in Ubers, sporting huge offenses and high Base Power moves. Its potential to run Choice Band, a mixed set, or even a boosting set makes it nigh impossible to safely switch into without risking the loss of a Pokemon. Access to Extreme Speed further limits offensive counterplay. Sadly, Rayquaza suffers from four-moveslot syndrome when choosing coverage. Its subpar defensive typing leaves it weak to Stealth Rock and makes it hard to switch in, as any chip damage it takes racks up rather quickly. Rayquaza is also susceptible to common revenge killers such as Calyrex-S, Eternatus, and Marshadow.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lum Berry may seem appealing to negate a status move, allowing Rayquaza to freely set up in front of a passive Pokemon like Blissey or Tangrowth and safely use Outrage; however, the extra damage from Life Orb is always a better option. A set using Dragon Dance can boost Attack and Speed without spending two turns on Swords Dance and Scale Shot, but Swords Dance still generally makes better use of Rayquaza's rare setup opportunities. The mixed set can utilize Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock, but Life Orb's damage boost is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Foes</strong>: Lunala, Lugia, Xerneas, and Groudon can take Rayquaza's physical attacks and threaten to KO it back. Groudon must be wary of the mixed set, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Rayquaza's Life Orb chip damage, alongside Dragon Ascent and V-create's Defense drops, make Marshadow's Shadow Sneak and Yveltal's Sucker Punch extremely threatening. However, they cannot KO Rayquaza from full health without multiple Defense drops.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Marshadow, Eternatus, Mewtwo, and Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Xerneas can outspeed Rayquaza and revenge kill it effortlessly, as Extreme Speed fails to KO them from full health. Galarian Darmanitan performs similarly but rarely falls to a +2 Extreme Speed from full health. None of them can switch in safely, however.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock, combined with Life Orb recoil, puts it on a timer and makes it much easier to revenge kill.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Rayquaza turns into one of the strongest physical attackers in the metagame. V-create gives Rayquaza almost perfect coverage, OHKOing Necrozma-DM, which resists Dragon Ascent. Extreme Speed is a valuable tool to pick off weakened foes and lessens the number of foes that can revenge kill Rayquaza. Earthquake provides similar coverage to V-create whilst not dropping Rayquaza's stats. Dragon Claw is an option to KO Eternatus and has a favorable roll to OHKO offensive Zygarde before Power Construct activates. Scale Shot gives Rayquaza a shot at muscling through defensive Lunala and boosts Rayquaza's Speed, making it harder to revenge kill for foes such as Calyrex-S and Eternatus.</p> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza fits best on offensive builds to pave the way for threatening sweepers, especially physical ones like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Swords Dance Groudon, and Choice Band Marshadow, to take over the match. Pivots such as U-turn Yveltal and Galarian Darmanitan can help bring Rayquaza in safely. Geomancy Xerneas is a fantastic partner because Rayquaza can pressure Necrozma-DM, its biggest counter, with V-create or Earthquake. In return, Xerneas can check Eternatus lacking Sludge Bomb, as well as other Dragon-types that threaten Rayquaza.

Scale Shot's Speed boosting complements Swords Dance well, helping Rayquaza outspeed revenge killers such as Marshadow and Choice Specs Calyrex-S while also KOing Eternatus with three hits at +2. Extreme Speed can be run instead to turn Rayquaza into a terrifying revenge killer. Focus Sash allows it to survive a hit from Pokemon such as Eternatus and Calyrex-S and thus guarantee a boost or KO.

Rayquaza also pairs well with Geomancy Xerneas, helping overwhelm Necrozma-DM, which is Xerneas's biggest roadblock.

Unlike Eternatus, Gastrodon is less likely to lose to Kyogre through status and can always beat Kyogre's Choice Specs set. It can also switch into Dracovish spamming Fishious Rend, safely switch into defensive Necrozma-DM not running Knock Off, and counter special Palkia and Dialga that are not running Choice Specs. However, Gastrodon is a more passive switch-in to Kyogre compared to other options like Eternatus and Ferrothorn and lets it freely use Rest; unlike Gastrodon, other special walls are able to switch in and shut down Kyogre by using it as an opportunity to heal, inflict status, or set entry hazards. Gastrodon is also susceptible to all entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, if not running Heavy-Duty Boots. When not facing Kyogre or Dracovish, Gastrodon is extremely underwhelming and offers little defensive value.</p>",

Ferrothorn is especially an issue, as it comfortably takes all of Gastrodon's attacks and gets a free chance to use Knock Off or set Spikes. It can also take Gastrodon out with its Grass-type STAB move and recover any small amount of damage it takes with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus can repeatedly sponge any of Gastrodon's attacks and threaten it with Toxic.

Earthquake hits Eternatus and Toxapex trying to heal or set up Toxic Spikes, and it also catches Zekrom and Dialga for respectable damage. Alternatively, Ice Beam prevents Zygarde-C from using Substitute and setting up on Gastrodon with Coil or Dragon Dance, while Icy Wind conveniently lowers the Speed of switch-ins, such as Calyrex-S and Xerneas to allow Gastrodon's partners to switch in more safely.

Dark and Ice hit almost the entire tier for neutral damage, with only the rare Zamazenta-C and Magearna resisting both. Ice Shard can also be situationally useful in keeping opposing offensive setup sweepers in check, most notably Zekrom and Zygarde. Weavile has incredibly low bulk by Ubers standards, though, and can be incredibly difficult to bring in repeatedly as a result. Its Dark typing can make it difficult to fit onto teams because it cannot check Calyrex-S effectively, forcing stacking weaknesses to common Pokemon like Xerneas. It offers very little to teams defensively and can be difficult to justify over similarly fast offensive Pokemon like Marshadow and Mewtwo, which offer similar offensive pressure, but with more defined defensive niches. Weavile also has to rely on Triple Axel's unreliable accuracy for damage output, which is never ideal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wide Lens is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots to make Triple Axel more reliable, but this does make Weavile much weaker to entry hazards. Focus Sash can be used on certain hyper offense builds that are good at preventing opposing hazards from getting up, letting Weavile have a guaranteed turn to set up a Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas does not fear any of Weavile's moves and will OHKO it with Moonblast, and defensive sets can normally stay healthy enough throughout a game to keep Weavile in check with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole's incredible physical bulk and resistance to Dark make it very effective at preventing Weavile from making progress. Buzzwole also threatens to OHKO Weavile in return and has reliable recovery to consistently check it throughout a game.</p> <p><strong>Zamazenta-C</strong>: Zamazenta-C completely shuts down Weavile given how little it takes from all of Weavile's moves.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: While Ho-Oh hates having its item removed, the standard physically defensive set can switch into Weavile and avoid the 2HKO from all of its standard moves. Ho-Oh also threatens to OHKO Weavile while recovering passively throughout the game to do so consistently.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can OHKO Weavile with Body Press and has Iron Barbs to further compromise Weavile's already miserable bulk.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: While uncommon, Toxapex doesn't take much from any of Weavile's moves, removes Weavile's Attack boosts with Haze, and will eventually burn it with Scald. Regenerator and Recover combine to let Toxapex do this consistently throughout a game, too.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Weavile to set up on forced switches and gives the power necessary to OHKO some of the physically bulkier Pokemon seen in Ubers. Without the boost from Swords Dance, Weavile can't break through the natural bulk of some of the best Pokemon in Ubers, which sadly makes it harder to scare Pokemon out for setup chances. Triple Axel, although unreliable, is Weavile's strongest attack and situationally shuts down Focus Sash users like Slurpuff and Substitute users like Zygarde. Knock Off hits most of the Ice-resistant Pokemon that reside in Ubers, most notably hitting Necrozma-DM. It's also useful to clean late-game because of Triple Axel's notoriously low accuracy. Ice Shard lets Weavile pick off some weakened faster Pokemon in the tier, including setup sweepers like Zekrom and Zygarde. Pressure is useful to deplete the PP of common attacks, most notably Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon. Pickpocket can have situational utility after taking Yveltal's Knock Off, but Pressure is often more useful, especially since Pickpocket can give an item Weavile doesn't want like Choice Specs or Choice Scarf. Jolly is normally preferred over Adamant to allow Weavile to outspeed most Eternatus, as well as Speed tying Jolly Marshadow, but Adamant can be used for its extra power.</p> <p>Yveltal provides good pivoting support to get Weavile in, and Weavile can force out Eternatus, the most common Yveltal check. Necrozma-DM can come in on Xerneas repeatedly throughout a game, and it can support Weavile with paralysis or by using Knock Off to help wear down checks like Ferrothorn. Eternatus can pivot in well against Pokemon that can force Weavile out, like Kyogre and Marshadow, and wear down Pokemon like Necrozma-DM into range of Weavile's attacks. Ferrothorn's Spikes helps wear down checks to most wallbreakers in the tier, and it appreciates a teammate that can check Substitute Zygarde variants alongside it.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Beat Up is the main appeal of this set, as it is one of the strongest moves in Ubers. The majority of the tier has high Attack stats, powering up Beat Up immensely and turning Weavile into one of the most terrifying wallbreakers to face. Beat Up can OHKO naturally bulky Pokemon like offensive Kyogre and can almost 2HKO Yveltal thanks to Dark Aura, making it very hard to scout what move Weavile will use. A Jolly nature lets Weavile Speed tie with Jolly Marshadow, a potent revenge killer to Weavile if it's revealed to be Adamant. An Adamant Nature helps secure more Beat Up damage overall, as well as giving Triple Axel a favorable roll to OHKO defensive Groudon after Stealth Rock. It also gives Ice Shard a chance to KO Nasty Plot Calyrex-S that has taken on Yveltal, depending on how much health it recovered from Draining Kiss.</p> <p>Choice Band Weavile has a limited pool of viable teammates, as Beat Up works best with a team consisting of Pokemon with high Attack. Pokemon such as Groudon, Zekrom, Rayquaza, Xerneas, and Landorus-T work very well with it alongside the near-mandatory Necrozma-DM and Yveltal. Landorus-T and slow Yveltal can also slow pivot for momentum to get Weavile in easier. Xerneas also has a base 131 Attack and Aromatherapy, meaning it gives Beat Up a lot of power and insurance if a teammate is statused, which removes its hit from Beat Up.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's niche in Ubers comes from Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap prominent Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. This allows its hard-hitting teammates such as Galarian Darmanitan and Xerneas to break through teams more easily. Though it's good at its job, it still has very big flaws that make it difficult to use. Magnezone's low Speed and mediocre Special Defense mean that many common offensive Pokemon revenge kill it; Eternatus, Kyogre, and Calyrex-S are able to both offensively and defensively check Magnezone. Against teams using different defensive counterplay than Necrozma-DM to the sweepers Magnezone is partnered with, it can end up rather useless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used over Discharge to more easily spread paralysis, and Substitute can be used to block Leech Seed from Ferrothorn. However, they are not as effective due to Discharge's more consistent utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Certain Steel-types</strong>: Shed Shell Necrozma-DM ignores Magnet Pull, making Magnezone’s role useless. Swords Dance variants can potentially break through it due to being faster. Though rare, Zamazenta-C and Heatran both threaten Magnezone with their secondary STAB attacks for big damage. Magearna is also able to pivot out with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Zygarde ignores Magnet Rise and Air Balloon with Thousand Arrows and is able to match boosts with Dragon Dance or Coil. Faster variants of Groudon are able to revenge kill Magnezone even at +6.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Magnezone's mediocre Special Defense and Speed leave it vulnerable to strong special attackers such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre.</p>",

Maximum Speed and Defense investment lets Magnezone outspeed most Necrozma-DM variants and maximizes Body Press damage.</p> <p>With Magnezone removing Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, many offensive teammates are able to slice through the balance teams relying on them. Xerneas is able to clean up late-game and deal with Zygarde. Galarian Darmanitan's Icicle Crash becomes incredibly difficult to switch into for many teams without Necrozma-DM, and its U-turn gives Magnezone free entry into Steel-types. Eternatus appreciates being able to spread Toxic poison without having to worry about immune Steel-types, and it is often also the defensive backbone for the team. Zygarde also benefits from Ferrothorn being removed to get multiple Dragon Dance boosts and sweep late-game.</p>"

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth is one of the few viable sleep inducers in Ubers. The combination of Regenerator, great physical bulk, and a decent defensive typing lets Tangrowth check many physical threats such as Zygarde, Groudon, and Necrozma-DM. As a trade-off, Tangrowth is extremely fragile specially. Its typing leaves it vulnerable to extremely common Ice-, Fire-, and Poison-type attacks, but even neutral special hits can bring it down, such as Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon and Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Also, after putting a foe to sleep, Tangrowth somewhat struggles to be useful, as it's very weak unless it hits super effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used to pressure Dragon Dance Zekrom; it also hits the rare Heatran quite hard on the switch. However, its utility remains relatively low, and it's at the cost of the often superior Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Zarude can use Tangrowth as setup fodder, and Ferrothorn can easily set up Spikes or Iron Defense on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Tangrowth usually checks can use super effective coverage moves. These include Weather Ball Zekrom alongside Groudon, Heat Crash Groudon, and the extremely rare Heat Wave Necrozma-DM.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Despite its great physical bulk, Tangrowth may fall to super effective physical moves after chip damage, such as Icicle Crash from Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile's Triple Axel.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Tangrowth's miserable special bulk, special attackers force it out with ease. While it cannot switch in on a Knock Off, Calyrex-S, in particular, can OHKO Tangrowth with Astral Barrage, use Trick to cripple the incoming check, or use Aromatherapy, which cures a sleep induced by Tangrowth. While it doesn't like to be put to sleep, Eternatus deals a ton of damage to Tangrowth with Flamethrower or Sludge Bomb and doesn't take much from Tangrowth's attacks. Worst of all, Pressure easily depletes Leech Seed's PP, which can leave Tangrowth completely useless against it long-term.</p> <p><strong>Clerics</strong>: Blissey can easily set up Stealth Rock on Tangrowth, and it doesn't care much about sleep thanks to Natural Cure. Xerneas can run Sleep Talk and doesn't take much from Tangrowth's moves, and it either threatens Tangrowth with Moonblast or uses Aromatherapy to cure its sleep. Finally, Calyrex-S can easily OHKO with Astral Barrage. However, Blissey and Calyrex-S don't like to switch in on a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Tangrowth relies a lot on Leech Seed and Sleep Powder to be effective. Behind a Substitute, Geomancy Xerneas and Dragon Dance Zekrom use Tangrowth as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: While it fears Earthquake and doesn't want to be put to sleep, Heatran easily OHKOes Tangrowth with Magma Storm. By forcing Tangrowth out, it is free to set up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's great bulk makes it a decent physical check to many threats in the tier, including Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Zekrom. Sleep Powder is the main asset of this set, as sleep inducers are extremely rare in Ubers. Grass Knot hits the heavy foes found in the tier quite hard, and it gives Tangrowth a good chance to break Zygarde-C's Substitute. Knock Off severely hinders the effectiveness of switch-ins such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Lunala. Leech Seed helps against bulky set-up sweepers like Coil Zygarde and Calm Mind Kyogre while also keeping Tangrowth healthy. It also discourages foes like specially defensive Necrozma-DM and defensive Groudon, which would use Tangrowth as a free opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. If your team has answers to those threats, Synthesis helps Tangrowth check dangerous threats such as Choice Band Marshadow. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves such as Sunsteel Strike from Necrozma-DM and Bolt Strike from Zekrom. Leftovers can be chosen instead for the extra recovery, which ensures Tangrowth is not 2HKOed by a Close Combat from Choice Band Jolly Marshadow.</p> <p>Tangrowth's miserable special bulk makes specially defensive teammates mandatory. Specially defensive Necrozma-DM is a solid blanket check to special attackers and offers Stealth Rock support. Blissey functions similarly, especially helping against Kyogre and Eternatus. Sweepers that take advantage of a sleeping foe like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Dragon Dance Zygarde, and Bulk Up Marshadow make great teammates for Tangrowth. Dragon Dance + Dragon Tail Zygarde and Bulk Up Marshadow are great for beating Ferrothorn and Zarude, which completely wall Tangrowth. Groudon offers sun support, which improves Tangrowth's Synthesis while setting Stealth Rock and exploiting sleeping foes with Swords Dance. In return, Tangrowth walls Marshadow, which forces out Groudon with Spectral Thief. Furthermore, with a boosted Synthesis under the sun, Tangrowth can reliably check Marshadow without being overwhelmed. Finally, clerics stop status from overwhelming Tangrowth in conjunction with heavy wallbreakers like Choice Band Marshadow. The aforementioned Blissey does this well, while Xerneas is another option that is great against mixed attackers such as Draco Meteor Zekrom and Life Orb Draco Meteor Rayquaza.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Froslass is one of the premier entry hazard setters and dedicated leads in the tier. By virtue of its base 110 Speed and access to useful utility moves like Spikes, Taunt, and Destiny Bond, Froslass distinguishes itself as a more viable option than other Spikes setters like Mew and Cloyster. Icy Wind also allows it to slow down faster threats and prevent them from using Defog via Taunt or potentially trade with them via Destiny Bond. However, Froslass’s rather low bulk leaves it vulnerable to being easily KOed. Additionally, Froslass has difficulty defeating common Sticky Web setters on hyper offense teams like Slurpuff and Mental Herb Shuckle. Furthermore, although base 110 Speed is adequate, Calyrex-S outspeeds and can use Substitute in front of Froslass and proceed to cause problems to the hyper offense teams it is commonly utilized on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp can be run over Destiny Bond or Icy Wind if a particular team benefits from it. However in most cases, this is suboptimal. Poltergeist can be used over Icy Wind or Shadow Ball as an option for a stronger attacking move. In this case, a Jolly nature should be utilized instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster offensive threats like Calyrex-S and Weavile can outspeed Froslass and KO it, threatening to sweep the hyper offense teams it is commonly featured on.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Thanks to Sacred Fire, Ho-Oh has a 50% chance of burning Froslass, negating its ability to potentially trade via Destiny Bond, and proceed to remove the entry hazards Froslass has set up with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp can bypass Focus Sash and make Froslass susceptible to being KOed before it gets to lay more than one layer of Spikes. Alternatively, Thunder Wave greatly reduces Froslass's overall effectiveness at setting up entry hazards and trading with a problematic foe.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Entry Hazard Pokemon</strong>: Faster users of Taunt such as Aerodactyl can completely prevent Froslass from setting up Spikes. Magic Coat leads like Slurpuff force mind games and can potentially bounce back Froslass's entry hazards and Taunt, putting its teammates in an extremely disadvantageous position. Furthermore, Magic Bounce users like Xatu can prevent Froslass from setting up Spikes, although it can 2HKO Xatu with Icy Wind.</p>",

Finally, the attacking move of choice comes down to personal preference. In most cases, the speed control that Icy Wind provides offers more benefit and utility to the hyper offense teams that Froslass is commonly run on. However, Shadow Ball can be used over Icy Wind if Magic Bounce users like Xatu are a concern or if Substitute variants of Calyrex-S pose an issue to the team Froslass is being utilized on. Cursed Body could prove situationally useful, especially when facing Choice-locked foes. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature are utilized to guarantee that Froslass outspeeds as many threats as possible while almost always setting up at least one layer of Spikes.</p> <p>As Froslass is commonly featured on hyper offense teams, potential team options include offensive threats like Meteor Beam Eternatus and Zekrom, which pressure and overwhelm the Defoggers commonly found in the tier. Yveltal is another great partner to pair with Froslass, as it has access to Taunt, which can prevent slower Defoggers from removing any entry hazards Froslass set up. Additionally, Froslass can be paired with another entry hazard setter like Slurpuff or a screens setter like Grimmsnarl or Regieleki to form a utility core that allows a variety of setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Geomancy Xerneas, Dragon Dance Zekrom, and Double Dance Groudon to sweep more easily. Air Balloon can be run on any of the aforementioned sweepers if the matchup against Sticky Web teams is a concern. Furthermore, it should be noted that Froslass struggles against leads on Sticky Web teams such as Slurpuff and Mental Herb Shuckle. Thus, pairing Froslass with a fast Rapid Spin user like Pheromosa or Regieleki would greatly benefit the removal of entry hazards and facilitate a potential sweep from one of Froslass's teammates.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W uses Levitate and its solid typing to be a nice defensive answer to strong Pokemon like Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Its main draw over other physically defensive Pokemon, like Giratina, is Volt Switch; this makes it far less passive and enables wallbreaking teammates, as it pivots on walls like Eternatus and Ferrothorn, which resist its STAB moves. Its typing is important for its Ice resistance, as not many Pokemon outside of Necrozma-DM can stand up to Icicle Crash and Triple Axel from Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile, and unlike Necrozma-DM, Rotom-W can take Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire with ease. Rotom-W has low overall bulk and below average attacking stats, though, making it fairly exploitable for any Pokemon its typing and ability don't allow it to counter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-W can run Trick with a Choice Scarf to remove the threat of walls like Eternatus and Ferrothorn. Trick would most often be used instead of Hydro Pump, which leaves Rotom-W unable to touch a Zygarde behind Substitute and makes chipping Groudon difficult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus walls both STAB moves from Rotom-W and is able to recover off burn damage, but it can be used as bait for Volt Switch to bring in another offensive threat.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can use Rotom-W to set up entry hazards, as it has no reliable way to damage Ferrothorn. Long-term damage from Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch can add up, though.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: While immune to Spikes, Rotom-W is heavily hindered if Stealth Rock stays up or if it gets poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon that Rotom-W can normally check like Necrozma-DM can carry Knock Off to limit it heavily, since landing it makes Rotom-W rely solely on Pain Split for recovery. Rotom-W doesn't get to use its Ice resistance as much as desired against Weavile, since it fears Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde-C rarely has its Substitute broken by Hydro Pump from Rotom-W, even with minimal HP investment, allowing it to set up freely most of the time. Thousand Arrows also negates Levitate, Rotom-W's only way of checking most Ground-types. Zygarde can freely set up on Rotom-W lacking Hydro Pump even before transformation.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Giratina ignores everything Rotom-W tries to do, healing off status with Rest and taking almost no damage from Volt Switch thanks to Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Rotom-W's ability to check Pokemon comes mainly from its typing and ability, meaning strong Pokemon that can break past its average bulk are very threatening.

These moves are the main draws of the set and are crucial for Rotom-W as a wall to make up for its lack of offensive stats. Pain Split is necessary for recovery and is a great help in the Ubers tier, where many Pokemon like Eternatus have very high natural HP stats, letting it reliably heal off most damage. Forcing Eternatus to recover off the resulting chip damage is important for momentum, allowing in partners that can exploit a free turn off a Volt Switch like Weavile to come in. Hydro Pump is helpful for dealing with Zygarde trying to set up Substitute before becoming Zygarde-C, as well as chipping Groudon, which takes no damage from burn over time if holding Leftovers. Alternatively, Defog can reliably clear entry hazards against the tier's best Stealth Rock setters, Necrozma-DM and Groudon, allowing for Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan and Rayquaza to shine as partners. However, it makes Rotom-W even more passive.</p> <p>One of Rotom-W's biggest weaknesses is status, with Toxic on Groudon or Necrozma-DM limiting how much it can pivot. It is important to pair Rotom-W with a cleric, such as Calyrex-S, Xerneas, or Blissey, to alleviate this weakness. Xerneas in particular is a good pivot into Dragon-types like Zygarde, and it adds a great Knock Off switch-in so Rotom-W can keep its Leftovers. Baiting in Ferrothorn and Eternatus and using Volt Switch is a fantastic way to get in strong wallbreakers like Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Specs Calyrex-S, which can take advantage of these Pokemon. Kyogre is another strong partner, as it appreciates the chip damage Rotom-W deals to its checks, which lets break through them with Choice Specs- or Calm Mind-boosted attacks more easily.</p>"

Power Gem prevents Ho-Oh from switching in and healing off the damage done by a different move while also doubling as a more accurate attack against Pokemon such as Yveltal and Calyrex-I. Flash Cannon is an acceptable alternative to Power Gem to hit Xerneas on top of granting a spammable STAB option that doesn't weaken over time, as Thunder can deal with Ho-Oh in its place.</p> <p>Dialga fits best on offensive and balanced teams, as it's able to cleave through opposing balances and open up gaping holes for its partners, such as Eternatus, Xerneas, Zekrom and Calyrex-S, to clean up.

However, Palkia's defensive utility ends there, as any status is detrimental to it, and it thus faces heavy competition from Eternatus as a specially bulky Dragon-type.

This allows it to come in on a plethora of bulky Pokemon such as Eternatus, Ho-Oh lacking Earthquake and Xerneas and wear down opposing teams with its strong movepool. Its signature move, Magma Storm, allows Heatran to trap and KO many of the tier's special walls such as Eternatus, Ho-Oh, and Blissey in combination with Taunt. Utility moves like Stealth Rock, Roar, and Toxic can help further break down bulkier teams and allow teammates like Groudon to forgo support moves in favor of more offensive sets. Unfortunately, Heatran's lack of reliable recovery limits the number of teams it can work on and forces it to rely on Leftovers, which makes it extremely vulnerable to the common Knock Off and entry hazards. Its typing also comes with various weaknesses to common attacking types, which requires extensive team support. Finally, Magma Storm's accuracy and low PP make Heatran somewhat unreliable at what niche it does have.</p>",

Eternatus has good defensive synergy with Heatran due to resisting both Water and Fighting. Offensive Pokemon like Kyogre and Xerneas appreciate Heatran's ability to pressure and remove common special walls like Blissey, Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh. Groudon provides sun support and benefits greatly from Heatran carrying Stealth Rock. When lacking Roar, Heatran becomes a liability versus hyper offense, since it is heavily pressured by common Pokemon such as Groudon, Marshadow and Calyrex-S; as such, anti-offense Pokemon like Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, Marshadow, and Heavy-Duty-Boots Eternatus make good teammates.</p>"

However, because it relies on status and doesn't have a reliable recovery move, Giratina is a really passive Pokemon and thus fits only on stall teams. It also faces competition with Lunala as a defensive Ghost-type, which is faster, has reliable recovery with Roost, and has a far superior ability in Shadow Shield, making it a much better check to dangerous setup sweepers like Groudon and Zekrom. Finally, its poor typing makes it weak to commonly used types, namely Fairy, Dark, Dragon, and Ghost.</p>",

In fact, it can even act as a status absorber thanks to its own Pressure, and thus it can keep coming in constantly on Giratina. Finally, the offensive variant can easily set up with Meteor Beam and then OHKO Giratina with a boosted Dynamax Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal's Dark typing, Taunt, and powerful super effective STAB moves heavily threaten Giratina. However, it is put on a timer if afflicted by Toxic and doesn't appreciate Will-O-Wisp, especially when running its physical set. Alternatively, Zarude can use Giratina lacking Roar as setup fodder, using Jungle Healing to heal itself from damage and Giratina's status before tearing it apart with a boosted Darkest Lariat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Other than Eternatus, the many Dragon-types are all threatening for Giratina; this includes both physical and special attackers, including Zekrom, Dracovish, Reshiram, Palkia, and Giratina-O. They can all be crippled by status moves but can in return massively damage Giratina with their STAB Dragon-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Lunala, and Giratina-O severely menace Giratina with their strong STAB Ghost-type moves. While Lunala, Marshadow, and Giratina-O are heavily crippled by status, Calyrex-S isn't thanks to Aromatherapy, and it can cripple Giratina with Trick and a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas can set up with Geomancy without fearing much from Giratina, and then it is able to massively damage the whole team with boosted Moonblast. The defensive sets also fear nothing Giratina can go for, with Rest and Aromatherapy to support itself and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Clerics and Status Absorbers</strong>: Being mostly dependent on residual damage from its status moves, Giratina is greatly hampered by clerics like Clefable and Blissey, the former being able to threaten Giratina with STAB Moonblast.

With its sheer bulk, it can switch into many threats and use Defog without fear of being taken down instantly. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp wear down and cripple many threats Giratina can switch in on, such as Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Necrozma-DM. Burn can annoy common switch-ins like Yveltal and Eternatus, additionally nullifying the latter's Black Sludge recovery. Will-O-Wisp cannot be absorbed by Steel- and Poison-types Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Eternatus, and it especially cripples physical threats like offensive Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Zekrom. Roar can be used to phaze Pokemon that would use Giratina's passiveness to set up, such as Zygarde-C, Kyogre, and Groudon. It can also rack up damage with entry hazard support. Giratina can be a good status sponge thanks to Pressure and Rest. Pressure also depletes the PP of entry hazard moves and forces switches alongside Giratina's status moves and ability to sponge status, giving free momentum to use Defog. You want to keep Giratina healthy as long as possible so it can take many boosted attacks and handle sweepers with either Roar or status.</p> <p>Giratina struggles to work efficiently alone; as a result, it fits on stall teams exclusively. A reliable cleric, such as Blissey or Clefable, is mandatory to not leave it completely useless when it uses Rest. Blissey can switch into many attackers Giratina cannot check or that take advantage of it sleeping, including Eternatus, Xerneas, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Clefable can also absorb status and is a good answer to the Dark-type attackers in the metagame. To take advantage of other stall teams, Eternatus is also a good choice, forming a bulky Pressure core with Giratina to PP stall rapidly. While Giratina is a good Defog user, it can't do much while it is asleep, so it works better with a secondary Defog user. Ho-Oh fits well because it provides an offensive answer to Steel-types, punishes Yveltal, Lunala, and Calyrex-S, and can spread status. It also stays very healthy over a long period even while statused thanks to Regenerator. Due to its crippling Ghost and Dark weaknesses, Giratina fits well with a bulky Dark-type, such as Tyranitar or Yveltal; both can take many attacks from both opposing Yveltal and Calyrex-S. Tyranitar is able to set Stealth Rock and threaten them in return with Rock Blast and Foul Play, and Yveltal can cripple them with Knock Off and be Giratina's secondary Defog user while recovering reliably with Roost. Toxapex is able to provide entry hazards that Giratina can benefit from with Roar while checking Marshadow and Dracovish.</p>"

However, lead Excadrill can almost never set Stealth Rock again if they are cleared, heavily diminishing its value as opposed to bulky entry hazards setters such as Necrozma-DM that can come in several times in a battle. This means that lead Excadrill is limited to hyper offense teams that can punish Defoggers. When not being used as a lead, its mediocre bulk means that careful switching is needed to get it into battle. Furthermore, the limited duration of sand means that it usually can only stay in for a few turns before needing to switch out. Running Sand Rush Excadrill means that you are also required to use Tyranitar on your team, which constrains teambuilding.</p>",

Lunala can easily remove Excadrill's entry hazards with Defog, but it's vulnerable to Toxic. Giratina goes one step further by curing itself from Toxic poison with Rest. Choice Scarf Calyrex-S can use Trick on Excadrill to let a teammate easily clear its Stealth Rock and can revenge kill it even under sand.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth walls Sand Rush Excadrill, KOes it with Earthquake, and can punish Rapid Spin with Rocky Helmet, though it needs to be wary of Toxic. Zarude can also defeat Excadrill through Bulk Up and Power Whip, and it can cure Toxic poison with Jungle Healing. Physically defensive Ferrothorn can take it out with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Groudon, Landorus-T, and Zygarde-C can all withstand a boosted hit from Excadrill and take it out with a Ground-type move.

Rocky Helmet whittles down Excadrill if it tries to spin, letting Skarmory keep Spikes up against it.

The Speed boost also allows Excadrill to threaten Eternatus with Earthquake if it uses Toxic Spikes on the first turn while also dissuading fast threats such as Calyrex-S from coming in. Be careful about spinning on Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet Necrozma-DM, as hazards are not cleared if Excadrill faints from recoil. Rock Tomb 2HKOes Ho-Oh, preventing it from using Defog, while also deterring sweepers from setting up in front of Excadrill. Furthermore, the Speed drop allows a teammate to outspeed the foe, deterring setup such as Geomancy from Xerneas. Earthquake allows Excadrill to dent other leads such as Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, and Ferrothorn while preventing it from being used as setup fodder by Substitute users such as Zekrom and Zygarde-C, whereas Toxic allows Excadrill to pressure bulky Pokemon such as Yveltal with passive damage. Focus Sash guarantees it can take a hit to set Stealth Rock, and Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to ignore the rare Magic Bounce and and hit Giratina-O through Levitate.

For example, Galarian Darmanitan's most common check, Necrozma-DM, is easily OHKOed by Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock with a Jolly nature, or without Stealth Rock with an Adamant nature. Icicle Crash becomes immensely strong, easily 2HKOing defensive Xerneas and Ho-Oh. Earthquake hits Toxapex and Heatran, which otherwise wall this set, as well as 2HKOing defensive Kyogre. U-turn can be used to pivot against foes like Lunala, while Rock Slide OHKOes Ho-Oh. Jolly is preferred for outspeeding base 90 Speed Pokemon with maximum Speed investment like Zekrom as well as most Xerneas and Yveltal variants without fear of being slower. Adamant does provide some notable OHKOs, such as the aforementioned one on Necrozma-DM, as well as guaranteeing that Icicle Crash and Earthquake take out defensive Groudon and Toxapex, respectively, but it heavily relies on paralysis support.</p> <p>The main flaw of this set is that it is extremely hard to bring into battle. Galarian Darmanitan is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all other entry hazards, and it has low defensive stats and a lack of resistances. Critically, without the Speed of Choice Scarf, Galarian Darmanitan can't always take advantage of opportunities to gain momentum from options like Yveltal's U-turn. Thunder Wave Ho-Oh is an excellent teammate for its ability to paralyze Eternatus, letting Yveltal's U-turn bring Galarian Darmanitan in more easily. Furthermore, Ho-Oh is great at preventing Necrozma-DM from keeping Stealth Rock up. Xerneas appreciates that Galarian Darmanitan can OHKO Necrozma-DM, with Geomancy and Choice Scarf sets in particular being able to sweep much more easily. Cosmic Power Eternatus also enjoys Necrozma-DM being gone, and it can take advantage of Kyogre. Eject Pack Eternatus, U-turn Landorus-T, and Teleport Blissey or Solgaleo are additional options that can provide momentum to bring Galarian Darmanitan in safely.</p>"

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<p>Galvantula secures its niche on hyper offense teams as the fastest viable Sticky Web setter, outspeeding key Pokemon such as defensive Eternatus and Palkia while crippling them with a Thunder Wave. Its powerful STAB Thunder allows it to threaten common Defoggers such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh, keeping Sticky Web up as long as it is on the field. However, Galvantula suffers from paltry bulk and middling power. This relegates it to a lead position, having next to no defensive utility. It only fits on dedicated Sticky Web teams, and even then it can face competition from Pokemon such as Slurpuff and Shuckle, with the former having Magic Coat and Misty Explosion, while the latter has Stealth Rock and Sturdy, freeing up its item slot. It also loses to opposing hyper offense leads such as Aerodactyl and Froslass, which can play constant mind games between Taunt and their own entry hazards due to their higher Speed and ways of breaking its Focus Sash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bug Buzz is an option that severely damages Grass-types that would otherwise not care about anything else Galvantula has, OHKOing Tangrowth and Zarude, as well as having the added benefit of going through Substitute. However, this leaves it as setup fodder for Zekrom and Zygarde, two notably dangerous Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon</strong>: Even with Toxic, Galvantula simply lacks ways to threaten Zekrom due to its 4x resistance to Electric and paralysis immunity. Zekrom can easily set up a Substitute and boost up with Dragon Dance before sweeping Galvantula's team. While Eternatus lacks the paralysis immunity of Zekrom, it resists Thunder and is immune to Toxic, so it uses Galvantula as Toxic Spikes fodder or a chance to safely switch in and start wallbreaking. Zygarde-C can easily set up on Galvantula due to its Electric immunity, although Toxic does annoy variants lacking Rest. Rare sights in Dialga and Giratina do not care about Thunder Wave due to running defensive sets and can set up entry hazards or remove Sticky Web with Defog, respectively. Notable Dragon-types that don’t check Galvantula well include Palkia and Rayquaza due to their Electric neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Faster Leads</strong>: Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Froslass can prevent Sticky Web from going up by using Taunt while setting their own entry hazards. Grimmsnarl has Prankster Taunt to also stop Sticky Web. Slurpuff is not faster, nor does it have Taunt, but Magic Coat bounces back Sticky Web, which is detrimental for teams that rely on it to function. All of these Pokemon dislike the possible paralysis chance from Thunder, however, as paralysis prevents them from playing sufficient mind games with Galvantula.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Sticky Web Pokemon</strong>: Defoggers such as defensive Xerneas, Giratina-O, and Lunala all do not take much from a Thunder and can easily remove Sticky Web while breaking Galvantula's Focus Sash, although Lunala is quite annoyed by Toxic. Flying-type wallbreakers such as Landorus-I and offensive Yveltal do not mind Sticky Web, but they don't enjoy switching into Toxic or Thunder, respectively. Excadrill can remove Sticky Web with Rapid Spin and is immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p>",

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is one of the sturdiest walls in the metagame, checking many offensive threats such as Kyogre, Xerneas, Zekrom, and Zygarde, depending on its set. Its fantastic defensive typing gives it multiple resistances to common coverage moves while having minimal weaknesses. Iron Barbs increases the passive damage it dishes out, punishing common contact moves like Sunsteel Strike and U-turn. Its immunity to Leech Seed and Toxic keeps its longevity high. It has great utility moves such as Spikes, Leech Seed, and Knock Off, slowly but effectively chipping down more offensive Pokemon. Spikes, in particular, greatly improves a team's entry hazard game and long-term pressure, especially when paired with ways to shut down Defog such as Taunt Yveltal. This moveset, while effective in its role, is fairly passive overall, though, so certain strong walls such as Ho-Oh, Corviknight, and Eternatus have minimal issues threatening it without taking much damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ferrothorn can run Thunder Wave in place of one of its utility or coverage options. However, the listed options are usually more beneficial, and running Thunder Wave can let Pokemon like Zygarde come in freely. Bullet Seed can be used for Substitute Kyogre. It also has a very high PP count, making it useful in drawn-out games, but its inconsistent power leaves a lot to be desired. Protect can be used to passively gain recovery with Leech Seed and Leftovers; however, this leaves Ferrothorn a sitting duck for one turn, which can be easily capitalized on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Heatran all easily exploit Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to Fire, forcing it to switch. These Pokemon all dislike Knock Off, though, making them inconsistent switch-ins. Dragon-types like Eternatus, Palkia, and Dialga also commonly have Fire-type coverage, allowing them to pressure Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Marshadow, Urshifu-S, and Pheromosa all carry Low Kick or Close Combat, which targets Ferrothorn's weakness to Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight</strong>: Corviknight's Pressure allows it to PP stall Ferrothorn's Spikes, and it can remove them with Defog, while Roost and U-turn let it stick around and use Ferrothorn to gain momentum.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Leech Seed both gives Ferrothorn more recovery and lets it force passive damage onto foes. Spikes is one of its main draws, as it's one of the few viable defensive Spikes users, and the entry hazard is very strong at forcing passive damage. Physically defensive Ferrothorn uses its great typing and Defense-boosting options to wall and set up on a variety of physical wallbreakers that are normally incredibly hard to check. These include Zekrom, Zygarde, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Dracovish, and others. Iron Defense is typically paired with Body Press and a Bold nature, while Curse is used with Knock Off and an Impish nature.</p> <p>This set does not reliably check Kyogre or Xerneas even with its typing, so special walls are greatly appreciated. Eternatus and Palkia provide fast options to complement Ferrothorn's slow playstyle, while Blissey and Shedinja can reliably check both but are very passive. Physically defensive Ferrothorn checking such dangerous physical setup sweepers as Zekrom, Zygarde, and Necrozma-DM makes it a good teammate for Pokemon that struggle against those, like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Tyranitar. Kyogre also appreciates Ferrothorn checking Zekrom, one of the largest offensive threats to it, while Kyogre's rain can possibly let Ferrothorn survive a Fire-type move in a pinch.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Spikes and Leech Seed are required for their incredible utility, but there are multiple options to cover the last moveslots, all of which bring their own benefits. Knock Off is always good for item displacement, especially to help Stealth Rock setters chip prevalent Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh. Power Whip can be used over Knock Off to hit targets like Groudon trying to set up on Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Calm Mind Kyogre, which other checks like Eternatus may not be as effective at beating. Gyro Ball is mostly used to check Xerneas, as well as many Pokemon that may try to set up on it such as Naganadel and Rayquaza; however, it requires a Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs to hit as hard as possible. Curse is great for letting Ferrothorn soft check Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Zekrom and Zygarde.</p> <p>Specially defensive Ferrothorn is vulnerable to most strong physical and Fire-type attacks, so it requires solid support to cover these flaws. Defensive Zygarde is an excellent way to make up for most of these weaknesses, as it can check physical threats such as Urshifu-S, opposing Zygarde, and Marshadow while resisting Fire. Lunala similarly covers multiple physical threats like Groudon and Zygarde and can burn them. Ferrothorn walling some of the tier's largest special threats in Kyogre and Xerneas frees up its teammates. Palkia, in particular, appreciates this, as it can afford to run a much more offensive set because it has help in checking Kyogre. Galarian Darmanitan also likes Ferrothorn reliably switching into defensive Kyogre, which is one of its biggest checks. Ferrothorn's Spikes also helps Galarian Darmanitan break through teams.</p>"

Hydreigon differentiates itself from offensive Eternatus with Nasty Plot, making it a terrifying attacker with very few defensive answers. Sadly, Hydreigon can never be a team's only answer to the threats it checks because of its middling bulk, leading to it stacking weaknesses on teams and competing heavily with Eternatus, which is much more defensively stable. Additionally, Hydreigon is very reliant on Nasty Plot to effectively wallbreak, and it struggles to safely set up because of its poor bulk, its mediocre Speed, and the recoil damage from Life Orb, making it easy to revenge kill too. Lastly, because Draco Meteor harshly drops Hydreigon's Special Attack, Hydreigon cannot repeatedly use its strongest attack and must rely on its teammates to clean up.</p>",

Flash Cannon allows Hydreigon to hit Xerneas and Tyranitar for super effective damage, two Pokemon that otherwise can switch into its STAB combination.

Offensive Yveltal should double up with Hydreigon to better take on Calyrex-S while overwhelming their shared checks in Eternatus, Tyranitar, and Xerneas. Other strong wallbreakers that blow through the opponent's special walls are appreciated. Examples of those include Marshadow and Mewtwo, both of which can effectively deal with Yveltal and Blissey. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can bait in and heavily damage Yveltal and check Eternatus for Hydreigon while also dealing with defensive Xerneas.

Outrage blows past Zygarde prior to Power Construct activating and has a much higher damage output against all targets, but the abundance of Fairy-types in the metagame means Zekrom being locked into it will end with it getting KOed the very next turn.

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability Sheer Force and Life Orb combined with its good Special Attack, Landorus is a potent wallbreaker in the Ubers metagame, being capable of breaking most of the defensive cores and threatening top-tier defensive foes such as Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. Moreover, its coverage can threaten almost every Pokemon in the metagame. Landorus's Speed sets it apart from other wallbreakers, the majority of which have a base Speed between 90 and 100. However, common threats like Marshadow and Calyrex-S outspeed and threaten it. While Landorus's Ground / Flying typing gives it two useful immunities that allow it to switch in on Pokemon like Groudon, its lack of bulk doesn't allow it to switch in often. Overall, Landorus has a unique role in the Ubers metagame, even though it competes with other special attackers like Eternatus and Calyrex-S.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set with three attacks can be used on Landorus, as it can outright sweep a team that doesn't have a Pokemon able to outspeed it. Otherwise, though, Landorus doesn't have the bulk to take a turn to set up. Moreover, due to Landorus's already huge wallbreaking potential, Calm Mind won't help it carry out its role. Rock Polish is also an option to consider, as it allows Landorus to sweep late-game if the opposing team is chipped or is hyper offensive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Calyrex-S, offensive Eternatus, and Marshadow can threaten Landorus, since they're faster than it and Landorus is frail. Moreover, Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre, Palkia, and Galarian Darmanitan can also threaten Landorus, since they all have an attack to hit it super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Thanks to their great typing, these two Pokemon are the only ones that can switch into Landorus and fear nothing. Moreover, Corviknight can use Landorus to recover momentum and Skarmory can set Spikes.</p>",

Rock Slide lets Landorus hit Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal while giving almost perfect neutral coverage alongside Earth Power. Knock Off's main utility is to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon, making it extremely useful to apply pressure with entry hazards. Sludge Wave is an option to prevent Xerneas from using Geomancy in front of Landorus, leaving Xerneas vulnerable to priority or even OHKOing it if Stealth Rock is up. Thanks to the pressure Landorus applies on the opposite team, it can also easily set up Stealth Rock. As far as Superpower is concerned, it allows Landorus to hit special walls like Blissey and Ferrothorn hard. Explosion is a useful option on hyper offense teams with Sticky Web, preventing the foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin. Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil when using Earth Power, Rock Slide, or Sludge Wave. A Naive nature along with maximum investment in Speed allows Landorus to outspeed common base 90 and 100 Speed Pokemon, while maximizing its damage from Rock Slide and Superpower.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates entry hazards being up on the opponent's field to help it wallbreak; therefore, Spikes support from Ferrothorn greatly helps it. Necrozma-DM is a good teammate too if Landorus doesn't have Stealth Rock. Also, Pokemon like Ho-Oh work well with Landorus, since they can switch in on Pokemon that threaten Landorus while also being able to use Defog. Pivots such as Yveltal and Blissey allow Landorus to switch safely onto the field, since it's relatively frail. Paralysis spreaders like Ho-Oh and Xerneas remedy one of the main weaknesses of Landorus: its Speed. Offensive partners such as Marshadow and Calyrex-S appreciate Landorus's ability to remove their checks or their checks' items; in return, they can eliminate faster threats, which Landorus can't handle. Slurpuff is another great partner, setting Sticky Web so that Landorus can outspeed foes such as Eternatus, Marshadow, and non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. In return, Landorus deters Ho-Oh and Yveltal from removing entry hazards with Rock Slide and Explosion, respectively.</p>"

Offensive Swords Dance variants work well on offensive teams, as their EdgeQuake coverage lets them hit most Pokemon in the tier and threaten common Defoggers in Yveltal and Ho-Oh. This set does, however, struggle against many physical walls; Buzzwole, Zygarde, and Kyogre completely invalidate it. Landorus-T can also run Stealth Rock in tandem with Explosion as a lead on hyper offense teams, which gets up Stealth Rock safely and uses Explosion to block Defog and Rapid Spin as well as to let it freely switch out into a teammate.

Furthermore, Necrozma-DM is one of the premier Stealth Rock setters in the metagame and can set up Stealth Rock without much trouble against Kyurem-B, preventing it from finding other opportunities to set up.

The lack of recovery is quite noticeable, though, as Xerneas really likes recovering without having to use Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM is the premier Steel-type in the tier, and one of the best Xerneas checks. Specially defensive sets are able to beat even boosted Xerneas, and physically defensive and offensive sets can live a boosted hit and use Sunsteel Strike for massive damage if not an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Chansey, and Ferrothorn are all very strong checks to Xerneas given its standard moveset lacking coverage for them, chipping it down and removing Geomancy boosts with Blissey and Chansey's Confide. Defensive Xerneas also is completely unable to break through these Pokemon, allowing them to easily take advantage of it.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: With offensive Xerneas's reliance on Geomancy for breaking many common defensive Pokemon, phazing effectively neutralizes it as a threat. Ho-Oh is the best at this role, with Lunala and Lugia also having the potential to stop its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Xerneas can only hit Shedinja with extremely niche moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Power Herb Xerneas is a very dangerous sweeper, using its high Special Attack and Fairy Aura-boosted Moonblast to sweep teams after a Geomancy. Thunder is useful coverage for foes that shrug off Moonblast, most importantly Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM. Substitute, Ingrain, and Aromatherapy are all very good support moves to complement the rest of its moveset. Substitute blocks potentially deadly status and lets Xerneas take any hit that could normally KO it, Ingrain prevents phazing and gives slight passive recovery—which can be crucial in the Ho-Oh matchup, and Aromatherapy clears status for Xerneas and its team, which is always beneficial with those being very common on Pokemon such as Eternatus and Necrozma-DM. 88 Speed EVs outrun Adamant Necrozma-DM with maximum Speed investment, as well as Jolly Marshadow if Xerneas switched into Sticky Web before using Geomancy. Leftover EVs go into Defense instead of HP because Geomancy already makes Xerneas very specially bulky.</p> <p>Strong special walls and Moonblast-resistant foes are some of the hardest obstacles for Xerneas. Physically offensive Yveltal with Taunt and Knock Off can support it on hyper offense teams, pressuring Blissey, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the latter as to greatly hurt its longevity against Xerneas. Xerneas's incredible offensive presence lets it function well with a multitude of breakers to form a strong offensive core. Groudon and Zekrom add physically offensive pressure to complement Xerneas's special offense. Zygarde and Lunala are commonly used to check Groudon, which Xerneas can pressure, and Lunala and Necrozma-DM are common checks to Zekrom, which Zekrom and Xerneas can both work to overwhelm. Strong special lures on bulkier teams can assist Xerneas in sweeping also, working to overwhelm certain checks; Choice Specs Power Gem Dialga and Trick Calyrex-S can bait in and break down Ho-Oh, giving Xerneas a much easier time sweeping.</p>"

        "description": "<p>RestTalk with Moonblast gives defensive Xerneas both the longevity and the ability to pressure certain offensive Pokemon that it needs to, letting it much more reliably beat targets like Zekrom, Marshadow, and Zygarde. Aromatherapy is amazing, as Sleep Talk can select it to wake Xerneas up early, while Defog is always welcome for entry hazard control, even though Xerneas loses to common hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave can sometimes be crucial for slowing down fast offensive threats. 252 Defense EVs lets Xerneas handle its main targets, with Leftovers for even more healing against them.</p> <p>Defensive Xerneas struggles to break through a lot of common defensive Pokemon, meaning it requires a good amount of offensive presence to support its passiveness. Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Blissey can all easily wall it, making Pokemon such as Zekrom, Dragon Dance Zygarde, and Marshadow incredible offensive partners to pressure these checks that also benefit from Aromatherapy. Xerneas also can't check a lot of Pokemon by itself, with threats such as Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-S being incredibly scary to face. Other defensive pivots that cover these Pokemon, most notably Yveltal and Ho-Oh, are greatly appreciated. Xerneas checking such dangerous threats as Zekrom and Zygarde is greatly appreciated by many defensive and offensive Pokemon alike weak to them. Ferrothorn can afford to run a specially defensive set to check Kyogre, since it doesn't have to work on beating those two Dragon-types, and Necrozma-DM is freed up a lot from not having to check Zekrom, so it can instead run a specially defensive set to cover bigger threats to it and Xerneas such as offensive Eternatus.</p>"

It can outspeed two of the most common Choice Scarf users in Kyogre and Galarian Darmanitan, as well as fast offensive threats such as Calyrex-S, Eternatus, Marshadow, Mewtwo, and +1 Zygarde, Zekrom, and Rayquaza. Thunder lets Xerneas deal decent damage to Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM. Focus Blast can be run instead to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran harder. Thunder Wave can provide good utility to deal with the two aforementioned foes, giving ample opportunities for Xerneas's teammates to deal with them. Aromatherapy provides cleric support to offensive teams that Choice Scarf Xerneas fits in. Defog is an option over Thunder Wave if entry hazard removal is paramount and helps against Sticky Web teams, further enhancing Choice Scarf Xerneas's anti-offense capabilities.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Xerneas is mostly found on offense. U-turn Yveltal can bring it in safely against threats such as Marshadow and Urshifu-S and answer Calyrex-S. Groudon is a great teammate that can either set Stealth Rock or beat Steel-types that Xerneas struggles to break past, such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn; it also threatens Ho-Oh with Stone Edge. Kyogre can force Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh out and make Xerneas's Thunder 100% accurate by setting rain. Strong wallbreakers such as Dragon Dance Zekrom and Rayquaza, Meteor Beam Eternatus, Marshadow, and Swords Dance Weavile allow Xerneas to sweep. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is another fantastic partner, checking opposing Geomancy Xerneas and luring in and removing Ho-Oh with Stone Edge.</p>"

  "Yveltal": {
    "overview": "<p>Yveltal is the most used Pokemon in SS Ubers and an essential part of the metagame. It is by far the most reliable check to Calyrex-S, with Calyrex-S having to rely on Trick, status, and passive damage to defeat it. It is the most common Defogger in a metagame sorely lacking them, and Yveltal's Knock Off limits switch-ins to the point that most teams have a dedicated Knock Off switch-in just for it. Utility options such as U-turn and Taunt give fantastic momentum, and Yveltal has useful revenge killing options in Choice Scarf sets, Sucker Punch, and Foul Play. Additionally, the right team support frees Yveltal up to use one of its devastating offensive sets; boosted by Hone Claws or Choice Band in addition to Dark Aura, Knock Off becomes a terrifying move to switch into. Overall, nearly every serious team should strongly consider having Yveltal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Oblivion Wing can be used on either the Specially Defensive or the Fast Utility set to let Yveltal lure in and KO Buzzwole or Tangrowth. An offensive set consisting of Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and U-turn with Black Glasses is an option in between the Specially Defensive and Hone Claws sets, but generally you are better off just using one of those two sets. Block can be used to trap opposing Pokemon to Toxic stall, such as opposing Yveltal. However, this is unreliable due to many Yveltal running U-turn or Taunt. Items such as Iron Ball can turn the tables on Calyrex-S using Trick, but these are gimmick options that are inferior to Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus is the most common Knock Off switch-in in the metagame, and it usually has little to fear from Yveltal. Offensive sets can KO many Eternatus, but physically defensive Eternatus has little issue walling even these sets.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Defensive Xerneas has little to fear from nearly all of Yveltal's options. Geomancy Xerneas cannot switch in recklessly, lest it lose its Power Herb, but it can otherwise easily force Yveltal out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Absorbers</strong>: Buzzwole, Zamazenta-C, and Tangrowth can take Knock Off very well and wall any Yveltal set lacking Flying-type coverage. Zarude can wall sets that lack U-turn or a Flying-type move. Toxapex can typically wall most Yveltal and stay healthy with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage</strong>: Paralysis, poison, burn, and Stealth Rock all significantly limit Yveltal's ability to check Calyrex-S and other threats.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Yveltal</strong>: The more defensive Yveltal sets can beat the offensive Yveltal sets with the right moves, such as Toxic and Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Tanks</strong>: While none of them love switching into Knock Off, Pokemon such as Zygarde, Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Zekrom can threaten Yveltal significantly with their strong physical attacks or status moves. Sets such as Bulk Up Groudon and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can take advantage of teams that rely on Foul Play Yveltal to check them.</p>",

      "Fast Utility": {
        "description": "<p>This set puts a great focus on Speed while still switching into Calyrex-S relatively well thanks to its Special Defense investment. The Speed investment allows Yveltal to check certain threats it wouldn't be able to otherwise, as well as more viably run some useful utility options. Knock Off is a strong attack and provides nice team support. Foul Play allows Yveltal to revenge kill Pokemon such as Groudon and Rayquaza, and it will do massive damage even to uninvested Necrozma-DM sets. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Eternatus from gaining momentum against Yveltal, and it is generally useful against stall and bulky teams. Taunt is also good against SubSeed Calyrex-S sets, provided they don't get the chance to boost too much with Nasty Plot. Toxic is a great move to catch an opposing Yveltal or Buzzwole off guard, making Yveltal a good check to opposing offensive Yveltal. This set is a fantastic user of Defog, and it's especially useful against Sticky Web teams, outspeeding Pokemon such as Kyogre and Xerneas. Roost provides reliable recovery, and it removing Yveltal's Flying typing can come in handy against Groudon. Heavy-Duty Boots is mandatory to make Yveltal a reliable user of Defog. Jolly is the preferred nature if you are running Knock Off; otherwise, run Timid. An alternative EV spread for either nature is 72 HP / 252 SpD / 184 Spe to have more bulk and still outspeed fully invested base 90 Speed Pokemon. If you desire even more bulk, use a Careful nature instead, and Yveltal will still outspeed neutral nature base 90 Speed Pokemon. With these EVs, U-turn becomes a viable option in the second moveslot.</p> <p>Compared to a more defensive set, the Speed investment is great for using Defog against Sticky Web teams, as Yveltal is immune to Sticky Web, but the lost bulk means it is unable to check Focus Sash Nasty Plot Calyrex-S. In general, Foul Play, Taunt, and Toxic all function much better when Yveltal has Speed investment. Foul Play allows you to have more security against Groudon and Necrozma-DM, which is especially appreciated for teammates such as Zygarde, which may get pressured by Swords Dance sets of both. Ho-Oh makes a good teammate, as it provides a backup check to Calyrex-S while also bringing Defog support. This allows Yveltal to run Taunt and Toxic together, making for a very effective stallbreaker. Necrozma-DM can switch into the Eternatus this set will attract. Groudon, Zygarde, and Zekrom are good teammates that can pivot into opposing Necrozma-DM without fear of paralysis. Blissey functions as a solid secondary check to Calyrex-S, including SubSeed sets, and it can also provide much-appreciated cleric and status support.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is Yveltal's bulkiest set, giving it the most flexibility to deal with Choice Specs and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S. Knock Off is Yveltal's most reliable STAB attack, and it provides fantastic team support. U-turn is a great option to gain momentum against Pokemon like Eternatus, Buzzwole, Zarude, and Tangrowth, which are commonly used to take Knock Off and wall Yveltal. U-turn works well with this set's nonexistent Speed investment, giving you advantageous switches more often. Snarl guarantees that Yveltal will beat all SubSeed Calyrex-S sets. It also is useful against Calm Mind Kyogre when paired with Mystical Fire Eternatus. Sucker Punch can be run to make Yveltal a decent revenge killer, which is greatly appreciated on teams that would otherwise lack a Choice Scarf or priority user. Defog provides invaluable team support, and on many teams, Yveltal is the only viable user of it. If you happen to be running another Defog user such as Ho-Oh, Sucker Punch could be run instead. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Yveltal will take no damage from Stealth Rock. The HP and Special Defense investment prevents Nasty Plot Calyrex-S from 2HKOing Yveltal with Draining Kiss or Choice Specs Calyrex-S from 3HKOing it with Astral Barrage. 72 Defense EVs are useful for pivoting on Marshadow, preventing Life Orb-boosted Poltergeist followed by Rock Tomb from KOing Yveltal. If you are running U-turn, 248 HP / 72 Atk / 188 SpD can be run for a chance to break SubSeed Calyrex-S's Substitute with one U-turn. Even more Attack investment could be used: invested U-turn, in combination with a revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Calyrex-S or Shadow Sneak Marshadow, can form an adequate defense against SubSeed Calyrex-S. If Marshadow and SubSeed Calyrex-S are not of concern, Yveltal can use maximum Special Defense investment.</p> <p>This Yveltal will fit on any team archetype outside of hyper offense. While this set counters Calyrex-S, you must be careful about keeping Yveltal healthy. Status effects and Stealth Rock damage, if Yveltal loses its item, can potentially whittle it down enough for Calyrex-S to power through. Additionally, Yveltal receiving a Choice item through Trick can easily force you into dangerous situations. For example, if Yveltal faces Calyrex-S and needs to use Roost to check it the next time it comes in, the opponent can predict that, stay in, and use Nasty Plot. For teammates, Eternatus and Necrozma-DM form the classic core of SS Ubers with Yveltal. Eternatus checks Kyogre, absorbs Knock Off and Toxic, and can even be a backup check to Calyrex-S thanks to its special bulk and Pressure. Necrozma-DM checks the Ice-types, Eternatus, and Xerneas that will force Yveltal out, and it provides status and entry hazard support. Checks to Ground-types, such as Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Zarude, synergize very well with the aforementioned Pokemon, giving your team checks to the vast majority of threats in the metagame. Ho-Oh can provide its own Defog support to free up Yveltal's third moveslot; Ho-Oh also has an excellent matchup against Necrozma-DM, which is the most common Stealth Rock setter in the metagame and can often cripple Yveltal for using Defog on it thanks to Thunder Wave and Iron Head. Other helpful Necrozma-DM switch-ins are Groudon, Zygarde, Zekrom, and Kyogre. Marshadow and Calyrex-S are good revenge killers, and they pair particularly well with U-turn Yveltal as insurance against SubSeed Calyrex-S; Calyrex-S may also provide Aromatherapy support, as can Blissey, which can be critical to keeping opposing Calyrex-S at bay if Yveltal gets poisoned or paralyzed.</p>"

      "Hone Claws": {
        "description": "<p>With Hone Claws raising its Attack, Yveltal becomes a devastating wallbreaker. At +1, a Dark Aura-boosted Knock Off is something that almost no Pokemon will like switching into. The most common Knock Off switch-in in the metagame, Eternatus, has a 93.8% chance to be OHKOed by a +1 Life Orb-boosted Knock Off. Sucker Punch provides an invaluable priority option, letting Yveltal still check Calyrex-S in a pinch. Acrobatics hits Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Zarude super effectively. In addition, it becomes very strong if Yveltal takes a Knock Off. An alternative option is Roost, which will greatly boost this set's longevity at the cost of coverage. The given Speed EVs beat fully-invested neutral nature base 90 Pokemon such as Kyogre, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Special Defense to better take hits from Calyrex-S. Life Orb will give Yveltal the most power, making +1 Knock Off on Eternatus a much more favorable roll to OHKO. Black Glasses is an alternative option that still makes Yveltal's Dark-type attacks hit incredibly hard while maintaining much more bulk over time.</p> <p>This set can fit on much fewer teams than most defensive sets due to it not reliably checking Calyrex-S. Therefore, alternative checks to Calyrex-S are a must as teammates. Zarude checks not only Calyrex-S but also Groudon and Zygarde, both of which can check this Yveltal set. Ho-Oh is useful for providing Defog support, which this set lacks, and also for pivoting Calyrex-S and Xerneas. Both aforementioned teammates appreciate Yveltal being able to lure and KO Eternatus. Blissey provides another Calyrex-S check as well as its valuable Aromatherapy and Wish support. For Black Glasses sets, Tyranitar has nice synergy, as the damage from sand can put Eternatus into OHKO range of a +1 Knock Off. Additionally, sand hindering Yveltal's ability to check Calyrex-S is not a problem because Tyranitar checks it much more safely. Xatu can be used to prevent Stealth Rock from being laid on the field.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This Yveltal set is seen most commonly on hyper offense builds, as these teams otherwise have trouble dealing with Calyrex-S. Therefore, it's designed to keep up offensive momentum. By focusing mostly on Special Attack, Yveltal can use its powerful Oblivion Wing to heal and attack at the same time, minimizing the effect of Life Orb recoil. Taunt prevents opposing Yveltal and Ho-Oh from using Defog, keeping Sticky Web or other entry hazards up. Sucker Punch provides Yveltal with a strong physical attack, and its priority is very useful for keeping Calyrex-S at bay. Rock Slide is an alternative option for Yveltal to lure Ho-Oh into taking a Dark Pulse before KOing it. Rock Slide is also useful against opposing Yveltal. The given EV spread and nature let Yveltal outspeed and use Taunt against most opposing Yveltal.</p> <p>This Yveltal is a mainstay of hyper offense teams, so it will work great with suicide leads such as Slurpuff, Froslass, Galvantula, Shuckle, and Aerodactyl. Necrozma-DM makes a fantastic partner, as it switches into Eternatus and Xerneas, which wall Yveltal. Offensive Eternatus and Naganadel can absorb Toxic Spikes, which can be very threatening to hyper offense teams, and they also appreciate Yveltal KOing Ho-Oh with Rock Slide. Strong wallbreakers such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Marshadow are great teammates for putting the pressure on bulky teams. Additional Calyrex-S checks are appreciated, especially if you drop Sucker Punch. Marshadow, Urshifu-S, Grimmsnarl, and Hydreigon work well for this role.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Yveltal makes for a decent revenge killer while also providing some powerful and unique utility. For one, it provides quite possibly the most airtight defense against Sticky Web teams, as it is immune to the entry hazard and can use Defog without fear of being hit by Taunt. Secondly, Yveltal doesn't fear Trick from Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Foul Play is a strong STAB option, letting Yveltal revenge kill Zekrom, Groudon, Marshadow, offensive Necrozma-DM, and Calyrex-S with ease. Thanks to Foul Play, Yveltal has the luxury of investing into its bulk instead of its attacking stats. While Roost syncs poorly with Choice Scarf, Yveltal often forces out Calyrex-S, giving it ample opportunities to heal off residual damage. Oblivion Wing is a less passive healing option that has the bonus of letting Yveltal lure in and KO common switch-ins such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth. However, its healing will be much less consistent. U-turn is a great option to gain momentum from obvious switches to Pokemon such as Eternatus and Xerneas, while Knock Off provides utility in removing items and is a secondary STAB option against Pokemon that take minimal damage from Foul Play such as Blissey. Finally, Defog ruins Sticky Web and other hyper offense teams that rely on entry hazards. The given EVs let Yveltal outspeed +1 positive nature base 90 Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Zekrom. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Special Defense to better handle Calyrex-S. Hasty should be chosen if you are running Oblivion Wing; otherwise, use Jolly.</p> <p>This Yveltal fits best on teams that lack a revenge killer, like Choice Scarf Calyrex-S or Shadow Sneak Marshadow, or want to win the Sticky Web matchup. Ho-Oh is a near-mandatory partner, as this Yveltal lacks Heavy-Duty Boots and thus cannot consistently use Defog against Stealth Rock users. Necrozma-DM and Blissey can both switch into Eternatus and Xerneas while providing Stealth Rock and paralysis support. Blissey can also function as a cleric and Wish passer. A Knock Off switch-in such as Eternatus, Buzzwole, Tangrowth, or Zarude is needed, as this set loses all revenge killing capability without Choice Scarf.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is found almost exclusively on hyper offense teams as a way to check Calyrex-S and prevent Defog with a fast Taunt. Knock Off comfortably 2HKOes the vast majority of Eternatus sets and prevents them from recovering HP with Taunt. Since this set only uses Dark-type moves, Black Glasses is usually chosen to prevent Life Orb's recoil. Life Orb can have situational usefulness, such as allowing Yveltal to OHKO offensive Kyogre sets after Stealth Rock chip and almost always OHKO Marshadow. Maximum Speed investment is used to have the greatest chance of landing Taunt on opposing Yveltal, while 68 Special Defense EVs prevent a 2HKO from Choice Specs-boosted Astral Barrage.</p> <p>This set allows Yveltal to put much more pressure on Eternatus than a special set would, which is great for teammates like Rayquaza, Marshadow, Mewtwo, and Weavile, which can be threatened by a faster Eternatus. However, it comes at the cost of coverage. Lacking Oblivion Wing or Rock Slide means Yveltal can't punish opposing Yveltal well should they win the Speed tie and get a Defog off, while Ho-Oh can play mind games between using Sacred Fire or Defog. Thus, this set tends to be used more with Aerodactyl, Excadrill, and Froslass leads, since losing their entry hazards tends to not be as critical as it would be for a Sticky Web team. Since Xerneas easily comes in on this set, Necrozma-DM is a highly recommended teammate, and it also provides useful security against Galarian Darmanitan. Buzzwole walls this set, so teammates such as Meteor Beam Eternatus and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S work well with it. Eternatus as well as Zekrom are appreciated for being able to switch into Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire.</p>"

It 2HKOes all Eternatus except physically defensive sets on the switch, preventing it from absorbing Knock Off, which means Yveltal can very effectively get rid of items on the opposing team. Dual Wingbeat is a strong secondary STAB option that will demolish typical walls to Yveltal such as Zarude, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. Notably, it makes this Yveltal able to check SubSeed Calyrex-S. U-turn becomes quite a strong momentum option should this set be successful in KOing Eternatus. An alternative is Roost, which lets this set check Calyrex-S much more reliably. Sucker Punch becomes an incredibly powerful revenge killing option when boosted by both Choice Band and Dark Aura. As a bonus, Choice Band gives Calyrex-S one of its worst possible items should it decide to use Trick. The given Speed investment is used to beat either neutral or positive nature base 90 Speed Pokemon with full Speed investment, depending on Yveltal's nature. Should specially defensive Eternatus successfully heal after losing its item, Adamant Yveltal will still always 2HKO with Knock Off despite the power drop, while Jolly only gives a 53% chance to. However, Jolly is useful for Yveltal to outspeed positive nature base 90 Pokemon such as Zekrom and Choice Specs Kyogre.</p> <p>This Yveltal needs quite a bit of team support to function properly. Ho-Oh is greatly appreciated for providing Defog and checking Calyrex-S and Xerneas. Blissey is another Calyrex-S check that can provide entry hazard, paralysis, cleric, and Wish support. Pokemon that love Eternatus being gone or heavily damaged, such as Marshadow, Buzzwole, and Zarude, are synergistic teammates. Marshadow and Zarude can act as secondary checks to Calyrex-S, and Zarude and Buzzwole can deal with defensive Ground-types like Groudon, Zygarde, and Landorus-T.

Activating Power Construct and its massive base HP boost, alongside great physical bulk, allows it to check potent wallbreakers such as Marshadow without the need for a type advantage or move prediction. However, its typing is a double-edged sword, as it makes it weak to the very common Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type moves that most Pokemon run in Ubers. Prior to Power Construct activating, its bulk isn't amazing and can thus be dealt with rather quickly by a strong attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with both Thousand Waves and Thousand Arrows and Dragon Dance can be run to trap passive Pokemon and not rely on Scale Shot to beat Ho-Oh one-on-one, but it requires more setup and traps a narrower list of Pokemon, so it's not as common. Sleep Talk on the Coil set is an option to not leave Zygarde completely useless while it's asleep, but the utility Glare provides is far too much to let go of. Dragon Tail on the Coil set can remove opposing setup sweepers that might try to use Substitute to dodge the paralysis from Glare, but it comes at the cost of having less chances to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas has the ability to come in on Zygarde and immediately threaten it with Moonblast, but it does not have any reliable form of recovery, so it has to be wary of switching into Thousand Arrows too much.</p> <p><strong>Other Dragon-types</strong>: Most Dragon-types in the metagame that aren't weak to Ground can switch in to sponge a hit and immediately threaten to OHKO Zygarde with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Shedinja can switch into any attack Zygarde runs and set up with Swords Dance or status it, but it must be cautious of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite it having great physical bulk, Zygarde's special bulk isn't up to par, especially prior to reaching its Complete forme, and it must thus be wary of powerful special attacks thrown its way. Kyogre and Yveltal can easily overwhelm it with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Lunala can safely come in on all Zygarde sets and phaze, often making it take entry hazard damage upon switching back in or leaving it low on health after it uses Substitute. They do not, however, enjoy getting statused by either Glare or Toxic. Opposing Zygarde that carry Dragon Tail can also phaze if your Zygarde isn't running the move.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls that do not rely on their Speed to beat Zygarde such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Kyogre can come in, break Zygarde's Substitute, and threaten it with strong attacks.</p>",

Substitute is extremely valuable to Zygarde, as it inherently wishes to get below 50% as quickly and safely as possible so that Power Construct triggers. Glare gives you more chances to set up a Substitute and boost with Dragon Dance. Toxic is the only tool Zygarde has to hit Shedinja, a Pokemon that otherwise blanket walls it. It also limits the longevity of the opponent's physically defensive walls. Dragon Tail guarantees Zygarde doesn't get phazed, as it's faster than every phazer in the metagame after just a single Dragon Dance, while also doing a fair bit of damage. 16 HP and 36 Defense EVs with an Impish nature guarantee that Zygarde-C's Substitute does not break from uninvested Ho-Oh's Brave Bird or Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike. 232 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed maximum Speed Eternatus and Mewtwo after a boost.</p> <p>Zygarde struggles in front of Fairy- and Ice-type coverage and, as such, appreciates Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, which can also provide Stealth Rock support. In return, Zygarde takes on the Fire-type attacks thrown their way. Ferrothorn sets Spikes, letting Thousand Arrows OHKO bulky Eternatus with one layer and Stealth Rock, while absorbing attacks from Kyogre, one of Zygarde's biggest checks. Toxic Spikes support is much appreciated, limiting the longevity of checks such as Tangrowth, opposing Zygarde, and defensive Kyogre, especially with Dragon Tail forcing the opponent into potentially unfavorable positions. Eternatus can set it up consistently while also absorbing it from your side, leaving Zygarde a clear pathway to switch in. Zygarde, in turn, is a switch-in to the Ground-type moves thrown Eternatus's way. Cleric support from Xerneas or Blissey is also appreciated, as Toxic and status from moves such as Sacred Fire can sometimes catch Zygarde off guard. Secondary setup sweepers like Swords Dance Groudon appreciate Zygarde weakening physical walls so that they can pick them off in case Zygarde falters.</p>"

Once Zygarde has fully boosted with Coil, use Scale Shot to raise its Speed and limit revenge killing options. Rest maximizes the opportunities for it to max out on boosts. 220 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Zygarde at +6 to OHKO defensive Kyogre with Thousand Waves and defensive Ho-Oh with a four-hit Scale Shot. 96 Speed EVs allow Zygarde-C at +2 Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf positive nature base 90 Pokemon, notably Kyogre, which can OHKO with Ice Beam. 80 HP EVs make Leftovers efficient.</p> <p>The team support this Zygarde appreciates overlaps greatly with that of other offensive boosting sets. Entry hazard setters allow Zygarde to blow through teams when the conditions for it to trap something aren't ideal. Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma-DM and Spikes setters like Ferrothorn appreciate Zygarde removing the likes of Eternatus and Ho-Oh, and they provide protection from Fairy-type attacks. Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kyogre and Xerneas pave the way for Zygarde to try and sweep by softening foes.</p>"

However, Toxapex is very passive, letting many common threats such as Calyrex-S, Zekrom, and Groudon switch in for free when it uses Recover or Haze. It also faces rough competition as a status spreader with Eternatus, which actually has an offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Block and Spite lets Toxapex lure in and PP stall passive switch-ins such as defensive variants of Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, and Yveltal lacking U-turn and Taunt. However, its utility against offensive teams is really low. Baneful Bunker punishes direct contact from many physical attackers that can 2HKO or OHKO Toxapex, including Ho-Oh, Dracovish, and Zekrom. However, it is more prediction reliant than Toxic and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Strong Psychic-types like Mewtwo, Calyrex-S, and Lunala heavily threaten Toxapex, though they must be wary of switching into Knock Off and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: With great bulk, immunity to Toxic, and a high Special Attack, Eternatus is a threat for Toxapex. It doesn't mind losing its item and is able to PP stall Toxapex thanks to Pressure. Finally, Eternatus can absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Even though they don't want to switch in and get statused, both Groudon and Zygarde-C are top threats for Toxapex. They can both attempt to set up with Bulk Up, Dragon Dance, or Coil. Both Landorus and Landorus-T can force Toxapex out with either Earthquake or Earth Power, and both can set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Toxapex can be overwhelmed quickly if Pokemon like Kyogre, Xerneas, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh predict it switching in and land coverage moves like Thunder and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Setup Special Attackers</strong>: Despite its high Special Defense, Toxapex struggles at absorbing boosted strong special attacks. Offensive variants of Eternatus can use Meteor Beam on the switch and threaten to 2HKO with Dynamax Cannon. Meanwhile, Xerneas can use Toxapex as setup fodder with Substitute and does massive damage with a boosted Thunder, though these variants have to be wary of Haze.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Yveltal can severely hinder Toxapex, leaving it unable to threaten foes with Toxic; specially-oriented Yveltal in particular can easily heal off any damage dealt by Toxapex with Oblivion Wing.</p>",

Toxic and Toxic Spikes are, admittedly passive, ways to better deal with Dracovish and Ho-Oh and cripple switch-ins such as Zekrom, Zygarde-C, and Giratina. The two can be used together, with Toxic punishing opposing threats that would switch in anticipation of Toxic Spikes, such as Zekrom, Groudon, and Kyogre. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item to punish most attacks from physical attackers such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, Dracovish's Fishious Rend, Ho-Oh's Brave Bird, and Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike. Black Sludge can be used to give Toxapex better longevity, notably reducing the chance that Dracovish's Fishious Rend 2HKOes it.</p> <p>Blissey and Chansey offer solid answers to special attackers like Xerneas, which Toxapex cannot handle.

Bulky Dark-types can check Psychic-types like Calyrex-S and Mewtwo. Yveltal provides Defog and Knock Off, and Knock Off can remove Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots to increase the effectiveness of Toxic Spikes, while Tyranitar offers Stealth Rock support. Both formes of Giratina are great teammates with Toxapex. Giratina can phaze dangerous setup sweepers like Zekrom and Zygarde-C, which Toxapex cannot handle alone; Giratina-O benefits from Toxapex spreading status thanks to Hex, has no trouble switching into Groudon thanks to Levitate, and offensively checks Calyrex-S with Shadow Sneak.

Misty Surge is highly appreciated by teammates like Groudon that do not want to be affected by status conditions and prevents Zygarde and Xerneas from using Rest. However, Tapu Fini's poor Speed and damage output mean that it does not have a good matchup against the more dangerous offensive staples like Calyrex-S, Groudon, and Kyogre.

Moonblast helps Tapu Fini defensively check Zygarde, Yveltal, and Marshadow, although its lack of reliable recovery means it cannot do so consistently throughout a game. The lack of reliable recovery also means it can only normally trap one Pokemon per game, as it will normally take significant damage in the process. 56 Speed EVs guarantee that Tapu Fini will outspeed Calyrex-I and paralyzed Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Tapu Fini partners best with offensive wallbreakers that appreciate its Misty Surge and trapping capabilities. Kyogre in particular appreciates Misty Surge both halving Eternatus's damage output with Dynamax Cannon and Draco Meteor and making Toxic fail, allowing it to potentially set up on Eternatus.

Marshadow and offensive Ho-Oh enjoy Tapu Fini preventing Zygarde, as well as other defensive Pokemon like Xerneas, Giratina, and Kyogre, from recovering with Rest. Galarian Darmanitan appreciates Tapu Fini potentially trapping Necrozma-DM and not having to fear paralysis. Galarian Darmanitan can also bring Tapu Fini onto the field frequently with U-turn, giving Tapu Fini an easier time trapping its targets. Heatran can be used alongside Tapu Fini to trap a wider range of Pokemon, including all defensive Eternatus sets.

Solgaleo has a niche on defensive teams for its ability to use Teleport to pivot against Magnezone, making it not lose to Xerneas teams with Magnezone, and it partners well with Kyogre and Marshadow thanks to Future Sight helping them break through their checks, most notably Eternatus.</p>",

Kyogre, most notably Choice Scarf variants, really appreciates Future Sight support helping it break past Eternatus. Frailer wallbreakers, like Marshadow, Dracovish, and Rayquaza appreciate Solgaleo bringing them in safely and the additional damage that Future Sight provides on their checks.

  "Lunala": {
    "overview": "<p>Lunala is a mainstay defensive Pokemon often paired with the classic core of Yveltal, Eternatus, and Necrozma-DM, forming a defensive backbone that is very difficult to break. Its typing may look terrible, compounding weaknesses to Calyrex-S and Marshadow; however, it provides two immunities and a neutrality to most types. These defensive traits, Shadow Shield, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Roost let Lunala blanket check some of the most dangerous threats in the tier, such as Fire-type move Groudon, Zygarde-C, Zekrom, offensive Necrozma-DM, Rayquaza, and Mewtwo. Lunala excels in long games, where its unmatched reliability in checking strong threats gives it a unique niche. Shadow Shield also makes it a \"get out of jail free\" card, even stopping a Geomancy Xerneas sweep in an emergency. Lunala can also opt for a more offensive set that surprises common switch-ins like Yveltal with Meteor Beam while still offering defensive utility. However, Lunala's reliance on constantly using Roost to maintain Shadow Shield makes it one of the more predictable Pokemon in the tier. This tendency also sacrifices momentum; thus, more flexible defensive options such as Landorus-T are sometimes preferred. Lunala is also vulnerable to lure options, especially status moves such as Toxic from Groudon. Overall, the key to Lunala is using its defensive presence to let other teammates be more offensive while, at the same time, running teammates with some defensive utility of their own to make Lunala more flexible.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moongeist Beam can be used over Hex for a stronger attack against foes without status afflictions. It can also be useful to check Lum Berry Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM when Lunala lacks Roar. Teleport is an interesting option to gain momentum on predicted switches. You must use it carefully because, since Teleport will always make Lunala move last, it can lead to Lunala taking damage and forcing a future Roost when a regular switch would have sufficed. Psyshock may be used on the Meteor Beam set to hit Blissey and Eternatus harder, but the other coverage options and Roost generally provide more utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost- and Dark-type Pokemon and Attacks</strong>: Lunala's 4x weaknesses to Ghost and Dark leave it extremely vulnerable to Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Yveltal, Urshifu-S, less obvious threats like Knock Off users, and lure options like Shadow Ball on Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Lunala hates any form of status. Passive damage will prevent it from ever having Shadow Shield active. Paralysis will stop Lunala from having the Speed needed to use Roost consistently, and full paralysis can stop it from forcing Pokemon like Zygarde and Groudon out. However, be aware that Lunala sometimes partners with clerics like Calyrex-S.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Eternatus, Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh can come in relatively freely on defensive Lunala and force it out, although none appreciate taking a status move, and only Ferrothorn doesn't mind Meteor Beam. Blissey hard walls even the Meteor Beam set, forcing it out through Confide and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Double Dance Groudon can block Lunala's status with Lum Berry, proceeding to 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Attacks</strong>: While uncommon, moves such as Scale Shot and Icicle Spear only suffer Shadow Shield's damage reduction on the first hit.</p>",

Thunder Wave stops Mewtwo lacking the rare Shadow Ball, and it is useful to take advantage of common switch-ins such as Yveltal and Eternatus. It notably makes Lunala much less reliable at checking Zekrom, though. Ice Beam does massive damage to Zygarde and Rayquaza, and it does great damage to Groudon and Zekrom. Hex is generally the preferred last move, as it makes Lunala less passive. Even without status, Hex can OHKO Calyrex-S and do good damage to Marshadow. With status, it allows Lunala to decently damage Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. Roar is useful for Zygarde, which can otherwise pressure Lunala through Substitute and status. It can also be useful in an emergency to stop a runaway sweep from Lum Berry Necrozma-DM, Geomancy Xerneas, or another sweeper with several boosts. Defog is a decent option for the Sticky Web matchup thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots and Lunala's good Speed. It is otherwise not recommended, as most entry hazard setters can cripple Lunala through Knock Off or status.

Will-O-Wisp provides more security against Zekrom and Groudon, which is appreciated by teammates like Zygarde.

Defensive Xerneas, Buzzwole, Zarude are also good partners, as they can take pressure off Lunala to stay healthy enough to check Zekrom and Zygarde. Yveltal is nigh-mandatory to switch into Calyrex-S. Offensive Yveltal in particular likes Defog Lunala, which prevents it from taking Stealth Rock damage. Eternatus, Zygarde, Xerneas, and Buzzwole can check Marshadow, and the former three can check Hone Claws Yveltal. Hex sets appreciate any teammate that can spread status, such as Thunder Wave Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn can check Zekrom reliably and provide Spikes support, so it works great with any Thunder Wave or Roar set.

With great base Special Attack and a strong Moongeist Beam, Lunala can be a force to be reckoned with, especially at +1. Unfortunately, this set very much relies on the surprise factor of Meteor Beam, as it can easily be forced out by Calyrex-S, Marshadow, or Mystical Fire Eternatus, which severely limits its ability to sweep. A perk of this set is that, with Roost and Shadow Shield, Lunala can still provide useful defensive utility, even without significant HP investment. Ice Beam is Lunala's best coverage option, hitting Yveltal, Eternatus, and Zygarde hard. The combination of Ice Beam and Roost can let Lunala feign a defensive set, although a smart player will be able to tell the difference by using a damage calculator when Lunala deals or takes damage.</p> <p>This set works best when it can appear to be regular defensive Lunala at Team Preview. Due to this, it's not recommended on hyper offense builds such as Sticky Web teams, as that would ruin the surprise. This Lunala set can significantly weaken or outright KO Ho-Oh and Yveltal, which makes Calyrex-S an obvious option. Other options include Marshadow without Rock Tomb, Buzzwole, Urshifu-S, and Mewtwo. While Ghost-types work well together offensively, keep in mind that defensively they multiply weaknesses to opposing Ghost- and Dark-types. Yveltal and Ho-Oh help this matchup. Both Pokemon also offer Defog, which is mandatory for this set; Lunala being affected by entry hazards will instantly reveal that it has an offensive set.</p>"

Its massive HP and Defense stats take even boosted attacks well, giving it the incredible and rare ability to survive any hit Marshadow throws out, and its Fighting typing lets it absorb Knock Off so its teammates' items can stay intact. Buzzwole pairs nicely with a lot of common defensive Pokemon that are weak to these setup sweepers, such as the omnipresent Yveltal + Necrozma-DM + Eternatus core, giving it great team value. However, its incredibly low Special Defense and susceptibility to status make it a prime target of options its targets can run specifically to beat it, limiting its consistency in certain matchups. Draco Meteor Zekrom, Groudon with Fire-type coverage, and Toxic Zygarde, for example, can all capitalize on these weaknesses extremely well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge is a very niche option on the defensive set, but it has the upside of surprising and OHKOing Ho-Oh, one of Buzzwole's sturdiest checks, after a Bulk Up. However, the listed coverage options are more reliable and broadly useful. Toxic with Power-Up Punch as the boosting option lets Buzzwole spread status against walls like Lunala while maintaining an offensive presence, but Buzzwole is less effective defensively without Bulk Up to boost Defense. An Occa Berry allows Buzzwole to survive a hit from Groudon carrying Fire-type coverage or Weather Ball Zekrom in sun, but it can't OHKO either Pokemon, so it's a very temporary solution to a bigger problem. Darkest Lariat can be used to threaten Lunala and OHKO Calyrex-S on the bulky attacking set, but, as Buzzwole is slower than both, it's a risky option to use aside from catching a switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Buzzwole's incredibly low Special Defense leaves it vulnerable to almost every special attacker in the tier. Calyrex-S, Eternatus, Kyogre, Xerneas, and Lunala are some of the most common special Pokemon, all of which take little damage from any of Buzzwole's attacks and can threaten it back with their strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Ho-Oh and Reshiram are the premier Fire-types, easily taking advantage of Buzzwole's Fire weakness. Fire-type coverage options are also deadly, letting Eternatus and sometimes Groudon easily break through it.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Ghost-types</strong>: Lunala and Giratina incredibly effectively wall Buzzwole, taking minimal damage from any hit and threatening it with status, leaving Buzzwole much less effective at its job.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Buzzwole is very reliant on sticking around to beat a lot of its checks, making getting hit with Toxic incredibly detrimental. Pokemon like defensive Yveltal and Dragon Dance Zygarde can both bait it in and cripple it with Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set focuses exclusively on checking dangerous physical wallbreakers and setup sweepers. Bulk Up lets Buzzwole set up alongside sweepers like Groudon, Zygarde, and Zekrom while giving it some extra firepower as well. Ice Punch hits Zygarde particularly hard, crucial for checking Coil sets more reliably, while also nailing the aforementioned Groudon and Zekrom. It's also a solid damaging move against Marshadow, letting Buzzwole slowly chip it down. Drain Punch and Leech Life both provide healing and are decently strong STAB moves, and they are the main way Buzzwole can pressure a lot of Pokemon. Drain Punch threatens Pokemon like Ferrothorn, while Leech Life strengthens its matchup against Calyrex-I, having a chance to OHKO it after two Bulk Ups. Roost, combined with Heavy-Duty Boots, gives Buzzwole the longevity it needs, with Heavy-Duty Boots importantly protecting against Toxic Spikes. Rocky Helmet is especially helpful for chipping threats like Zekrom, Marshadow, and Necrozma-DM. The Speed EVs let Buzzwole outspeed both paralyzed Calyrex-S and maximum Speed Calyrex-I. An alternative EV spread with maximum HP and Defense helps on teams that are weak to Zekrom, improving the matchup against it once it has boosted.</p> <p>With Buzzwole being able to check a ton of threats such as Groudon, Marshadow, Zygarde, and Urshifu-S, defensive cores that are unable to beat those Pokemon greatly appreciate it. These physical wallbreakers heavily dent the core of Yveltal + Necrozma-DM + Eternatus or Blissey; Buzzwole can be the defensive pivot they need to beat those Pokemon. Meanwhile, they check the strong special attackers in the metagame for it, such as Kyogre by Blissey or Eternatus, Calyrex-S by Yveltal, and Xerneas by Necrozma-DM. Life Orb Eternatus commonly has to switch into unwanted Knock Offs from Yveltal, so having Buzzwole to absorb Knock Off gives it more freedom to offensively pressure teams without worrying about losing its item. Groudon and Haban Berry Zekrom can check and bait in opposing Zekrom, respectively, removing one of the few physical attackers that can slowly overwhelm Buzzwole given the right circumstances. Due to Buzzwole's susceptibility to status, clerics like Blissey and Choice item Calyrex-S with Aromatherapy are good teammates for helping it stick around and check foes like Toxic Zygarde more reliably.</p>"

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Bulky attacker Buzzwole uses its massive Attack stat and strong coverage options to wallbreak while still having the bulk to soft check physical threats. Close Combat deals the most damage, 2HKOing even bulky neutral targets like specially defensive Necrozma-DM with a Choice Band, and sometimes even without it. Ice Punch catches Eternatus and Landorus-T while also pressuring targets like Groudon and Zekrom without lowering its Defense. Rock Slide is good for heavily damaging or OHKOing Ho-Oh, which can switch into Buzzwole's other options easily and force it out with Sacred Fire. Roost is required for longevity, even finding a use with Choice Band due to Buzzwole's tendency to switch into Yveltal's Knock Off. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Buzzwole a bit more staying power in long games, as well as freedom of move choice, which is especially helpful for Roost, while Choice Band's power is incredible, allowing for a guaranteed OHKO on targets like Ho-Oh and physically defensive Ferrothorn. The given EV spread allows Buzzwole to outspeed a paralyzed Calyrex-S and maximum Speed Calyrex-I. The defensive investment allows it to survive two Adamant Choice Band Spectral Thiefs from Marshadow. A maximum Attack spread that forgoes the Defense investment can also be used to improve damage rolls against Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Groudon, but the chance to be 2HKOed by Marshadow is a big tradeoff.</p> <p>With minimal bulk investment and no way to boost its Defense, this set requires defensive support against offensive threats that it soft checks. Zekrom and Marshadow are two important threats that have the power to break through offensive Buzzwole, so partners like Xerneas and Haban Berry Eternatus can lift some of the pressure off Buzzwole and form a core that has multiple offensive soft checks to these Pokemon. Pokemon that can force damage onto opposing Buzzwole are greatly appreciated, as Buzzwole is a very solid answer to itself, making Groudon with Fire-type coverage and Draco Meteor Zekrom good partners also. Choice Band Rock Slide is a good surprise for Ho-Oh, which teammates like Xerneas and Calyrex-S appreciate being eliminated.</p>"

  "Necrozma-Dusk-Mane": {
    "overview": "<p>Necrozma-DM is the premier Ubers Steel-type and one of the best Pokemon in the tier. It checks a myriad of powerful offensive threats, such as Xerneas, Calyrex-I, Galarian Darmanitan, and Eternatus. With a good ability in Prism Armor, useful utility options including Stealth Rock and status moves, and reliable enough recovery, Necrozma-DM functions as a critical glue Pokemon for the vast majority of teams. Offensive sets are also not to be underestimated, as Necrozma-DM packs an impressive base 157 Attack on top of its good bulk and has great boosting options in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. Since it's one of the most common defensive Pokemon in the tier, powerful threats like Groudon, Zygarde, Zekrom, and Kyogre often look to take advantage of Necrozma-DM. As such, it is critical to pick Necrozma-DM's coverage options and teammates well in accordance with your team structure, lest you leave big openings in your defensive core.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Morning Sun is functionally identical to Moonlight. Sunsteel Strike can be run on the Specially Defensive set, trading higher PP and a flinch chance for more power and the ability to hit Shedinja. If Necrozma-DM does not need to run Stealth Rock due to a teammate such as Groudon, Clefable, or Blissey already having it, then a boosting move such as Dragon Dance or Swords Dance is possible on defensive sets as a surprise option to win late-game scenarios. Expert Belt and Knock Off can be run on Dragon Dance sets to secure the OHKO on Lunala. Colbur Berry is a decent option for offensive Dragon Dance sets to better take on Choice Scarf or Sucker Punch Yveltal. Life Orb is another viable option for these sets, but generally the lost bulk is not worth it compared to Weakness Policy. Stone Edge and 12 Attack EVs with Expert Belt can be run on any defensive set to lure in and OHKO Ho-Oh, although the loss of a less situational item is noticeable. Heat Wave can be run on Dragon Dance sets to heavily damage Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, although the other coverage options are generally better. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to avoid damage from Spikes; however, the utility you lose from Rocky Helmet or Leftovers is noticeable, especially since Necrozma-DM already resists Stealth Rock. Double Dance and Trick Room are surprise sweeper sets, but they lose a coverage move and often rely on Weakness Policy or setting up twice to sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Groudon and Zygarde have an easy time switching into anything Necrozma-DM can throw at them and proceed to use it as setup fodder. However, Knock Off or Toxic can limit their presence in the game.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom is immune to Thunder Wave, resists Steel-type attacks, and can heal off anything Necrozma-DM can throw at it with Leftovers or Roost. Zekrom can then use it as setup fodder. However, Zekrom needs to be careful of a boosted Earthquake or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre resists Steel-type attacks and can use Necrozma-DM to set up or to put out strong Choice Specs-boosted attacks. Defensive Kyogre will be able to beat most offensive sets, but they need to be wary of a boosted Knock Off or a Choice Band Photon Geyser.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight can switch in for free and use Necrozma-DM to lay Spikes or remove Stealth Rock with Defog. These Pokemon are also some of the best counters to offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Ghost- and Dark-types</strong>: While they don't like switching into a strong attack, Yveltal, Marshadow, Urshifu-S, and Calyrex-S can threaten to massively damage or KO Necrozma-DM. Lunala can stop offensive sets if they lack Knock Off or Lum Berry. Physically defensive Zarude can wall most Necrozma-DM sets easily.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: While Ho-Oh loses to Stone Edge sets, against most defensive sets it can come in relatively for free and use Defog and Sacred Fire with abandon. Status threatens Ho-Oh, but Regenerator mitigates Toxic.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most common Necrozma-DM set thanks to the Special Defense investment making Necrozma-DM an excellent check to Xerneas and Eternatus. Stealth Rock provides invaluable team support, and Necrozma-DM is probably the best user of it in the tier. With Thunder Wave and Iron Head, the most common Defog user in the tier, Yveltal, will have a very difficult time dealing with Necrozma-DM. Iron Head is used instead of Sunsteel Strike for its higher PP, which lets it more effectively check Calyrex-I, and its flinch chance, which works excellently in combination with Thunder Wave. If a teammate is already providing Stealth Rock support, such as Groudon, Clefable, Blissey, or Landorus, Necrozma-DM can run Knock Off instead to punish common switch-ins like Groudon, Zygarde, Zekrom, and Kyogre. Toxic could also be run to punish the aforementioned switch-ins as well as Ho-Oh. The Speed EVs ensure that Necrozma-DM will outspeed all Calyrex-I sets as well as paralyzed Calyrex-S. If you have a teammate that can deal with SubSeed Calyrex-I well enough, such as Leech Life Buzzwole, Necrozma-DM can instead run a spread of 216 HP / 252 SpD / 40 Spe. This lets it outspeed Adamant Calyrex-I, have a higher chance of beating Geomancy Xerneas, and have a 50% chance to survive a Choice Specs Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S.</p> <p>It's important to have solid switch-ins to Pokemon such as Zygarde, Groudon, Zekrom, and Kyogre. These Pokemon are immune to or don't mind Thunder Wave and take little damage from Iron Head, so they can use Necrozma-DM as an easy setup opportunity. If you have solid checks to these Pokemon, Necrozma-DM can still gain momentum by setting Stealth Rock. Eternatus and Yveltal are fantastic partners for being able to switch into Kyogre and Calyrex-S, respectively, and together the three of them form the classic defensive core of SS Ubers. Buzzwole and Tangrowth make excellent defensive partners for dealing with Ground-types and Marshadow well. Defensive Xerneas can deal with Marshadow, Zekrom, Zygarde, and Urshifu-S, as well as providing cleric support. Groudon and Clefable can check Zekrom and Zygarde, respectively, and also free up the Stealth Rock moveslot on Necrozma-DM. Calyrex-S appreciates this set's ability to cripple Yveltal and provide Stealth Rock support. In return, Necrozma-DM likes Aromatherapy and Calyrex-S's revenge killing capabilities.</p>"

      "Bulky Booster": {
        "description": "<p>Necrozma-DM makes a threatening wallbreaker with Swords Dance or Dragon Dance while maintaining a lot of its defensive utility. The key to this set's success is its combination of bulk and power; compared to many other wallbreakers in the tier, bulky teams have a very difficult time OHKOing or even 2HKOing Necrozma-DM. Swords Dance boosts Necrozma-DM's Attack to sky-high levels, letting it power through Pokemon better early-game than Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance makes it sweep balanced teams better in late-game scenarios. Iron Head has more PP and better neutral coverage than Photon Geyser and Sunsteel Strike, which is especially helpful against Eternatus. Sunsteel Strike can still be useful, especially against Geomancy Xerneas, as it has a much better chance to OHKO when unboosted than Iron Head does. Knock Off gives more coverage and makes Necrozma-DM very difficult for bulky teams to deal with; defensive Pokemon such as Lunala, Tangrowth, Ho-Oh, Ferrothorn, and opposing Necrozma-DM that may try to stop this set can get crippled for the rest of the game. Stone Edge is an alternative that lets it get past Yveltal and especially Ho-Oh. Moonlight and Leftovers allow Necrozma-DM to use its good bulk to boost several times. The EVs ensure that it outspeeds all Calyrex-I, which it checks decently with this set, as well as paralyzed Calyrex-S. With Dragon Dance, it will outspeed all base 100 Pokemon at +1 and non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S at +2. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe can be used to better check Xerneas and offensive Eternatus, especially if your team lacks an alternative check such as Ho-Oh or Blissey. Do note that the lack of Attack investment is quite noticeable.</p> <p>This set works best on teams with other bulky teammates that already cover some of the roles that defensive Necrozma-DM would normally cover. In return, Necrozma-DM can still provide some of its defensive roles and also function as a strong wallbreaker. Since it lacks Stealth Rock, a teammate such as Groudon, Blissey, Clefable, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, or Landorus can provide an entry hazard. An additional Xerneas check, such as Ho-Oh or Blissey, is a great teammate, since this set lacks the bulk to take on Geomancy Xerneas consistently. Clerics such as Calyrex-S, Clefable, and Blissey make great partners, as this set can often get statused early in the game. Pairing Necrozma-DM with a strong physical partner such as Groudon, Zekrom, or Marshadow lets both break down checks for each other. Finally, paralysis spreaders such as Ho-Oh, Blissey, Zygarde, and Groudon are terrific teammates, as this set benefits from the Speed drop and paralysis chance, especially in tandem with Iron Head.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Necrozma-DM finds its place on offensive teams for its nice bulk and ability to raise its Speed. Particularly, hyper offense teams like its ability to limit some typical anti-offense Pokemon, such as Xerneas and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Sunsteel Strike is therefore your mandatory STAB attack to OHKO the former more often. Stone Edge is used mainly to KO Ho-Oh and Yveltal when boosted. From there, Earthquake gives good neutral coverage and hits Pokemon such as Eternatus and Zekrom extremely hard. The EV spread and nature give Necrozma-DM enough Speed to beat Adamant Marshadow after a Dragon Dance. At +2, it will also outspeed non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. A viable alternative is to run 136 HP / 252 Atk / 120 Spe with an Adamant nature, which outspeeds fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. Weakness Policy limits the offensive options against this set from the opposing team and also gives easy setup opportunities against Pokemon like Eternatus. On the other hand, Lum Berry lets Necrozma-DM 2HKO Lunala without fear of being burned and avoid paralysis from opposing Necrozma-DM. It also allows it to 2HKO Tangrowth without fear of Sleep Powder.</p> <p>This set loves strong wallbreakers for teammates, as it's much better at cleaning up weakened teams than breaking through cores and overcoming common defensive Pokemon such as Kyogre, Zygarde, Zarude, Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Lunala, and Groudon by itself. Offensive teammates such as Zekrom and Groudon make fantastic partners, as both can both lure in and KO Tangrowth with their coverage options. Zekrom will make quick work of Kyogre, while Double Dance Groudon, Rayquaza, and Xerneas are all good options to overpower Zygarde. Marshadow will be able to OHKO Lunala and most Ferrothorn.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>When paired with the right teammates, physically defensive Necrozma-DM can be better than the more common specially defensive set. Particularly, Blissey can cover the roles of the specially defensive set, mainly checking Xerneas and offensive Eternatus. In exchange, this set can check Pokemon such as Zekrom and offensive Necrozma-DM sets. Notably, this set is also perhaps the best check to the powerful physical Ice-types of the tier, Galarian Darmanitan and Calyrex-I. Stealth Rock provides Necrozma-DM with its usual supporting role, but be mindful that this set has little to stop Yveltal or Ho-Oh from using Defog on it. Earthquake is used to hit Zekrom and opposing Necrozma-DM hard, with Sunsteel Strike preferred over Iron Head because paralysis isn't on this set. Iron Head could be run for its higher PP against SubSeed Calyrex-I and works well with paralysis support from teammates. Finally, Moonlight is critical to keeping this set healthy, especially since Rocky Helmet has been chosen over Leftovers to better help Necrozma-DM damage Zekrom and other physical attackers. Leftovers could be used to better check SubSeed Calyrex-I and is preferred if using Necrozma-DM on a team with Kyogre, which weakens Moonlight with rain.</p> <p>As mentioned above, Blissey is a great teammate, since it covers the roles that specially defensive Necrozma-DM normally would like checking Xerneas and offensive Eternatus. Since this set can handle Zekrom relatively well, it will work best on teams that don't have another Zekrom answer. Be mindful that, depending on the circumstances, Zekrom and offensive Necrozma-DM can still win against this set, so a revenge killer like Calyrex-S or Marshadow is a good partner. Pokemon that can set up on Defog users are also good partners; Zygarde, Zekrom, and Kyogre are some notable options.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions as a surprise wallbreaker. Base 157 Attack in combination with Choice Band gives this Necrozma-DM a ton of immediate power. Sunsteel Strike will heavily damage even Necrozma-DM's typical switch-ins such as Groudon and Zygarde. Knock Off pairs nicely with Sunsteel Strike to give Necrozma-DM good neutral coverage; it particularly smacks Lunala hard. Removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet offers useful utility as well. Moonlight allows Necrozma-DM to come back later in the game to check Xerneas, Calyrex-I, Galarian Darmanitan, or Eternatus. Stone Edge is an alternative option that will secure an OHKO on Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Photon Geyser covers Pokemon like Eternatus and gives a secondary STAB attack for Pokemon resisting Steel. Notably, it will OHKO non-defensive Kyogre and 2HKO defensive variants. The Speed EVs ensure Necrozma-DM will outspeed all Calyrex-I sets as well as paralyzed Calyrex-S.</p> <p>This set appreciates offensive partners that can help break down some of its common switch-ins. Double Dance Groudon, Urshifu-S, or Ice Punch Marshadow can help to offensively pressure Zygarde. Paralysis support from spreaders such as Zygarde, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Blissey can help make up for this set's low Speed. U-turn Yveltal is an excellent partner for checking Calyrex-S, as well as easily bringing Necrozma-DM in on Eternatus switch-ins. Clerics such as Calyrex-S, Xerneas, Blissey, and Clefable are much appreciated, as this set can get statused quite easily.</p>"

These moves allow Marshadow to be an effective revenge killer; only Choice Scarf Calyrex-S can compare to Marshadow's utility in this regard.

Swagger is usable to both confuse the opponent and let Marshadow steal the boost with Spectral Thief, and works well with paralysis support, but it is very luck-reliant. Focus Sash is extremely popular, so it should be mentioned; however, while it may seem tempting to use, Marshadow desperately needs the power from Choice Band, Life Orb, or Spell Tag. Not to mention, Focus Sash is a very unreliable item, as it is invalidated by any passive damage, especially from entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Defensive Xerneas can take anything Marshadow can throw at it and OHKO back with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole resists Low Kick and is bulky enough to take even Choice Band Poltergeist without being 2HKOed, and thus it completely walls Marshadow.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde-C has the bulk to tank anything Marshadow uses with the exception of Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh resists Low Kick and will have the bulk to survive most of Marshadow's Ghost-type attacks, but Choice Band or Life Orb Marshadow will OHKO with Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus and Yveltal</strong>: While rare, physically defensive Eternatus has the bulk and Speed to force Marshadow out. The more common specially defensive Eternatus is usually EVed to outspeed Adamant Marshadow and switch into a predicted Low Kick. Specially defensive Yveltal has the HP and Defense investment to pivot into many of Marshadow's attacks; Sucker Punch Yveltal is also very threatening. Both of these sets must be very careful of switching into the wrong STAB attack or Ice Punch, lest they be 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Tanks</strong>: While they often lack recovery, Pokemon such as Groudon, Landorus-T, and Zekrom can take a neutral hit if need be and force Marshadow out.</p> <p><strong>Regenerator Pivots</strong>: Tangrowth and Toxapex have the physical bulk to take most of Marshadow's attacks and damage it back with Rocky Helmet.</p> <p><strong>Status and Passive Damage</strong>: Marshadow is frail and thus cannot take repeated damage over time well. Life Orb recoil, poison, entry hazard damage, and Rocky Helmet damage all limit Marshadow's ability to consistently pressure foes. Paralysis and burn both severely lower Marshadow's offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Single-use Items</strong>: Poltergeist Marshadow has the unique problem of being checked by Pokemon using single-use items such as Air Balloon, Power Herb, and Sitrus Berry, commonly Eternatus and Xerneas. A lack of item will prevent Poltergeist from working, invalidating a powerful option from Marshadow.</p>",

      "Offensive Cleaner": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Life Orb or Spell Tag, Marshadow is great at cleaning up weakened teams. Spectral Thief is used over Poltergeist for its consistent power, accuracy, and utility against set-up sweepers such as Calm Mind Kyogre, while Low Kick is chosen over Close Combat as the majority of the Ubers tier is very heavy. Shadow Sneak makes Marshadow a useful revenge killer and prevents Calyrex-S from threatening it. The last moveslot is customizable based on team need. Ice Punch is a strong option for hitting Zygarde, which can otherwise wall Marshadow or use it as a setup opportunity, as well as easing prediction against Yveltal and Eternatus. Notably, Life Orb Jolly sets have a chance to 2HKO Eternatus with Ice Punch. Rock Tomb OHKOes Ho-Oh and heavily damages Yveltal; the Speed drop also helps Adamant Marshadow outspeed checks like Eternatus. Bulk Up is Marshadow's only good boosting move, and it works best in tandem with Spell Tag. Marshadow's longevity is significantly improved without Life Orb recoil, letting it survive attacks from Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, and Yveltal and potentially power through them. Life Orb is usually preferred on sets with four attacks, but Spell Tag is still a valid option for longevity. Note that Ho-Oh needs to be chipped before Spell Tag Marshadow can OHKO it. Jolly nature can be used especially for outspeeding Eternatus, but the power drop is definitely notable. Adamant works best when paired with paralysis support.</p> <p>This set requires strong wallbreakers as teammates. Kyogre can notably put pressure on Eternatus, Hone Claws Yveltal can lure in Eternatus and Buzzwole, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM has great synergy, as it can take out Ho-Oh and Yveltal with Stone Edge and set up on Xerneas and Eternatus. Ferrothorn's Spikes can help Marshadow pressure its checks, such as giving Jolly Marshadow a greater chance to 2HKO Eternatus. Necrozma-DM is a highly recommended teammate to switch into Eternatus and Xerneas and set up Stealth Rock, helping Marshadow sweep much more easily. Eternatus and Zygarde provide synergy by switching into Ho-Oh and statusing the opposing team. Eternatus also forces out Buzzwole. Xerneas, Buzzwole, and Zarude can switch into Zygarde-C and force it out. Blissey can switch Marshadow in with Teleport, heal Life Orb recoil with Wish, and provide cleric support. Ho-Oh easily switches in on Xerneas and Buzzwole. Additionally, both Thunder Wave Kyogre and Ho-Oh can lure Eternatus and paralyze it, helping Adamant Marshadow take it out.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band's power allows Marshadow to be more flexible in the attacks it runs. For example, with Choice Band, Marshadow can run Spectral Thief with a Jolly nature and comfortably 2HKO the vast majority of Eternatus sets, not needing Poltergeist or Adamant to 2HKO. Shadow Sneak is a useful priority move to revenge kill threats, especially when boosted by Choice Band. In the last slot, Ice Punch or Rock Tomb is used to heavily damage checks such as Zygarde and Ho-Oh. Poltergeist is a useful in-between option, as it's Marshadow's strongest Ghost-type attack, and it hits both the aforementioned foes for good damage. However, Poltergeist has notable flaws in its accuracy and vulnerability to foes with consumed items. While an Adamant nature is possible, Jolly is greatly preferred for letting Marshadow outspeed and 2HKO Eternatus, a very common switch-in. Despite Choice Band's power, be careful when locking into a move, since Zygarde-C, Xerneas, Landorus-T, Necrozma-DM, Buzzwole, and Zarude can often set up for free against certain moves.</p> <p>This set works well on teams that want a revenge killer that isn't Calyrex-S. Certain setup sweepers appreciate this set's focus on wallbreaking power. Zygarde-C and Kyogre enjoy Marshadow heavily pressuring Eternatus, Groudon appreciates it continuously bashing Zygarde-C with Ice Punch, and offensive Necrozma-DM loves it taking out Ho-Oh with Rock Tomb. Other setup sweepers that enjoy Marshadow removing Eternatus are Zarude and Buzzwole. Checks to Pokemon such as Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Zekrom are much appreciated teammates, such as Xerneas and Landorus-T, as those foes can all take a hit from Marshadow if need be. Pivots such as U-turn Yveltal and Teleport Blissey help Marshadow come into the game much more easily and check Calyrex-S, which can force Marshadow out if it is locked into a move besides Shadow Sneak. They appreciate Marshadow's ability to force out setup sweepers like Cosmic Power Eternatus and SubCM Kyogre, and U-turn Yveltal and Marshadow together can keep SubSeed Calyrex-S in check. Blissey is also good for cleric support, as are Xerneas and Clefable. If Marshadow runs Poltergeist, make sure none of its teammates have Knock Off on their sets.</p>"

  "Naganadel": {
    "overview": "<p>Naganadel is a strong sweeper and cleaner for hyper offense teams with good coverage and strong STAB moves. Nasty Plot is the key to its success, boosting its already high Special Attack much further, which, when coupled with Life Orb, threatens many common defensive Pokemon. It's naturally very fast, and Beast Boost only increases its Speed further. Unfortunately, Naganadel has poor defenses, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed, and it provides little defensive ability. Its reliance on Nasty Plot for power can also be quite detrimental, as it can be KOed while setting up. Naganadel also faces strong competition from numerous offensive wallbreakers in the tier, directly competing with Eternatus as a Poison / Dragon type wallbreaker, as well as with other special attackers like Xerneas and Calyrex-S.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With its access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Naganadel can act as an offensive lead for hyper offense teams. It is largely outclassed in this role by Cloyster, though, and losing its wallbreaking power with Nasty Plot is not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Heatran is the best counter to Naganadel, as Flash Fire means it resists or is immune to all of its attacks. Tyranitar can also survive its attacks and threaten it back with Crunch or Thunder Wave. Blissey can be broken through with multiple boosts but can also cripple Naganadel with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fast Wallbreakers</strong>: Naganadel's Speed is solid, but it still gets outsped by Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf users like Yveltal, Galarian Darmanitan, and Kyogre. Choice Scarf Calyrex-S even outspeeds Naganadel after a Speed boost and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Naganadel's low natural bulk and use of Life Orb mean that priority moves such as Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak can easily revenge kill it. Adamant Choice Band Weavile's Ice Shard can even OHKO Naganadel, while other sets similarly threaten it.</p> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: With Shadow Shield intact, Lunala can take even boosted Draco Meteor and hit back super effectively with Ice Beam or cripple Naganagel with Thunder Wave. Sacrificing Naganadel to break Shadow Shield can open up other teammates walled by Lunala, though.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot makes Naganadel a strong sweeper that can boost past many defensive Pokemon including Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Blissey. Draco Meteor and Sludge Wave are powerful STAB moves that hit a large portion of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, including Yveltal, Xerneas, Eternatus, and Zygarde. Fire Blast hits most Steel-types that resist its STAB moves, giving Naganadel a nearly unwallable moveset. Life Orb is the only viable item, boosting Naganadel's power as much as possible to sweep through teams, which lets it possibly OHKO Ho-Oh at +2 and OHKOing Blissey at +6 with Draco Meteor. A Timid nature raises Naganadel's Speed above its Special Attack, letting it boost its Speed with Beast Boost after KOing a Pokemon, which makes sweeps easier against teams with a revenge killer.</p> <p>Naganadel exclusively fits on hyper offense teams. Slurpuff, Shuckle, and Galvantula can provide Sticky Web support so that Naganadel can outspeed Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Choice Band Pheromosa without needing to boost, and other leads such as Froslass and Excadrill can set damaging entry hazards. Xerneas is a solid offensive partner, as it applies pressure onto both Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh, allowing it and Naganadel to overwhelm their shared checks together. Zekrom and Groudon are good physical wallbreakers that force out Pokemon like Blissey and Heatran, forcing them to take more chip damage from entry hazards so that Naganadel can overwhelm them. They also benefit from Naganadel forcing out physical walls like Zygarde-C. Calyrex-S and Pheromosa can still outspeed unboosted Naganadel and +1 Speed Naganadel with a Choice Scarf, so Pokemon that can switch into them like Yveltal and Necrozma-DM are appreciated.</p>"

  "Cinderace": {
    "overview": "<p>Libero allows Cinderace to hit harder with every move, letting it function as a niche attacker in the Ubers metagame. Its unique move Court Change also gives it a better shot in the metagame, as there are limited effective tools for entry hazard control. Cinderace has good enough Speed to outrun key Pokemon that have between 90 and 100 base Speed such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Unfortunately, due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Cinderace is forced to use Heavy-Duty Boots rather than an offensive item. Its bulk is also poor, meaning most attacks KO it; however, it can alter its typing to potentially survive a fatal blow. Lastly, Cinderace has a fairly lackluster Attack stat that prevents it from firing off truly powerful blows. Still, its good utility and moves to threaten staples like Necrozma-DM mean you shouldn't fire Cinderace from your club right away.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>High Jump Kick is an option to consider on Cinderace that beats common checks such as Tyranitar, Urshifu-S, and Zekrom. Super Fang allows Cinderace to weaken one of the metagame's strongest walls in Zygarde-C. Cinderace can use Life Orb to boost its power, even 2HKOing defensive Ho-Oh with Gunk Shot. Sticky Web teams may prefer Cinderace to run an Adamant nature to threaten OHKOs on Pokemon such as offensive Eternatus, Kyogre, and Marshadow.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Pyro Ball like Kyogre, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh can comfortably take all of Cinderace's attacks. Moreover, despite the fact that Kyogre and Zygarde-C lack a strong recovery move, Rest is often enough to stop Cinderace from getting past them.</p> <p><strong>Strong Bulky Attackers</strong>: Common bulky attackers such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Landorus-T are able to take the momentum from Cinderace quite easily thanks to their powerful STAB moves forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Xerneas, Eternatus, and Lunala are seen on most teams and can wall Cinderace depending on its moveset. They're also able to threaten Cinderace with their strong STAB moves, which force Cinderace to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Other attackers like Calyrex-S and Marshadow often outmatch Cinderace with their higher power and Speed.</p>",

Cinderace can use Gunk Shot to threaten the important Xerneas and possibly poison two of the metagame's strongest defenders: Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Zen Headbutt lets Cinderace bypass common walls like Eternatus and Toxapex that otherwise resist its moves. Sucker Punch can help Cinderace's matchup against offensive threats such as Calyrex-S. The EVs in HP allow Cinderace to survive one Earthquake from Necrozma-DM, and the EVs in Special Defense allow it to survive one Moonblast from standard Xerneas after a Geomancy.

Therefore, Pokemon like Yveltal and Blissey are good teammates. Other offensive threats greatly enjoy Cinderace's U-turn and Court Change. Groudon is one such teammate that also offers sun and paralysis support. Zekrom, Marshadow, and Calyrex-S also greatly appreciate Cinderace's pivot support. Hyper offense and bulky offense team structures also generally appreciate Cinderace's ability to improve the entry hazard matchup and check Sticky Web teams thanks to Court Change.</p>"

Grimmsnarl's bulk and typing enable it to switch into threats such as Marshadow, Calyrex-S, and Yveltal throughout the game, which gives the offensive teams a more favourable matchup versus these otherwise troublesome threats. However, Grimmsnarl struggles versus Pokemon that can set up against it and threaten a KO simultaneously, for example Xerneas and Necrozma-DM, which force it into a coinflip situation of setting up the appropriate screen or using Taunt. Additionally, teams featuring both Defog Ho-Oh and Yveltal can completely neutralize Grimmsnarl: when Grimmsnarl uses Taunt to stop Ho-Oh's Defog from removing screens, Ho-Oh can go for a Sacred Fire burn, which makes Play Rough so weak that Yveltal can freely come in and shut Grimmsnarl down with Defog.</p>",

Play Rough enables Grimmsnarl to set up screens versus the Taunt-immune Defogger Yveltal, as Play Rough outdamages Roost. It also enables Grimmsnarl to check to Marshadow, Zygarde, and Calyrex-S. 252 HP and 164 Special Defense EVs guarantee Grimmsnarl survives two hits from Choice Specs Calyrex-S and a hit from Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout while Light Screen is active, and the Defense investment makes Grimmsnarl more resilient against Necrozma-DM and Marshadow.</p> <p>Grimmsnarl should only be used on offensive teams, as they can fully take advantage of the setup opportunities it provides its teammates. Zekrom is a strong teammate, as it can instantly threaten Ho-Oh + Yveltal Defog cores and switches into Kyogre if it is behind Light Screen. Zekrom greatly appreciates dual screens letting it shrug off Necrozma-DM's Earthquake, Zygarde's Thousand Arrows, and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon while surviving a hit from Groudon. Stone Edge Necrozma-DM is a good teammate too, as it resists Xerneas's Moonblast while surviving super effective hits from Groudon, Yveltal, and Calyrex-S behind the appropriate screen, which activate Weakness Policy. Meteor Beam Eternatus absorbs Toxic Spikes, threatens Defog cores, and appreciates Light Screen preventing Calyrex-S from easily revenge killing it. Xerneas appreciates Reflect, as it prevents a 2HKO from Necrozma-DM. Groudon threatens Defog cores while appreciating dual screens, as they allow it to use both of its setup moves more easily.

  "Obstagoon": {
    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon's unique Normal / Dark typing makes it immune to Ghost- and Psychic-type attacks, giving it a unique niche as the only fully evolved Pokemon immune to Calyrex-S's STAB moves. Its decent Attack stat and Guts + STAB-boosted Facade give it a powerful offensive presence; coverage moves such as Knock Off, Switcheroo, and Ice Punch enable it to further threaten metagame staples such as Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Lunala. Obstagoon is severely limited by its susceptibility to chip damage from burn and entry hazards. In addition, its lack of useful resistances beyond its niche and a middling Speed means it will be is easily OHKOed or 2HKOed by most threats in the tier. Thus, it faces competition with most physical attackers in the tier, such as Marshadow, Zekrom, and Rayquaza, which will find more opportunities to switch in and threaten the opposing team. Obstagoon also cannot function as a team's sole Ghost-type answer and as such constricts teambuilding.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative EV spread of 168 HP / 248 Atk / 92 Spe lets Obstagoon survive a +2 Draining Kiss from Calyrex-S and increases its overall bulk while outrunning Adamant Dracovish, but the loss in Speed is detrimental and makes it potentially slower than common threats like offensive Ho-Oh, offensive Calm Mind Kyogre, Groudon, and Zygarde. Fling can be added to this spread to offer a chance for Obstagoon to take on Focus Sash Calyrex-S on one-on-one, which has a 75% to OHKO Calyrex-S thanks to the burn damage.</p> <h3>Check and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn is one of the best checks to Obstagoon: while it does not want to take a Guts-boosted Fire Punch, physically defensive Ferrothorn is able to tank Knock Off and OHKO Obstagoon with Body Press or deplete Obstagoon's HP with chip damage from Iron Barbs and entry hazards. Skarmory and Corviknight can mitigate any damage taken from Obstagoon with Roost and also OHKO it with Body Press. Finally, Zamazenta-C is resistant to Obstagoon's STAB moves and Fire Punch fails to 3HKO it, meaning Zamazenta-C can use Obstagoon as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: All forms of chip damage heavily cripple Obstagoon, as it does not have any form of recovery and is slowly chipped already by its burn; thus, Rocky Helmet damage, Iron Barbs, and Leech Seed damage from foes like Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Ferrothorn can all quickly reduce its longevity. While SubSeed Calyrex-S cannot damage Obstagoon directly with its STAB moves, Leech Seed + Substitute in combination with the burn damage drain its HP fast enough to force Obstagoon out.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Obstagoon is relatively fragile by the Ubers standards, and is threatened by most neutral moves in the tier, such as Zekrom's Bolt Strike, Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon, and Yveltal's Oblivion Wing.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde</strong>: While it does not appreciate receiving a Flame Orb and cannot take a +1 Guts-boosted Ice Punch, Zygarde completely walls Obstagoon otherwise and can use it as setup fodder with its Coil set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Due to its middling Speed and insufficient defensive stats, Obstagoon is extremely weak to any foes that outrun it. For example, Marshadow is immune to Facade and OHKO it with Low Kick or Close Combat, even though it has to be cautious to not take a Knock Off and doesn't like Parting Shot. A Speed boosted Zekrom can OHKO Obstagoon with Bolt Strike, and Life Orb Eternatus can heavily damage Obstagoon and shrug off some of the damage it takes in return thanks to Recover.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: While it does not appreciate taking Facade, U-turn Yveltal severely weakens Obstagoon, and pivots to faster teammates that force Obstagoon out. Choice-locked Calyrex-S is usually completely walled by Obstagoon, but Nasty Plot Calyrex-S can easily OHKO it with a +2 Draining Kiss, and rarer options like Pollen Puff on Choice Specs variant can claim a surprise OHKO on Obstagoon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Knock Off has a high chance to 2HKO specially defensive Necrozma-DM, OHKOes Calyrex-S, and has the great advantage of removing the foes' precious items, such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal's Heavy-Duty Boots, leaving them susceptible to Stealth Rock. Facade becomes extremely powerful once Obstagoon is burned, 2HKOing most foes that don't resist it, such as Eternatus, Yveltal, defensive Xerneas, and physically defensive Ho-Oh. Switcheroo lets it exchange its Flame Orb after it has been activated for a more useful item such as Leftovers, which mitigates the damage Obstagoon takes from its burn, greatly increasing its longevity. Meanwhile, Obstagoon can Bulk Up against Ghost-types that fail to damage it like non-Focus Sash Calyrex-S, physically offensive Giratina-O, and Shedinja, which makes it extremely menacing against most physical walls; at +1, Ice Punch OHKOes Zygarde before Power Construct, and Fire Punch Obstagoon OHKOes Ferrothorn. Obstagoon can opt for Parting Shot to become an offensive pivot. An Adamant nature maximizes its offensive presence, and once boosted, allows it to OHKO Lunala with Knock Off and offers a decent chance to OHKO Yveltal and specially defensive Necrozma-DM with a burn-boosted Facade or Knock Off, respectively. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie with Rayquaza and always outrun many foes with less than 95 base Speed like Groudon, Kyogre, Zekrom, and Ho-Oh; however, Obstagoon prefers the consistent wallbreaking power that an Adamant nature provides.</p> <p>Obstagoon is mostly used on bulky offense teams, where its ability to threaten defensive staples like Xerneas, Lunala, Kyogre, and Yveltal is appreciated by offensive cleaners like Bulk Up Marshadow, Dragon Dance Zekrom, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Also, they break through Eternatus with more ease than Obstagoon, and in return, Obstagoon can either give its teammates more setup opportunities with Parting Shot or wear down its teammates' checks with its STAB moves. It also serves as the best answer to Choice-locked Calyrex-S; on top of being immune to both its Psychic- and Ghost-type moves, Calyrex-S will be crippled by Flame Orb if it uses Trick on Obstagoon, while Obstagoon can later Trick its received Choice item back to another foe thanks to Switcheroo. While using Obstagoon, it's extremely important to play cautiously around Knock Off users before it has activated its Flame Orb, as Obstagoon is dead weight prior to activation. Yveltal is able to choose between more offensive sets featuring Life Orb, Hone Claws, or even a Choice item because Obstagoon's presence relieves some of the pressure on it. Obstagoon is hindered by entry hazards, so it appreciates Defog support: Ho-Oh, in particular, melts entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM and can Thunder Wave foes like Eternatus and Yveltal, which lets Obstagoon outspeed and 2HKO them reliably with Facade. Wish support from Clefable and Blissey vastly increase Obstagoon's longevity, letting it break through the opposing team more reliably. Blissey can also Thunder Wave foes like Marshadow and Yveltal on an anticipated switch in, which Obstagoon can capitalizes on to KO them. Glare Zygarde is another great paralysis spreader that switches into Marshadow for Obstagoon, while Substitute + Dragon Dance Zygarde takes advantage of burned foes like Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Groudon to use Substitute. SubSeed Calyrex-S and SubSeed Calyrex-I take advantage of burned foes like Yveltal and Necrozma-DM to put immense pressure on the opposing team; also, they can OHKO Eternatus with their STAB moves. The latter especially likes the support Obstagoon offers in dealing with opposing Calyrex-S. Obstagoon can also be used in Sticky Web teams, which make up for its middling Speed and makes a Guts-boosted Obstagoon extremely difficult to stop. In return, Obstagoon is an excellent Calyrex-S switch-in, one of the best anti-offense tools which can easily revenge kill Obstagoon's teammates. It also threatens the most common Defog users in the tier, such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Lunala, but can't switch into them repeatedly.</p>"

  "Dracovish": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Dracovish's mediocre stats are unimpressive at best when compared to other Ubers Pokemon. However, it has one of the strongest moves in the game, Fishious Rend, and an incredible ability in Strong Jaw. These factors combined make it a potentially dangerous wallbreaker. Dracovish preys on common defensive staples such as Necrozma-DM, Blissey, and Ho-Oh with Fishious Rend. However, its weakness to status and lackluster defensive stats make it difficult to switch in and give it mediocre defensive utility, only really being able to check Kyogre and offensive Necrozma-DM in a pinch. This means that while Dracovish can be a scary wallbreaker against slower teams, it offers little utility against faster, more offensive teams. Finally, without any recovery, Dracovish is vulnerable to getting worn down quickly and needs to be played carefully to make use of its capability throughout the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sand Rush set running Earthquake instead of Psychic Fangs and Low Kick over Crunch can be used on dedicated sand teams to bypass Dracovish's low Speed. However, Sand Rush Dracovish requires a lot of support, and Dracovish on sand teams faces competition from Excadrill, making this set rather niche. Possible coverage options such as Low Kick and Ice Fang seem appealing at first, but Fishious Rend is nearly as strong as Low Kick and Ice Fang against targets such as Ferrothorn and Zarude, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Water-resistant foes such as Eternatus, Zarude, Ferrothorn, Giratina, and Zekrom make it difficult for Dracovish to make progress. Eternatus tanks Fishious Rend from both Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets without rain active and threatens Dracovish out with its Dragon-type STAB move. However, it must be wary of Dracovish's coverage options. Physically defensive Zarude and the rarer Tangrowth are the best Dracovish answers, but both can be overwhelmed by rain-boosted Fishious Rend, and rain also limits Zarude's ability to heal off repeated attacks. Ferrothorn and Giratina can take Choice Scarf Dracovish's attacks reasonably well, but they can get worn down by repeated attacks and overwhelmed by the raw power of Choice Band Dracovish, especially with rain support. Lunala, although not a Water-resistant Pokemon, can tank Choice Band-boosted Fishious Rend well due to Shadow Shield and threaten Dracovish back with crippling status. However, it must be wary of a Choice Band-boosted Crunch outdamaging Roost's recovery. Zekrom must watch out for Dracovish's Dragon-type STAB moves, but it is able to take Fishious Rend due to its typing and use Dracovish as a setup opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage, Status, and Knock Off</strong>: Residual damage, status, and Knock Off cripple Dracovish. Residual damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and status greatly limits its longevity, which is made worse by Dracovish's lack of recovery and resistances to residual damage. Status ailments such as paralysis and burn cripple Dracovish's offensive capabilities, and they are commonly dished out by many of Dracovish's best targets, such as Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM. Yveltal and Necrozma-DM can remove Dracovish's item with Knock Off, making it easier for Pokemon such as Eternatus to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster offensive threats such as Calyrex-S, Marshadow, offensive Eternatus, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Zekrom can use Dracovish as an opportunity to either wallbreak or set up. Hyper offense teams in particular deserve a mention, as Dracovish has very little utility against them except for stomaching one attack from Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM or Choice Specs Kyogre.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fishious Rend is the primary source of Dracovish's power and OHKOes common defensive Pokemon such as specially defensive Necrozma-DM with Choice Band. Choice Band-boosted Outrage OHKOes specially defensive Eternatus, which can switch into Fishous Rend. Dracovish can choose to run Dragon Rush over Outrage on the Choice Band set, giving it a favorable chance to OHKO specially defensive Eternatus without locking it into Outrage. Psychic Fangs serves as a solid mid-ground attack, dealing heavy damage to Eternatus without fear of being locked into a move or missing. Crunch outdamages Roost on defensive Lunala, which Fishious Rend is unable to do, and prevents Shedinja from walling Dracovish. Strong Jaw gives a 1.5x damage boost to Fishious Rend, Crunch, and Psychic Fangs. Choice Band allows Dracovish to crush bulky teams and gives it OHKO potential against many threats, while Choice Scarf lets it outspeed defensive Pokemon such as Yveltal and defensive Eternatus, maintain Fishious Rend's power, and gain more opportunities to clean faster teams. An Adamant nature is crucial for certain damage rolls against its common checks such as Eternatus. On the other hand, a Jolly nature allows Dracovish to outspeed certain threats such as fast Eternatus and Jolly Marshadow with Choice Scarf or Sticky Web support.</p> <p>Dracovish fits on teams that appreciate its wallbreaking abilities and can offer the necessary support for it to thrive. Kyogre's rain boosts Dracovish's power and reduces the need to predict, as even switch-ins like Eternatus cannot safely take Fishous Rend in rain; in return, Kyogre appreciates Dracovish taking advantage of Blissey and helping to overwhelm Water-resistant foes such as Eternatus and Ferrothorn. Pivot support is crucial for Dracovish; while it has decent bulk and a defensive typing, its lack of recovery and weakness to status make pivot support crucial to give Dracovish opportunities to wallbreak. As such, pivots like Teleport Blissey, U-turn Yveltal, and U-turn Landorus-T are great teammates for Dracovish. Clerics such as Calyrex-S, defensive Xerneas, and Blissey give Dracovish more leeway in absorbing status. Choice Band Dracovish should be used as a wallbreaker, specializing in defeating slower, bulkier teams. Therefore, a team with Choice Band Dracovish should be built to allow it multiple opportunities to break down defensive cores, and the player must use smart double switches and pivots to get in Dracovish against a Pokemon it is able to threaten. Due to Choice Band Dracovish's poor defensive profile and low Speed, it finds itself struggling to keep pace with faster, more offensive teams. As such, it appreciates fast teammates that can outspeed and beat offense teams, such as Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Meanwhile, Choice Scarf Dracovish is better utilized as a strong cleaner. Lacking Choice Band's OHKO potential against bulkier teams, Choice Scarf Dracovish in particular appreciates other offensive teammates like Marshadow, Dragon Dance Zygarde, and Choice Specs Calyrex-S to break down defensive cores and entry hazard support, such as Spikes from Ferrothorn, to compensate the lack of power.</p>"

  "Eternatus": {
    "overview": "<p>Eternatus is one of the big three threats in Ubers due to its ability to check Yveltal, causing it to be found on the vast majority of teams. Additionally, it's the premier Kyogre check thanks to its typing, great bulk, Speed, reliable recovery, and access to strong damaging and support moves. It also provides important role compression and soft checks a variety of threats, most notably Ho-Oh and Marshadow. Eternatus is also an offensively threatening Pokemon in its own right with its high offensive stats, backed by strong attacks such as Dynamax Cannon, Sludge Bomb, Flamethrower, and Meteor Beam. Eternatus is one of the best poison spreaders around with access to Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Sludge Bomb; it is also immune to Toxic and clears opposing Toxic Spikes. Although Pressure is a mostly useless ability, Eternatus does at least have the attributes to realistically PP stall when utilized on defensive teams. Simply put, Eternatus is a highly customizable Pokemon that can adapt its moveset, item, and EV spread to accommodate its team's weaknesses. However, apart from a Water-type resistance and Toxic immunity, its defensive typing isn't great; it takes heavy damage from Psychic-, Ground-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves, which are all fairly common.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Tail can be used to phaze setup sweepers and other common specially defensive switch-ins to Eternatus such as Ho-Oh and Blissey. An offensive set with Agility can be utilized as a bulky cleaner that, after a turn of setup, can outspeed the entire tier, including Choice Scarf Calyrex-S.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM is immune to poison, resists Dynamax Cannon, and tanks Fire-type coverage somewhat well via Prism Armor, making it an effective and prevalent check to Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Mewtwo, opposing Eternatus, and Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan, Dugtrio, and Ditto have the Speed, power, and type advantage to outspeed and KO Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey heals Eternatus's poison with Natural Cure and Aromatherapy, and its massive special bulk enables it to tank all of Eternatus's attacks easily.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: With its high special bulk in sand, Tyranitar is fairly effective at checking offensive Eternatus and can paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Although niche, Heatran is effective at switching into just about every move Eternatus typically runs.</p> <p><strong>Sticky Web and Paralysis</strong>: Much of Eternatus's capacity to check offensive threats is diminished when its Speed is lowered, making Sticky Web and paralysis decent counterplay against it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set serves as a solid special wall, capable of checking Yveltal and Kyogre. Flamethrower hits Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic and resist Eternatus's Dragon-type STAB moves. Flamethrower is typically used over Mystical Fire for its significantly higher Base Power and possibility to burn Necrozma-DM; however, it can be dropped to prevent special attackers from breaking past Eternatus. Sludge Bomb prevents Xerneas from setting up in front of Eternatus and can poison foes that often switch into it, such as Ho-Oh. Toxic Spikes may be used over Sludge Bomb as a niche method of spreading poison even when Eternatus is not on the field. Since Eternatus often switches into Yveltal, it will usually absorb Knock Off, limiting the practicality of certain items. Heavy-Duty Boots is used to eliminate entry hazards' impact on Eternatus without entry hazard removal. A combination of Draco Meteor and Eject Pack may be used to gain early offensive momentum. Draco Meteor also affords Eternatus extra power, which can be especially helpful against Marshadow, and gives it an option to escape trappers like Block Kyogre and Dugtrio. 92 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Eternatus to outspeed Adamant Marshadow, along with key threats such as non-Choice Scarf Kyogre, Yveltal, Landorus, and Palkia; the remaining EVs are used to maximize special bulk to better tackle Yveltal and Kyogre. Several different Speed benchmarks can be utilized, most notably 24 EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Landorus in exchange for additional special bulk. Shuca Berry, Haban Berry, and Sitrus Berry are all consumable items that fit Eternatus's tendency to tank Knock Off and limit its risk against Poltergeist Marshadow while also allowing customization for teams to increase Eternatus's durability against certain offensive threats. Black Sludge may be used to increase the difficulty of 2HKOing Eternatus and reduce the effects of entry hazards over time.</p> <p>Specially defensive Eternatus is one of the most important role compressors in the tier and finds itself on a wide variety of teams without requiring any specific teammates or support. Other defensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Yveltal, and Xerneas naturally find themselves paired with Eternatus on bulky offense and balance teams. Sun team staples such as Groudon and Ho-Oh need a strong defense against Kyogre, which begins with Eternatus.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Meteor Beam requires a Power Herb but lets Eternatus blast through Ho-Oh and Yveltal, both of which are common Defoggers, and boosts Special Attack to increase its potency as a cleaner or wallbreaker. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types, mainly Xerneas, which can be very important for offense teams that struggle to prevent it from switching in and setting up. Sludge Wave is interchangeable with Sludge Bomb as a marginally more powerful STAB option with a lower chance to inflict poison; it should be noted that poison can be especially effective against Yveltal, Kyogre, and Lunala, and it typically doesn't miss out on any significant KOs. Substitute pairs well with Thunder Wave users, most notably Necrozma-DM, to help Eternatus function as a setup sweeper. Flamethrower is an important coverage move for common Steel-types that resist Dynamax Cannon, such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill, and also lets Eternatus bust through other defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Shedinja, Skarmory, Magearna, and Corviknight. Toxic Spikes can be utilized in the first moveslot for teams that capitalize on spreading poison or stacking entry hazards.</p> <p>Meteor Beam Eternatus is typically limited to hyper offense teams that maintain momentum, especially in the entry hazard war, and do not require a more sturdy, reactive Eternatus to keep Pokemon such as Kyogre, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh in check. Apart from this, Eternatus is an important Pokemon that finds itself on many teams and doesn't require any specific support to function. Meteor Beam Eternatus will nearly always finds itself paired with Yveltal to offensively cover Calyrex-S, one of the few Pokemon capable of revenge killing it. Thunder Wave Necrozma-DM is another natural match that is equally offensively inclined. Major offensive threats such as Calyrex-S, Kyogre, and Zygarde-C are great partners to match with Meteor Beam Eternatus that take advantage of its important role compression. Offensive entry hazard removal, such as Cloyster or Aerodactyl is appreciated to remove Sticky Web, which robs Meteor Beam Eternatus of its ability to clean.</p>"

      "Demon (Cosmic Power)": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Eternatus's high Speed, immunity to Toxic, access to Recover, and Pressure, Cosmic Power turns it into one of the metagame's hardest Pokemon to stop. Notably, Cosmic Power improves the matchup against certain Kyogre sets such as Block and SubCM. Meteor Beam gives Eternatus a useful secondary attack that also boosts its Special Attack stat. Since this set tends to prolong games, Dragon Pulse is the preferred STAB option due to its much higher PP. However, Dynamax Cannon is useful to bluff other Eternatus sets; in particular, this can lure in Ho-Oh, which is KOed by Meteor Beam after taking Dynamax Cannon. The given Speed EVs with Timid outspeed Jolly Marshadow, which could otherwise steal Eternatus's boosts with Spectral Thief. The rest are dumped into Special Defense and HP to better take on Kyogre. Alternative items such as Shuca Berry, Haban Berry, Air Balloon, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Black Sludge are all viable options that can patch up structural weaknesses on your team.</p> <p>While this set may appear extremely hard to stop, it has a few weaknesses. Due to its lack of Fire-type coverage, Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn can be hard to muscle through. Necrozma-DM can paralyze Eternatus and fish for flinches with Iron Head or use it to set up. Ferrothorn's Leech Seed also causes significant problems. Calyrex-S can cripple Eternatus with Trick, Blissey can stall it with Confide, and Groudon can force it out through pure strength. Meteor Beam's charge turn without Power Herb can also prove detrimental, allowing Ho-Oh to force it out with Whirlwind or Zygarde to switch in and paralyze with Glare. Additionally, this set starts out more passive than other Eternatus sets, since it can't spread status with Toxic and it can't punish Steel-type switch-ins. Due to all these factors, Eternatus serves best as an endgame wincon, meaning that it has to rely on its teammates to do much of the wallbreaking. Switch-ins to Necrozma-DM like Groudon, Zygarde, Zekrom, and Kyogre work well, and all are strong wallbreakers in their own right. Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Rayquaza, and Calyrex-I deserve mention as teammates that can lure in and KO or heavily damage Necrozma-DM; meanwhile, Magnezone can trap and eliminate most Necrozma-DM. Non-Eternatus Knock Off absorbers such as defensive Xerneas, Zygarde, Buzzwole, and Zamazenta-C are great to to keep Power Herb; additionally, the aforementioned teammates love Meteor Beam surprising and nailing Ho-Oh. While this Eternatus set does well against many Kyogre, Ice Beam sets pose a risk through freeze and critical hits; therefore, backup Kyogre responses such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, Zekrom, and Ferrothorn are appreciated. Dynamax Cannon sets can lure in and KO Ho-Oh, opening up holes for Calyrex-S, bulky setup Necrozma-DM, and Xerneas to exploit. Xerneas additionally provides Aromatherapy support, and Geomancy sets can force Blissey to run out of Confide PP.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Life Orb gives Eternatus immediate and reliable wallbreaking power, letting it function as both a versatile wallbreaker and cleaner at once. Recover is an important move, even on Life Orb Eternatus, allowing it to switch in more frequently and stick around longer; this is especially important due to Eternatus's status as an offensive check to Kyogre. However, on hyper offense teams, it is possible for Eternatus to run Meteor Beam with Sludge Bomb instead of Recover. Flamethrower is an important coverage move for common Steel-types that resist Dynamax Cannon, such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill, and also lets Eternatus bust through other defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Shedinja, Skarmory, Magearna, and Corviknight. Sludge Bomb importantly hits Fairy-types, particularly Xerneas, which offensive teams often struggle with. Sludge Wave is interchangeable with Sludge Bomb as a marginally more powerful STAB option with a lower chance to inflict poison, although the status is especially effective against Yveltal, Kyogre, and Lunala, and it typically doesn't miss out on any significant KOs. Toxic Spikes can be utilized over a Poison-type move or Meteor Beam for teams that capitalize on spreading poison or stacking entry hazards. The given EV spread maximizes Special Attack while still outspeeding Palkia and offers better special bulk for offensively checking Kyogre.</p> <p>Life Orb Eternatus is typically limited to hyper offense or bulky offense teams that maintain momentum and do not require a more sturdy, reactive Eternatus to keep Pokemon such as Kyogre, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh in check. Apart from this, Eternatus is an important Pokemon that finds itself on many teams and doesn't require any specific support to function. Life Orb Eternatus excels with sun and Spikes support to break its greatest check, Necrozma-DM, so Groudon and offensive Spikers such as Cloyster make for some of the best teammates. Eternatus virtually always finds itself paired with Yveltal, which is used on nearly all offensive teams to cover Calyrex-S, one of the few Pokemon capable of revenge killing Eternatus. Major offensive threats such as Calyrex-S, Kyogre, and Zygarde-C are natural partners to match with Life Orb Eternatus and take advantage of its important role compression. Entry hazard removal, particularly from offensive teammates such as Cloyster and Aerodactyl is appreciated to reduce Life Orb's impact and the frequency that Eternatus needs to use Recover; it also removes Sticky Web, which is very detrimental to Eternatus.</p>"

Flamethrower is run over Mystical Fire because physically defensive Eternatus should be paired with a Kyogre check, and Flamethrower has better damage output against defensive Steel-types and comes with a chance to burn. Mystical Fire still hits Steel-types hard while preventing special attackers from breaking through Eternatus if not using dedicated specially defensive sponges such as Blissey and Ferrothorn. Heavy-Duty Boots is used to eliminate entry hazards' impact on Eternatus without entry hazard removal. Black Sludge may be used to make it more difficult for foes to 2HKO Eternatus and reduces the effects of entry hazards over time. 216 Speed EVs allow Eternatus to outspeed neutral-natured Marshadow; the remaining EVs maximize physical bulk while recovering as much as possible with Black Sludge. An alternate EV spread of 176 HP / 240 Def / 92 Spe with a Timid nature slightly reduces Eternatus's physical bulk while gaining some substantial increases in special bulk to better check Kyogre.</p> <p>With physically defensive Eternatus, another Kyogre check is required, such as Ferrothorn, Palkia, or Blissey. Blissey is notable for serving as a blanket check to most special attackers, which could beat physically defensive Eternatus, while Eternatus checks several physical threats in return. Giratina is a notable partner for defensive teams; together, they provide a strong PP stall core.

Unseen Fist complements these traits well, preventing walls from using Protect to scout its moveset. Its Dark typing allows it to offensively answer one of the tier's scariest attackers in Calyrex-S. Urshifu-S unfortunately faces competition from Pokemon that it shares a type with such as Marshadow and Yveltal. Its typing also leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed or walled by Xerneas, one of the metagame's most prevalent Pokemon. While its Speed allows it to safely take on most walls, it gets outsped by opposing wallbreakers such as Landorus, Palkia, and Eternatus. Urshifu-S also struggles to remain effective in longer games, as its primary attacks only have 8 PP, making PP stalling an attack an effective strategy to deal with it.</p>",

Groudon is an incredible teammate for providing reliable sun to boost Zarude's Synthesis recovery and make it immune to status. Fighting-types like Marshadow, Urshifu-S, and Buzzwole are some physical attackers that Zarude can't handle, meaning teammates like Eternatus and Xerneas are helpful for covering those matchups. Without any Speed or Special Defense investment, Zarude can't reliably pressure Kyogre. This makes teammates like Blissey and specially defensive Eternatus necessary to have.</p>"

It is also extremely frail, leaving it weak to priority moves, and provides no defensive utility.</p>",

However, it cannot fit all of Rapid Spin, Wild Charge, and Explosion. Furthermore, it faces heavy competition from Grimmsnarl, which can set up dual screens more consistently thanks to its more useful defensive typing and utility moves such as Taunt and Thunder Wave. Thunder can be used on the special attacking set for increased firepower, achieving feats such as an OHKO on Yveltal and Ho-Oh and on Calyrex-S and offensive Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock chip damage, though the accuracy is prohibitive. If used, Kyogre is a great partner to provide rain to ensure it connects. Rising Voltage can also be used on the special-oriented set in conjunction with Tapu Koko over Rapid Spin or Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types such as Zygarde-C, Groudon, Excadrill, Landorus, and Gastrodon completely nullify Regieleki's powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn not only resists Electric-type moves but also withstands Explosion easily, and it can punish Rapid Spin with Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon</strong>: Dragon-types such as Eternatus and Zekrom resist Regieleki's Electric-type STAB moves, though they often have to be wary of Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-types can prevent Regieleki from spinning away hazards, though they must be wary of Assurance and Electric-type moves. Giratina and Giratina-O notably resist Regieleki's STAB moves and threaten it with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Regieleki takes heavy damage from priority attacks such as Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak.

Wild Charge is used over Thunderbolt to hit specially defensive targets such as Yveltal harder while maintaining Attack EVs to power up Explosion. Assurance allows Regieleki to revenge kill Calyrex-S or smack it as it tries to switch in and spinblock while also nailing Shedinja.

Explosion allows Regieleki to generate momentum, block Defog, and dent Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Eternatus, Zekrom, and Zygarde.</p> <p>Regieleki should be used on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its Rapid Spin support and revenge killing capabilities while not suffering too much from its lack of defensive utility, and is a nice teammate to Sticky Web setters such as Shuckle and Slurpuff. It often has to use Explosion against Electric-resistant Pokemon, so teammates that can take advantage of the free switch are great partners, such as Xerneas for Dragon-types and Kyogre for Ground-types.

Rapid Spin allows Regieleki to clear entry hazards in a pinch. Explosion prevents it from being total setup bait for Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Zekrom. A Rash nature is used instead of Mild in order to take priority attacks such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak a little better and increase damage output. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead of Life Orb to pivot more freely throughout a match.</p> <p>As Regieleki often pivots out against bulky Electric-resistant Pokemon, Pokemon such as Xerneas and Eternatus that can threaten them out help Regieleki wear them down over time.

Between its typing, low Attack, and Will-O-Wisp, Spectrier's Substitute will not be broken by Yveltal's burned Foul Play or U-turn, thus making Yveltal complete setup fodder. This means Spectrier is very matchup-dependent, as common Pokemon such as Knock Off Yveltal, Ho-Oh, or Blissey spell doom for Spectrier. It is also reliant on Will-O-Wisp to power up Hex, and its low bulk means it is easily revenge killed without Substitute up.</p>",

Its great bulk ensures that it can take a solid amount of hits, even the occasional super effective one if needed. With a wide movepool and diverse set options, Calyrex-I is versatile as well, making it unpredictable and able to take advantage of its checks depending on the set. However, a poor defensive typing heavily offsets its great bulk, giving it no relevant resistances and many common weaknesses such as Steel, Dark, Fire, and Ghost. Despite them having different roles, it faces competition from the superior, metagame-warping Calyrex-S because both formes can't be run on the same team. It is also vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards, hindering its ability to come in and out of the game to wallbreak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Trick Room set with Life Orb, Lum Berry, or Weakness Policy can be run in order to take advantage of faster checks such as Calyrex-S and offensive Necrozma-DM, but it lacks the snowball potential of SubSeed. A set consisting of Substitute, Iron Defense, and Body Press can make for a powerful wincon, but it is much harder to fit on most teams and often relies solely on its surprise factor. Swords Dance + Agility makes Calyrex-I a strong sweeper, and, combined with its natural bulk, it is easily capable of finding opportunities to set up. However, it fails to outspeed threats such as Calyrex-S at +2 and requires multiple turns to set up. Close Combat is able to hit Ferrothorn harder than anything else Calyrex-I commonly runs. However, it is weaker against Necrozma-DM. Seed Bomb is useful for hitting Kyogre, but it hits nothing else and can be easily taken advantage of if locked into.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB Moves</strong>: While its bulk is great enough to survive many neutral and super effective hits, Calyrex-I greatly fears users of super effective STAB moves. Marshadow can steal possible boosts from Calyrex-I and revenge kill it without an issue. Offensive variants of Yveltal and Ho-Oh have no problem using Knock Off or Sacred Fire, respectively, to stop Calyrex-I in its tracks. Its own cousin, Calyrex-S, can use a Choice Specs-boosted Astral Barrage to cleanly dispose of Calyrex-I. All of these are outsped in Trick Room; however, Yveltal and Marshadow can still use Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: With a bit of Speed investment, defensive Necrozma-DM can effectively handle all Calyrex-I variants thanks to Prism Armor, apart from the rare Substitute + Iron Defense one. It can constantly heal against SubSeed Calyrex-I thanks to its lower overall power while setting entry hazards, inflicting status on it, and chipping it with Sunsteel Strike and possible Rocky Helmet damage. Facing a Choice Band Calyrex-I is a bit harder, but potential Rocky Helmet damage will eventually wear Calyrex-I down.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: With its solid bulk and Ice resistance, Kyogre can check, or even counter, Calyrex-I with both offensive and defensive sets. Choice Specs and Choice Scarf variants will almost always OHKO with a full health Water Spout, while defensive variants can always break a Calyrex-I Substitute, even outside of rain. It only fears a Trick or the rare Seed Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock heavily cuts into Calyrex-I's HP every time it comes in, mandating Defog support. Toxic Spikes chip damage is also an annoyance. Heavy-Duty Boots sets do not have this problem, although they have to watch out for Knock Off.</p>",

Glacial Lance provides solid neutral coverage as Calyrex-I's sole attacking move. Swords Dance makes Calyrex-I more threatening and helps it break past Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM. Leech Seed allows Calyrex-I to passively pressure its few switch-ins while maintaining its health. Leftovers stacks nicely with Leech Seed and lets Calyrex-I set more Substitutes, while Heavy-Duty Boots is especially useful for its Stealth Rock weakness.

A Defogger such as Yveltal or Ho-Oh is greatly appreciated, especially with variants that run Leftovers. They can also further weaken Necrozma-DM with Knock Off or status, respectively. Defensive Dragon-types such as Eternatus and Zygarde can switch into threatening Dark- and Ghost-types such as Yveltal, Urshifu-S, and Marshadow lacking Ice Punch.

Trick can beat its best check, Yveltal, with a few correct predictions; Aromatherapy provides invaluable team support; Nasty Plot will boost its Special Attack to sky-high levels; and Leech Seed + Substitute can wipe out any team unprepared for it. Calyrex-S also makes for the best revenge killer in the tier, keeping hyper offense at bay. While Calyrex-S has a terrible defensive typing, leaving it easily revenge killed by Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, its defenses are workable enough to come into battle on neutral hits. Calyrex-S is strong enough that it is the most prepared-for Pokemon in the metagame. Many teams will carry at least two, if not three, checks to it. Even still, this Pokemon has little to no flaws and should be considered for nearly every team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative SubSeed set using Taunt and Hex is an option; notably, this prevents Taunt Yveltal, Whirlwind Ho-Oh, Blissey, and Roar Kyogre from breaking through, and it gives Calyrex-S a higher-PP attack to work with. The problem is that this set relies on teammates to spread status and set entry hazards to take off, as lacking Nasty Plot makes it harder to pressure the opposing team. Pollen Puff is a niche option to hit Zarude and Tyranitar switch-ins harder. Will-O-Wisp could be run to cripple common switch-ins such as Yveltal, but it simply does not provide as much utility as Aromatherapy or Nasty Plot does.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots Yveltal can switch into any attack and proceed to force Calyrex-S out. Yveltal lacking Choice Scarf needs to be wary of Trick, as this can force the team into very difficult situations, especially in combination with entry hazards or status. Sets lacking Snarl, Taunt, or an Attack-invested U-turn will lose to SubSeed Calyrex-S, and only the bulkiest of Yveltal will avoid the 2HKO from +2 Draining Kiss. Even still, Calyrex-S must always be wary of Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types besides Yveltal such as Zarude and Tyranitar are bulky enough to take Astral Barrage and force Calyrex-S out. These Pokemon have worse recovery options than Yveltal, and they must also be wary of Trick. The rare Pollen Puff will do massive damage to them, as well. Offensive Dark-types such as Urshifu-S, Weavile, and Hydreigon can bring some security against Calyrex-S on more offensive teams.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Blissey fears Psyshock, but it can switch into a Choice-locked Astral Barrage with impunity. The rare Porygon2 completely walls most Calyrex-S. Both Pokemon are severely crippled by Trick, albeit giving Calyrex-S a useless item instead of Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Marshadow and Giratina-O can help to keep Calyrex-S at bay with Shadow Sneak. They cannot take Astral Barrage at all and thus can only revenge kill Calyrex-S.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Tanks</strong>: Ho-Oh and Kyogre have enough special bulk to force Calyrex-S out in a pinch. They can phaze SubSeed sets with Whirlwind or Roar. However, both will get 2HKOed by Choice Specs Astral Barrage and they cannot take boosted hits. Trick also severely limits them.</p> <p><strong>PP Stalling</strong>: Eternatus, but also some lesser-used Pokemon such as Dialga, Palkia, and Weavile, have Pressure, which can quickly lower Astral Barrage's already low 8 PP. Normal-types such as Blissey can also switch into Astral Barrage for free. This can be critical to stopping a Calyrex-S sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>This is the standard Calyrex-S set. Astral Barrage is powerful and accurate and will do massive damage to anything that's not a Dark- or Normal-type. However, you must be careful to keep its limited PP high enough. Repeatedly hitting Yveltal, Blissey, and Eternatus with it can quickly drain its PP to little effect and limit Calyrex-S's sweeping potential. Psyshock does massive damage to Blissey, which would otherwise wall Calyrex-S. Trick is the best third option by far. Yveltal, the main check to Calyrex-S, will lose its Heavy-Duty Boots, meaning Stealth Rock can repeatedly damage it when Calyrex-S forces it in. If Trick hits something other than Yveltal, that Pokemon will likely become useless and create an opening for the rest of your team to exploit. However, be careful not to use Knock Off recklessly with your teammates after this. Aromatherapy is immensely valuable, as paralysis and Toxic are very strong in Ubers, and clerics are rare. If a cleric is already on your team, Nasty Plot is effective to pressure Yveltal even further after using Trick on it. Nasty Plot works best on Choice Specs sets, as Yveltal will not gain any Speed from Trick. Choice Scarf will allow Calyrex-S to revenge kill nearly anything in the game, even if they're at +2 Speed. Choice Specs brings more damage against balance and stall teams, helping it revenge kill bulky setup Pokemon such as Groudon, but using Trick can be more dangerous if you can't catch Yveltal.</p> <p>The key to using this set is deciding whether and when to use Trick. Being too hesitant will lose you momentum whenever you just waste an Astral Barrage on a Yveltal switch-in. Using Trick too early can lose Calyrex-S the power or Speed needed to take out a dangerous threat. However, if you do land Trick at the right time, it can potentially make the game basically a 6-5 matchup. It is useful to decide Trick usage by Team Preview. For example, if you are running Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and you see that the opponent has no Speed-boosting threats, then you are relatively free to use Trick without much trouble. If you have used Trick on Yveltal, setting up Stealth Rock is key to damage it over time. If Yveltal gets chipped enough, it may attempt to stay in on Calyrex-S to either use Roost or Defog; if you predict this correctly, you can gain the advantage by either using Nasty Plot and sweeping, or by using Psyshock until you predict Yveltal will switch out and using Astral Barrage on that turn. Necrozma-DM makes a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock and, at the same time, pressure Yveltal coming in to use Defog with Thunder Wave and Iron Head. Since Calyrex-S has no recovery and mediocre bulk, it works best if switched in by a pivot move or a double switch. Its special bulk is decent enough to switch into Pokemon like Eternatus without too much trouble, but it can't do it repeatedly. U-turn Yveltal makes a great partner to the Choice Scarf set, as not only will it allow Calyrex-S to switch in safely, but the combination of the two will give you a safe defense against an opposing SubSeed Calyrex-S. Make sure Yveltal has Attack investment for this, or else it will not break the opposing Calyrex-S's Substitute. Switch-ins to Yveltal, other Dark-types, and Marshadow are very much appreciated for this set. Eternatus, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth are good to switch into Yveltal and take Knock Off well. Physically defensive Eternatus, Buzzwole, Tangrowth, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde are some notable Marshadow switch-ins. Groudon can lure in Yveltal and KO it with Stone Edge. For the best effect, use a Groudon that is EVed to survive a Foul Play after one Swords Dance. If Calyrex-S is running Nasty Plot, Blissey, Xerneas, and Clefable are good partners to fill the cleric role instead.</p>"

This matchup lets it easily sweep when given the chance, making it more matchup dependent than other Calyrex-S sets. The combination of Substitute, Leech Seed, and Leftovers means that Yveltal switch-ins will eventually have to use Roost, which gives Calyrex-S a free turn of setup with Nasty Plot. Setting up lets it eventually plow through many Dark-types with Astral Barrage, but be wary of its low PP. The given EVs ensure that Calyrex-S's Substitute will survive an 8 Attack EV Yveltal U-turn. More HP or Defense investment could be used for Attack-invested Yveltal, but running too much can compromise Calyrex-S's Special Attack or Speed.</p> <p>Leech Seed can cause many switches, so it has great synergy with any teammates that can set up entry hazards or dish out status, which further wear down foes for a sweep. Necrozma-DM, Groudon, Zygarde, Ferrothorn, and Blissey are some notable options. Pokemon that can lure in and KO Zarude such as Heat Crash Groudon are great teammates, as Zarude hard walls this set, never giving Calyrex-S setup turns due to its Leech Seed immunity. Blissey is also a problematic foe, since Calyrex-S cannot damage it directly; therefore, any setup Pokemon with high Attack that can switch into Blissey for free is a good partner, like Groudon, Zekrom, Necrozma-DM, or Marshadow. Since this set loses out on providing a lot of the utility of Choice-item Calyrex-S, priority users such as Marshadow and Sucker Punch Yveltal may be beneficial to revenge kill threats. Clerics such as Blissey, Xerneas, and Clefable similarly take up a role that this set drops. Whirlwind Ho-Oh is capable of forcing this set out, so Ho-Oh lures such as Rock Tomb Marshadow, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Stone Edge Necrozma-DM can make this matchup much easier.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions the best on hyper offense teams, which can best deny opposing entry hazards to keep its Focus Sash intact. The set is fairly straightforward: set up using Nasty Plot and hopefully be able to 2HKO Yveltal with Draining Kiss, forcing Yveltal to choose between beating Calyrex-S and getting rid of entry hazards. Astral Barrage and Psyshock beat the vast majority of the metagame after a Nasty Plot boost. Draining Kiss hits the Dark-types that resist Calyrex-S's STAB attacks, and it will 2HKO any Yveltal at +2 unless it has high HP and Special Defense investment. Draining Kiss can also regain HP, so it is helpful to make Focus Sash usable if Calyrex-S takes chip damage. Modest could be run so that this set will 2HKO even the bulkiest of Yveltal, but losing the Speed tie to other Calyrex-S can be difficult to manage, especially on hyper offense teams.</p> <p>One must also be wary of Sucker Punch Yveltal, which can potentially take out this set after it has used its Focus Sash. It is possible to play mind games if you know Yveltal has Sucker Punch by using Nasty Plot on its Sucker Punch turns, especially since Sucker Punch only has 8 PP, but it's better to avoid this situation if possible, as one wrong prediction lets Yveltal KO with any other attack. Slurpuff and Shuckle are natural hyper offense partners to set up Sticky Web; they also have the best chance of preventing the opponent from laying their own entry hazards. Choice Specs Kyogre makes a great partner, since it pressures teams to sacrifice their Yveltal in order to remove Sticky Web, which can create a huge opening for Calyrex-S to exploit. Weavile is notable for being able to set up if this set gets revenge killed by Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Froslass or Aerodactyl could also be run to set up Spikes or Stealth Rock, respectively, and prevent foes from laying hazards with Taunt. Aerodactyl with Defog, Pheromosa, and Regieleki are hyper offense-specific partners that can get rid of hazards mid-game, which can be useful for this set.</p>"

      "Disable": {
        "description": "<p>Disable makes it difficult for many Yveltal sets to consistently check Calyrex-S. Since most Yveltal only run one Dark-type move, the combination of Substitute and Disable can effectively render it useless. Disable, in comparison to Leech Seed, has the benefit of 100% accuracy and the ability to affect Grass-types such as Zarude. It also works well with Mental Herb, which lets Calyrex-S feign a Choice item and prevents Taunt from Yveltal. Additionally, against Choice item users or foes with one attack such as many Calm Mind Kyogre sets, Calyrex-S can use Disable to prevent them from attacking, giving it some unique defensive utility and setup opportunities. The given EVs stop 32 Attack Adamant Yveltal from breaking Substitute with U-turn, and the Special Defense EVs ensure Dynamax Cannon from Eternatus cannot 2HKO Calyrex-S. The Special Attack EVs guarantee a 2HKO on any Yveltal and an OHKO on Ho-Oh after two boosts. The HP investment optimizes Leftovers healing, which gives Calyrex-S more chances to make Substitutes at the cost of losing to Taunt Yveltal.</p> <p>The best way for Calyrex-S to set up is to force out Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Eternatus, giving it a free opportunity to use Nasty Plot or Substitute. Yveltal will be forced to attack, which will break Calyrex-S's Substitute and make it susceptible to Disable. A successful Disable will allow Calyrex-S to further set-up without much worry. If expecting a switch, using Substitute instead of Disable will allow Calyrex-S to scout the opposing team for Choice Scarf users or fast attackers like Marshadow. Additionally, Pokemon that live a +2 Astral Barrage such as Eternatus and Ho-Oh can break Calyrex-S's Substitute or phaze it with Whirlwind, preventing it from sweeping. As such, using Nasty Plot on the turn they come in will allow Calyrex-S to OHKO either threat at +4. In general, teammates that can weaken Eternatus and Ho-Oh make Calyrex-S's life much easier. Ho-Oh and Kyogre are fantastic to paralyze and hinder Eternatus, while Zygarde, Zekrom, Meteor Beam Eternatus, Rock Slide Buzzwole, and Stone Edge Necrozma-DM are good options to pressure Ho-Oh. Since Calyrex-S, especially Mental Herb variants, needs to come in with high HP to be able to fish with Substitute, the ability to get it in safely is critical. Eject Pack Eternatus is particularly great at bringing Calyrex-S in against Necrozma-DM; other useful options include U-turn Yveltal, Teleport Blissey, and Landorus-T. Groudon is a classic teammate for Calyrex-S thanks to pressuring Yveltal through brute force or status, and its breaking power is much appreciated against Blissey teams.</p>"
