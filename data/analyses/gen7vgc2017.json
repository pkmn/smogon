  "Vikavolt": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Vikavolt is unique in the metagame thanks to the combination of its typing, its ability Levitate, and its access to Electroweb.</li> <li>It has an incredibly efficient base stat spread, boasting a base 145 Special Attack stat and respectable 77 / 90 / 75 bulk.</li> <li>Vikavolt can fill a variety of roles thanks to its diverse movepool. It can disrupt, act as a pivot with Volt Switch, control speed with Electroweb and String Shot, and fire off high damage attacks.</li> <li>Thanks to Levitate, it's one of the few Pokemon making the Discharge + Earthquake combination possible.</li> <li>However, Vikavolt sits at a bit of an awkward base 43 Speed stat, and other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Magnezone are better alternatives if speed control or Levitate is not required.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Energy Ball targets Gastrodon, but it hits little Pokemon outside of that.</li> <li>Mud Shot can be used for the Speed decrease, but it doesn't gain STAB, unlike Electroweb, making the latter a more favorable choice.</li> <li>Sky Drop removes foes from the field, which is quite useful, but due to Vikavolt's low Speed, it rarely gets to use the move without being attacked first.</li> <li>Flash Cannon is super effective against Alolan Ninetales and hits Vanilluxe and Gigalith harder, but it hits nothing that resists Vikavolt's STAB moves.</li> <li>Vikavolt can run a more aggressive set using damage boosting items such as Life Orb or Choice Specs, but it is generally not recommended, as these sets don't capitalize on Vikavolt's amazing defensive capabilities.</li> <li>Minimum Speed with a Quiet nature is an option for Trick Room teams, although Vikavolt's niche is with Electroweb and String Shot, and this is slightly conflicting with a Trick Room set.</li> <li>A Z-Crystal could be used for the String Shot set, giving access to Gigavolt Havoc or Savage Spin-Out.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Torkoal and Arcanine threaten Vikavolt, as they can KO Vikavolt with their powerful STAB moves. Arcanine, can knock out Vikavolt easily in one hit with Flare Blitz or a Z-Move, unless it is afflicted with Intimidate or if rain is on the field. Despite this, Vikavolt still hits it hard with Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, so Arcanine needs to secure the knock out to be an effective check.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Nihilego and Gigalith pose problems for Vikavolt. It can't really touch Gigalith, especially when sand is up, and Vikavolt can get knocked out easily by Stone Edge or a Z-Move. The best thing Vikavolt can do when up against Gigalith is use Volt Switch to bring in a check or counter. Nihilego forces Vikavolt out with Power Gem, and Vikavolt can't deal any significant damage because of Nihilego's high Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele checks Vikavolt, as it can outspeed and knock it out with a Shattered Psyche while Psychic Terrain is up, even when Vikavolt is using the Assault Vest set.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Although it takes a while due to Vikavolt's impressive bulk, Porygon2 can beat Vikavolt one-on-one thanks to its access to Recover.</p> <p><strong>Lightning Rod</strong>: With Electroweb being Vikavolt's niche, it finds itself struggling against Pokemon with Lightning Rod, such as Togedemaru and Alolan Marowak, which can exploit its Electric-type STAB moves by gaining a Special Attack boost.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Thunderbolt and Bug Buzz are the standard STAB moves for strong and reliable damage.</li> <li>Discharge can be used when paired with a Ground-type such as Garchomp or Krookodile.</li> <li>Volt Switch lets Vikavolt punish switches, switching in and out of battle while dealing respectable amounts of damage.</li> <li>Electroweb is an excellent speed control option that works with Assault Vest.</li> <li>Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice can be used if you need more answers to Kartana or Garchomp on your team, respectively. Both can be omitted for triple Electric moves, as you still deal respectable damage to either Pokemon with Bug Buzz.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Levitate gives Vikavolt an immunity to Ground-type moves.</li> <li>The defensive EV spread in combination with Assault Vest allows Vikavolt to survive a wide range of attacks, such as Gyarados's Hydro Vortex and Arcanine's Inferno Overdrive.

Vikavolt can threaten many of Garchomp's checks and counters such as Tapu Fini and Kartana, while Garchomp can use Earthquake freely because of Vikavolt's Levitate.</li> <li>In the same vein, Krookodile is an excellent partner. Although slower, it can benefit from the speed control Electroweb provides, while Intimidate enhances Vikavolt's defensive capabilities even further.</li> <li>Vikavolt wants to have team members that can handle key threats such as Arcanine and Gigalith. Ground-types do a fine job with that, but having a Water-type such as Politoed, Pelipper, Tapu Fini, or Gyarados is recommended.</li> <li>Vikavolt often struggles against the Tapu group, making Alolan Muk a good partner.</li> <li>Steel-types like Metagross and Kartana also handle the Tapu group, and they can take care of Rock-types as well.</li> </ul>"

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Tapu Koko is lightning-fast thanks to its incredible base 130 Speed, making it the second fastest unboosted Pokemon in VGC 2017, losing only to Pheromosa.</li> <li>It has a great offensive typing with passable coverage.</li> <li>The Electric Terrain it brings from its ability, Electric Surge, gives it very powerful Electric-type attacks. It also provides team support by blocking sleep and canceling other Terrains.</li> <li>It possesses incredible versatility and can be tailor-fit to various team compositions.</li> <li>Without Electric Terrain up, its damage output suffers rather heavily, as it only has base 95 Special Attack.</li> <li>Its high Speed can be a downfall against opposing island guardians, as its Electric Terrain is often replaced if they are sent out at the same time as Tapu Koko.</li> <li>Its physical movepool is very small, somewhat wasting its awesome base 115 Attack.</li> <li>Due to its heavy focus on Electric-type attacks, the Lightning Rod ability can nullify a hefty portion of Tapu Koko's offensive presence.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Tapu Koko has a massive list of alternative options that are often very team-specific and difficult to write an independent set about.</li> <li>Assault Vest Tapu Koko provides the team with a sturdy Electric-resistant Pokemon and a soft check to rain, surviving even Golduck's Hydro Vortex. With the increased Special Defense, it can take repeated hits from Tapu Fini. Assault Vest Tapu Koko typically runs enough Speed to outrun Gengar and has heavy bulk investment.</li> <li>Choice Specs gives Tapu Koko extra power and an extra attacking moveslot at the expense of flexibility.</li> <li>Focus Sash helps patch up Tapu Koko's frailty.</li> <li>Nature's Madness is a solid option on sets lacking heavy offensive investment, such as the Assault Vest set. Tapu Koko's Speed means it can often outrun its partner and get full value of its damage output.</li> <li>Wild Charge is a powerful physical attack that allows Tapu Koko to smash apart specially defensive targets such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Nihilego.</li> <li>Brave Bird hits Grass types such as Tapu Bulu and Lilligant and in general is a decent neutral coverage. However, it is not very strong, as it lacks the STAB boost.</li> <li>U-turn is significantly weaker than Volt Switch, but nothing is immune to it.</li> <li>Sky Drop is useful for temporarily disabling a threat so Tapu Koko's ally can set up. It cannot be redirected and can be used on the redirector to lift the redirection effect.</li> <li>Nature Power can be combined with other Terrains to give Tapu Koko a flexible access to coverage moves in a single moveslot. Combined with Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko gains access to Psychic, 2HKOing opposing Alolan Marowak. Combined with Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko gains Moonblast, OHKOing Garchomp and Krookodile. Combined with Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko can pick up a surprise KO on Gastrodon with Energy Ball.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ground deals heavy damage to Alolan Marowak, Magnezone, and Togedemaru.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire allows Tapu Koko to OHKO Assault Vest Kartana if it is holding a Life Orb.</li> <li>Tapunium Z turns Nature's Madness into Guardian of Alola, dealing a hefty 75% of the target's current HP. This is extremely useful for quickly chunking down Pokemon such as Marowak and Porygon2.</li> <li>Flyinium Z can be combined with Mirror Move to gain +2 Attack and a potential Z-Move version of the move it copies. Additionally, it gives Tapu Koko the option to use Supersonic Skystrike with Brave Bird. The combination of Supersonic Skystrike and Brave Bird KOes maximum HP Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>Choice Scarf is an odd option, as Tapu Koko is incredibly fast already, but it allows Tapu Koko to outpace Swift Swim Golduck in rain and pick up a surprise KO.</li> <li>Taunt can be used to stop foes from setting up and is best used with Focus Sash.</li> <li>Roar can stop Trick Room and phaze setup Pokemon.</li> <li>Tapu Koko's high Speed makes it a solid Reflect and Light Screen user. With Electric Terrain and Nature's Madness, it still has an offensive presence that is difficult to ignore.</li> <li>Roost can help Tapu Koko live for a while, but its frailty often means that it usually has better things to do.</li> <li>Substitute can scout for attacks and waste Z-Moves. However, Tapu Koko often does not want to stay on the field for a long time, as there is an increased likelihood that its Terrain is replaced.</li> <li>Calm Mind with Electric Seed makes Tapu Koko a fairly tanky sweeping threat, but it also suffers from the aforementioned issues and is not very flexible.</li> <li>Electro Ball can be used to deal heavy damage to slow targets such as Snorlax and Gigalith.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak</strong>: Lightning Rod in general, actually, but Alolan Marowak is easily the most threatening Lightning Rod user and loves the switch in opportunities provided by the opposing Tapu Koko. Free Alolan Marowak switch ins can leave huge holes in teams due to its raw power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Koko may be one of the fastest Pokemon in the game, but that is only true from an unboosted perspective. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Lele can threaten a quick OHKO on Tapu Koko. Weather sweepers such as Golduck in rain and Alolan Sandslash in hail can also outrun Tapu Koko and knock it out. Finally, Pheromosa is faster than Tapu Koko and can revenge kill it with Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Gastrodon can take hits repeatedly and threaten Tapu Koko with High Horsepower and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room turns Tapu Koko into one of the slowest Pokemon in the game, and it often lacks the bulk to survive if it is moving last.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Bulu</strong>: Tapu Bulu resists Electric, can replace Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain with Grassy Terrain, and can OHKO it back with Wood Hammer. The rare Brave Bird can deal heavy damage to Tapu Bulu, however.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's primary STAB attack, as it is the most powerful and reliable move Tapu Koko has access to.</li> <li>Dazzling Gleam offers yet another STAB option, 2HKOing otherwise troublesome Pokemon such as Garchomp and Krookodile. It also functions as a moderately powerful spread attack.</li> <li>Volt Switch takes advantage of Tapu Koko's great Speed to quickly withdraw itself from trouble, dealing solid damage in the process. It can be used to reposition Tapu Koko's ally to avoid attacks targeted at that slot and re-activate its on-entry ability if it has one.</li> <li>Discharge allows Tapu Koko to bypass Lightning Rod, but be wary, as it also damages allies.</li> <li>Protect shields Tapu Koko from double targeting and increases its longevity.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Tapu Koko to Speed tie with opposing Tapu Koko, as well as outrunning Salazzle, Alolan Persian, Weavile, and Alakazam.</li> <li>Maximum Special Attack EVs maximize the damage it can deal.</li> <li>Modest is a viable nature alternative, as the aforementioned Pokemon are uncommon, and there are ways to play against opposing Tapu Koko even if yours underspeeds it. The increase in power is not insignificant—Tapu Koko can 2HKO Assault Vest Kartana much more frequently with Modest.</li> <li>Life Orb is the preferred item, as it provides a consistent increase in damage. Some of Tapu Koko's most common partners, Gyarados and Garchomp, often hold a Z-Crystal, as it tends to benefit them more.</li> <li>However, Tapu Koko is not a bad user of Z-Moves. Electrium Z turns Thunderbolt into a powerful Gigavolt Havoc that OHKOes even a +1 Tapu Fini in Electric Terrain, or an unboosted Tapu Fini in Misty Terrain. Additionally, Gigavolt Havoc easily OHKOes Maximum HP Arcanine, dealing 110% minimum.</li> <li>Fairium Z gives Tapu Koko a strong single target Fairy-type attack, allowing it to OHKO Assault Vest Garchomp and deal 95% minimum to opposing Tapu Koko. Since most Tapu Koko are Life Orb, Fairium Z Tapu Koko often comes out on top, as the opposing one will knock itself out thanks to Life Orb recoil.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Koko is a solid presence at all game stages. If it has Volt Switch, it exerts more pressure as a lead, as it can pivot out of any unfavorable matchups. If it has Discharge, it is a better late-game cleaner. When selecting the four Pokemon in Team Preview, it may be preferable to keep Tapu Koko in the back if it lacks Volt Switch.</li> <li>Do not be reckless when it comes to firing off Thunderbolts; a target may Protect itself and its partner may retaliate.</li> <li>If Tapu Koko has Volt Switch, it is preferable to use it often early-game, wearing down would-be checks such as Alolan Muk and certain Arcanine. The beauty of Volt Switch is that its targeting option is more flexible than Thunderbolt thanks to its switch-out effect.</li> <li>Volt Switch can be used to reposition Tapu Koko's ally—switch that Pokemon out, then have Tapu Koko use Volt Switch to bring it into Tapu Koko's slot on the same turn. By doing this, you can quickly re-activate on-entry abilities such as Intimidate or Drizzle without having to take two turns to do so. This also helps clear any negative stat changes.</li> <li>Tapu Koko is difficult to switch in due to its poor bulk. Predicting when your opponent will play a turn passively switch to gain an immediate advantage off your current board position helps bring Tapu Koko back onto the field. Conditioning your opponent to not target a specific Pokemon slot is also another way to send Tapu Koko back out.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Koko is a great partner to many Pokemon due to being a standout threat, but it prefers fast, offensive Pokemon next to it to threaten quick KOs.</li> <li>Examples of these Pokemon include Kartana, Nihilego, Garchomp, and Alolan Raichu.</li> <li>When facing a team with a Pokemon with Lightning Rod such as Alolan Marowak, Tapu Koko should often be positioned with a Pokemon such as Garchomp or Krookodile that can commonly defeat it. Keep in mind, however, that Tapu Koko is not an airborne Pokemon and can be struck by their Earthquake.</li> <li>Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Tapu Fini, and Arcanine are good Pokemon to serve as buffers to hits as Tapu Koko pivots out. Additionally, all of these Pokemon possess on-entry abilities, which Tapu Koko can help reset using Volt Switch.</li> <li>Intimidate is helpful for Tapu Koko, as it prevents Tapu Koko from getting OHKOed by Choice Scarf Garchomp's Earthquake. Gyarados, Krookodile, and Arcanine are solid options.</li> <li>Simply think about what kind of Pokemon Tapu Koko can remove and pair it with Pokemon that would normally struggle against them.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Other possibly viable sets include Choice Specs, bulky Sitrus or Iapapa Berry, and Calm Mind.</li> <li>A Choice Specs set does a lot of damage with Psychic, but the Choice lock and lack of Protect can be hard to work around.</li> <li>Nature Power is a flexible move for STAB and coverage for teams with another island guardian as Tapu Lele's partner.</li> <li>Nature's Madness does a lot of damage to potential checks, but Tapu Lele has coverage moves that can finish off those potential checks as well as deal damage on the switch.</li> <li>Focus Sash is a good item, but the damage boost from Psychium Z or Life Orb is important for offensive sets.</li> <li>Psyshock does more damage to specially defensive Pokemon, but it does less damage overall and has lower Base Power for Shattered Psyche.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Assault Vest Kartana, Celesteela, and Metagross can tank Tapu Lele's STAB moves and threaten heavy damage in return with their Steel-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk is immune to Psychic, so it can switch into Shattered Psyche, and Poison Jab will do big damage back. Nihilego outspeeds and will also do heavy damage with Sludge Bomb. Do note that both of them will not OHKO against bulky Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mimikyu and Gengar threaten Tapu Lele with heavy damage from super effective hits. In particular, Jolly Mimikyu can outspeed Tapu Lele and OHKO it with a Never-Ending Nightmare. Marowak is slower than Tapu Lele but can OHKO it with Shadow Bone in Trick Room and can be EVed to take a Psychic if Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche is already used. However, they take a lot of damage from Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attacks from likes of Groundium Z Garchomp will heavily dent, if not flat out OHKO all but the physically bulkiest of Tapu Lele variants.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Terrain</strong>: Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu take away the Psychic Terrain. While these Pokemon are not counters to Tapu Lele by any means, they dampen its damage potential and give their partners an easier time against it.</p>",

It also hits Dragon-types such as Garchomp super effectively.</li> <li>Protect is used to protect Tapu Lele and help it with positioning against strong physical attackers.</li> <li>The last moveslot is extremely customizable.</li> <li>Taunt denies Trick Room and Tailwind from the likes of Porygon2 and Mandibuzz, respectively.</li> <li>Substitute takes advantage of Protects and switches forced by the threat of a fast OHKO from Shattered Psyche.</li> <li>Reflect and Light Screen are options that also similarly take advantage of Protects and switches, and they let Tapu Lele support the team after it has does its job of inflicting heavy damage on the opposing team.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Psychic Surge is its only released ability, and it boosts Psychic-type STAB moves and removes opposing Terrain.</li> <li>Psychium Z is the item of choice that allows Tapu Lele to pick up OHKOs against bulky Pokemon, such as Arcanine and Tapu Fini, in Psychic Terrain (note that because of Snarl and Misty Terrain, this does not happen very often).</li> <li>Tapu Lele is highly customizable in its EV spreads and has 2 main options: bulky and fast.</li> <li>Bulkier spreads with a Modest nature and heavy HP and Defense investment take advantage of Tapu Lele's ability to score OHKOs and shore up its defenses.</li> <li>With bulkier spreads such as 164 HP / 92 Def / 252 SpA, it is possible for Tapu Lele to avoid a 2HKO from Garchomp's Earthquake, but it will be slower than opposing Arcanine, Tapu Lele, and Krookodile.</li> <li>With even higher defensive investment, it is possible for Tapu Lele to survive stronger physical attacks as Kartana's Smart Strike, but this sacrifices a large amount of damage output.</li> <li>28 HP / 44 Def / 228 SpA / 4 SpD / 204 Spe is a faster spread that lets Tapu Lele score the OHKO on most bulky Arcanine before Snarl lowers its Special Attack, or use Reflect / Light Screen before the opponent uses an attack.</li> <li>228 Special Attack EVs let Tapu Lele OHKO maximum HP Tapu Fini and Araquanid in Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>28 HP and 44 Defense EVs let Tapu Lele take a Liquidation from Araquanid.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Use the high burst damage output of Psychium Z + Psychic as a wallbreaking tool against hard-to-KO Pokemon such as Porygon2.</li> <li>The threat of a fast KO can put slower teams in a pinch, but defensive teams should have a way to absorb the Shattered Psyche with the likes of Celesteela and Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Watch out to not blow the Z-Move on a potential Alolan Muk switch-in or a Protect.</li> <li>Instead, try to pair it with a partner that can take advantage of the free turns given by these switches and Protects.</li> <li>It is even possible for Tapu Lele to take advantage of these free turns for its own, with Substitute or other supportive moves.</li> <li>Terrain control goes to slower Pokemon, so Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu will usually take control of the Terrain if you lead with Tapu Lele against them, reducing its damage output severely.</li> <li>Against offensive teams, do not worry too much about keeping Psychic Terrain intact unless they are reliant on priority moves—the damage boost on Shattered Psyche is often overkill against frail Pokemon such as Tapu Koko.</li> <li>However, against bulky Pokemon such as Arcanine and Tapu Fini, Psychic Terrain's damage boost is quite helpful, if not necessary.</li> <li>Taunt on Tapu Lele lets it match up well against full Trick Room teams that rely on Fake Out + Trick Room setup.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Arcanine provides Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp support, augmenting Tapu Lele's defensive investments. Intimidate support lets it avoid the OHKO from strong super effective physical moves and shrug off weaker physical attacks with ease. Arcanine can also use Flamethrower to threaten Steel-types such as Celesteela and Kartana, which can beat Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Garchomp is a strong Ground-type that threatens Alolan Muk and Nihilego.</li> <li>Krookodile provides Intimidate as well as using Ground-type moves to KO Alolan Muk and Nihilego.</li> <li>Kartana synergizes fairly well with Tapu Lele in addition to Garchomp and Krookodile.</li> <li>Tapu Fini does not have notable typing synergy with Tapu Lele, but it synergizes with many of Tapu Lele's aforementioned teammates and will not go down to physical moves as easily as Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Tapu Koko provides a speed safety net, is faster than threats such as Kartana and Nihilego, and threatens Celesteela with heavy damage.</li> <li>Keep Terrain in mind as you play, especially if you're running another island guardian, as Shattered Psyche needs the Psychic Terrain boost to be a wallbreaking threat against insanely bulky Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Porygon2.</li> </ul>"

Still, its other moves can do a lot of damage outside of Psychic Terrain thanks to Life Orb.</li> <li>Life Orb provides good damage on its coverage moves such as Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Tapu Fini and Celesteela.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>With the ability Grassy Surge and a powerful Attack stat of 130, Tapu Bulu easily becomes one of the best Grass-type Pokemon in the format.</li> <li>Defensive stats of base 70 / 115 / 95 give it a considerable amount of bulk that helps it survive a lot of powerful attacks when combined with Intimidate support or Assault Vest support, while its Speed stat of 75 places it in an average Speed tier, outspeeding a lot of the metagame with just a small amount of investment.</li> <li>The ability to set Grassy Terrain upon being sent out makes it invaluable on a team that is susceptible to Earthquake, making it a great partner to Pokemon like Arcanine and Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu lacks access to any decent physical Fairy-type attack like Play Rough, so it must depend solely on its coverage options in the form of Superpower and Stone Edge.</li> <li>Being Grass-type can help it fit in popular team archetypes like rain, which helps mitigate its Fire weakness.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu has access to a variety of support moves like Leech Seed, Snarl, Taunt, and Rock Slide.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu is 4x weak to Poison-type moves like Poison Jab and Sludge Bomb, which are usually sufficient to OHKO it, so users of these moves should be handled with caution.</li> <li>The increasing popularity of Will-O-Wisp, Buzzwole, and Poison-type attacks gives Tapu Bulu a hard time in the current metagame.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Fightinium Z can be used to deal with Porygon2 and Celesteela, but it won't do much to other Pokemon in the metagame.</li> <li>Similarly, Tapunium Z allows Tapu Bulu to use Guardian of Alola, which greatly damages every Pokemon in the metagame by significantly reducing their HP. This is especially useful when dealing with Celesteela or Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Snarl can be run with Leftovers to weaken opposing Pokemon on the switch in. Taunt, on the other hand, helps Tapu Bulu shut down any setup options like Belly Drum or Trick Room.</li> <li>Assault Vest is used at times to greatly enhance Tapu Bulu's special bulk, allowing it to survive attacks like Pelipper's Hurricane with ease.</li> <li>Miracle Seed can be used to further boost Tapu Bulu's Grass-type moves, though this makes it nothing more than a mindless attacker.</li> <li>EVs can be invested so that it survives Poison Jab from Garchomp after an Intimidate, which is usually enough to score a KO with Wood Hammer.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type moves can OHKO Tapu Bulu almost every time and should be played around with caution. One also have to be careful about Pokemon that have the capability to run a Poison-type move, like Garchomp and Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon like Celesteela and Kartana often wall Tapu Bulu and OHKO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Powerful Fire-type Pokemon like Arcanine and Alolan Marowak can easily OHKO Tapu Bulu with a Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon like Talonflame and Braviary can greatly damage Tapu Bulu with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales and Vanilluxe can deal massive amounts of damage to Tapu Bulu, OHKOing it most of the time with 100% accurate Blizzards in hail.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burn</strong>: Like most physical attackers, Tapu Bulu is susceptible to burn and Intimidate, and can be rendered useless by the former.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Wood Hammer is Tapu Bulu's primary STAB move and used to pick up OHKOs when boosted by Grassy Terrain, while Horn Leech is used as a recovery option to extend its longevity. Both are used on this set to cover both damage and recovery.</li> <li>Superpower is used as a coverage option to deal super effective damage to Magnezone and break Celesteela's Substitute.</li> <li>Stone Edge is often used in the last moveslot to pick up KOs on Alolan Marowak and Arcanine, with the higher critical hit chance coming in handy. Rock Slide may be used instead to fish for flinches when you are in a pinch, giving you some space to plan your next move. Choice Scarf Rock Slide has always been well known for crippling opposing Pokemon with flinches.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Bulu's ability, Grassy Surge, sets up Grassy Terrain when it is sent out. Grassy Terrain boosts the damage of Grass-type moves by 1.5x and weakens Earthquake, Bulldoze, and Magnitude.</li> <li>Choice Scarf is used to enable Tapu Bulu to outspeed and KO threats such as Garchomp and Nihilego. This allows the user to invest more EVs in bulk and Attack, making Tapu Bulu a fast and effective sweeper.</li> <li>108 EVs are invested in HP give it greater longevity.</li> <li>148 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Bulu outspeeds Timid Nihilego, allowing it to take out the threat before it gets KOed. Alternatively, 196 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Pokemon from the base 110 Speed tier, and 228 EVs outspeed Timid Salazzle.</li> <li>252 EVs are put into Attack to make sure Tapu Bulu hits hard as possible with an Adamant nature. This is usually sufficient to OHKO an unsuspecting Garchomp.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>As a Grass-type Pokemon, Tapu Bulu can easily take down most of the Water-type Pokemon in the metagame. This includes but is not limited to Gastrodon, Milotic, Golduck, and Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Due to its high Speed thanks to Choice Scarf, Tapu Bulu almost always sets up its Terrain before the opponent's Terrain setter. It is advisable to switch in Tapu Bulu later on to turn the Terrain in your favor.</li> <li>With its bulk, Speed, and offensive power, Tapu Bulu can be used to outspeed and OHKO the guardian deities with ease.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu's Fairy typing allows it to be switched into incoming Dragon-type attacks, especially Salamence's Devastating Drake, which can put your opponent at a disadvantage.</li> <li>Grassy Terrain can be utilized against Earthquake users to provide your team with better bulk. It can also be used to boost other Grass-type moves like Grass Knot from Nihilego and Leaf Blade from Kartana.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu also serves as a soft Rain check, easily getting rid of Pelipper and Golduck with Horn Leech, which restores its HP in the process.</li> <li>Poison-immune Pokemon like Celesteela and Magnezone are advised to be used with Tapu Bulu to switch into Poison-type attacks, as this can put your opponent at a disadvantage.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Team members are chosen to take advantage of Tapu Bulu's Grassy Surge. Pokemon weak to Earthquake can fill this role, as they don't have to worry about one of their weaknesses. Such Pokemon include Alolan Muk, Nihilego, Arcanine, and Magnezone.</li> <li>It is essential to have a Poison-immune Pokemon on the team to absorb Poison-type moves directed at Tapu Bulu.</li> <li>Steel-types like Celesteela and Kartana can take down Tapu Bulu if you are not careful; it is advised to use Fire-type Pokemon like Arcanine and Alolan Marowak to deal with those Pokemon.</li> <li>As Garchomp poses a threat to Tapu Bulu due to Poison Jab, a Pokemon like Salamence that can KO Dragon-types is often utilized on such teams to OHKO it and other threats. It can also be used to OHKO Arcanine and deal massive amounts of damage to Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Intimidate users like Arcanine and Gyarados are recommended to be used alongside Tapu Bulu, weakening physical attackers like Kartana and Garchomp that otherwise would be able to OHKO Tapu Bulu with Smart Strike and Poison Jab, respectively.</li> <li>Finally, a Water-type Pokemon like Milotic or Gastrodon can be used to deal with Tapu Bulu's Fire-type weakness.</li> </ul>"

A simple switch from your opponent could waste a potential KO.</li> <li>Bulky Fire-type Pokemon like Arcanine wall this set and should be taken care of before sending in Tapu Bulu.</li> <li>Setting up Grassy Terrain on turn one is often the optimal play when facing another guardian diety, as this allows you to use Bloom Doom and score a KO quickly.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>As Tapu Bulu is 4x weak to Poison-type attacks, it is recommended to run a Ground- or Steel-type like Celesteela, Magnezone, or Mudsdale.</li> <li>Since Fire-types like Arcanine pose a threat to Tapu Bulu, Water-type Pokemon like Gastrodon and Milotic work well with it.</li> <li>Rain setters like Politoed can be used to help Tapu Bulu mitigate its Fire weakness, while Tapu Bulu takes out powerful Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko that threaten Politoed. Combined with Tapu Bulu's bulk, Politoed can disrupt your opponent with Encore and even use Perish Song as a last resort due to its low Speed.</li> <li>Using a Fire-type Pokemon like Arcanine can benefit Tapu Bulu as well, with its Intimidate support weakening opposing Garchomp and Celesteela as well as its STAB moves taking out bulky Steel-types.</li> <li>Porygon2 can be used with Tapu Bulu as a Trick Room setter, which helps Tapu Bulu move faster thanks to its middling Speed stat.</li> <li>Since Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake, it is safe to use Magnezone against Garchomp, although Intimidate may be required to make sure Magnezone survives.</li> <li>Alolan Muk and Nihilego can be used as well, as they take advantage of Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake, though the former should be wary of Tectonic Rage from Garchomp. These Pokemon help take out hail teams, which otherwise easily threaten Tapu Bulu.</li> </ul>"

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Tapu Fini is one of the premier Water-types in the format that can fit comfortably on most teams.</li> <li>Misty Terrain is a godsend, as it prevents Tapu Fini and its partners from being inflicted by status effects. It also activates the Special Defense boost from Misty Seed instantly.</li> <li>Tapu Fini possesses impressive 70 / 115 / 130 bulk, which can allow it to sponge off hits relatively well.</li> <li>Without a Calm Mind or Choice Specs boost, Tapu Fini's offensive capabilities are rather mediocre.</li> <li>Water / Fairy is a pretty significant  defensive and offensive typing, as it comes with a ton of useful resistances and allows Tapu Fini to hit a good chunk of the format for super effective or neutral damage.</li> <li>Tapu Fini struggles against the other island guardians such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, which can not only remove its Misty Terrain, but also smack it pretty hard with their STAB moves.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Wiki Berry is a viable alternative to Leftovers if you want large instantaneous healing instead of gradual healing over time. This works pretty well if you're not using Tapu Fini for the long haul, but still want it to have a bit of longevity.</li> <li>Tapu Fini can make great use of a bulky support set, as it has access to a number of solid support moves such as Haze, Heal Pulse, Taunt, Swagger, and Nature's Madness. It should be noted that if you're using Nature's Madness a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature should be used in order to get Nature's Madness off as fast as possible so that one of Tapu Fini's partners can take advantage of it.</li> <li>Waterium Z with Muddy Water is a solid option for providing a powerful Hydro Vortex to pick up the OHKO on specially defensive Arcanine and Gigalith in sand easily. Waterium Z with Hydro Pump is also nice, but the Z-Crystal is better used on Muddy Water, as Tapu Fini can still fire off Muddy Waters for accuracy drops while having the strong Hydro Vortex option whenever.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tapu Fini really hates going up against Tapu Bulu and Kartana, which both have more than enough power behind them to eliminate Tapu Fini instantly, while it can only threaten to 2HKO in return at best. Tapu Bulu is especially troublesome, as it can remove Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Being a Fairy-type, Tapu Fini doesn't enjoy going up against Poison-type Pokemon such as Salazzle, Gengar, and Muk. Each can 2HKO with their respective STAB moves and often avoid being OHKOed in return because of their Focus Sash or incredible bulk in Muk's case.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Xurkitree, and Magnezone all threaten to deal massive damage to Tapu Fini with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Z-Moves</strong>: Because Tapu Fini is seen as such a potent defensive Pokemon in the format it is often the target of powerful Z-Moves from the likes of Tapu Bulu, Garchomp, Magnezone, and Pheromosa. Of course, this can be mitigated by Tapu Fini simply using Protect on that same turn.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Calm Mind increases Tapu Fini's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, which can turn it into a potent wincon that is able to clean through teams with limited ways to break it.</li> <li>Muddy Water is Tapu Fini's Water-type STAB move and is preferred over Scald for its ability to threaten two Pokemon at once. It also has a small chance to reduce the foe's accuracy, which is nifty while Tapu Fini is setting up.</li> <li>Moonblast is a reliable Fairy-type STAB move that threatens Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types. It can also cause Special Attack drops, which helps with setting up.</li> <li>Protect keeps Tapu Fini safe from potential double targets and gives it a free turn of Leftovers recovery.</li> <li>Scald can be used if Muddy Water's accuracy is a hindrance for you, but it should be noted that Tapu Fini can't burn grounded foes while Misty Terrain is active.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>252 HP EVs and 116 Defense EVs allows Tapu Fini to survive maximum Attack Jolly Kartana's Leaf Blade and makes Arcanine's maximum Attack Wild Charge a 3HKO.</li> <li>The 140 leftover EVs are placed into Special Defense to enable Tapu Fini to stomach a Sludge Bomb from Life Orb Nihilego and Life Orb Thunder from Tapu Koko outside of Electric Terrain.</li> <li>If you desire a faster variant then an EV spread of 252 HP / 12 Def / 244 Spe is viable, as it enables Tapu Fini to outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Arcanine and Timid maximum Speed Xurkitree. However, this gives Tapu Fini significantly less physical bulk and gives Kartana a strong chance to OHKO with Leaf Blade.</li> <li>Leftovers provides passive recovery to keep Tapu Fini healthy for the long haul.</li> <li>Aguav Berry can be used to heal 50% of Tapu Fini's health should it be brought below 25%.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This Tapu Fini set is designed to stay on the field and slowly win games, so you have to play very conservative with it.</li> <li>Tapu Fini's natural bulk and typing allows it to switch in on many threats, but try to avoid coming in on strong neutral attacks, as you'll want Tapu Fini's HP as high as possible.</li> <li>It's important that Tapu Fini stays as healthy as possible because it lacks a form of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers or a certain Z-Move.</li> <li>Tapu Fini should be sent out when its counters are either not on the field or are checked by one of Tapu Fini's partners.</li> <li>Tapu Fini often doesn't need too many Calm Mind boosts to win a game so just setting up one or two will be enough.</li> <li>Avoid setting up Calm Minds versus Pokemon that can deal a lot of damage to Tapu Fini and instead use that time to either get an attack off, use Protect, or even just switch out.</li> <li>Keep in mind that even with Special Attack boosts Tapu Fini still isn't dishing out too much damage until you have about four or five.</li> <li>Be wary of Toxic users if your opponent has ways of removing Misty Terrain.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Arcanine is a staple partner for Tapu Fini, as it provides much needed Intimidate support, which eases the stress from physical attackers. It's also one of the best answers to Kartana in the format because it can OHKO it with a Fire-type move, which is a huge blessing for Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Garchomp works well with Tapu Fini, as it is one of the few Pokemon in the format that can reliably counter Alolan Muk with Tectonic Rage.</li> <li>Kartana is a valuable partner, as it can reliably take on opposing Tapu Fini, which makes winning the mirror matchup a lot easier. Tapu Fini also keeps Arcanine in check, which Kartana very much appreciates.</li> <li>Eevee is an interesting partner, as Tapu Fini is a fantastic recipient of Extreme Evoboost because of its stellar bulk being boosted even further and its solid type coverage being complemented by the +2 Special Attack boost. Misty Terrain also prevents the opponent from slowing down the Extreme Evoboost strategy with status.</li> <li>While Tapu Koko can remove Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain, it is a good partner that can take on faster threats like Garchomp, Gengar, and Kartana before they can do any damage to Tapu Fini.</li> </ul>"

Dazzling Gleam and Hydro Pump are more helpful in these matchups.</li> <li>Muddy Water is more useful against defensive teams that can't handle Tapu Fini too well so that you can stick around longer and harass with accuracy drops.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Arcanine is a solid partner for Choice Specs Tapu Fini, as Intimidate support keeps it a bit safer against physical attackers. Arcanine also possesses Helping Hand to further increase Tapu Fini's damage output.</li> <li>Ninetales is a fine partner that can provide Aurora Veil to buff up Tapu Fini's bulk and Icy Wind to provide much-needed speed control.</li> <li>Kartana is again a solid partner, as it excels at eliminating most Water-type Pokemon, which makes it much easier for Tapu Fini to consistently fire off Muddy Water and Hydro Pump. It's also very good at beating down on Snorlax and Chansey, which Tapu Fini struggles against.</li> <li>Even with the Choice Specs boost, Tapu Fini still struggles against Alolan Muk, which makes Garchomp a good partner. Tectonic Rage + boosted Fairy-type attacks can also do incredible damage to opposing teams and is very difficult to switch into.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Alolan Raichu's high Speed and access to Fake Out make it a natural supporter to generate free turns for its teammates.</li> <li>Its unique ability, Surge Surfer, lets Alolan Raichu outspeed almost every single other Pokemon in the metagame under Electric Terrain, ensuring it will always go first with Fake Out. Surge Surfer also enables Alolan Raichu to be an effective late-game cleaner, picking off weakened targets with its high speed.</li> <li>Its Electric / Psychic typing pairs excellently with Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele, letting Alolan Raichu take advantage of both of the Terrains that they set.</li> <li>Alolan Raichu also has access to moves such as Nuzzle, Encore, and Feint to disrupt your opponent further.</li> <li>Its Special Attack is good but not outstanding, and it relies on the correct Terrain being active to deal significant damage to Pokemon that it's not hitting super effectively.</li> <li>Alolan Raichu possesses very little in the way of bulk, letting it be OHKOed by almost any strong attack.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Volt Switch is less powerful than Thunderbolt but lets Alolan Raichu stick around longer and have more opportunities to use Fake Out.</li> <li>Feint can be useful on teams with many hard hitters, as it allows Alolan Raichu's teammate to effectively attack whatever it wants without having to worry about opposing Protect.</li> <li>Nuzzle can spread paralysis to slow down the opposing team and deal some small amounts of damage to break opposing Focus Sashes.</li> <li>Charm can be used to lower the Attack of opposing Pokemon, but Alolan Raichu struggles to fit it on its moveset.</li> <li>Electro Ball can reach absurd levels of power due to Electric Terrain combined with Surge Surfer, but its power is very heavily dependent on the terrain staying active. Without the Electric Terrain, it is weaker than Thunderbolt on most targets.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal more damage to Ground-types, but it won't be OHKOing anything without something like a boosting item or Helping Hand.</li> <li>Aloraichium Z upgrades Thunderbolt to Stoked Sparksurfer, which both deals massive amounts of damage to a target and paralyses them. Be wary of using this over Psychium Z, as many teams carry more Pokemon resistant to Electric-type moves than ones that resist Psychic-type moves.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Krookodile is immune to both of Alolan Raichu's STAB attacks and can switch in for free on almost anything it can do. Other Ground-types such as Garchomp and Mudsdale are immune to Alolan Raichu's Electric-type moves but have to watch out for a stray Psychic or Shattered Psyche.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types in the metagame either resist both of Alolan Raichu's STAB attacks, such as Magnezone and Kartana, or possess the special bulk to be able to shrug them off. They can also hit the Tapu Koko or Tapu Lele that Alolan Raichu is usually partnered with for heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types aren't as common as Ground-types are, but they can switch in for free on any of Alolan Raichu's Psychic-type moves and can completely waste its Shattered Psyche. Krookodile deserves a mention again, as it is immune to both of Alolan Raichu's STAB attacks. Alolan Muk has good special bulk and can hit Alolan Raichu back hard with a Knock Off or Shadow Sneak. Weavile can outspeed Alolan Raichu outside of Electric Terrain and also has Fake Out and Knock Off to KO it through a potential Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Alolan Raichu relies on its Speed to get off attacks before it can be hit back. Speed control like Trick Room turns Alolan Raichu's high Speed into a liability, as under Electric Terrain, almost everything will move before it, making it easy for Alolan Raichu to be KOed. Other forms of speed control such as Icy Wind and Tailwind are also effective against Alolan Raichu, but they must also be used with a way to get rid of Electric Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Lightning Rod</strong>: Lightning Rod users can redirect and nullify any Electric-type moves Alolan Raichu tries to use, hampering its effectiveness. Alolan Marowak is immune to Fake Out and can hit back with a super effective Bonemerang or Shadow Bone. Togedemaru resists both of Alolan Raichu's STAB moves and can also use Fake Out.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Fake Out is mandatory on any Alolan Raichu, as it prevents a foe from doing anything for a turn, letting Alolan Raichu's partner more effectively deal with a threat.</li> <li>Thunderbolt and Psychic are Alolan Raichu's STAB moves, which possess good neutral coverage on a significant portion of the metagame. They are also boosted by Electric and Psychic Terrain, respectively.</li> <li>Protect is useful to give Alolan Raichu extra turns to stick around, as it will be KOed by most strong or super effective hits, and it lets Alolan Raichu's partner deal with a threat.</li> <li>Encore can punish opposing moves like Protect and Fake Out, locking their user into either doing nothing next turn or switching out.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Psychium Z is the preferred item, as paired with Psychic Terrain it lets Alolan Raichu hit incredibly hard, OHKOing most targets that don't resist or are immune to it. Even outside of Psychic Terrain it lets Alolan Raichu deal heavy damage.</li> <li>If you want Alolan Raichu to focus more on support and less on offense, a Focus Sash can be used instead, letting Alolan Raichu potentially use another move in place of Protect, such as Encore or Feint.</li> <li>Surge Surfer is Alolan Raichu's only ability and lets it reach an incredibly high Speed stat.</li> <li>A Timid nature is used to increase Alolan Raichu's Speed even further. Maximum Speed is important so that outside of Electric Terrain, Alolan Raichu can still use its moves before other Pokemon that are only slightly slower than it, such as Alolan Ninetales and Kartana.</li> <li>For the same reason, a spread of maximum Special Attack and Speed is simple and effective.</li> <li>An EV spread of 60 HP / 12 Def / 252 SpA / 36 SpD / 148 Spe avoids the 2HKO from Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard, including damage from hail, but makes Alolan Raichu more vulnerable to threats that are only slightly slower than it outside of Electric Terrain.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Alolan Raichu is best used as a lead, letting it immediately use Fake Out to prevent a foe from doing anything for a turn. This leaves Alolan Raichu's partner free to either deal with an opposing Pokemon or use a setup move.</li> <li>When faced with a threat it cannot KO, Alolan Raichu must be careful of being knocked out itself, as its frailty means it cannot take attacks very well. It can be good to switch Alolan Raichu out after its job of using Fake Out is done, letting it be sent out later on in the battle to use it again.</li> <li>When paired with another fast and offensive teammate, Alolan Raichu can help score early-game KOs to swing momentum in your favor.</li> <li>Its other support moves like Feint and Encore allow Alolan Raichu to effectively support a more offensive teammate.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Alolan Raichu pairs excellently with Tapu Koko, making it extremely fast thanks to Surge Surfer. The Electric Terrain makes Alolan Raichu's Thunderbolts deal significantly more damage. These two together form an effective lead against opposing fast and offensive teams.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is another excellent partner, as its Psychic Terrain powers up Alolan Raichu's Shattered Psyche into an incredibly powerful attack that will OHKO most Pokemon that don't resist it. This pairing is great against slower and bulkier teams.</li> <li>Fake Out and Encore help teammates use setup moves, so partners such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Curse Alolan Muk will appreciate the free turns.</li> <li>Teammates that can deal with opposing Ground-types are appreciated, so Pokemon like Kartana and Gyarados make good partners.</li> <li>Alolan Raichu can't handle opposing Electric- or Steel-types very well, so a Ground-type partner like Garchomp or Krookodile is appreciated. Alolan Raichu should have Protect when used with a Ground-type partner so it can use Earthquake more freely. Arcanine is also a useful teammate, as its Intimidate lowers the power of incoming physical attacks and can help deal with Pokemon like Vikavolt and Magnezone.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Thanks to its ability Slush Rush, which doubles its Speed in hail, Alolan Sandslash is a team option to consider should you be building a team with Vanilluxe or Alolan Ninetales.</li> <li>The ability to hit a titanic Speed tier while still being able to switch moves is what makes Alolan Sandslash worthy of considering on a team that has a Hail setter, as the inability to change moves is a shortcoming for Choice Scarf users.</li> <li>Its access to Steel-type STAB moves enables it to hit the Rock-type Pokemon that threaten hail setters; this is especially noteworthy for improving hail's matchup against Gigalith.</li> <li>Alolan Sandslash also has pretty good physical bulk for an offensive Pokemon.</li> <li>However, its Attack stat leaves much to be desired, and its Speed could be better, meaning it's often too slow with an Adamant nature, too weak with a Jolly nature, and easily walled.</li> <li>Alolan Sandslash's typing also leads to it stacking a Fire-type weakness with Alolan Ninetales and Fire-type and Fighting-type weaknesses with Vanilluxe.</li> <li>Due to these shortcomings, it is usually easier and more efficient to build a standard team that has Vanilluxe or Alolan Ninetales on it rather than directly taking advantage of hail.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Icicle Spear is inconsistent due to its hit variance and accuracy, but it can KO foes through Sturdy and Focus Sash.</li> <li>Rock Slide is an alternative for Fire-types that doesn't target Alolan Sandslash's partner, unlike Earthquake, and comes with a nice chance to flinch.</li> <li>Swords Dance allows Alolan Sandslash to increase its damage output, which may seem appealing thanks to its mediocre Attack stat, but the limited number of hail turns means it's almost always better off simply attacking.</li> <li>Brick Break allows Alolan Sandslash to always 2HKO Kartana regardless of its held item or nature.</li> <li>Focus Sash can be valuable to survive a single attack given Alolan Sandslash's low Special Defense and multiple 4x weaknesses.</li> <li>Icium Z can be used to enable the use of Subzero Slammer, which is only particularly useful for hitting Pokemon like Garchomp and Salamence through Protect.</li> <li>Steelium Z allows Alolan Sandslash to use Corkscrew Crash, which OHKOes Gigalith.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-type Pokemon resist at least one of Alolan Sandslash's STAB moves and are usually bulky enough to take the one they don't resist. As such, Pokemon such as Gyarados, Tapu Fini, and Araquanid all prove problematic for Alolan Sandslash. However, it should be noted that Alolan Sandslash is always paired up with either Vanilluxe or Alolan Ninetales, both of which almost always run Freeze-Dry.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Torkoal, Arcanine, and Alolan Marowak can easily take any of Alolan Sandslash's STAB moves, are not OHKOed by Earthquake, and can OHKO Alolan Sandslash with their Fire-type STAB moves. However, they must watch out for Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Celesteela and Metagross easily take any hit from Alolan Sandslash and can retaliate with Flamethrower and Hammer Arm, respectively. While Kartana cannot switch in thanks to being 2HKOed by Icicle Crash, if it safely comes in at full health, it can take a hit from Alolan Sandslash and OHKO it with Sacred Sword.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Trick Room turns Alolan Sandslash's ability against it, ensuring it will go last on any given turn. Similarly, opposing Tailwind gives Alolan Sandslash's opponents an equivalent Speed boost, while paralysis completely negates Slush Rush.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Torkoal, Politoed, and Pelipper can come in to change the weather and remove Alolan Sandslash's Speed boost. Gigalith can also do so, but risks being OHKOed by Corkscrew Crash, while Pelipper and Politoed won't enjoy taking Freeze-Dry from the Vanilluxe or Alolan Ninetales that Alolan Sandslash will always be seen with.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Iron Head is Alolan Sandslash's strongest Steel-type STAB move, capable of 2HKOing Gigalith and OHKOing Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Icicle Crash serves as a secondary STAB attack, notably OHKOing foes such as Garchomp and Salamence and 2HKOing foes such as Krookodile and Mudsdale, as well as 2HKOing Kartana if Alolan Sandslash carries a Life Orb.</li> <li>Earthquake gives Alolan Sandslash a chance against Fire-types, though it should be noted that it only has a 53.5% chance to 2HKO Torkoal after Hail damage with a Life Orb.</li> <li>Protect is a VGC staple, allowing Sandslash to shield itself for a turn while a partner handles threats like Tapu Fini.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Groundium Z enables the use of Tectonic Rage, which allows Alolan Sandslash to threaten the Fire-type Pokemon which threaten it and its Hail setter.</li> <li>Life Orb gives Alolan Sandslash a much-needed power boost, enabling Icicle Crash to 2HKO Kartana.</li> <li>Slush Rush is the only ability Alolan Sandslash should be using, as doubling its Speed in Hail is what makes it viable.</li> <li>The given EV spread gives Alolan Sandslash as much power and speed as it can possibly get.</li> <li>An Adamant nature is highly recommended, as it makes Alolan Sandslash stronger, although a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp under hail, ensuring it goes before any variant of these Pokemon, though it should be noted that this causes many OHKOs and 2HKOs to no longer be guaranteed, such as the Life Orb Icicle Crash 2HKO on Kartana.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>If hail isn't up, it's not recommended to send out Alolan Sandslash, as it will be too slow to do anything of value.</li> <li>Thanks to its respectable physical bulk and Steel typing, Alolan Sandslash can realistically be switched in on a non-super effective physical attack, though it will have a hard time switching in on special attacks.</li> <li>As such, it can easily come in on a neutral or resisted physical attack and give the opponent little opportunity for a follow-up attack thanks to its great Speed tier in hail, but against special attackers, it would be better off coming in after an ally is knocked out.</li> <li>As Torkoal can easily change the weather and force Alolan Sandslash out, it's generally ill-advised to bring Alolan Sandslash against a team that has Torkoal. However, Alolan Sandslash can at least deal significant damage to it with Tectonic Rage.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>As Slush Rush is the only reason Alolan Sandslash is viable, it is mandatory to pair it up with either Vanilluxe or Alolan Ninetales. As five turns of Hail may turn out to be too little, it may be worthwhile to consider giving an Icy Rock to whichever Snow Warning user you pick.</li> <li>As Fire-type Pokemon like Torkoal and Arcanine are problematic for Alolan Sandslash and its Hail setter, Ground-type Pokemon like Krookodile and Water-type Pokemon like Araquanid and Milotic make good allies. Milotic also discourages Intimidate users from coming in to weaken Alolan Sandslash.</li> <li>A Fire-type ally of its own, such as Arcanine or Alolan Marowak, will assist Alolan Sandslash against Pokemon like Celesteela and Metagross. Arcanine can also use Roar to phaze problematic Trick Room setters.</li> <li>Other means of deterring Trick Room, such as Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Gyarados, can prove equally as effective in maintaining a Speed advantage.</li> <li>Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Xurkitree help Alolan Sandslash against Water-types like Tapu Fini and Araquanid. Grass-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Kartana do the same, but it should be noted that this will cause its team to have at least three Fire-type weaknesses, meaning it's usually better to use an Electric-type to handle Water-types.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Tapu Lele assists Alolan Sandslash against Hariyama and Pheromosa.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Encore is a great tool for disrupting the opponent's strategy; for example, it enables Alolan Ninetales to lock the otherwise-threatening Celesteela into Substitute, or to lock almost any Pokemon slower than it into Protect.</li> <li>Moonblast or Dazzling Gleam provide Alolan Ninetales with a way to hit Dark- and Fighting-types super effectively.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire enables Ninetales to secure an OHKO on non-Assault Vest Kartana.</li> <li>Hypnosis gives Ninetales an option to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, but its 60% accuracy makes it an all-around poor option.</li> <li>Disable allows Alolan Ninetales to temporarily block an opposing Pokemon from using a move like Protect, as well as allowing it to disable an attack like Celesteela's Heavy Slam.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Not only do Steel-types not fear Alolan Ninetales's attacks at all, they also have 4x super effective STAB to use against it. As such, Pokemon such as Celesteela, Metagross, and Kartana grab OHKOs on Alolan Ninetales through Aurora Veil, while all of these Pokemon except for Kartana take virtually nothing from Alolan Ninetales.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: By virtue of resisting Alolan Ninetales's STAB attacks, Torkoal, Alolan Marowak, and Arcanine can take a hit from Alolan Ninetales and threaten it out with their Fire-type attacks. Furthermore, thanks to Drought, Torkoal can come in to prevent Alolan Ninetales from setting up Aurora Veil.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Despite not resisting Alolan Ninetales's Ice-type attacks, Alolan Muk's Special bulk in conjunction with the combination of Gluttony and Figy Berry means that it cares very little about Alolan Ninetales's attacks, enabling it to easily threaten it with Poison Jab or Gunk Shot. Nihilego's special bulk enables it to take anything from Alolan Ninetales and OHKO it with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Alolan Ninetales's great Speed tier turns into a liability should Trick Room be active. Trick Room will prevent Alolan Ninetales from ever going first, meaning Alolan Ninetales has no options against Trick Room other than to use Protect in an effort to burn a Trick Room turn.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Although Pelipper doesn't want to take Freeze-Dry, it and all of the other weather Pokemon give Alolan Ninetales a hard time on account of preventing Aurora Veil from going up, as Alolan Ninetales is so fast that any other weather setter's weather will go up instead.

Switch it out of these if you can. Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu are lesser concerns thanks to Alolan Persian being able to outspeed the two and Parting Shot away.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While not very much outspeeds Alolan Persian, the few that do can be threatening. Pheromosa can nail it with any STAB move, while Aerodactyl and Whimsicott can use Taunt or Tailwind freely. Powerful Choice Scarf users and weather Speed boosters can also quickly take out Alolan Persian. In these cases, where the faster Pokemon is a serious threat, it is often best to simply switch out after a Fake Out rather than using Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Bulky special attackers like Porygon2, Tapu Fini, and Goodra can put a serious dent in Alolan Persian and are often hard to take down without the right ally. Luckily, it can usually outspeed and escape them with Parting Shot. The Assault Vest set can generally take their attacks better to retaliate with Snarl, but still would like to avoid super effective hits.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: While Alolan Persian can shut down Tailwind, Trick Room, and Thunder Wave, if your opponent manages to pull one of them off, you could be in some serious trouble. The Assault Vest set has an even harder time dealing with this. Trick Room sweepers like Drampa and Hariyama can dish out massive damage, and Alolan Persian's high Speed means it will go last much of the time. Keep it out of these situations if possible, relying on other teammates to stall Trick Room out.</p> <p><strong>Counters to Status Moves</strong>: While Substitute isn't overly common in the meta, a foe using Substitute effectively leaves Alolan Persian unable to do anything to them. Ghost-types pose another threat, being immune to both Fake Out and Feint. Pokemon immune to stat changes like Metagross can limit Alolan Persian's options, and Milotic can switch in on a predicted Parting Shot or Snarl in order to gain a Special Attack boost. Make sure your team is ready to deal with any of these possibilities.</p>",

      "Parting Shot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Parting Shot allows Alolan Persian to switch to a better matchup and weaken something dangerous. Z-Parting Shot also heals an injured ally.</li> <li>Fake Out ruins the opponent's plans on the first turn and allows you to either have a teammate set something up or get a head start with damage. Parting Shot allows Alolan Persian to do this multiple times in a game.</li> <li>Foul Play is Alolan Persian's only reliable damage option, and while it struggles to do much to special attackers, it can do good damage to physical ones like Kartana and Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>Snarl lowers the foes' Special Attack stats, allowing Alolan Persian and its partner to better take hits. It also breaks Focus Sash and can force switches.</li> <li>Taunt allows Alolan Persian to stop the use of Trick Room, Tailwind, Protect, and other status moves, shutting down supporters and often scoring a free turn.</li> <li>Feint breaks through Protect, allowing Alolan Persian's teammate to strike them. However, it requires some predicting.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Most of Alolan Persian's EVs are in Speed to Speed creep Tapu Koko that lack a Speed-boosting nature.</li> <li>156 EVs are in HP for general bulk.</li> <li>The rest is in Special Defense to make Porygon2's Download boost its Attack.</li> <li>Fur Coat is the only usable ability, boosting Defense to high enough of a level that Alolan Persian can take some hits.</li> <li>Darkinium Z makes it a good pivot that can heal a bulkier attacker.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>It's best for Alolan Persian to adopt a hit-and-run playstyle, using Fake Out, then whatever support moves are deemed important, and finally retreating with Parting Shot. This way, Alolan Persian can frequently provide Fake Out support and avoid being KOed for a while despite poor Special Defense.</li> <li>Use Fake Out and then Parting Shot on either the Pokemon that is the most threatening or the one that you want to knock out right away. It also helps to target Pokemon that often do not run Protect.</li> <li>As Parting Shot allows Alolan Persian to switch in on most of the metagame, it can make for a good lead to scout the opponent and find a good matchup with the bonus of weakening the foes' offenses.</li> <li>Be more apt to switch out Alolan Persian's weakened teammates if they are in a bad matchup rather than sack them outright. A well-timed Z-Parting Shot can put them back in the game if they find a better matchup.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Alolan Persian needs something to counter Fairy-types and switch into the island guardians. Celesteela is bulky enough to take all but Electric-type attacks, while Alolan Muk can generally deal massive damage to Fairy-types and has reasonable bulk. Kartana and Nihilego can both take on Fairy-types with their high Speed and super effective STAB moves.</li> <li>Alolan Persian also needs something reliably bulky to switch out to after using Parting Shot. Celesteela can again work to deal with Fairy- and Bug-types, and so can other Steel-types like Magnezone. Tapu Fini has good mixed bulk and resists incoming Fighting-type moves. Assault Vest Goodra, though sharing a weakness to Fairy, can take many of the special attacks Alolan Persian can't and knock out Fairy-types with Sludge Bomb.</li> <li>Intimidate users work well too, as the Attack drop enhances the bulk of your team more than the effect of Parting Shot alone.</li> <li>Alolan Persian usually wants to be with something that can use the Fake Out support, like other support Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Tailwind setters as well as frail attackers such as Pheromosa and Tapu Koko. It can also work with bulky attackers to bolster their bulk with Snarl and Parting Shot.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Fake Out disables an opponent for a turn to allow Alolan Persian's ally to get a head start.</li> <li>Snarl is Alolan Persian's main move in the set, as when combined with the Assault Vest, Alolan Persian gets good mixed bulk. This gives it more staying power, changing its role from a supporting pivot to a check to special attackers.</li> <li>Foul Play is Alolan Persian's best offensive option with the lack of offensive investment and can do solid damage to physical attackers like Garchomp, Kartana, and Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>Feint expands on the set's supportive ability and is best paired with a powerful attacker to surprise and break through a Protect user as well as break Focus Sashes.</li> <li>U-turn provides an option for pivoting, though the low damage output makes it underwhelming.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment allows Alolan Persian to hit threats with Foul Play or Snarl before they strike back, and the defensive EVs give solid bulk and cause Download to give Porygon2 an Attack boost.</li> <li>Assault Vest boosts its Special Defense to usable levels, making it somewhat bulky when combined with Snarl.</li> <li>Fur Coat gives it enough physical bulk to complement its special bulk.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This set focuses more on keeping Alolan Persian in play as opposed to pivoting. That being said, don't be afraid to switch it out either when Alolan Persian has little to do or when doing so would create a better matchup, as this allows you to use Fake Out again.</li> <li>Fairy types are a significant threat, so you should carry a good Poison-type, such as Alolan Muk or Nihilego, or Steel-type, such as Celesteela or Kartana, to deal with them.</li> <li>As Snarl is Alolan Persian's most useful move, make sure it gets plenty of chances to use it. Try to send it out more as a check to special attackers than a lead; it works really well when the foe is at a disadvantage and cannot switch.</li> <li>Feint, though it requires a lot of prediction, can be used to finish off a threat with a teammate. It's especially useful in combination with Z-Moves.</li> <li>Foul Play is largely an emergency move, as it lacks power against most of the metagame. However, it can be useful against foes like Alolan Marowak and Kartana, or if you need more offensive presence to secure a win.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>As this Alolan Persian set is less mobile, it is much more important to find a partner that can exert offensive pressure to take advantage of Snarl, Fake Out, and Feint.</li> <li>Setup sweepers like Gyarados and Snorlax appreciate the Fake Out to immediately set up as well as increased special bulk through Snarl.</li> <li>Physically bulky offensive Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Gigalith can use the Snarl support to become well-rounded powerhouses and put immediate pressure on the opposing team.</li> <li>Powerful Z-Move users like Kommo-o and Araquanid appreciate Feint, as it allows their Z-Moves to go off without a hitch.</li> </ul>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Golduck is the best Swift Swim user in VGC 2017.</li> <li>Its STAB moves such as Scald, Hydro Pump, and Surf are boosted from rain.</li> <li>It is highly dependent on rain to maintain an offensive presence.</li> <li>Its bulk is decent, but it cannot survive most super effective moves.</li> <li>Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu are incredibly common, which rarely leaves Golduck unthreatened.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Surf is Golduck's only decent spread move. Though Hydro Pump is preferred, Surf is useful when combined with Storm Drain Gastrodon for a gimmicky sweep.</li> <li>Golduck has access to Calm Mind, but it's so frail that it'll find a hard time pulling it off before getting KO'd.</li> <li>Hidden Power Electric hits Gyarados and Araquanid harder than Hidden Power Grass, but you would be countered by Gastrodon, and the move is so weak that you're better off just having an Electric-type as Golduck's partner.</li> <li>A fast Disable is a good support move that can take away STAB moves meant to KO Golduck's partner (or Golduck itself).</li> <li>Though it may be tempting to run its other special attacks, such as Psychic, Psyshock, and Focus Blast for coverage, these moves don't hit Pokemon much harder than its rain-boosted STAB attacks.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Bulu can survive a super effective Ice Beam and KO Golduck with a Horn Leech or Wood Hammer. Kartana can also KO Golduck with Leaf Blade but might get KO'd first by Golduck's Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Gastrodon is serious threat to Golduck's attempt to sweep teams, as it negates all of Golduck's Water-type attacks (except Surf) and gets a power boost from it. Milotic, Gyarados, and Araquanid also take little damage from Golduck's moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Raichu outspeeds Golduck with Electric Terrain and easily KOs it with Thunderbolt. Tapu Koko and Xurkitree don't outspeed Golduck, but both can survive a Scald and KO it with their respective Electric STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Tanks</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Porygon2, and Oranguru can take on all of Golduck's Water-type attacks and then cripple it with status or set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: Considering how dependent Golduck is on rain for its Speed and power boost, opposing weather setters such as Alolan Ninetales, Gigalith, and Torkoal can severely hinder it by changing the weather condition.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: If you allow Trick Room to be set up, Golduck immediately becomes fodder, since it will become slow. Powerful Trick Room abusers such as Drampa and Vikavolt can obliterate Golduck with Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt, respectively. Paralysis from Prankster Klefki and Whimsicott harshly cuts its offensive presence by negating its Speed boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Hydro Pump is its main STAB move, which can OHKO Pokemon like Kartana and Tapu Koko in rain.</li> <li>Scald is another solid STAB move in Golduck's arsenal, since it has 80 Base Power and 100% accuracy. When used under rain, the move still does a respectable amount of damage and also has a chance to burn its targets. Hydro Pump's extra power is much more preferred, however, but if you're paranoid about Hydro Pump's less-than-perfect accuracy, feel free to use Scald.</li> <li>Encore is great for locking Pokemon into Protect after using the move last turn. It is also good for stopping setup sweepers, specifically Dragon Dance Gyarados, which Golduck would otherwise have a hard time stopping with its weak coverage.</li> <li>Ice Beam is a good coverage move that dents Pokemon like Drampa and Tapu Bulu, which would otherwise wall this set; in addition, Ice Beam can OHKO Pokemon like Garchomp and Salamence.</li> <li>Soak is another good support move that can be used over Scald, as it allows Electric-type partners such as Tapu Koko to hit Pokemon for super effective damage, which can KO Pokemon that usually survive its attacks.</li> <li>Protect serves to buy more time for Golduck as its partner deals with its checks or sets up.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Waterium Z allows Golduck to use an incredibly powerful Hydro Vortex. If the Z-move slot is already taken, Mystic Water is a decent replacement, as rain-boosted Water-type attacks are Golduck's main method for dealing damage.</li> <li>Swift Swim is required for Golduck to boost its average base 85 Speed.</li> <li>Maximum EVs in Special Attack let Golduck hit as hard as possible, and 124 Speed EVs allow Golduck to out run Choice Scarf Tapu Lele with rain.</li> <li>Modest nature is chosen over Timid because even without a Timid nature, Golduck outspeeds most Pokemon. The power boost is simply more useful, since its base Special Attack isn't that high.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Pelipper/Politoed + Golduck is a strong lead combination if none of your opponent's Pokemon challenges them, but considering how popular Electric-types, opposing weather setters, and Gastrodon are, you probably can't afford to use it. Another option is to switch in your rain setter as Golduck uses Protect. If you don't want to do either of those, saving Golduck until all of its checks are gone to sweep is a perfectly fine option.</li> <li>Set up rain as quickly as possible. If your opponent has an opposing weather setter such as Torkoal or Gigalith, be prepared to engage in weather wars. Always remember that Golduck is significantly slower and weaker without rain, so preserve your rain setter for as long as possible.</li> <li>Golduck's defensive stats are poor, so be careful of which moves you switch it in on. Switching it in on weak or resisted moves or after an ally has fainted is your best bet.</li> <li>Golduck should mainly be using Hydro Pump on foes, as it does massive damage with rain. You should save Hydro Vortex for targets bulky enough to survive Hydro Pump, such as Porygon2 and Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Avoid using Water-type attacks until Gastrodon is gone from the opponent's team. One wrong move against a Gastrodon can easily turn the tides against you. You should also watch out for opposing Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu, as they are your main offensive threats. Alolan Raichu is able to outspeed Golduck with Electric Terrain, so watch out for that lightning rat especially. They can also survive a Scald or Surf but not a Hydro Pump. Don't be afraid to still let it rip with your Water-type attacks if Tapu Koko has some prior damage.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Since rain is mandatory for Golduck to function properly, Drizzle Politoed or Drizzle Pelipper is required to be on the same team.</li> <li>Kartana makes a good teammates for Golduck, since it easily scares off bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Milotic, and it hits special tanks like Goodra much harder than Golduck can. Kartana also appreciates having its Fire weakness mitigated by the rain.</li> <li>Even under rain, Arcanine's typing, natural bulk, and Intimidate ability allow it to handle Tapu Bulu and Kartana well.</li> <li>Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, and Xurkitree greatly appreciate Golduck's ability to eliminate Alolan Marowak, while Golduck appreciates their ability take on Gyarados and Araquanid. They also love to use 100% accurate Thunder, which synergizes well with rain teams.</li> <li>Golduck gets worn down by status and attacks and is also vulnerable to strong priority attacks. Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele all give Golduck nice buffs with their respective terrains. Tapu Koko also pairs well with Golduck for the aforementioned reasons.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arcanine is one of very few Pokemon in the VGC17 format with access to Intimidate, an extremely valuable ability for most teams.</li> <li>Its well-rounded stats can be tailored to offensive or defensive roles, allowing it to fit on many different teams.</li> <li>Arcanine's deep movepool gives it options to further customize its set and makes it difficult to play around until its moves have been scouted.</li> <li>Its Fire typing lets it check many threats in the metagame; Grass-, Ice-, and Steel-types like Kartana, Ninetales, and Celesteela are at a disadvantage both offensively and defensively, and the resistance to Fairy- and opposing Fire-type attacks is often useful.</li> <li>Lack of any exceptional stat can make Arcanine underwhelming compared to more specialized offensive or defensive Pokemon.</li> <li>Common Ground-, Water-, and Rock-type attackers threaten to KO Arcanine even when weakened.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Life Orb can be used on offensive sets to boost the damage of all of Arcanine's moves, but combined with the natural recoil of Flare Blitz and Wild Charge it wears Arcanine down very quickly.</li> <li>Choice Band is another option for offensive sets that boosts all of Arcanine's moves significantly, but it can leave it locked into a suboptimal attack and prevents it from running Protect.</li> <li>Safety Goggles makes Arcanine an extremely strong answer to the Torkoal / Lilligant / Oranguru core, but it is useless in most other situations.</li> <li>Firium Z can be used on a support set for a one-time nuke, and it is usually used with Overheat or Burn Up to attack once before having to deal with their drawbacks.</li> <li>Assault Vest immediately increases Arcanine's special bulk, and combined with Snarl it can make Arcanine extremely difficult for special attackers to break. However, this does prevent Arcanine from using Protect and some of its support moves.</li> <li>Close Combat can be used on physically offensive Arcanine to hit Porygon2 and Gigalith, and it is usually seen on Choice Band sets.</li> <li>Crunch is an option on physically offensive sets to hit Alolan Marowak, which otherwise walls Arcanine.</li> <li>Helping Hand boosts a partner's attack once and is useful to exert pressure when Arcanine itself doesn't do much to either foe. It is particularly good with a partner that has strong spread moves.</li> <li>Heat Wave gives Arcanine a spread STAB attack, but the spread damage reduction and its imperfect accuracy make it undesirable for some players.</li> <li>Bulldoze can be used as a means of speed control, although it requires Arcanine's partner to use Protect or be Ground immune and is rather weak.</li> <li>Toxic can be used to wear down walls like Porygon2 and Gastrodon, especially in conjunction with Morning Sun.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp and Krookodile can both OHKO Arcanine with Tectonic Rage through Intimidate or potentially 2HKO it with Earthquake depending on EV spreads. Krookodile is naturally slower than Arcanine but usually has near-maximum Speed investment, and Garchomp is always faster than Arcanine. Mudsdale is much slower than Arcanine, but it doesn't take much damage from Arcanine's attacks due to its good defenses and can avoid being burned if Misty Terrain is up or Arcanine isn't running it. High Horsepower misses the OHKO at -1 but will 2HKO even bulky sets.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Many common Water-types in the meta give Arcanine problems. Pelipper and Golduck can OHKO Arcanine with rain-boosted Scalds, although offensive Arcanine can outspeed Pelipper and KO it with Wild Charge. Araquanid's Water Bubble makes Liquidation nearly OHKO Arcanine through Intimidate, makes Hydro Vortex easily KO any Arcanine, and even prevents Arcanine from burning Araquanid. Milotic's Competitive ability boosts its Special Attack two stages when any of its stats is lowered, turning Milotic into a massive threat if Arcanine tries to Intimidate or Snarl its partner—at +2, even an uninvested Milotic can OHKO Arcanine with Scald. Tapu Fini's Misty Surge prevents Arcanine from using Will-O-Wisp to burn it or its partner, it can deal heavy damage to Arcanine with Muddy Water, and it can use Calm Mind to offset Special Attack drops from Snarl. Gastrodon easily takes attacks from any common Arcanine set and can use Recover to stick around and annoy Arcanine throughout a match.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Nihilego outspeeds Arcanine and OHKOes almost any set with Power Gem if holding a Life Orb and can still OHKO offensive sets without a boosting item. Aerodactyl outspeeds Arcanine and does solid damage with Rock Slide, although it won't 2HKO at -1 and may only 4HKO bulky Sitrus berry sets. Gigalith is much slower than Arcanine but is often used under Trick Room, and it easily OHKOes with Continental Crush even at -1.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele doesn't enjoy taking Flare Blitz from offensive Arcanine sets, but it can deal massive damage to any Arcanine with Psychic or even OHKO with a Terrain-boosted Shattered Psyche. Psychic Terrain also prevents offensive Arcanine from using Extreme Speed to pick off Tapu Lele or its partners at low HP.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak</strong>: Marowak's typing and Lightning Rod ability allow it to take attacks from Arcanine with ease—even super-effective Snarl from defensive sets does very little, and offensive sets can hit it for resisted damage at best unless they run Crunch. Meanwhile, Marowak's Bonemerang may 2HKO Arcanine through Sitrus Berry and Intimidate and will always 3HKO even against very defensive Arcanine holding Aguav Berry.</p> <p><strong>Braviary</strong>: Defiant gives Braviary a net one-stage boost to its Attack whenever Arcanine Intimidates it, making it extremely dangerous. +1 Brave Bird may KO Arcanine without a boosting item, and Life Orb Brave Bird or Supersonic Skystrike will OHKO any Arcanine. At +1, Life Orb Braviary can OHKO Tapu Fini with Brave Bird and most Porygon2 with Superpower. Offensive Arcanine sets outspeed and may OHKO no-bulk Braviary, but you must still be wary of Adrenaline Orb, Choice Scarf, and bulkier sets.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Opposing Intimidate Pokemon can weaken physically offensive Arcanine sets and cause them to miss KOs on various targets, but specially based Arcanine are unaffected.</p>",

      "Helpful Pupper (Bulky Support)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Flamethrower provides an accurate STAB attack that can be used repeatedly, but Overheat and Burn Up are sometimes chosen for their much higher power.</li> <li>Snarl weakens special attackers, which can ignore Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, and deals chip damage to both foes.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp shuts down most physical attackers and provides helpful chip damage.</li> <li>Protect is a staple move in VGC, letting Arcanine defend itself while its partner attacks or switches to gain a stronger position. Roar can prevent opposing Trick Room and creates problems for teams focused on Extreme Evoboost, Z-Conversion, or other boosting moves. Recovering with Morning Sun helps Arcanine stay on the field and support its team for even longer, forcing the opponent to have Toxic or very strong attackers in order to break through it. Any of these moves can also replace Snarl or Will-O-Wisp if the team needs that particular support—Will-O-Wisp is often replaced on teams using Tapu Fini.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Intimidate is a VGC staple and Arcanine's best ability—it lowers the Attack stat of both foes by one stage every time Arcanine enters the field. One Intimidate turns many strong attacks aimed at your team from OHKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into 3HKOs; after two, most physical attackers become dead weight unless they're hitting for super effective damage. This Arcanine set has the bulk to switch in and out of battle repeatedly, making Intimidate even more valuable than normal.</li> <li>HP is made divisible by 4 so Sitrus Berry will activate after Nature's Madness / Super Fang and Aguav Berry will activate after Guardian of Alola. With 188 EVs in Defense, Arcanine avoids the 3HKO from Garchomp's Earthquake after Intimidate and Aguav Berry. 76 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature let Arcanine survive a Life Orb Tapu Lele's Psychic in Psychic Terrain or a Salamence's Devastating Drake.</li> <li>The EVs can easily be adjusted to suit team needs: more Speed can be used to weaken various mid-Speed attackers before they move—156 Speed with a Timid nature outspeeds Modest Tapu Lele, Adamant Krookodile, and any Gyarados; Defense and Special Defense can be balanced to hit benchmarks relevant to the team; Special Attack investment can secure Flamethrower 2HKOs or 3HKOs or Overheat or Burn Up OHKOs.</li> <li>Aguav Berry and Sitrus Berry both heal Arcanine and help it support its team for longer. Aguav Berry heals 50% compared to Sitrus Berry's 25%, but Sitrus Berry is more reliably activated.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This Arcanine can often be used as a lead to disrupt the opponent right from the start and prevent them from gaining momentum. However, this is very risky when the opponent has a Competitive or Defiant user like Milotic or Braviary unless Arcanine's partner can immediately KO them.</li> <li>If Arcanine is needed to handle an endgame threat like Celesteela, it should be preserved with a good amount of health; otherwise, it can afford to tank hits while weakening its foes.</li> <li>Arcanine can safely switch in on resisted or weaker neutral hits from the likes of Kartana, Muk, and Porygon2—this can be used to spread Intimidate, Snarl, and burns repeatedly throughout the match.</li> <li>Arcanine can work alongside nearly any Pokemon, but it is best sent out next to a partner that has strong attacks or setup options. Arcanine can lower both foes' offenses until they are no longer threatening, but it often doesn't threaten them back itself. A partner that capitalizes on this lack of opposing offensive pressure can often set up a win by getting damage onto a key threat or boosting its stats to sweep.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Water-types appreciate Arcanine scaring off Kartana and Tapu Bulu, and they hit Ground- and Rock-type attackers that threaten Arcanine. Calm Mind Tapu Fini is very often paired with this set, but Araquanid, Milotic, Gastrodon, Lapras, and others can work well depending on the team.</li> <li>Grass-types hit the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that threaten Arcanine, while Arcanine walls opposing Fire-types and KOes Steel-types that would otherwise be problematic for them. Kartana and Tapu Bulu are the most common Grass-type attackers in the format, but others like Lilligant and Dhelmise have niche roles.</li> <li>Porygon2 can use Ice Beam to easily KO Garchomp, which otherwise threatens to chunk Arcanine with Earthquake or even OHKO it with Tectonic Rage. Intimidate and Snarl from Arcanine further increase Porygon2's impressive bulk, allowing it to handle nearly any attacks thrown its way. Even Pheromosa can no longer OHKO Porygon2 when affected by Intimidate, and Arcanine easily KOes Pheromosa in return.</li> <li>Celesteela uses Arcanine's Intimidate and Snarl support to more easily stall out teams with Leech Seed, and Arcanine hits Pokemon like Kartana that wall non-Flamethrower variants of Celesteela. In return, Celesteela can switch in to take certain powerful attacks aimed at Arcanine, such as Tectonic Rage from Garchomp, Shattered Psyche from Tapu Lele, and Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z.</li> <li>This Arcanine set generally fits best on bulky offensive teams, which can make full use of Arcanine's defensive support to dish out big damage and safely switch into strong positions.</li> </ul>"

      "Attack Doggo (Physically Offensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Flare Blitz is chosen as STAB attack despite the recoil because it is vastly more powerful than Arcanine's other physical Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Wild Charge hits Water-types like Tapu Fini, Milotic, and Araquanid which resist Arcanine's STAB. While it won't OHKO these targets, it does deal a large chunk and may even KO after they switch into a Flare Blitz.</li> <li>Extreme Speed is used to finish off weakened targets and to put foes into KO range of a faster partner.</li> <li>Protect shields Arcanine from attacks for one turn, and this Arcanine set usually needs it because it can't easily shrug off hits without bulk investment.</li> <li>Support moves like Roar can replace one of Arcanine's coverage attacks if its partners handle the relevant threats already and/or if the utility is needed.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>This set is less able to repeatedly switch in and Intimidate foes throughout a match, but Intimidate is still by far Arcanine's best ability. Weakening a physical attacker on even one occasion is often all it takes for Arcanine and its partners to seize momentum.</li> <li>Maximum Attack is used to hit as hard as possible.</li> <li>Maximum investment with Arcanine's solid base 95 Speed lets it outspeed mid-Speed Pokemon without worrying about Speed creep wars, and bulk investment would often be pointless when using attacks with recoil damage.</li> <li>Jolly Arcanine at worst Speed ties with non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, usually being faster due to few Tapu Lele being Timid. It also guarantees outrunning non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, Krookodile, and Xurkitree. Many Pokemon around this Speed tier don't use Speed-boosting natures, though, so Adamant Arcanine can be used for greater power while still often outspeeding these foes. The increased power allows Adamant Arcanine to probably 2HKO Leftovers Tapu Fini with Wild Charge where Jolly Arcanine almost never will, for example.</li> <li>Firium Z gives Arcanine a recoil-free and very powerful Fire-type attack but doesn't boost its coverage moves. Electrium Z lets Arcanine deal massive damage to Tapu Fini, Araquanid, and other Water-types that usually give it trouble, but it doesn't boost its primary attacking move. Importantly, both of these options are only usable once per battle and inhibit Arcanine's partners from using Z-moves.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Arcanine is often a fine lead to immediately weaken opposing physical attackers and to pressure foes with Flare Blitz. Wild Charge hits Milotic hard enough that its presence doesn't always force Arcanine to stay in the back, but you should still be wary of it.</li> <li>Arcanine should be played carefully if needed to handle a specific threat like Celesteela or Kartana—this set is rather vulnerable to being worn down by neutral hits and the recoil from its own attacks.</li> <li>Keeping up momentum is very important with this set—if Arcanine's partner is too passive, your opponent can easily tank Arcanine's attacks and wear it down. On the other hand, Arcanine can pin many foes when next to another strong attacker.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Kartana easily KOes Gastrodon and other Water-types for Arcanine, and Arcanine can KO Celesteela and opposing Kartana. Even Pokemon that are strong against both members of this pair often struggle to handle them both simultaneously—Alolan Marowak can switch into a Flare Blitz or Leaf Blade, but you threaten the KO on the next turn with the combination of Night Slash and Flare Blitz.</li> <li>Tapu Lele's Terrain-boosted Psychic deals heavy damage to everything in the metagame except Steel-types, opposing Tapu Lele, and Muk. The first two go down easily to Arcanine's Inferno Overdrive and nearly to normal Flare Blitz; even though Muk can take Inferno Overdrive, it definitely won't enjoy it. Using Tapu Lele does have the notable drawback of blocking Arcanine's Extreme Speed—this can be handled with careful Terrain management or by choosing a utility or coverage move for that slot instead.</li> <li>Ninetales outspeeds Garchomp and OHKOes it with Blizzard, hits Water-types hard with Freeze-Dry, and can set Aurora Veil to increase Arcanine's durability. In return, Arcanine scares away Ninetales's Steel-type nemeses and chunks specially bulky Pokemon like Snorlax and Tapu Lele, which can tank Blizzards.</li> <li>Water-types have strong type synergy with Arcanine, being protected from Grass-types and helping protect Arcanine against Ground- and Rock-types. This Arcanine set generally prefers more offensive partners to maintain momentum, such as Araquanid and Choice Specs Tapu Fini, but bulkier Water-types can work as well.</li> <li>Arcanine is weak to two of the most common spread attacks, Rock Slide and Earthquake, so Wide Guard support can be useful. Araquanid, Gigalith, Aerodactyl, Hariyama, and Celesteela are the most viable users.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Gengar's great typing gives it a coveted Fairy-type resistance and, on top of that, it is immune to all Normal-type attacks. This makes it excellent to switch-in to Fake Out.</li> <li>Its main role in the metagame comes from its combination of great Speed, strong yet consistent STAB attacks, and a very high base 130 Special Attack stat. Its niche is providing a fast way to get solid damage on Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele, but it also can damage Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Arcanine.</li> <li>Gengar's phenomenal Speed tier allows it to outrun Kartana and Alolan Ninetales, both of which are very common Pokemon in the metagame. It also means that it can outspeed its primary threat, Garchomp.</li> <li>Low bulk pretty much requires that it be run with Focus Sash, which also limits its offensive potential. This puts Gengar in a very awkward spot, as it means it won't be able to get much done without it and a partner supporting it.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Ghostium Z allows Gengar the ability to chose between either a strong Never-Ending Nightmare or Z-Destiny Bond to take advantage of when opponents are baited into targeting Gengar.</li> <li>Poisonium Z can be used to have a nuke that can OHKO many Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, offensive Arcanine, and Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Life Orb can increase damage output on Pokemon that Gengar already does solid damage to, such as Marowak, Metagross, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Lele. Running Life Orb does completely compromise Gengar's survivability, however.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be used as a check to Assault Vest Kartana, ensuring a knock out.</li> <li>Disable may be used for additional utility (it won't stop Z-moves, however). It's also worth noting that when paired with an Encore user, it can completely shut out a Pokemon from doing anything but Struggling, if it chooses to stay in.</li> <li>Energy Ball can cover Gastrodon and do decent damage to Mudsdale, and Thunderbolt can be used to blast Gyarados and deal additional super effective coverage on things like Celesteela and Araquanid. Hidden Power Ice can do solid damage to Garchomp and other Pokemon with a 4x weaknesses, such as Salamence.</li> <li>Haze can be used to cover for niche threats like Eevee teams, but otherwise is a rather useless move.</li> <li>Perish Song can be used as a way to secure wins late-game, and also provides checks to things such as Eevee and Palossand.</li> <li>Trick Room is rather unexpected in a best-of-one setting, but is rather obvious and easy to play around in best-of-three battles.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Alolan Muk</strong>: Gengar's STAB attacks do virtually no damage to Alolan Muk due to its great bulk on top of its Dark and Poison typing resisting both of them. Muk, on the other hand, can bring Gengar down to its Focus Sash with Knock Off, and then potentially follow up with a Shadow Sneak. If not, it can simply just finish Gengar with a clean second Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Gigalith</strong>: The fact that Gigalith summons sandstorm means that it can break Gengar's Focus Sash, in addition to the fact that it gains boosted Special Defense when in sandstorm. Gigalith's Earthquake is strong enough to one shot a Gengar barring Focus Sash, meaning Gengar's best play is really to just flee the field.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything holding a Choice Scarf, such as Garchomp, can easily outspeed and bring Gengar to its Focus Sash. Garchomp in particular can also switch in on any of Gengar's attacks without taking too much damage. Other fast Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko and Aerodactyl, don't even need a Choice Scarf to outspeed and damage Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Gengar's great Speed can become its largest weakness once Trick Room goes up, as attackers can take full advantage of Gengar's little bulk. Snorlax and Araquanid deserve a mention as well as Knock Off from Hariyama and Eruption from Torkoal will bring Gengar down to its Focus Sash if it has one.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Gengar severely struggles against Pokemon that can sponge its hits and do decent damage back to it, such as Porygon2, Snorlax, and Araquanid. The latter two also have the ability to bring Gengar down to its Focus Sash, whereas Gengar can 3HKO Araquanid at best. In addition, Celesteela can easily hold its own with Gengar, even if it is Taunted.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Sludge Bomb is used for reliable, strong STAB coverage, especially on Fairy-types. Its higher damage output than Shadow Ball coupled with its 30% chance to inflict poison means this is the move that will be used in most scenarios.</li> <li>Shadow Ball to provide a consistent secondary STAB move that can hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for super effective damage as well as hitting Steel-types neutrally.</li> <li>Fast Taunt makes Gengar an excellent utility Pokemon, especially when a lot of the Pokemon that enjoys to use Taunt against are at the forefront of the metagame, such as Porygon2.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp has a niche in crippling physical attackers, which usually ends up helping the team out more than Gengar itself. With this increased utility, Gengar is great for supporting certain teams that need ways to halt physical attackers. It's worth it to note that Will-O-Wisp will be rendered useless in Misty Terrain, unless the target is a Flying-type or Levitate Pokemon.</li> <li>Protect is for capitalizing on turns where Gengar puts pressure on the opponent. With a Focus Sash, Gengar is very likely to be attacked twice in one turn. Using Protect to potentially make the opponent waste an entire turn in such a fast-paced metagame can be absolutely crucial.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Focus Sash is to ensure at least one move goes off, and patches up Gengar's low bulk. It also makes Gengar very open to double targets, which is why Protect can be seen as a useful move choice.</li> <li>Cursed Body has a 30% chance to disable crucial attacks from the opponent, which can occasionally win games.</li> <li>The EV spread maximizes both Gengar's Speed and attacking potential. Without the Speed investment, Gengar falls behind both Alolan Ninetales and Kartana, and even Garchomp if you sacrifice more Speed or choose to play with a Modest nature. In addition, there's no reason to sacrifice attacking power for more bulk, as the Focus Sash ensures that Gengar will be, at worst, 2HKOed.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Scout for teams that have Pokemon faster than Gengar such as Tapu Koko, as they'll be able to easily bring Gengar down to its Focus Sash.</li> <li>Gengar is a good pick to bring against Trick Room teams, where they usually don't have checks to a Taunt user like Gengar that is immune to Fake Out.</li> <li>Use Gengar's utility moves to support your team, in ways like burning strong physical attackers.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Use other fast Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko, to follow up on Gengar's fast attacks with an additional fast attack. This offensive momentum makes it more likely that Gengar and its partner can KO threats and Gengar can stay around longer.</li> <li>Pheromosa is another fast Pokemon that can eliminate Pokemon that Gengar has a bad matchup against, such as Garchomp with Ice Beam and Porygon2 with High Jump Kick, or even All-Out Pummeling if a Z-crystal hasn't already been taken.</li> <li>Pelipper and Golduck can cover up Gengar's Ground-type weakness with strong Water- and Ice-type moves; just note that a lot of common Pokemon in the format have prepared for this combination.</li> <li>Snorlax and Gigalith are good Trick Room checks, which Gengar struggles under if the opponent manages to get a Trick Room up. They're both slower than almost all common Trick Room attackers, and Snorlax can become the slowest viable Pokemon in the format after one Curse.</li> <li>Porygon2 packs a strong Ice Beam that can OHKO Garchomp and 2HKO Krookodile with the right investment, and has bulk that any Pokemon in the format appreciates.</li> <li>Araquanid and Celesteela can use to Wide Guard to block out Earthquakes, but keep in mind this does not block Tectonic Rage and will make your opponent more likely to use Tectonic Rage over Earthquake.</li> <li>Mandibuzz has Tailwind support and covers Gengar's and Ground-type weaknesses very well. Vikavolt also does this, trading a Psychic immunity for the ability to do lots of damage to Celesteela and Kartana.</li> </ul>"

Pokemon like Gigalith and Celesteela are the main threats. Pokemon like Buzzwole help deal with these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Tapu Koko can Speed tie Aerodactyl and hit it back with super effective STAB Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf Xurkitree also outspeeds Aerodactyl and can hit Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns lower Aerodactyl's Attack, limiting its use even though the most common Intimidate user is a Fire-type.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room presents a major problem to Aerodactyl if it isn't using Taunt, as it takes away most of Aerodactyl's usefulness and lets down the whole team when Tailwind is active.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Rock Slide has STAB, flinch chance, and covers the whole of the opponent's field, making it very useful to spread damage quickly.</li> <li>Sky Drop can remove a foe temporarily from the field, giving space for teammates to take care of another foe.</li> <li>Tailwind doubles the Speed of the team for four turns, aiding slower teammates.</li> <li>Protect ensures that Aerodactyl stays protected when a teammate switches in, takes down a threat, or gets free damage while punishing a double target.</li> <li>Taunt can be used to stop Trick Room setters like Porygon2 and Mimikyu and make sure Aerodactyl's Tailwind doesn't get countered easily. It can also interfere with setup sweepers like Snorlax, ruining their strategy.</li> <li>Wide Guard is mainly to cover the team from spreading moves like Rock Slide, Earthquake, Muddy Water, and Surf.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Focus Sash prevents OHKOs on Aerodactyl, as it is very prone to being OHKOed with its low Defense.</li> <li>Unnerve counters Berry users, which are very common in VGC17. Examples include Arcanine, Snorlax, Gastrodon, and Alolan Muk. It shines as the only viable Unnerve user in the metagame.</li> <li>Jolly nature maximizes Speed to benefit from Tailwind the most. 252 Speed EVs make Aerodactyl as fast as possible. 252 Attack EVs let Aerodactyl hit hard as possible with remaining EVs invested in HP.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Aerodactyl should most often be used as a lead, setting up Tailwind and spreading damage with Rock Slide until switching out.</li> <li>Preserving Aerodactyl's Focus Sash is important, as it gives Aerodactyl a lifeline to hang on to in case of an emergency.</li> <li>Be sure to remember some of Sky Drop's additional effects including nullifying moves like Follow Me and Rage Powder as well as the inability to hit Pokemon weighing more than 200kg like Celesteela, Mudsdale, and Snorlax.</li> <li>Playing aggressively with Aerodactyl works, as it can take advantage of Tailwind and spam Rock Slides. This can get it knocked out and a sweeper can switch in and take advantage of Tailwind quicker.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Pokemon that can make use of Tailwind are appreciated. Good choices are mainly Pokemon with middling Speed stats like Xurkitree, Tapu Lele, and Buzzwole.</li> <li>Ground-type Pokemon like Garchomp and Krookodile cover Aerodacty's weaknesses of Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-type Pokemon as well as being able to spam Earthquake with no care in the world. Gastrodon also redirects Water-type attacks, giving extra support.</li> <li>Steel-types like Kartana, Metagross, and Celesteela also resist most of Aerodactyl's weaknesses.</li> <li>If Aerodactyl isn't using Taunt then a Taunt user is appreciated to counter Trick Room. Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Whimsicott, and Tapu Lele are great Taunt users.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>A very low Speed stat combined with great bulk and solid Attack makes Snorlax effective both as a Trick Room attacker and as a check to opposing Trick Room cores.</li> <li>Snorlax is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the buff to Figy Berry and its relatives—with Gluttony, Snorlax can recover 50% of its HP whenever it falls below 50% of its total. The combination of a Figy Berry and an enormous HP stat makes Snorlax quite difficult to KO and enables it to safely use boosting moves like Curse and Belly Drum.</li> <li>Snorlax's Normal typing offers no useful resistances, but few Pokemon in the VGC 2017 format carry the Fighting-type moves that could exploit its one weakness.</li> <li>Base 110 Attack with STAB Return lets Snorlax hit most of the format for solid neutral damage, but it can struggle to break through bulkier foes without boosts from Curse or Belly Drum.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Mono-attacking sets can be viable, since few Ghost-types are common in the VGC 2017 metagame. Usually these sets are Return / Recycle / Protect with Curse or Belly Drum, but variants such as Return / Belly Drum / Stockpile / Recycle are also usable.</li> <li>Facade deals more damage when Snorlax is inflicted with status, but it is weak otherwise.</li> <li>Rock Slide deals spread damage and can cause a flinch if Snorlax is moving first due to Trick Room, but it is rather weak and has imperfect accuracy.</li> <li>Choice Band gives Snorlax much greater immediate power, but running it sacrifices bulk and setup potential.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hariyama, Pheromosa, and Buzzwole are practically the only Pokemon in the format that can cleanly OHKO Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Kartana</strong>: Kartana's Sacred Sword hits Snorlax for super effective damage and slices right through any Defense boosts it has gained from Curse. Even though Kartana doesn't OHKO Snorlax, it deals heavy damage, and Snorlax deals mediocre damage in return unless it's boosted.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Celesteela takes very little damage from Snorlax's attacks and can heal back any lost health with Leech Seed and Leftovers. It can't deal much damage to Snorlax in return, however, so Snorlax can set up and eventually break through Celesteela.</p> <p><strong>Preventing Berry Use</strong>: Snorlax's Berry is central to its bulk and its ability to set up; Pokemon with the ability Unnerve can prevent Snorlax from eating its Berry while on the field, making it much easier to KO. Knock Off is even more dangerous—if Snorlax's Berry is Knocked Off, not only does it not get recovery on that turn, but it can't use Recycle to regain the Berry later in the game. Bug Bite and Thief are much rarer than Knock Off but can similarly prevent Snorlax from using its Berry at any point in the game.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burn</strong>: Intimidate offsets boosts from Curse and forces Snorlax to keep boosting in order to have offensive pressure, although Belly Drum sets are not greatly hindered. If not partnered with Tapu Fini, all Snorlax sets are vulnerable to being burned and having their damage output severely hampered.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic slowly wears Snorlax down and eventually deals more damage than it can recover with Recycle and its Iapapa Berry.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Snorlax from setting up with Curse or Belly Drum and from recovering its Berry with Recycle.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Return is Snorlax's preferred STAB move due to its high power and perfect accuracy.</li> <li>High Horsepower is chosen to hit threats such as Arcanine, Muk, Gigalith, and Marowak for super effective damage and to hit Kartana for neutral damage. It does leave Snorlax completely walled by Drifblim and Mismagius, but for most players this is not concerning enough to run a different attack.</li> <li>Curse quickly boosts Snorlax's Attack stat to terrifying levels while patching up its rather low Defense. It also brings Snorlax's Speed even lower, enabling it to underspeed even Gigalith and Torkoal.</li> <li>Recycle combines with Gluttony and an Iapapa Berry to give Snorlax reliable recovery, allowing it to shrug off hits while boosting with Curse.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>The combination of Gluttony and an Iapapa Berry is crucial to how Snorlax functions—it nearly always has to take hits before it can set up and deal damage, which is only possible with the powerful recovery provided by a pinch Berry with Gluttony.</li> <li>A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs make Snorlax as slow as possible for maximum effectiveness in Trick Room.</li> <li>The HP and Defense EVs allow Snorlax to survive Araquanid's Hydro Vortex and give it an even HP stat, causing Iapapa Berry to activate if it is hit with Super Fang or Nature's Madness.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are dumped in Attack to maximize Snorlax's damage output.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This Snorlax can be used alongside a Trick Room setter, but it is also very effective as a Trick Room check on teams that are primarily fast. The mere presence of Snorlax on the field can make an opponent hesitant to set up Trick Room for fear of accelerating its sweep.</li> <li>Against teams that lack Fighting-types or the powerful attackers that can threaten Snorlax with neutral attacks, Snorlax can take the field early in a game and begin boosting right away. Barring untimely critical hits, it is often safe to alternate Curse and Recycle for several turns and then tear through the opposing team.</li> <li>Snorlax has great natural special bulk, so it can be used to sponge damage from attackers such as Tapu Koko and Ninetales. This should be done somewhat carefully to avoid losing Snorlax prematurely—if Snorlax loses its Berry and too much of its health, your opponent will likely double attack it to eliminate it quickly.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Fini is a great partner for Snorlax—Misty Terrain protects Snorlax from burns, which would hinder its damage output, and Toxic, which would wear it down despite its bulk and recovery. Tapu Fini can also switch in on Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snorlax, and it can use Moonblast to threaten Fighting-types like Pheromosa, Buzzwole, and Hariyama.</li> <li>Arcanine is one of the best answers to Kartana, which can deal major damage to Snorlax through its Defense boosts with Sacred Sword. Arcanine also threatens Celesteela, which Snorlax struggles to damage unless it has boosted several times. Intimidate bolsters Snorlax's low Defense stat even before it starts using Curse, and if Arcanine carries Snarl it can help Snorlax to tank special attacks as well.</li> <li>Garchomp can easily eliminate Muk with Tectonic Rage; Muk can effectively neuter Snorlax by Knocking Off its Berry, which prevents its from being found with Recycle and denies Snorlax recovery for the rest of the game. Snorlax can easily switch in to common attacks that threaten Garchomp, such as Porygon2's Ice Beam, Ninetales's Blizzard, and Fairy-type attacks from Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Tapu Koko can hit Fighting-types for super effective damage with Dazzling Gleam, while Thunderbolt covers Pokemon such as Celesteela and Drifblim, which can wall Snorlax.</li> <li>Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil to boost Snorlax's bulk even further and make it easier to set up several Curses.</li> <li>Trick Room support from Porygon2 or Mimikyu helps Snorlax to boost and sweep more easily, but Curse Snorlax doesn't rely on Trick Room to be effective.</li> </ul>"

      "DrumLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Return is Snorlax's preferred STAB move due to its high power and perfect accuracy.</li> <li>High Horsepower is chosen to hit threats such as Arcanine, Muk, Gigalith, and Marowak for super effective damage and to hit Kartana for neutral damage. Crunch is an option to avoid being completely walled by Drifblim and Mismagius and for perfect accuracy.</li> <li>Belly Drum boosts Snorlax's Attack to +6, allowing it to OHKO practically anything in the format, at the cost of 50% of its health. The combination of Gluttony and an Iapapa Berry causes Snorlax to immediately recover the lost health, making this setup incredibly powerful.</li> <li>A +6 Snorlax is going to be a high-priority target, and many opponents will try to KO it by doubling into it. Protect can heavily punish those plays, effectively giving Snorlax's partner a free turn. Protect is also useful for guarding Snorlax while setting or resetting Trick Room, which this set often requires.</li> <li>Recycle can be used instead of Protect—this allows Snorlax to more safely take hits early in the battle while keeping enough health to Belly Drum later, but not being able to guard against double targets means Snorlax will often be quickly focused down after it boosts.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Gluttony ensures that Iapapa Berry will activate after Belly Drum, healing back all the HP lost.</li> <li>A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are recommended to make Snorlax as slow as possible in Trick Room.</li> <li>Maximum Attack is used so that Snorlax hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are used to bolster its Defense.</li> <li>Snorlax can run bulkier spreads if desired, since very few Pokemon can survive a hit from +6 Snorlax even without full Attack investment. A spread of 180 HP / 76 Atk / 252 Def gives Snorlax even greater bulk while keeping the ability to OHKO standard Assault Vest Kartana with High Horsepower and most Porygon2 with Return after boosting. Usually, bulkier spreads will run Recycle over Protect—the choice of spread and fourth move comes down to personal preference and specific team composition.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This Snorlax is used as an incredibly potent Trick Room sweeper, capable of quickly destroying unprepared teams.</li> <li>Snorlax's great bulk allows it to soak up some attacks, but this set needs to be more careful about preserving its HP so that it remains healthy enough to set up Belly Drum.</li> <li>Snorlax can effectively use Belly Drum at any point in a game—it can come out and boost early on, which forces your opponent to focus on KOing Snorlax while leaving its teammates unchecked. This works well if your opponent doesn't have any threats that can only be defeated by your Snorlax, and if your team has other powerful attackers to serve as wincons after Snorlax goes down. Alternatively, Snorlax can remain in the back until its checks have been removed or weakened and then take the field for a late-game sweep. This strategy is preferred when Snorlax is your only way to beat a certain Pokemon on the opposing team—for example, Porygon2 if your team lacks a Fighting-type or Toxic—or when your opponent has a Pokemon such as Hariyama that will seriously threaten Snorlax until it is removed.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Mimikyu is one of the best partners for DrumLax—it is a reliable Trick Room setter, and it has several powerful options for its other moves. When facing foes slower than Mimikyu, Z-Destiny Bond can allow Snorlax to set up for free and simultaneously eliminate an opposing Pokemon. Psych Up can be used to copy Snorlax's boosts after it uses Belly Drum, forcing your opponent to deal with two +6 Attack Pokemon at once. Taunt can be used to stop opposing Taunt, Roar, or Haze users that try to stop Snorlax from boosting.</li> <li>Porygon2 is another reliable Trick Room setter, although it has fewer support options than Mimikyu and does share Snorlax's weakness to the Fighting type. Porygon2 is often used along with Mimikyu so that you can still set Trick Room if Mimikyu sacrifices itself with Z-Destiny Bond instead.</li> <li>Clefairy can use Follow Me to redirect attacks away from Snorlax while it boosts, and Friend Guard provides even more protection. With this support, Snorlax can sometimes sweep even outside of Trick Room.</li> <li>Psych Up users such as Metagross can copy Snorlax's boosts and quickly overwhelm your opponent with enormous offensive pressure.</li> <li>Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain protects Snorlax from burns, which would prevent it from sweeping, and Tapu Fini can hit Fighting-types for super effective damage with Moonblast.</li> <li>Ninetales can use Aurora Veil to boost Snorlax's bulk and make it safer to set up Belly Drum.</li> </ul>"

Encore can trap a foe into a move, making space for a teammate to set up easily, and Perish Song can guarantee wins when needed and can be useful when the opponent is on their last limb.</li> <li>Although Politoed has only two weaknesses, they are seen everywhere in the metagame, with Tapu Koko and Kartana being very common.</li> </ul>",

Pokemon like Torkoal, Gigalith, and Alolan Ninetales are all examples of opposing weather setters.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Politoed has trouble taking hits from the majority of Grass-types in the tier, including hard hitters like Tapu Bulu and Kartana and other minor threats like Lilligant. Although Politoed can do some damage with Ice Beam if it survives, its subpar Special Attack means it won't likely be getting many KOs.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Politoed has trouble staying in on most Electric-types in the format, as most of them, like Tapu Koko and Togedemaru, outspeed it and can OHKO it with Thunder and Zing Zap.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon redirects Scald and Hydro Pump thanks to Storm Drain and interferes when Politoed is trying to hit another Pokemon.

It should also switch back in when the rain has ended in order to reset it.</li> <li>Perish Song should only be used against setup sweepers or at the end of the game.

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 establishes itself as the premier Trick Room setter in the VGC 2017 metagame boasting great overall bulk with Eviolite, and offensive capability with Download. Porygon2 gets access to a good amount of offensive coverage, capable of tackling the likes of Garchomp, Araquanid, and Tapu Bulu with Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. Porygon2 also displays great prowess in endgame situations thanks to Recover and Toxic allowing it to poison bulky targets that it usually doesn't hit so well, such as Snorlax, and continually heal. While Porygon2's only weakness is very uncommon in the metagame, Fighting-types like Hariyama, Pheromosa, and Buzzwole can cause it plenty of trouble. Its main drawback comes when fighting against bulkier Steel-types such as Celesteela that can shrug off Toxic and match its defensive capabilities. Its offensive presence is also significantly decreased when Download boosts Attack, making it somewhat less reliable. Additionally, Porygon2 is susceptible to Knock Off from Alolan Muk and Hariyama, making it significantly less bulky.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Ice Beam is Porygon2's primary damaging move thanks to its wide coverage, being particularly effective against the likes of Garchomp and Tapu Bulu. Thunderbolt is a great coverage option that gives Porygon2 a nice way to break through Celesteela and Tapu Fini, which it would be unable to do otherwise. Toxic can make Porygon2 a consistent wincon in longer games, especially against bulkier Pokemon such as Snorlax and Pokemon it would otherwise struggle to hit such as Alolan Marowak. Trick Room is Porygon2's best utility, providing the team with a great speed control option against the slew of fast Pokemon in the metagame like Tapu Koko, Alolan Ninetales, and Kartana. Recover gives Porygon2 longevity, allowing it to successfully play out endgames with Toxic or outlast opposing Pokemon that don't have their own recovery. Download is the most common ability on Porygon2, as it gives it a chance to become a genuine offensive presence, notably allowing it to OHKO Garchomp and 2HKO Tapu Koko with Ice Beam. Analytic is a good alternative that provides a more consistent boost to damage thanks to its relatively low Speed.</p> <p>Porygon2 always wants to set Trick Room up for slower teammates such as Gigalith, Araquanid, and Alolan Muk, allowing these sorts of teams to snowball. Porygon2 is capable of dueling most Pokemon in the metagame thanks to Download, so it is beneficial to play a longer endgame while continually healing with Recover, especially against foes that don't have a super effective move or access to a Z-Move. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are best used in conjunction thanks to covering a good portion of the current metagame, but Toxic is an idea to overcome bulky threats such as Snorlax and opposing Porygon2 if the team would otherwise struggle with them. Porygon2 also appreciates Arcanine as a partner, having its bulk supplemented by its Intimidate, Snarl, and Will-O-Wisp and having problematic Pokemon such as Pheromosa and Buzzwole dealt with thanks to Flare Blitz.</p>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Pelipper is a good rain setter either on a dedicated rain duo or by itself due to its typing and movepool, and it can also be used to eliminate opposing weather.</li> <li>It has good dual STAB moves in Scald and Hurricane, keeping it a threat instead of something your opponent can ignore and take advantage of, and the rain boosts its Scalds to be even stronger.</li> <li>It also has access to Tailwind, which provides the rest of the team with speed control.</li> <li>Pelipper is relatively frail and has a quadruple weakness to Electric-type moves, making it more frail than Politoed, another potential rain setter.</li> <li>The rain archetype in general is very offensive, relying on outspeeding and dealing heavy damage to the opposing team without taking much damage in return. It can sweep through unprepared teams, but well-prepared opponents will have an easier time dealing with it.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Hydro Pump can be used if you want even more damage output on Pelipper, but its accuracy makes it unreliable.</li> <li>Ice Beam is an option if you want Pelipper to hit Ground- and Dragon-types harder, but it is significantly weaker on targets neutral to both Ice Beam and Hurricane.</li> <li>Pelipper can be built to be more bulky, as it has access to Roost to stay around a lot longer, but its mediocre defenses leave much to be desired.</li> <li>Wide Guard can be used if your team is weak to spread moves, but Pelipper finds it difficult to replace one of its other four moves with it.</li> <li>Life Orb is viable if you want Pelipper to hit even harder, though it makes it more difficult for Pelipper to set up Tailwind.</li> <li>Lastly, Pelipper can also be used as more of a supporter, using much more defensive EVs and a Sitrus Berry, which could be useful if you want Pelipper to stick around for a longer time. On a set like this, you could also use Roost or U-turn.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Any Electric-type move will either OHKO Pelipper or knock it down to its Focus Sash, and Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Raichu can outspeed Pelipper before it gets a chance to move. They also take reduced damage from Hurricane and can take advantage of the rain with an accurate Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Goodra</strong>: Possessing titanic special bulk and an expansive movepool, Goodra can tank anything that rain teams can throw at it and deal huge damage back with a Thunderbolt or Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Storm Drain makes Gastrodon an incredibly effective counter to rain teams, and it can completely cripple the popular Pelipper + Golduck pairing.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room Pokemon are usually very bulky and won't be OHKOed by Pelipper's attacks, and Trick Room itself can turn any advantage gained from Tailwind into a liability. Porygon2 can survive being attacked by both Pelipper and its partner on the same turn, set Trick Room, and hit back hard with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Most other weather setters have a good matchup against Pelipper. Ninetales and Vanilluxe hit it back hard with Freeze-Dry, and their hail can break Pelipper's Focus Sash. Torkoal is slower than Pelipper normally, meaning the sun will be up if they are both used to lead. Gigalith has titanic Special Defense under sand, especially if it is also carrying an Assault Vest, a common item on it, and its Rock-type moves hit Pelipper super effectively.</p>",

      "Offensive Rain Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Scald and Hurricane are the go-to STAB moves of choice, providing strong offensive coverage that can hit many Pokemon for at least neutral effectiveness. Hurricane is also perfectly accurate in rain, which could help against opposing Pokemon that try to increase their evasion.</li> <li>Tailwind lets Pelipper support its team in scenarios where its attacks wouldn't hit very hard, so its teammates can start dealing more damage first.</li> <li>Protect lets Pelipper survive opposing attacks that might KO it or break its Focus Sash, so it can survive longer.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used to make Pelipper as fast and as offensive as possible, with the remaining 4 EVs placed in HP.</li> <li>Pelipper doesn't really need a Timid nature to outspeed anything significant, and it can boost its Speed with Tailwind anyway, so the extra power that Modest provides is appreciated.</li> <li>Drizzle is mandatory for Pelipper to do its job, and it is the only thing that makes Pelipper viable.</li> <li>Focus Sash is necessary for Pelipper to set Tailwind more reliably and can even set it in the face of strong Electric-type attackers, letting Pelipper outspeed them afterwards.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Pelipper is a good lead, as its Focus Sash lets it ensure that it gets up Tailwind early on unless it is double targeted. Once Tailwind is up, you can continue hitting the foes hard with Pelipper or switch it out to let its teammates take full advantage of the increased Speed.</li> <li>Use Protect to block Fake Out and being double-targeted.</li> <li>Be wary of opposing Pokemon with Trick Room, as Tailwind under Trick Room makes your Pokemon even more vulnerable.</li> <li>Opposing weathers can be an issue. If an opposing team is well-prepared for rain offense, you can just use Pelipper as more of a support Pokemon to set Tailwind and hit opposing Pokemon with rain-boosted Scalds. Opponents are likely to bring their own form of weather to counter yours. Take note of the Speed of the other weather setters, and if you think Pelipper will outspeed them, don't lead with it so you can switch it in later.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Golduck is a fantastic partner to Pelipper, as Golduck is the best Swift Swim user in the format, and Pelipper's rain also powers up its Water-type attacks. Early-game pressure from Golduck also makes it easier for Pelipper to set up Tailwind for subsequent turns.</li> <li>Grass-types such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu are good partners to Pelipper, as they can switch in on any Electric-type attacks directed at it and immediately threaten the foe.</li> <li>Ground-types like Garchomp and Krookodile can also switch in on Electric-type attacks and are free to use Earthquake next to Pelipper due to its Flying typing.</li> <li>Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu, Tapu Koko, and Xurkitree are useful to take on any bulky Water-types that your opponent brought to tackle the rain.</li> <li>Teammates that can take on other weather setters are also appreciated, as Pelipper has a difficult time dealing with most of them. Fire- and Rock-types like Arcanine and Nihilego are useful against hail and sun teams, while the Grass-types mentioned above are useful against sand and opposing rain teams.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Torkoal could use Choice Specs, but Torkoal likes Eruption and Eruption likes Protect.</li> <li>Fire Blast, Overheat, and Lava Plume are all alternative Fire-type moves.</li> <li>Torkoal has access to good supportive moves such as Will-O-Wisp, but it is better off doing damage instead.</li> <li>Alternative Hidden Power types are also options. Hidden Power Electric can catch Pelipper and Gyarados for heavy damage.</li> <li>Torkoal really has few other relevant offensive moves: Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types, while Nature Power can be cute with Terrain play and provides Torkoal with some diverse coverage options at the cost of being somewhat unreliable.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon</strong>: Dragon-types such as Salamence resist both Fire-type moves and Solar Beam. Assault Vest Garchomp can take multiple Eruptions, while Drampa has Cloud Nine to cripple Torkoal's damage output and does not mind being in Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Opposing bulky Fire-types, primarily Arcanine, resist Torkoal's moves and also have positive matchups against Lilligant.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Gyarados can take multiple Eruptions and can chip Torkoal down. Pokemon such as Milotic and Gastrodon can take Eruption, but they need to be careful because Solar Beam will deal heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Nihilego has great Special Defense alongside Rock typing. Gigalith has Sand Stream, which removes sun and buffs its Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Gigalith and Pelipper resist Fire and remove Torkoal's harsh sunlight, and they threaten Torkoal with their respective super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Gigalith, Aerodactyl, and Araquanid all commonly carry Wide Guard, crippling Torkoal's damage output. They also all resist Eruption, which lets them take attacks from Torkoal if necessary.</p>",

      "Eruption": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Eruption is the selling point and will be Torkoal's main damage tool.</li> <li>Heat Wave provides a STAB option when Torkoal's HP is too low to effectively use Eruption.</li> <li>It is possible to drop Heat Wave for another coverage or single-target move, especially if it has Firium Z or Flamethrower in order to let Torkoal use its STAB move at low HP.</li> <li>Solar Beam hurts Rock-types and Water-types and is very effective against Gastrodon. However, this makes Torkoal even more vulnerable to opposing weather.</li> <li>Alternatively, Flamethrower is a secondary STAB move with perfect accuracy that gets around Wide Guard from likes of Celesteela.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice can be used to gain coverage against Dragon-types such as Salamence and Garchomp.</li> <li>Protect is a staple in doubles play, as it helps with positioning and earns free turns. It is particularly useful because it preserves Torkoal's HP, which is needed for high-powered Eruption.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Charcoal gives Torkoal a consistent damage boost on its Eruption, which lets it take some 2HKOs versus resistant targets such as Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>Alternatively, Firium Z gives Torkoal access to a heavy single-target nuke that bypasses Wide Guard and hits hard regardless of its current HP.</li> <li>As it is a fairly one-dimensional Pokemon, maximum Special Attack is needed to let Torkoal deal as much damage as possible.</li> <li>Speed is minimized with 0 IVs and a Quiet nature, which allows it to underspeed nearly everything for Trick Room.</li> <li>The remaining EVs go into HP for general bulk.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Torkoal underspeeds all other weather setters. Against teams with Pelipper, Politoed, or Gigalith, it can be effective to lead with Torkoal + Lilligant to take control of the weather, immediately pressure them, and force them to risk switching into a Grass-type move (or Sleep Powder) from Lilligant.</li> <li>Alternatively, setting up Trick Room allows Torkoal to be a threat on its own without having to keep Lilligant alive.</li> <li>Torkoal needs to stay healthy in order to use Eruption, so avoid switching it into attacks if possible.</li> <li>Opposing Wide Guard users other than Celesteela can tank hits from Torkoal regardless of Wide Guard. Instead of trying to go for single-target moves, try to pin the Wide Guard Pokemon into positions where Eruption will do hefty damage if they don't go for the Wide Guard, but using Wide Guard will leave them vulnerable to KO by Torkoal's partner. If this is not possible, Torkoal should likely be kept on the bench.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Lilligant threatens opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, can take advantage of Chlorophyll for fast Sleep Powder, and has After You to let Torkoal move first outside of Trick Room.</li> <li>Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Oranguru can reverse the move order for Torkoal to attack first. Without speed control, Torkoal with its low Speed cannot use Eruption properly.</li> <li>Oranguru can double Torkoal's damage output with Instruct, which lets Torkoal KO resistant foes such as Salamence and Alolan Marowak before they can move.</li> <li>Other Trick Room attacker options alongside Torkoal include Hariyama, Drampa, and Magnezone.</li> <li>Hariyama facilitates easier setup of Trick Room with Fake Out.</li> <li>Feint lets Torkoal bypass Wide Guard and Protect used to stall out Trick Room turns.</li> <li>Drampa and Magnezone beat Dragon-, Water-, and Rock-types.</li> <li>Mudsdale beats Fire-types and Rock-types.</li> <li>Faster teammates that can function without having to set up Trick Room can be helpful alongside Lilligant + Torkoal. Pokemon such as Salamence have a positive matchup against Pokemon like Gyarados and Garchomp, which can switch in to limit Torkoal's damage output.</li> <li>It might be worthwhile to have Sunny Day on supportive Pokemon such as Oranguru in order to ensure weather control.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Hydro Pump enables Milotic to hit a little harder, but its lack of ability to burn foes and chance to miss are off-putting. The extra power granted by Hydro Pump is especially threatening on Adrenaline Orb Milotic, as the extra power helps make up for sacrificing Special Attack investment to hit a certain Speed tier with the Adrenaline Orb boost.</li> <li>Hidden Power Electric, Hidden Power Grass, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to cover Gyarados, Gastrodon, and Kartana, respectively, but have no use otherwise.</li> <li>Hypnosis gives Milotic a way to put foes to sleep, but its dreadful 60% accuracy makes it a terrible option on any Pokemon.</li> <li>Blizzard gives Milotic an Ice-type attack that targets both opponents for use in Hail.</li> <li>Assault Vest gives Milotic titanic special bulk, dodging OHKOs from Modest Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche and any attack from Life Orb Tapu Koko without any Special Defense investment, but it does not have the ability to run Recover, Protect, or Toxic. However, the ability to take any non-Gigavolt Havoc attack from Tapu Koko and punish it with Mirror Coat gives Assault Vest Milotic a niche as a lure, given how popular and powerful Tapu Koko is.</li> <li>Rindo Berry enables Milotic to take a Grass-type attack from a Pokemon like Tapu Bulu or Kartana once.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Milotic cannot OHKO Tapu Bulu with Ice Beam, while Tapu Bulu OHKOes back with Wood Hammer, though it does have to be wary of Scald burns. While Kartana doesn't want to directly switch in on Milotic due to its poor special bulk and the threat of a Scald burn, it easily OHKOes Milotic with Leaf Blade.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Barring Hidden Power Grass or Toxic, Gastrodon fears nothing from Milotic, easily sponging any hit and using Toxic to put a timer on Milotic. Furthermore, its Storm Drain will prevent Milotic from using Scald as long as Gastrodon is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Koko</strong>: While Tapu Koko needs to hold a Life Orb in order to have any chance of OHKOing non-Assault Vest Milotic with Thunderbolt, Milotic also cannot OHKO in return without a Competitive boost or Mirror Coat. Tapu Koko does have to watch out for Assault Vest variants, however, as they can take Thunderbolt even from Life Orb Tapu Koko and retaliate with Mirror Coat. Milotic is never taking Gigavolt Havoc no matter how hard it tries, though.</p> <p><strong>Denying a Competitive boost</strong>: The easiest way to handle Milotic is to simply ensure it never gets a Competitive boost. Without it, Milotic struggles to do any meaningful damage with neutral hits, limiting its uses to fishing for Scald burns or using Toxic.</p>",

However, Leftovers is an option as well for passive recovery if Milotic's team already has a Sitrus Berry user.</li> <li>Adrenaline Orb allows Milotic to punish Intimidate even more by giving it a boost to Speed.</li> <li>252 HP / 76 Def EVs enable Milotic to take Garchomp's Tectonic Rage, and a Calm Nature allows it to take Timid Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche in Psychic Terrain. The remaining investment is placed into Special Attack to give Milotic as much power as possible.</li> <li>Adrenaline Orb Milotic should run 100 Speed EVs, as this enables it to outspeed Garchomp after the Adrenaline Orb boost. If Milotic needs to be faster, 164 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow it to outspeed Tapu Koko with the Adrenaline Orb boost.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>If you see Pokemon with Intimidate on the opposing team, Milotic is generally an easy pick. However, should your opponent's team lack such a Pokemon, Milotic probably isn't a good pick unless it is needed to handle another threat, such as Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>If Milotic's opponent has an Intimidate user, leading with Milotic will ensure its opponent regrets leading with said user.</li> <li>Milotic should tread lightly against Tapu Koko; while Milotic can take any of non-Life Orb Tapu Koko's non-Gigavolt Havoc attacks, it can't threaten Tapu Koko without a Competitive boost.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Alolan Marowak and Milotic are perfect teammates for each other; Alolan Marowak redirects threatening Electric-type attacks, especially those from Tapu Koko, away from Milotic, while Milotic discourages Intimidate users from coming in to weaken Alolan Marowak.</li> <li>Alolan Muk also makes for a good teammate, as it handles Grass-types for Milotic while Milotic handles Ground-types for it.</li> <li>Teammates that can handle Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Kartana are a necessity. As such, Pokemon like Arcanine and Alolan Marowak make for good teammates, although the latter doesn't enjoy taking Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer. Celesteela makes for another good teammate, being able to take on Tapu Bulu more reliably thanks to its 4x resistance to Wood Hammer.</li> <li>The aforementioned Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Kartana make for good teammates for Milotic due to their ability to handle Gastrodon, which walls Milotic unless it carries Hidden Power Grass or Toxic.</li> </ul>"

Metagross has no means of recovery outside of Grassy Terrain, so premature spamming may leave it vulnerable to heavy damage; if you can keep Metagross from being worn down excessively, any Meteor Mash boosts it gains are worthwhile in the long run.</li> <li>If you see plenty of Fairy-types that are detrimental to your team's success, it would be a good idea to send Metagross out early so that it can quickly dispatch of them. On the other hand, if you see a Torkoal and other Pokemon that work well in the sun, it would be best to have Metagross sit that battle out.</li> <li>As with all other Pokemon, consider Metagross's damage output and what you can afford to use.

As such, 124 EVs and a Jolly nature help it outpace everything up to and including uninvested Arcanine.</li> <li>252 EVs in Attack ensure Metagross hits as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs go into HP to increase its overall bulk.</li> <li>Psychium Z turns Zen Headbutt into a 160-Base Power, physical Shattered Psyche.</li> <li>If you do not care for outspeeding Arcanine, you can choose to run other Speed investments. 0 Speed EVs make Metagross faster than uninvested Tapu Bulu, 12 EVs let it outpace uninvested Goodra, and 52 EVs ensure it moves before uninvested Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Clear Body is the ability of choice for ignoring opposing Intimidate and taking less damage from Heavy Slam, should it ever do so.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>As this set has less bulk than bulky attacking sets, do not be hasty in bringing it out. Make sure it can outspeed and KO an opposing threat before sending it out to do so.</li> <li>As this set has no coverage options apart from its STAB moves, it would be better to leave it behind if there are multiple Steel-type threats on the opposing team and to bring it into battle if there are multiple Fairy- or Ice-type threats. Fire-type threats are not as troublesome if they are weakened slightly, for a Shattered Psyche will often be a sufficient finisher.</li> <li>Be very careful when using Shattered Psyche. As it only does 25% of its usual damage when going through Protect or Detect, its only use must be aimed and timed perfectly to achieve optimal damage. Immediately after the Pokemon you want it to hit has used Protect would be the optimal time to use it.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Garchomp and Salamence are good Pokemon for taking out some of Metagross's main checks, like Gengar and Alolan Muk, and their typings complement Metagross's to a high degree.</li> <li>Pelipper and Tapu Bulu are good options to mitigate its weakness to Fire-type moves or Earthquake, respectively.</li> <li>Tapu Fini gives Metagross immunity from status conditions with the Misty Terrain it sets.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is a great teammate, for its Psychic Terrain increases the power of Shattered Psyche even further. Bear in mind that Bullet Punch is consequently rendered useless against grounded Pokemon in Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>As this set has little means of dealing with opposing Steel-types, Fire-type help is appreciated. Do note that if running Pelipper, the utility that Fire-types would provide is diminished.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Drifblim is one of the few good Tailwind setters in VGC 2017.</li> <li>With a high base HP of 150, it has tremendous bulk, and when combined with Terrain Seeds, it becomes one difficult Pokemon for your opponent to bring down.</li> <li>With access to a unique Ghost / Flying typing, Drifblim becomes the only Tailwind setter of the format that is immune to Fake Out, and it has the capability to wall a regular Snorlax set.</li> <li>Drifblim has access to a huge support movepool in Will-O-Wisp, Disable, Haze, Swagger, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Memento and Tailwind, thus serving its role primarily as a support Pokemon.</li> <li>What makes Drifblim viable over other Tailwind setters is its ability Unburden, which doubles its Speed upon consumption of its held item. Combined with either Misty Seed or Psychic Seed, this allows Drifblim to gain more bulk and Speed before the turn player even makes a move, enabling it to greatly pressure your opponent.</li> <li>Its Flying typing partly becomes a source for its downfall, as it's not protected against priority moves in Psychic Terrain, allowing Pokemon like Whimsicott and Sableye to cripple it with Taunt before it can set up a Tailwind.</li> <li>Being purely a support Pokemon, Drifblim fails to deal sufficient damage once Tailwind is set up, and switching it out makes it lose both its defensive boosts, as well as the Speed boost from Unburden.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Electric Seed and Grassy Seed can also be used to activate Unburden, although this makes Drifblim much more weak against certain special Z-Moves.</li> <li>204 EVs can be invested in Speed to outspeed Modest Golduck in rain, after which it can use Sunny Day before Golduck uses Hydro Vortex, greatly weakening the damage output.</li> <li>For the fourth move slot, Rain Dance can be used as well to control the weather, but it makes Drifblim much more susceptible to rain archetypes. Investing 236 EVs in Speed enables Drifblim to outspeed Modest Lilligant in sun and set up a Rain Dance before they use After You, though one must be careful about incoming Sleep Powders.</li> <li>Memento too can be run here to provide a safe switch once Tailwind is set up, greatly weakening an opposing threat in the process.</li> <li>Acrobatics is used at times as Drifblim's offensive attack, but isn't very effective against Kartana, and it makes Drifblim weaker to Intimidate, but gives Drifblim a way to damage Snorlax and Porygon2 without relying on burns.</li> <li>Finally, Haze can be used to shut down any set up attempts like Extreme Evoboost, Curse Snorlax, and Swords Dance, although this will get rid of Drifblim's Seed boost as well. Clear Smog can work as a substitute for Haze, as it only negates the target's boosts, but can be redirected by Follow Me and Rage Powder and may prove to be inefficient.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: While Drifblim is faster than most Taunt users, if it's crippled by Taunt, its support options are shut down, and it must rely on Shadow Ball for damage. Moreover, Prankster Taunt from Whimsicott and Sableye can prevent Tailwind from being set up.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers like Gigalith can OHKO Drifblim with their Z-Moves, even after burns (if Stone Edge is used as the catalyst).</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-type Pokemon like Celesteela wall Drifblim and can proceed to stall it with Leech Seed and Heavy Slams.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: As mentioned above, Drifblim suffers greatly against Trick Room, as its Speed is extremely high thanks to Unburden, effectively making it the slowest Pokemon on the field in Trick Room.</p>",

Combined with the Unburden speed boost, Drifblim can almost always set up Tailwind easily.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp is used to weaken opposing physical attackers like Kartana and Garchomp and is usually run when using Psychic Seed.</li> <li>Swagger can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp if Drifblim is holding Misty Seed to Swagger your own physical attackers like Garchomp and Snorlax, greatly increasing their offensive capabilities, as Misty Terrain prevents Confusion.</li> <li>There are a lot of support options for the last slot, and Sunny Day is often used to reset the weather in your favor to ease up the rain matchup or to stop an opponent's Alolan Ninetales from setting up Aurora Veil.</li> <li>Disable can be used in this slot as well, which can come in handy when disrupting the foe.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Psychic Seed is used as the primary item, as it boosts Drifblim's Special Defense when in Psychic Terrain and activates Unburden, increasing Drifblim's Speed greatly.</li> <li>Misty Seed if often used as well, and similar to Psychic Seed, it boosts Drifblim's Special Defense, hence activating Unburden.</li> <li>Unburden is the ability of choice, since it has extremely good synergy with Terrain Seeds, greatly powering up Drifblim the moment it hits the Terrain.</li> <li>The EVs are primarily invested in bulk to ensure that Drifblim stays alive long enough to potentially set up a second Tailwind.</li> <li>12 HP EVs and 236 Special Defense EVs allow Drifblim to survive Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche in Psychic Terrain, as well as surviving Tapu Koko's Gigavolt Havoc outside of in Electric Terrain.</li> <li>12 HP EVs and 236 Defense EVs help Drifblim survive a 140-Base Power Continental Crush from burned Gigalith, as well as turning a burned Kartana Smart Strike into a 4HKO 99.3% of the time.</li> <li>12 EVs are invested in Speed, as they enable Drifblim to outspeed Timid Pheromosa after Unburden's Speed boost.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to increase Drifblim's damage output.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Drifblim is often chosen as a potential lead along with the Terrain setter respective to its Terrain Seed, as this is an offensive lead that can easily set up and pick up KOs easily.</li> <li>It is also possible to set up Tailwind at the final turn of Trick Room, as it ensures that your team doesn't lose momentum.</li> <li>While Drifblim is extremely bulky, it is not unbeatable, and powerful Z-Moves like Gigalith's Tectonic Rage can OHKO it unless it's burned first. Hence, it is advisable to burn it first before attempting to set up Tailwind.</li> <li>One should be careful not to use Will-O-Wisp in Misty Terrain, when facing Tapu Fini, and should be aware of potential Tapu Fini switch-ins.</li> <li>Sunny Day can be used to reset sand that is set by Gigalith. After which, powerful special attackers like Tapu Lele can OHKO it with Psychic Terrain-boosted Psychic. This move also comes in handy against Tapu Fini, greatly weakening their offensive powers while boosting Drifblim's teammate's Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Just like Will-O-Wisp, one should be careful about potential Terrain switch-ins when using Swagger on ally Pokemon, as it that can negate Misty Terrain, which would make Swagger confuse an ally.</li> <li>It is not advisable to set up Tailwind against Nihilego and Porygon-Z, as they can use Trick Room to instantly gain enormous momentum.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Since the primary strategy to using Drifblim is Psychic Seed and Misty Seed, Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini, respectively, are essential to activate them.</li> <li>Powerful attackers that can take advantage of Tailwind's Speed boost like Buzzwole and Nihilego are recommended to swiftly deal with threats.</li> <li>As Drifblim mostly gets walled by Celesteela, Pokemon like Arcanine and Xurkitree work well with it.</li> <li>Physical attackers that can take advantage of fast Swaggers are recommended, such as Garchomp, Buzzwole and Snorlax.</li> <li>As Tailwind is easily countered by Trick Room, slow Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Snorlax are encouraged, as they work well inside Trick Room.</li> <li>Additionally, Taunt users can prevent any set up and can potentially shut down most Trick Room teams quite easily.</li> <li>Intimidate users like Arcanine and Gyarados can further weaken physical attackers that can threaten Drifblim like Gigalith and Alolan Marowak.</li> </ul>"

Tapu Bulu is of note, as while it's incredibly threatened by Poison Jab, its Grassy Terrain is nevertheless an annoyance for reducing the damage of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Given that Garchomp is 4x weak to Ice, it makes sense that it's heavily threatened by Ice-type attackers such as Alolan Ninetales and Alolan Sandslash. Water-types are similarly threatening, as they commonly carry Ice-type attacks like Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Celesteela easily walls both of Garchomp's STAB moves, making it a nuisance for Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burn cut into Garchomp's damage output. Intimidate users like Gyarados and Krookodile drop Attack when switched in. Gengar can also use Will-O-Wisp to halve Garchomp's Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: As Garchomp relies on its high Speed, effects such as Tailwind and Trick Room hamper it.</p>",

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Whimsicott has access to Prankster along with a high base 116 Speed and a plethora of useful status moves, allowing it to provide nearly guaranteed support for its team and disruption to the opponent's Pokemon.</li> <li>It is one of the few viable Tailwind users, providing a reliable and not very common form of speed control in the format.</li> <li>It can prevent and disrupt other forms of speed control with its status moves.</li> <li>While providing resistance to some common types like Electric, Whimsicott's Grass / Fairy typing and low defensive stats makes it weak to common attacks in the format, especially Poison-type coverage moves.</li> <li>Dark-type's immunity to Prankster status moves hinders it's disruptive potential.</li> <li>Its large support movepool means it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome.</li> <li>It has little offensive presence, only being capable of dealing significant damage to a select few Pokemon.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Memento with Darkinium-Z can be used to neutralize a threat when Whimsicott is on its last legs, while at the same time bringing a fully healed teammate back into the field.</li> <li>Helping Hand is an option to make up for Whimsicott's low offensive presence by boosting the power of its partner's moves.</li> <li>Trick Room can be used to reverse an opponent's own Trick Room or for a surprise set up of your own, since Whimsicott can still function during it thanks to Prankster.</li> <li>Charm can be used to drop the Attack stat of physical attackers two stages, severely lowering their damage potential or countering any boosts they might have obtained previously.</li> <li>Sunny Day can be used to remove a foe's weather, stopping hail or sand from breaking Whimsicott's Focus Sash, as well as hinder the opponent's strategy and possibly help your own team if you have Pokemon that make use of the sun. Bear in mind that this is less optimal than simply running your own dedicated weather setter.</li> <li>Beat Up can be used to boost the Attack of a partner with Justified like Arcanine or Lucario up to four times, at the cost of minimal health loss due to Whimsicott's low Attack stat.</li> <li>Energy Ball can be used over Moonblast if you find your team deficient in answers to Gastrodon or bulky Water-types, but Whimnsicott's lackluster Special Attack makes this far from optimal.</li> <li>Nature Power instead of Moonblast with Normalium-Z can be used on teams with multiple guardian deities, allowing Whimsicott to do considerable damage off a move that also has priority from Prankster, even getting a few surprise OHKOs on relevant threats like Garchomp under Misty Terrain. Bear in mind that you become vulnerable to Taunt this way.</li> <li>Endeavor is an alternative to bring down most threats to KO range after Whimsicott is brought down to its Focus Sash, allowing its teammates to finish them off.</li> <li>Infiltrator is an option if you are using Whimsicott and Tapu Lele on the same team, allowing Whimsicott to use status moves in Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>Fake Tears can be used to lower the Special Defense of a foe, letting a specially offensive teammate do more damage; this is especially useful if using Infiltrator with Tapu Lele as a partner.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: All Dark-type Pokemon can safely switch in and brush off Encore and Taunt thanks to their immunity to moves affected by Prankster. Most dangerous of all are Alolan Muk and Incineroar, which take minimal damage from Moonblast and can KO Whimsicott comfortably with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Muk, Nihilego and Salazzle pose an inmediate offensive threat to Whimsicott, along with many other Pokemon that run Poison-type coverage like Garchomp and Goodra.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Kartana, Magnezone, and Celesteela can all easily KO Whimsicott after it has lost it's Focus Sash, with only Celesteela being afraid of getting locked into a move by Encore or Taunted.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Arcanine, Alolan Marowak, and Incineroar can both get rid of Whimsicott after it has lost its Focus Sash too, being unafraid of Taunt. Incineroar is especially capable of countering Whimsicott, being inmune to Prankster and taking little damage from Moonblast, as well as being able to use Fake Out freely to stop Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users</strong>: Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, opposing Whimsicott, and many other Pokemon with Taunt can effectively turn Whimsicott into dead weight with it, preventing the use of its status moves for three turns.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Moonblast is Whimsicott's best offensive choice, allowing it to 2HKO Dragon-types like Garchomp and Salamence as long as Focus Sash is intact, as well as Dark-types like Persian wishing to switch in to block Prankster. It can also 2HKO uninvested Hariyama that try to support a Trick Room setter.</li> <li>Tailwind is the most important move on Whimsicott, doubling the Speed of its teammates and allowing them to attack first in most scenarios.</li> <li>Encore lets Whimsicott lock a foe into Protect or a setup move for three turns, either shutting it down or forcing it to switch out.</li> <li>Taunt prevents foes from using status moves, most notably preventing the setting of their own speed control measures like Trick Room, as well stopping them from using Protect, making them more vulnerable.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Prankster is mandatory, allowing Whimsicott to use its status moves before it can be hit, as well as letting it shut down other status move users before they can set up.</li> <li>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Whimsicott to be as fast as possible, with the remaining EVs are invested into HP and Defense to help it take resisted hits the best it possibly can.</li> <li>Focus Sash is needed due to Whimsicott's low defenses, ensuring it stays in the field to use another status move after setting Tailwind.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Leading with Whimsicott is usually recommended, as it can set up Tailwind on turn one to provide immediate pressure from your sped-up teammates, or letting it shut down dangerous set up Pokemon before they can gain momentum.</li> <li>If your team is not completely reliant on Tailwind and you see a hail or sand setter on the opponent's team, not leading with Whimsicott is advisable, as the weather damage will break the Focus Sash and risk an early faint.</li> <li>Take advantage of Whimsicott's immunity to Dragon-type attacks in order to safely switch in later in the match, as you can easily waste a foe's Devastating Drake or Draco Meteor and turn the tide of battle in your favor with a late-game Tailwind.</li> <li>Only use Moonblast when you can predict a favorable switch or if the opponent has no way to prevent a super effective hit on one of his Pokemon. The most notable target is Garchomp, which can try to KO Whimsicott with Poison Jab.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Powerful Pokemon with above average Speed like Garchomp and Kartana are prime teammates as they become extremely threatening after Tailwind doubles their Speed.</li> <li>Intimidate users can help Whimsicott deal better with otherwise lethal physical Poison-type attacks. Arcanine can take care of dangerous Steel-types like Celesteela and Kartana, while Krookodile can use Groundium-Z to take care of the ever-threatening Alolan Muk; both also have enough Speed to take advantage of Tailwind.</li> <li>All of the guardian deities are good partners that make great use of Whimsicott's support to pressure the opponent's team, set up, and generally bypass any Speed creep wars with opposing Tapu groups thanks to Tailwind, be wary of stacking Poison weaknesses, though.</li> <li>Steel-types like Magnezone and Kartana are also great parners as they can switch in on the Poison- and Steel-type attacks aimed at Whimsicott, letting them in safely to make use of Tailwind.</li> <li>Pokemon with set up moves like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Calm Mind Tapu Fini also appreciate Whimsicott's support, as Encore gives them more breathing room to set up.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li>While Lilligant sees play pretty much exclusively for sun teams with Torkoal, it nevertheless excels within that role.</li> <li>There, its Grass coverage that checks Water- and Rock-types, alongside After You improving flexibility, is appreciated.</li> <li>Since Water-types in particular are common, and speed control is rare, Lilligant covers a lot of holes in teams.</li> <li>Its frailty means that opponents can wear it down easily, which makes it difficult to keep around late-game.</li> <li>Relying fairly heavily on two inaccurate moves in Leaf Storm and Sleep Powder creates problems with consistency.</li> <li>If you're not utilizing sun and still need a Grass-type, just stick with alternatives such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Energy Ball is a STAB move that doesn't drop Lilligant's Special Attack, but the drop in initial power is massive.</li> <li>Giga Drain trades power for a good amount of recovery but, as Lilligant is frail and offensive, is unneeded.</li> <li>Solar Beam is close to Leaf Storm's power, but it doesn't drop Lilligant's Special Attack. Though this increases Lilligant's dependence on the sun.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice allows Lilligant to OHKO foes that are 4x weak to Ice such as Garchomp and Salamence.</li> <li>Quiver Dance could be used in combination with Dancer Oricorio, so the boosts can be replicated by it.</li> <li>Sunny Day can set the sun manually; however, given how frail Lilligant is, this is most often better left to Torkoal.</li> <li>Life Orb is one of Lilligant's better other options, trading any facade of taking hits for a consistent power boost.</li> <li>Wide Lens is available to increase Leaf Storm's and Sleep Powder's accuracy, thereby making Lilligant more reliable.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-type Pokemon</strong>: Bug-types such as Araquanid, Pheromosa, and Vikavolt resist Grass and can retaliate super effectively. However, the former two must still be wary of taking big damage from Leaf Storm and Bloom Doom.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types such as Arcanine, Incineroar, and Alolan Marowak resist Grass-type attacks and hit back hard with their Fire-type STAB moves. The former two's access to Snarl makes them especially problematic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-types such as Talonflame and Braviary resist Lilligant's STAB moves and can hit back super effectively with their own. Mandibuzz is also notable, as it gets access to Overcoat for Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon such as Alolan Muk and Gengar resist Grass and can hit back hard with their STAB moves. Furthermore, Alolan Muk's Shadow Sneak allows it to finish off weakened Lilligant with priority.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: The use of moves such as Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room counter Chlorophyll's boost. Trick Room Porygon2 is a good example of a user thanks to its bulk, although it must be wary of Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Replacing sun with another weather eliminates much of Lilligant's Speed advantage. Alolan Ninetales is the most potent option, as it can hit Lilligant super effectively and Hail breaks Lilligant's Focus Sash.</p>",

Hitting Grass-types, particularly Kartana, is especially important, since they are unaffected by Sleep Powder.</li> <li>Protect allows Lilligant to shield itself while a partner eliminates a threat or switches; this is valuable given its frailty.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Focus Sash is often the most useful item, given that Lilligant's frailty means that it struggles to survive many turns.</li> <li>Grassium Z is a more offensive alternative that is particularly powerful with Leaf Storm, as there's no stat drop. It also allows the use of Z-Sleep Powder, which raises Lilligant's Speed. This is useful outside of sun.</li> <li>Chlorophyll is the mandatory ability with this set, as Lilligant's Speed is otherwise too low without the sun boost.</li> <li>A 252 SpA / 252 Spe EV spread is fine here, as Lilligant is frail enough that any investment in bulk will likely be wasted. That said, an EV spread of 124 HP / 252 SpA / 132 Spe is an option to outpace the first relevant foe: Choice Scarf Garchomp.</li> <li>Modest is often the better nature, as Lilligant doesn't enjoy giving up any of its already average Special Attack.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>In general, you shouldn't bother bringing out Lilligant without sun, as it's too slow and frail to function without it.</li> <li>While predictable, just leading Torkoal + Lilligant can often be a good decision, as many teams are unprepared.</li> <li>After which, you'll either want to use Protect on Torkoal for a turn while Lilligant moves, or just do After You + Eruption.</li> <li>Opposing weather can be an issue though. If seen at team preview, bring Lilligant out late-game or not at all. This is so you have more time to wrestle control of the weather with Torkoal before bringing Lilligant out safely.</li> <li>Sleep Powder's undesirable accuracy means that you should avoid relying on it; take alternative plays where possible instead.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Torkoal is essentially mandatory as an ally, since its Drought is the most reliable means of setting sun.</li> <li>Given the above, Trick Room support from teammates such as Oranguru are also likely to join Lilligant's team.</li> <li>Rock-types such as Nihilego and Aerodactyl cover many of Lilligant's weaknesses in Bug, Fire, and Flying.</li> <li>Ground-types such as Mudsdale are likewise a boon, as they cover Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types for Lilligant.</li> <li>Salamence switches into Fire- and Bug-type moves aimed at Lilligant, and Intimidate allows it to take a hit.</li> <li>Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain boosts Bloom Doom and cancels Electric Terrain and Misty Terrain, which stop Sleep Powder.</li> </ul>"

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>As one of the few viable Intimidate users legal in VGC 2017, and the only one that resists Rock-type attacks, Krookodile finds use on teams that need both an Intimidate user and a Rock resistance in one Pokemon.</li> <li>It also has access to other support options like Snarl, Taunt, Bulldoze, Low Sweep, Roar, and Dragon Tail, giving it plenty of ways to support its team beyond Intimidate.</li> <li>Krookodile is capable of running either a bulky set or an all-out offensive set.</li> <li>However, Krookodile has many weaknesses, which make it vulnerable to Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, Araquanid, and Kartana.</li> <li>Furthermore, Krookodile has a tough time competing with Garchomp if the role compression it offers is not needed. If Intimidate is not needed, use Garchomp instead.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Power Trip generally should not be used, but it turns Krookodile into an excellent Baton Pass recipient for Eevee's Extreme Evoboost thanks to being absurdly powerful with the boosts.</li> <li>Stone Edge gives Krookodile another option to target Flying-types that isn't blocked by Wide Guard, but it suffers from dreadful accuracy.</li> <li>Rock Slide also allows Krookodile to target Flying-types super effectively, but it is incredibly weak.</li> <li>Assurance is generally inferior to Crunch, but it has its Base Power doubled to 120 if its target has already received damage on that turn, such as from any attack from Krookodile's teammate.</li> <li>Darkinium Z is another Z-Crystal option for Krookodile; most targets are hit harder by Tectonic Rage, but Black Hole Eclipse picks up an OHKO on Oranguru, Krookodile's only option to be able to do so.</li> <li>It's not normally advised to run special attacks on a physical attacker like Krookodile, but Sludge Bomb allows it to 2HKO Tapu Bulu, which no other move Krookodile learns can do.</li> <li>Krookodile can carry a Choice Scarf if its team needs it to outspeed threats like Tapu Koko, but Garchomp is usually a better choice for such a set.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Fini all deal super effective damage to Krookodile, though Tapu Koko must be wary of Earthquake and cannot reliably take on Assault Vest sets. Additionally, Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain weakens Krookodile's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Kartana prove problematic thanks to their Grass-type STAB moves. Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer picks up the OHKO on Krookodile through Intimidate, while Krookodile cannot OHKO Kartana before Kartana 2HKOes it with Leaf Blade through Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Milotic and Araquanid can both take Earthquake and retaliate with their Water-type STAB moves. Furthermore, Milotic's Competitive gives it a Special Attack boost from Intimidate, while Araquanid only has to be on the lookout for Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Pheromosa, Hariyama, and Kommo-o all threaten to pick up OHKOs on Krookodile, the former two regardless of Intimidate and the latter with its specially based All-Out Pummeling.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Celesteela fears little from Krookodile and can 2HKO Krookodile with Heavy Slam if it is not affected by Intimidate. Furthermore, if Krookodile lacks Taunt, Celesteela can use Leech Seed on it in order to take it on much more safely.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: As a physical attacker, opposing Intimidate and burn will severely hinder Krookodile's effectiveness by limiting its damage output.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Although there are relatively few viable Wide Guard users, Pokemon like Celesteela and Araquanid can both utilize Wide Guard so as to prevent Krookodile from using Earthquake, Bulldoze, or Snarl. However, Taunt stops this, and Krookodile can also use Tectonic Rage so as to circumvent Wide Guard.</p>",

For example, 180 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature provide Krookodile with just enough speed to always outspeed Modest Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Intimidate is the reason you should be using Krookodile, enabling it to weaken physical attackers.</li> <li>Groundium Z allows Krookodile to use Tectonic Rage while also allowing it to freely come in on Knock Off.</li> <li>An Adamant nature gives Krookodile more power, but it causes Krookodile to lose out on Speed benchmarks like Timid Porygon-Z and Modest Tapu Lele.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Don't just use Tectonic Rage freely; it can only be used once per match, meaning it's completely wasted if the opponent switches into a Ground-immune Pokemon like Celesteela. Save it for when your opponent cannot reliably switch anything in.</li> <li>This set needs to be careful against all of the Guardian Deities, including Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko cannot take Earthquake, but it does 2HKO Krookodile with Dazzling Gleam. Meanwhile, all of the other ones simply beat Krookodile one-on-one.</li> <li>While Krookodile can switch in on non-super effective physical attacks thanks to Intimidate, it's not taking special attacks that well, so this set should be played offensively.</li> <li>Unless Krookodile is absolutely necessary in order to handle a certain threat—Alolan Muk, for example—bringing it against Milotic is generally not a good idea thanks to Milotic's Competitive.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Fire-type Pokemon like Alolan Marowak make for great teammates for Krookodile, as they handle Pokemon like Celesteela and Kartana. Krookodile also supports Alolan Marowak by threatening Alolan Muk, which threatens to remove its Thick Club with Knock Off.</li> <li>Electric- and Grass-types like Tapu Koko and Kartana handle threatening Water-types like Milotic, Tapu Fini, and Araquanid. Assault Vest Kartana is an especially good teammate here, as it can safely handle Tapu Lele and any non-Life Orb Tapu Koko, barring Hidden Power Fire.</li> <li>Flying-types like Celesteela give Krookodile a teammate that is immune to Earthquake, allowing it to freely spam Earthquake. This is especially helpful once Krookodile has used up its Tectonic Rage, while Celesteela is a particularly noteworthy option thanks to its ability to handle Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu.</li> <li>Pelipper also allows Krookodile to freely spam Earthquake while also assisting it against Bug- and Grass-types. Additionally, Krookodile stops the Electric-types that prove threatening for Pelipper.</li> <li>Psychic-types like Tapu Lele and Metagross also prove to be good teammates as they put a stop to Fighting-types for Krookodile while Krookodile stops Ghost-types for them.</li> </ul>"

It's stronger than Freeze-Dry is on a single target and does not rely on weather like Blizzard. However, Blizzard and Freeze-Dry are generally sufficient in terms of Ice-type STAB moves.</li> <li>Water Pulse is horribly weak, but it provides a means for Vanilluxe to deal damage to Fire-types.</li> <li>Weather Ball gives Vanilluxe the option to use surprising coverage moves when other weather conditions like rain are active.</li> <li>Hail can be used to revert the weather back to hail should it be changed after being set initially, although its use with Choice Scarf forces Vanilluxe to switch out afterwards.</li> <li>Explosion provides a last-resort spread attack that offers a safe way for a teammate to get onto the field when Vanilluxe has expended its usefulness.</li> <li>Focus Sash can serve as an alternative item. It allows Vanilluxe to switch between moves without switching and enables the use of Protect and support moves like Taunt or Imprison. However, without Choice Scarf Vanilluxe is quite slow even with maximum Speed investment, and being Choice-locked into one move doesn't bother Vanilluxe too much, as it generally just spams Blizzard anyway.</li> <li>Taunt can be also used as filler move on the Choice Scarf set, but it often forces Vanilluxe to switch out after using it.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon are of major concern to Vanilluxe. Arcanine, the most common of them, can easily take several hits and OHKO Vanilluxe back with its Fire-type STAB moves. Alolan Marowak and Torkoal equally have little difficulty against it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While the two most common Steel-type Pokemon, Kartana and Celesteela, don't resist Blizzard, they can still OHKO Vanilluxe with their Steel-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Opposing weather setters can revert Vanilluxe's hail, which means it can no longer utilize 100% accurate Blizzard. Gigalith and Torkoal are of particular concern, as they can both take hits from Vanilluxe well and hit back hard with their Rock- and Fire-type STAB attacks, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Vanilluxe relies on the Speed it gains from Choice Scarf, so speed control is an effective way of hampering it. Trick Room often makes Vanilluxe the slowest Pokemon on the field, which makes it quite easy to KO. Likewise, Icy Wind and Tailwind also hinder Vanilluxe.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard blocks Vanilluxe's primary attacking move, Blizzard, which will force Vanilluxe out if it's locked into Blizzard. Araquanid and Gigalith are the most notable Wide Guard users. While it's rarely seen with it, Celesteela can also use Wide Guard and OHKO Vanilluxe, making it a major threat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Blizzard is a spammable STAB move that never misses under hail.</li> <li>Freeze-Dry is a single-target Ice-type STAB move that also hits Water-types for good damage.</li> <li>The last two slots are mostly filler.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can OHKO Assault Vest Kartana two-thirds of the time, but it has little other use than that.</li> <li>Sheer Cold is a last-resort attack that has a 30% chance to remove a threat that is otherwise insurmountable. Be aware that Sheer Cold fails against Ice-types.</li> <li>Icy Wind provides speed control, which is valuable given only a few VGC 2017 Pokemon get access to it.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf is used so that Vanilluxe can outspeed the majority of the metagame and is therefore almost guaranteed to get at least one Blizzard off.</li> <li>Snow Warning is Vanilluxe's only viable ability, given how notable setting hail often is to the state of the game.</li> <li>The given EVs and Timid nature allow Vanilluxe to outpace neutral-natured Pheromosa and survive Life Orb Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack so that Vanilluxe can hit as hard as possible.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Vanilluxe's use will be relatively one-dimensional. Use it to set hail when appropriate, such as when a Slush Rush teammate requires it, or to break Focus Sash and Sturdy, and proceed to spam Blizzard until Vanilluxe faints.</li> <li>Be careful against opposing weather. Thanks to Choice Scarf making Vanilluxe the fastest weather setter, it's generally advisable to avoid leading with it if there's an opposing weather setter that can cancel Hail.</li> <li>Conversely, if there is no opposing weather, Vanilluxe makes a good lead because it can set up hail early and weaken foes with chip damage from hail and Blizzard.</li> <li>Don't be afraid to switch it out to preserve it for the late-game even in this scenario, however, as Vanilluxe's Choice Scarf means it can function well as a late-game revenge killer.</li> <li>Vanilluxe is not particularly bulky and has only one resistance, so it's not recommended to switch Vanilluxe directly in. It is better to send Vanilluxe out after an ally Pokemon has been KOed.</li> <li>Try to avoid Choice-locking it into Hidden Power, as the pitiful damage it deals to neutral foes makes it easy for the opponent to kill your momentum, such as by switching.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Having Pokemon to deal with Fire- and Steel-types is absolutely necessary, as Vanilluxe is hopeless against them.</li> <li>Ground-types such as Garchomp are great partners, as they can threaten Steel- and Fire-types with their Ground-type STAB moves. Garchomp specifically also appreciates Vanilluxe's ability to threaten opposing Dragon-types.</li> <li>Fire-types such as Arcanine can threaten Steel-type Pokemon with their STAB moves. Vanilluxe, in return, can OHKO Garchomp, which is one of the biggest threats to them.</li> <li>Alolan Sandslash can take advantage of hail with its Slush Rush ability, though caution should be given to its use, as it shares weaknesses to Fire- and Fighting-type moves with Vanilluxe.</li> <li>Anything that has access to Blizzard is optional partner, as Vanilluxe's hail makes Blizzard 100% accurate. Porygon2, Tapu Fini, and Milotic are a few examples of many Pokemon that gain access to Blizzard.</li> <li>Tapu Koko can beat Celesteela, and the combination of Vanilluxe and Tapu Koko makes for a very fast and offensive core that outspeeds the majority of the metagame.</li> </ul>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mandibuzz has good defensive stats and a unique typing that makes it a great switch-in to common Z-Moves. Its access to Roost solidifies its bulk, making it a great defensive Pokemon that rivals Porygon2's defensive capabilities.</li> <li>It has great supporting moves, namely Taunt, Snarl, Knock Off, and Tailwind, and is immune to Earthquake, making it a good partner for Garchomp and other Earthquake users.</li> <li>The combination of Taunt and Roost makes Mandibuzz a good pick to stifle Celesteela and Porygon2. These two Pokemon are notoriously hard to KO, and Mandibuzz prevents them from recovering HP, allowing teammates to KO them at their leisure.</li> <li>While Foul Play offsets its mediocre attacking stats, it can still become dead weight at times, especially in front of common Electric- Fairy-type Pokemon.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Whirlwind works like Taunt against Trick Room and stat-boosting strategies, except instead of preventing these moves, they phaze the Pokemon after it has its boosts. This is especially useful against Eevee (Extreme Evoboost cannot be Taunted) and Palossand (which boosts with Smeargle's Water Shuriken, which also cannot be Taunted). However, using Whirlwind over Taunt worsens Mandibuzz's matchup against Porygon2 and Celesteela.</li> <li>Fake Tears can increase the damage output of Mandibuzz's partner. It is a good idea to EV Mandibuzz to outspeed the Pokemon using a special move, so that Mandibuzz uses Fake Tears first, allowing the attacker to take immediate advantage of the stat drops. The only problem with using Fake Tears is finding a moveslot for it.</li> <li>Toxic improves Mandibuzz's matchup against other Mandibuzz and Porygon2 and easily allows Mandibuzz to Toxic stall Pokemon that can only 3HKO it. Note that Tapu Fini, especially on your own team, mostly prevents Toxic from being used, so it is best to use Toxic when using Tapu Lele as a partner.</li> <li>Leftovers is another option to consider, restoring Mandibuzz's health over time. It can allow Mandibuzz to forgo using Roost in favor of setting up Tailwind, for example. While in most situations it is outclassed by Sitrus Berry, it is a good item in its own right.</li> <li>Iapapa Berry can be used in the same vein as Sitrus Berry except for the fact that it heals at 25% health instead of half health. Even though Iapapa Berry heals more HP, in practice, Sitrus Berry is more useful to avoid double-target KOs because it activates at half health.</li> <li>Kee Berry and Maranga Berry can be used similarly to Misty Seed and Psychic Seed, boosting Mandibuzz's defenses after getting hit. While this is useful if you don't have a guardian deity on your team, the requirement of being hit first makes these berries inherently less useful than instantly receiving the boost upon entering a Terrain.</li> <li>A Bold or Impish nature could be used to tank more physical attacks, but a Careful or Calm nature is recommended. Mandibuzz will most likely be taking more Thunderbolts and Moonblasts than super effective physical attacks, meaning investing in its Special Defense is more useful.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko, Vikavolt, Xurkitree, and Magnezone all threaten to either wound or OHKO Mandibuzz with boosted and unboosted Thunderbolts. Vikavolt stands out, as it can use String Shot or Electroweb to combat Tailwind's Speed control, and it can use Bug Buzz to hit Mandibuzz after it uses Roost, as Roost removes its Flying typing.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Primarina can take chunks out of Mandibuzz's HP with Moonblast. While Tapu Fini can be Taunted before it can set up Calm Mind, if it does manage to set up, Mandibuzz without Snarl or Whirlwind is powerless against it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Gigalith, Aerodactyl, and Nihilego can chunk Mandibuzz with Stone Edge, Rock Slide, and Power Gem, respectively, or OHKO it outright with Continental Crush. Aerodactyl in particular can use Taunt to stop Tailwind and Roost or match Mandibuzz's Tailwind with its own Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales and Vanilluxe can't OHKO Mandibuzz, but they can casually throw out Blizzards to chunk Mandibuzz lacking Snarl. Alolan Sandslash works just as well with Icicle Crash, especially with Slush Rush matching Tailwind's Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko, in addition to threatening Mandibuzz with their STAB options, can Taunt Mandibuzz to prevent it from using Roost and Tailwind, and they take little damage from Foul Play. Mimikyu can also threaten Mandibuzz with Play Rough and Taunt in addition to setting up Trick Room against Tailwind.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: As with any defensive Pokemon, Toxic is a death sentence for Mandibuzz. Porygon2 and Gastrodon are the most common users of Toxic, and even if Mandibuzz can Taunt them before they can move, any Mandibuzz lacking Taunt or otherwise unable to Taunt can be effectively shut down with Toxic. Other Pokemon who can find room in their movesets to tack on Toxic, such as Goodra and Araquanid, can easily surprise and cripple Mandibuzz. Fishing for regular poison with moves such as Sludge Bomb and Poison Jab isn't a bad way for Pokemon to pass an otherwise uneventful turn, especially since Mandibuzz does not receive protection from status in Misty Terrain despite being able to activate Misty Seed upon entering it.</p>",

      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Tailwind is a great Speed control option, as it doubles Mandibuzz's and its ally's Speed. This is useful for checking faster Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Garchomp, and Kartana.</li> <li>Roost allows Mandibuzz to stay on the field long enough to set up more than one Tailwind per match.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Trick Room, which would counteract Tailwind, and it prevents stalling options such as Celesteela's Substitute and Leech Seed, Porygon2's Recover, and Toxic. It can also be used to stop the opponent from using Protect or boosting moves such as Calm Mind. Bear in mind that this does not stop Z-Moves such as Extreme Evoboost.</li> <li>Foul Play threatens physically offensive Pokemon such as Metagross, Kartana, and Garchomp, and in general, it is the most offensive move Mandibuzz should be using. Note that against Alolan Marowak, Foul Play is a 3HKO because its damage is unaffected by Thick Club.</li> <li>Snarl augments Mandibuzz's Special Defense and cripples special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko. It also helps limit Porygon2's damage output.</li> <li>Knock Off helps check Figy Berry Snorlax and Alolan Muk and cripples Alolan Marowak and Porygon2. It also provides valuable information as to what Pokemon holds what item, which is important for best-of-three environments.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Mandibuzz can work with several different items.</li> <li>Sitrus Berry is for general health recovery and helps it survive being double targeted.</li> <li>Misty Seed can be replaced by the other Terrain seeds depending on which guardian deity is on your team. Misty Seed and Psychic Seed are recommended, as they boost Mandibuzz's Special Defense, allowing it to take 3 Life Orb Thunderbolts from Tapu Koko outside of Electric Terrain, and they make Modest Tapu Lele's Moonblast a 2HKO.</li> <li>The EV spread maximizes Mandibuzz's Special Defense, and allows it to outspeed Adamant Pheromosa under Tailwind.</li> <li>Be sure to use a Careful nature when using Knock Off. Use a Calm nature when using either Snarl or Foul Play to reduce the damage of other Foul Play and confusion damage.</li> <li>Overcoat allows Mandibuzz to tank Gigalith's Stone Edge 88% of the time without being KO'd by Sandstorm damage afterwards. To survive Gigalith's Stone Edge 100% of the time, use at least 20 Defense EVs.</li> <li>Electric Seed and Grassy Seed could be used instead of Misty Seed and Psychic Seed when using Tapu Koko or Tapu Bulu, respectively. However, the Special Defense boost is often more useful because many of Mandibuzz's weaknesses are against special moves such as Ice Beam and Moonblast.</li> <li>When using Sitrus Berry, use an EV spread of 244 HP / 252 SpD / 12 Spe to make an even HP number to avoid surprise Nature's Madness or Super Fang KOs.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Mandibuzz makes an excellent switch-in against Shattered Psyche and Tectonic Rage, so not leading with Mandibuzz when Krookodile, Garchomp, or Tapu Lele is on the opponent's team is often a good idea.</li> <li>Because Mandibuzz essentially gets a free Special Defense boost when paired up with Tapu Lele or Tapu Fini when using the respective Seeds, it may be tempting to keep Mandibuzz in to retain that boost. However, once Mandibuzz has successfully used Taunt and Tailwind, it lacks offensive pressure and can become dead weight. Take into account how well you're using your Tailwind turns and switch or stay in accordingly, and don't become overly concerned with the Seed boosts.</li> <li>When not using a recovery item such as Sitrus Berry, look for opportunities to use Roost in order to keep Mandibuzz healthy. You may predict a foe's double Protect to stall out Tailwind turns, for example, which is an excellent opportunity to regain health.</li> <li>Mandibuzz can take down Porygon2 and some Celesteela sets in a late-game one-on-one with a combination of Taunt, Foul Play, and Roost, especially if Download gives Porygon2 an Attack boost, so this is a possible win condition to play into. Note that Porygon2 can easily freeze Mandibuzz if it is allowed to fire off too many Ice Beams.</li> <li>Mandibuzz's Snarl and Overcoat also help check the Torkoal and Lilligant lead combination, given Mandibuzz's immunity to Sleep Powder, Tailwind to match Lilligant's Chlorophyll, and Snarl to weaken Eruption.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele are excellent partners, mostly because of their Terrains activating Misty Seed and Psychic Seed, respectively. They also appreciate Tailwind to help them outspeed Pokemon such as Garchomp and Kartana.</li> <li>Garchomp and Mudsdale can use Earthquake freely alongside Mandibuzz, which is a relatively rare quality to have in VGC17. Mudsdale doesn't make as much use of Tailwind as Garchomp does, but it can outspeed troublesome Pokemon such as defensive Arcanine with some minor Speed investment. Krookodile is another prominent Earthquake user and offers Intimidate support, but it shares many weaknesses with Mandibuzz.</li> <li>Offensive Arcanine offers Intimidate support and loves being able to outspeed and OHKO the likes of Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Pheromosa with Inferno Overdrive or Flare Blitz. Defensive Flamethrower Arcanine also enjoys being able to outspeed Kartana under Tailwind, but it does not apply as much offensive pressure.</li> <li>Kartana and Alolan Ninetales appreciate the fact that Tailwind allows them to bypass awkward Speed ties. Alolan Ninetales in particular offers Aurora Veil support to make Mandibuzz even more defensive, and Overcoat negates hail damage.</li> <li>Nihilego always appreciates an Earthquake and Psychic switch-in, and Tailwind allows it to outspeed and OHKO Tapu Koko and helps Nihilego deal with Garchomp and Kartana depending on the type of Hidden Power it's using.</li> <li>Metagross, like Nihilego, enjoys an Earthquake switch-in as well as a good Ghost- and Dark-type switch-in. Metagross is also a prominent Earthquake user, so Mandibuzz allows some freedom of movement as well as Tailwind support.</li> <li>Alolan Muk enjoys a switch-in to Tectonic Rage given that it is the most common move used to OHKO it because of its bulk and Gluttony recovery. It can also outspeed Modest Tapu Lele under Tailwind with some minor Speed investment, which helps Mandibuzz avoid deadly Moonblasts.</li> <li>Alolan Marowak offers Mandibuzz protection from Tapu Koko and other Electric-types thanks to Lighting Rod, and can OHKO various threats to Mandibuzz such as Vikavolt, Tapu Lele, and Alolan Ninetales.</li> <li>In general, when using Mandibuzz, it is important to note your team's Speed stats and tweak their Speed accordingly to get the most out of Tailwind. Hitting a raw Speed stat of 116 outspeeds Adamant Choice Scarf Garchomp and Modest Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. 102 Speed outpaces neutral-natured Pheromosa and Tapu Koko. 89 Speed outspeeds Kartana and Alolan Ninetales. Finally, 86 Speed outspeeds Timid Nihilego and Jolly Garchomp. These are examples of useful Speed numbers to hit, but you should evaluate your team's weaknesses to determine what Pokemon needs to hit what Speed stat. Additionally, you should try not to go too far out of your way to hit certain Speed stats if it compromises too much of that Pokemon's offensive or defensive stats.</li> </ul>"

However, as they do not resist Flying-type moves, they will still take heavy damage from Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Koko</strong>: Tapu Koko outspeeds and OHKOes Talonflame with Thunderbolt while not being OHKOed by anything in Talonflame's arsenal. However, it does risk taking huge damage from Flare Blitz on the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge ability will set up Psychic Terrain, which will prevent Talonflame from using Supersonic Skystrike against any grounded Pokemon at full HP, although Talonflame will still be able to use priority Tailwind. However, Tapu Lele risks being 2HKOed by Flare Blitz as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate users like Gyarados and Arcanine lower Talonflame's already meager Attack stat, reducing its damage output. Furthermore, these Pokemon threaten to OHKO Talonflame with Waterfall and Wild Charge, respectively, although Talonflame has a chance to OHKO both with Supersonic Skystrike, depending on their EV spreads, if it is unaffected by Intimidate.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Brave Bird is Talonflame's strongest Flying-type STAB move and is therefore used as the base move for Supersonic Skystrike.

However, the recoil damage means that Brave Bird will only have priority on the first use.</li> <li>Despite breaking Gale Wings, Flare Blitz is still Talonflame's best Fire-type STAB move, OHKOing Kartana and 2HKOing Celesteela and Metagross.</li> <li>Tailwind doubles the Speed of Talonflame and its allies for four turns, and thanks to Gale Wings, Talonflame virtually guarantees setting it up.</li> <li>Protect grants Talonflame a turn of protection while its teammate handles a threat like Tapu Koko or Nihilego.

No other item should be considered on Talonflame, as access to a priority Z-Move is one of Talonflame's biggest selling points.</li> <li>Talonflame can afford to run an Adamant nature in order to help patch up its below-average Attack stat, as its base Speed is already so high that it outspeeds Kartana and Alolan Ninetales by exactly one point without a Speed-boosting nature, while there is nothing particularly noteworthy that Talonflame must run Jolly in order to beat.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>If you bring Talonflame to a match, it should generally be used as a lead so it can set up Tailwind as soon as possible.</li> <li>That being said, should the foe have very fast, offensive Pokemon like Pheromosa, Golduck, and Lilligant, or a setup sweeper like Gyarados, it's a good idea to consider keeping Talonflame in the back, keeping it at maximum HP so it can strike these threats with Supersonic Skystrike at the right moment.</li> <li>Leading Talonflame alongside a Fake Out user assists it in setting up Tailwind, enabling it to safely get Tailwind up even against threats like Tapu Koko.</li> <li>Talonflame should be brought against opposing Tailwind setters like Mandibuzz and Drifblim so that it can match their Tailwind at a minimum.</li> <li>Given that Flare Blitz's recoil will break Gale Wings, it's best to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Pretty much any Pokemon can benefit from Tailwind support, but Pokemon with low-to-average Speed like Tapu Fini, Alolan Marowak, and Alolan Muk especially benefit from Tailwind support, as it enables them to outspeed Pokemon that they otherwise wouldn't be able to.</li> <li>Given that Rock-types like Gigalith and Nihilego are huge thorns in Talonflame's side, Ground-, Water-, and Steel-types like Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Kartana make for good teammates. Talonflame also allows Garchomp to use Earthquake without worrying about damaging its teammate, although it likely won't survive long enough to grant Garchomp this luxury for a whole match.</li> <li>Consider running a second Fire-type for an additional check to Steel-types; options include Arcanine, Alolan Marowak, and Salazzle. This allows Talonflame to use Flare Blitz as a last resort against these Pokemon, as opposed to it being the only option to handle these Pokemon.</li> <li>Lightning Rod support from the likes of Alolan Marowak or Togedemaru helps Talonflame by protecting it from Electric-type moves, especially those from Tapu Koko.</li> <li>Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu assist Talonflame by beating Water-types like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon.</li> <li>Using one or two of Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, or Tapu Fini is strongly recommended, as they can clear the field of Psychic Terrain to allow Talonflame to use Supersonic Skystrike on grounded Pokemon.</li> </ul>"

Thunder and Blizzard could be used on rain and hail teams respectively, but effective use of them requires the weather to be up at all times, so they are not reliable.</li> <li>Goodra's physical movepool is also fairly expansive, offering coverage moves such as Aqua Tail and Earthquake, but overall these moves will hit fewer Pokemon super effectively than its special moves. Power Whip should only be used to hit Gastrodon, as it is weaker than Thunderbolt on anything else without significant Attack investment.</li> <li>Dragonium Z, Life Orb, or other offensive items might seem enticing to let Goodra get off huge attacks or hit even harder, but the lack of an Assault Vest significantly cuts into Goodra's bulk and makes it easy to knock out.</li> <li>A healing Berry such as Iapapa Berry can be used to achieve similar levels of effective bulk and let Goodra run Protect, but Goodra loses both a coverage move and the ability to survive certain absurd special hits such as a Moonblast from Life Orb Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Gooey might seem enticing to punish the physical attacks directed at Goodra, but Goodra shouldn't be getting hit by many physical attacks in the first place, and you lose the ability to check the popular Grass-type moves in the format.</li> <li>The combination of Hydration and Rest might seem effective on a rain team, but not only do you lose the immunity to Grass-type moves, but Goodra is also now more vulnerable to opposing forms of weather, as Rest can't be used with an Assault Vest.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: These are Goodra's biggest problem, as even neutral physical attacks will deal heavy damage to Goodra, and certain unresisted Z-moves will even OHKO it. Garchomp is especially good at pressuring Goodra, as both its Dragon Claw and Tectonic Rage will deal heavy damage to it. Alolan Sandslash can come in easily on most of Goodra's attacks and deal heavy damage back, but has to watch out for Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Tanks</strong>: Opposing Pokemon with high Special Defense that aren't easily knocked out by any of Goodra's attacks can be a problem, especially if they have access to a recovery move. Pokemon like Porygon2 and Milotic with Recover and Arcanine with Morning Sun can slowly whittle down Goodra's HP.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Goodra really needs its Assault Vest to function well, and a Knock Off from Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Hariyama can cripple it for the rest of the battle.</p> <p><strong>Snarl</strong>: Goodra's Special Attack isn't that high to begin with, as it mostly relies on hitting foes super effectively to deal significant damage, so Snarl from Pokemon like Arcanine and Alolan Persian can reduce Goodra's offensive pressure to ignorable levels.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Dragon Pulse and Draco Meteor are both good choices for the first move. Dragon Pulse is better if you want Goodra to stay on the field longer, as it offers good consistent damage that doesn't weaken its other moves, whereas Draco Meteor offers more damage output at the cost of leaving Goodra relatively exposed after it's used. If you don't need to use its wide selection of other coverage moves, Goodra can comfortably run both Dragon-type attacks, letting it use whichever is more appropriate in a battle.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is not a strict requirement, but it lets Goodra check all of the Island Guardian Pokemon and whittle others down with poison damage, and very few Pokemon in the metagame resist both Dragon-type and Poison-type attacks.</li> <li>The remaining two moveslots are extremely customizable and should be used to fill holes in the rest of your team. Flamethrower lets Goodra check Steel- and Bug-type Pokemon like Kartana, Celesteela, and Vikavolt. Thunderbolt hits the popular Flying- and Water-types such as Celesteela, Milotic, and Pelipper. Ice Beam is used for Ground-types like Krookodile and Garchomp, and it can also score OHKOs on Dragon-types like Garchomp and Salamence if Goodra doesn't have Draco Meteor. Lastly, Power Whip may seem strange on a special attacker, but it allows Goodra to deal heavy damage to Gastrodon if the rest of your team can't handle it very well.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity to Grass-type attacks, which lets it switch in for free on moves like Celesteela's Leech Seed, Kartana's Leaf Blade, Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer, and Lilligant's Sleep Powder.</li> <li>The Assault Vest is required for Goodra to perform its role as a check to most special attackers.</li> <li>The given EVs let Goodra survive Tectonic Rage from Garchomp, two Smart Strikes from Kartana, and two Moonblasts from Tapu Lele. The Special Attack EVs, in combination with a Modest nature, are sufficient for Thunderbolt to OHKO uninvested Gyarados.</li> <li>The EVs are very customizable, however, so it is a good idea to figure out what foes the rest of your team is weak to and change Goodra's bulk to survive these hits. It can be ran both more defensively or more offensively.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Goodra can be used both as a lead and in the back. As a lead, it can put immediate pressure on Pokemon you expect your opponent to lead with, as there are very few attacks that can OHKO Goodra, almost ensuring that it can get an attack off.</li> <li>Good prediction is important when using this Pokemon. If Goodra threatens a foe enough, try to predict what your opponent will switch it to, and pick the correct move to hit it super effectively!</li> <li>Goodra deals with opposing sun, rain, and hail teams well. A sun-boosted Eruption from Torkoal does not deal much damage to Goodra at all, and Sap Sipper means Goodra can't be put to sleep with Lilligant's Sleep Powder. Water-type attacks from rain attackers hardly dent Goodra, and it can easily strike back with a Thunderbolt. Goodra can also easily survive Ice-type attacks from Alolan Ninetales and Vanilluxe and KO back with a Flamethrower, but it has to watch out for Icicle Crash from Alolan Sandslash. Goodra does not deal with sand teams very well, however, as Gigalith is a physical attacker and the sand lets it take negligable damage from any of Goodra's attacks.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Goodra greatly appreciates teammates that can weaken the opposing Pokemon's attacks to let it survive longer. Pokemon with Intimidate such as Arcanine and Gyarados pair up well with it, as they help weaken the physical attacks that Goodra can't take as well. Snarl helps Goodra take even super effective special attacks without breaking a sweat, letting it survive for a long time.</li> <li>Chip damage can build up on Goodra fairly easily, so ways to recover its health such appreciated, such as through Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain or Tapu Fini's Heal Pulse.</li> <li>Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain can help Goodra better deal with opposing Dragon-type attacks, although Goodra's own Dragon-type attacks will also be weakened.</li> <li>Fire-types pair well with Goodra, as they help against the three types that are super effective against Dragon-type. Arcanine and Incineroar are particularly useful, as they have access to moves like Snarl and Will-O-Wisp, and Arcanine even has Intimidate.</li> <li>Steel-type teammates such as Kartana, Magnezone, and Celesteela are also useful, as they do well against Fairy- and Ice-type foes.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<p>Araquanid is one of the most effective Trick Room attackers in the metagame thanks to its good bulk and natural offensive prowess with Water Bubble. Notably, its strong Hydro Vortex allows it to hit typically defensive Pokemon for great damage, hitting Snorlax and Porygon2 for 75% of their health and wiping out just about any other neutral hit. Araquanid's Water Bubble also allows it to ignore burns from the likes of Mimikyu and Arcanine, helping it keep up its physical prowess long into the game. Araquanid does have its shortcomings, however; its desire to use Water-type moves means that Gastrodon completely shuts it down, and it matches up poorly against the likes of Tapu Fini and Kartana, making it less effective against balance teams with good defensive synergy. Equally, after it has used its Z-Move, it is less effective at tackling the likes of Snorlax and Porygon2. Its typing also makes it vulnerable to some of the most common Z-Move users, notably Tapu Koko and Gigalith.</p>",

It also provides an immensely strong Hydro Vortex, allowing Araquanid to break through bulky foes such as Gigalith and specially defensive Celesteela. Bug Bite is primarily used to steal opposing 50% recovery Berries from common users such as Snorlax, Alolan Muk, and Tapu Fini. Wide Guard allows Araquanid to block some of the common spread moves in the format such as Gigalith's Rock Slide, Tapu Lele's Dazzling Gleam, and Garchomp's Earthquake. Araquanid's naturally low Speed, a Brave nature, (AC) and 0 Speed IVs allow it to underspeed Alolan Marowak, protecting its common partners in Kartana and Metagross from being taken down in Trick Room.</p> <p>Araquanid's power lies within Water Bubble, so more often than not, it relies on Liquidation to do the majority of its damage. Bug Bite is best used when trying to take a Figy Berry or any of the other 50% recovery Berries off a common user such as Snorlax or Tapu Fini. Wide Guard effectively nullifies Garchomp, which tends to run Rock Slide and Earthquake, and blocks Gigalith's Rock Slide as well. Araquanid really appreciates Porygon2 as a partner, as it can set Trick Room for it and form a decent offensive pairing. Araquanid also loves Kartana as a partner due to its ability to break through Gigalith and Tapu Fini, as well as pairing nicely with Arcanine and Salamence that can take down opposing Kartana, which Araquanid hates facing.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Toxic, when used with Salazzle's Corrosion ability, enables it to poison Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon. However, Salazzle has no problems handling the latter as is, meaning this option is only really useful for inflicting Alolan Muk with the badly poisoned status in order to put a timer on it if its teammates struggle against it.</li> <li>Disable allows Salazzle to temporarily block a foe from using a move like Protect or a move like Earthquake that threatens to OHKO it.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice gives Salazzle an option to deal super effective damage to Garchomp, which otherwise fears nothing Salazzle can throw at it.</li> <li>Air Balloon allows Salazzle to dodge Earthquakes, either from its enemies or its teammates, but a frail Pokemon like it would much rather have Focus Sash.</li> <li>Life Orb improves Salazzle's damage output; for example, it makes Sludge Bomb a guaranteed OHKO against non-bulky variants of Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Overheat gives Salazzle a stronger Fire-type attack, having a chance to OHKO Celesteela without a Life Orb and always OHKOing it with a Life Orb.</li> <li>Poisonium Z allows Salazzle to use Acid Downpour, which picks up OHKOs on Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Garchomp resists both of Salazzle's STAB moves and, thanks to Rough Skin, will break Salazzle's Focus Sash should Fake Out hit it, allowing it to OHKO it with Earthquake. Mudsdale can take Salazzle's Flamethrower and easily OHKO it with High Horsepower once its Focus Sash has been broken, while using Fake Out on Mudsdale is not recommended due to Stamina giving it a Defense boost.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Araquanid, Gastrodon, and Milotic can take any of Salazzle's attacks and threaten it with their Water-type STAB moves. Tapu Fini can take one Sludge Bomb from Salazzle and threaten it with its Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon resist both of Salazzle's STAB moves and boast super effective STAB of their own. Nihilego can take any attack from Salazzle and readily retaliate with Power Gem, although Salazzle is still capable of breaking a potential Focus Sash with Fake Out. Gigalith also takes any of Salazzle's attacks and OHKOes it with any Rock-type STAB move, with its Sand Stream ability setting a sandstorm that both boosts its Special Defense and breaks Salazzle's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak</strong>: Alolan Marowak resists both of Salazzle's STAB moves and boasts an immunity to Fake Out, allowing it to take anything from Salazzle and OHKO with Bonemerang through Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Muk</strong>: Although Alolan Muk only resists Sludge Bomb from Salazzle, its high Special Defense in combination with Gluttony and Figy Berry means Salazzle does not threaten it, only being able to fish for a burn with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain</strong>: Tapu Lele itself is not an answer to Salazzle thanks to its lower Speed and its weakness to Sludge Bomb, but its Psychic Surge ability will set up Psychic Terrain, which prevents Salazzle from using Fake Out against any grounded Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Salazzle's high Speed stat means it is likely to be moving last during Trick Room, which it does not want given its poor defenses. However, Salazzle is not totally useless during Trick Room, as it can still use Fake Out to immobilize a foe.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Fake Out enables Salazzle to immobilize a foe on the first turn that it's out, enabling it to stop a threat to its teammate for that turn.</li> <li>Flamethrower is Salazzle's preferred Fire-type STAB move, having perfect accuracy while OHKOing Kartana and 2HKOing Celesteela.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb allows Salazzle to hit Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini super effectively while hitting Tapu Bulu harder than Flamethrower.</li> <li>Protect allows Salazzle to shield itself while its teammate handles a threat like Alolan Marowak that Salazzle can't handle and also allows it to shield itself from an ally's Earthquake.</li> <li>Encore expands on Salazzle's disruption capabilities, allowing it to lock an opponent into a status move like Substitute or Protect, allowing Salazzle and its teammates to ignore that Pokemon and instead focus on another one for a few turns.</li> <li>Taunt allows Salazzle to prevent Pokemon like Porygon2 and Mandibuzz from using Trick Room or Tailwind while also preventing these Pokemon from using their recovery moves.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>A simple spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is fine for Salazzle, as it won't be taking very many hits anyway.</li> <li>A Timid nature is essential, as this allows Salazzle to outspeed Kartana and Alolan Ninetales.</li> <li>Focus Sash allows Salazzle to take any attack from full health, which is helpful given that its paper-thin defenses don't allow it to take very many attacks. Furthermore, the Focus Sash enables it to actually threaten Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini with Sludge Bomb.</li> <li>On Salazzle, Oblivious is a situational ability at best. However, it gets the nod over Corrosion thanks to protecting Salazzle from Taunt, thus ensuring that it can always use any of its status moves no matter what. On the other hand, Corrosion only enables Sludge Bomb to poison opposing Poison-types, but Salazzle has no business staying in on Alolan Muk or Nihilego to begin with.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Unless Tapu Lele shows up in Team Preview, Salazzle is generally a pretty easy pick for a lead, allowing it to immediately exert Fake Out pressure.</li> <li>Leading Salazzle with a Tailwind setter like Mandibuzz helps to maintain momentum; for example, Salazzle can use Fake Out against a threat like Tapu Koko while Mandibuzz sets up Tailwind to allow Salazzle to then outspeed and OHKO Tapu Koko.</li> <li>Try to conserve Salazzle for as long as possible by switching it out, even if it has been brought down to its Focus Sash. Even a 1 HP Salazzle can still come in handy for the Fake Out pressure.</li> <li>Unless you need to bring Salazzle in order to beat a threat like Kartana, it's generally not recommended to bring it against a team that has Gigalith, seeing as Gigalith's Sand Stream ability will break Salazzle's Focus Sash and it resists both of Salazzle's STAB moves.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Fast, offensive Pokemon like Pheromosa and Kartana appreciate Salazzle's ability to create free turns with Fake Out and Encore, as it protects them from OHKOs while they handle the foe that has not been immobilized. Furthermore, Pheromosa can handle Garchomp with Ice Beam, while Kartana easily manages Gigalith and Nihilego.</li> <li>Given that Salazzle cannot touch Pokemon like Gigalith, Nihilego, and Alolan Marowak, Ground-type Pokemon like Garchomp and Krookodile make for good teammates. Since their Earthquake will also target Salazzle, it is almost essential to run Groundium Z on whichever one of Garchomp or Krookodile you pick.</li> <li>If your team does not have any more room for Z-Move users, Mudsdale makes for a good teammate to handle the aforementioned Ground-weak threats, as it can target them with High Horsepower, which does not have the downside of also hitting Salazzle.</li> <li>As Ground-types like Garchomp and Mudsdale prove to be problematic for Salazzle, it's a good idea to consider running a Water-type like Tapu Fini or Gyarados alongside it.</li> <li>Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini make for strong teammates for Salazzle, as they can remove Psychic Terrain from the field.</li> </ul>"

You also stall your own turns of Trick Room when using this attack, taking away an additional turn that Dhelmise could be doing damage.</li> <li>Earthquake can be an alternative to Shadow Claw or Rock Slide, dealing more damage to Fire and Steel-types.

Groundium Z could be used alongside Earthquake to give a strong Ground-type move to possibly OHKO Arcanine or Torkoal, but that costs both Dhelmise's item slot and your Z-Move for the game.</li> <li>Gyro Ball can serve as an alternative due to Dhelmise's low Speed, but it won't often be better than Heavy Slam due to the large number of slow Pokemon in the metagame.</li> <li>Misty Seed can be used to give it a Special Defense boost when it enters Misty Terrain, giving it the ability to use Protect, unlike Assault Vest. However, you have to use Tapu Fini alongside it in order to get the boost reliably, and it only lasts until Dhelmise switches out.

An exception to this would be if the opponent's team has no checks to it, but even then, you should keep it out of battle until the time is right.</li> <li>It can serve as a good switch-in, but it isn't a good situation to do so when there's a Pokemon that threatens it on the field and Trick Room isn't up.</li> <li>If Power Whip and Heavy Slam would deal the same amount of damage to a Pokemon, use Heavy Slam because it has more accuracy.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>If you are using Dhelmise, you should be using it on a Trick Room team, and Porygon2 serves as almost non-debatably the best Trick Room setter in the game.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Has access to spammable 110-Base Power STAB spread move, Clanging Scales.</li> <li>Is the only special attacker in the metagame (apart from All-Out Pummeling Pheromosa) with ability to OHKO some variants of Porygon2.</li> <li>75 / 125 / 105 defenses makes it quite bulky and allows Kommo-o to tank some strong moves like Garchomp's Dragon Claw.</li> <li>Kommo-o also has few cool coverage moves like Flamethrower.</li> <li>Kommo-o faces basically no competition due to unique typing and as there are almost no other special attacking Fighting-types in the metagame.</li> <li>A 4x weakness to Fairy makes it hard to use effectively as Fairy-types are very common in this metagame.</li> <li>While it can hit hard, its Special Attack isn't that high.</li> <li>Kommo-o sits at an awkward speed tier, being too fast for Trick Room but not very fast outside of it.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Choice Specs is an alternate set as it makes Kommo-o a very powerful spread attacker. Choice Specs Clanging Scales can OHKO Garchomp, for example. However, not being able to switch between coverage makes Choice Specs Kommo-o very situational, and in order to use coverage moves it is necessary to have Pokemon that can switch into Kommo-o's slot, such as Steel-types.</li> <li>If Choice Specs is used, Protect should be dropped for a fourth attacking move. Draco Meteor is a one-time attack that enables Kommo-o to OHKO Alolan Marowak and deal huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Flash Cannon is an other option to have some kind of attack against Fairy-types, but apart from Alolan Ninetales it fails to OHKO any relevant Fairy-type Pokemon even with Choice Specs.</li> <li>Soundproof gives Kommo-o immunity to Snarl and Perish Song, as well as immunity to Clanging Scales from opposing Kommo-o, but generally has no other use than that, as there are no Aerilate, Pixilate, or Refrigerate Hyper Voice users in VGC 17.</li> <li>A mixed set with Life Orb, -SpD or -Def nature, Poison Jab, and 124 Atk EVs can be used to OHKO max HP Tapu Bulu. It also enables Kommo-o to hit other Fairy-types hard, as well as use boosted Clanging Scales while still being able to switch moves. However, using a mixed EV spread and negatively affecting nature on either of its defenses greatly sacrifices Kommo-o's bulk, and using Poison Jab means that Kommo-o needs to either drop its Fighting STAB move or Flamethrower for it, which results in general loss of coverage.</li> <li>It is not recommended to use a physical set in VGC even if using Dragon Dance or Belly Drum, as Kommo-o's physical STAB moves are mediocre at best and this physical set is widely outclassed by Garchomp, which is faster, has higher Attack, and has STAB Earthquake.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini can easily tank anything Kommo-o throws in and OHKO back with Fairy-STAB. While Moonblast is not commonly used on Alolan Ninetales, it can still hit Kommo-o hard with Blizzard. All Fairy-types are also immune to Kommo-o's Clanging Scales, so any of them can easily switch into predicted Clanging Scales.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Metagross can tank even All-Out Pummeling, and possibly OHKO back with Zen Headbutt. While Oranguru doesn't OHKO Kommo-o, it has enough bulk to tank Kommo-o's attacks. It also can set up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Talonflame can OHKO Kommo-o with Supersonic Skystrike, and Pelipper can hit hard with Hurricane and potentially has Wide Guard to block Clanging Scales.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon</strong>: While no Dragon-type Pokemon likes to get hit by Clanging Scales, they still pose a threat for Kommo-o. Garchomp outspeeds Kommo-o, can avoid getting KOed by Clanging Scales with Focus Sash, and can 2HKO with Dragon Claw. Salamence can OHKO Kommo-o with Devastating Drake outside of Misty Terrain. Drampa can easily OHKO Kommo-o with Draco Meteor, though it gets outsped and OHKOed by All-Out Pummeling outside of Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: While not as common as in earlier years, Wide Guard can be annoying for Kommo-o as it means Kommo-o can't use its strongest STAB move. Araquanid gets special mention, as even though it isn't that threatening for Kommo-o offensively, it has huge Special Defense and resists all Kommo-o's moves except Clanging Scales, which it can potentially block with Wide Guard.</p> <p><strong>Snarl</strong>: Snarl lowers Kommo-o's Special Attack, which Kommo-o needs to hit as hard as possible.</p>",

It also allows Kommo-o to shut down Torkoal + Lilligant very effectively, as Kommo-o is immune to Sleep Powder with Overcoat.</li> <li>Bulletproof gives Kommo-o immunity to certain moves like Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Kommo-o is generally most effective mid- or late-game, when its biggest threats are removed and it can finish off weakened targets with Clanging Scales. Leading with Kommo-o is not a bad option however if the opponent has Porygon2. Make sure to switch Kommo-o out if the opponent happens to lead with a Fairy-type like Tapu Koko.</li> <li>Use All-Out Pummeling to take out a single bulky target. After that generally just spam Clanging Scales.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Having partners to deal with Fairy-types is necessary.</li> <li>Steel-types such as Kartana, Metagross, and Celesteela are great partners for Kommo-o as they can threaten Fairy-types fairly nicely.</li> <li>Ninetales is a great partner as it can use Aurora Veil to make Kommo-o very bulky, giving Kommo-o the ability to survive Life Orb Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam. The combination of Blizzard and Clanging Scales can do devastating spread damage. Kommo-o is also immune to hail with Overcoat.</li> <li>While Tapu Fini weakens Clanging Scales, it's still a good partner as it allows Kommo-o to tank opposing Dragon-type attacks more effectively. Tapu Fini also appreciates Kommo-o's ability to threaten Kartana, one of the biggest threats to Tapu Fini.</li> <li>Wide Guard support can be useful to block Dazzling Gleam from some Fairy-types that rely on it as a STAB move, such as Tapu Koko. Pelipper gets a special mention as it has access to Tailwind, a move that Kommo-o greatly appreciates.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Nihilego is used primarily for its Speed and typing. Therefore, it is mandatory to run Sludge Bomb due to the rising popularity of Fairy-type Pokemon. Sludge Bomb almost always OHKOes most of the popular guardian deities, after which Nihilego gets a boost from its ability to make sure its next attack hits even harder.</li> <li>Pokemon like Gyarados and Arcanine are common staples in many teams, and the former can even OHKO Nihilego if it's not running a Focus Sash. Power Gem ensures Nihilego KOes them with ease while also hurting Celesteela for neutral damage.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice allows Nihilego to OHKO most Garchomp and helps deal with the occasional Ground-type Pokemon once boosted and is often a staple on most Nihilego. Grass Knot can be used in this slot to deal huge amounts of damage to Gastrodon and Milotic, 2HKOing the latter.</li> <li>Protect is necessary in VGC due to Nihilego's frailty, as it helps scout incoming attacks and stall out Trick Room.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Focus Sash is the most used item on Nihilego, as it helps compensate for Nihilego's lack of physical bulk. Prolonged field presence with Beast Boost makes Nihilego much more threatening than it already is.</li> <li>Taking enough Special Attack EVs is another way to take advantage of Beast Boost, to ensure Nihilego's Speed is boosted instead. This increases Nihilego's Speed so that it can outspeed even Choice Scarf Pokemon.</li> <li>Life Orb is often used to secure the OHKO on Gyarados and Arcanine. However, this makes Nihilego much more susceptible to Earthquake and Heavy Slam.</li> <li>252 Speed EVs ensure Nihilego outspeeds maximum speed Garchomp, which is one of the faster Pokemon in the format. This also helps Nihilego outspeed threats like Tapu Lele and Salamence.</li> <li>252 Special Attack EVs are run to maximize Nihilego's damage output. The EVs are plain and simple, as Nihilego is purely an offensive sweeper.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>As one of the frailest Pokemon in the format, Nihilego is almost always equipped with Focus Sash.</li> <li>It is advisable to switch into incoming special attacks to take advantage of Nihilego's special bulk while safely getting it onto the field.</li> <li>As a Focus Sash user, Nihilego can also pressure your opponent as a lead, as it can easily take out a lot of threats.</li> <li>You have to be careful when using Sludge Bomb, as a switch into a Steel-type will render it useless, and moreover, put Nihilego at risk.</li> <li>Terrains are useful when using Nihilego, as Tapu Lele's Psychic fails to OHKO it when it is used under a different terrain. Similarly, Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquakes from Garchomp and Krookodile, and when paired with Intimidate or burn, it greatly improves Nihilego's longevity to the point that you don't need to rely on Focus Sash.</li> <li>Nihilego is an easy pick against most teams due to its powerful movepool and offensive capabilities.</li> <li>Nihilego is best used against Pokemon it can either OHKO or wall using its Special Defense. As such, it shouldn't be kept on the field against Pokemon that can OHKO it like Kartana and Celesteela.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Nihilego suffers from a variety of weaknesses due to its typing. As Ground-types are one of the most common types in VGC, Wide Guard users like Celesteela make great partners to Nihilego, helping it overcome Earthquakes.</li> <li>Grassy Terrain helps further mitigate Nihilego's Ground weakness to an extent.

However, beware of the Fairy-types that usually accompany Garchomp, as they can quickly take care of Buzzwole.</li> <li>Even though Buzzwole is a physical tank, it can still be OHKOed by strong super effective moves like Talonflame's Brave Bird and Arcanine's Inferno Overdrive, so users of such moves should be handled with caution.</li> <li>Its abysmal Special Defense makes it an easy target for the likes of Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini, meaning it shouldn't be kept on the field when facing the duo.</li> <li>Like most physical attackers, Buzzwole is hindered by Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, and players should hold out using its Z-Move until they can ensure it connects, as using it on to a Protect severely hurts your momentum.</li> <li>Buzzwole serves as a perfect Snorlax and Porygon2 counter, being able to easily OHKO them with its Z-Move, though you should keep an eye out for the occasional Protect.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Most Flying-type attacks are capable of OHKOing Buzzwole. Hence, Rock-type Pokemon like Nihilego form a solid defensive core with Buzzwole, and Nihilego in particular also takes down the guardian deities with STAB Sludge Bomb.</li> <li>Poison-type Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Nihilego help Buzzwole by dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon like the guardian deities, some of which are capable of OHKOing Buzzwole with their STAB Fairy-type attacks.</li> <li>As Buzzwole is weak to Fire-type moves, a Ground-type Pokemon like Garchomp works well with it. Rain setters like Pelipper can be used to mitigate its Fire weakness as well, with Pelipper having the added benefit of supporting Buzzwole by providing speed control.</li> <li>Like most physical attackers, Buzzwole is crippled by burns and Intimidate, and hence appreciates the help of Tapu Fini and its Misty Terrain.</li> <li>Due to Buzzwole's mediocre Speed tier, it often appreciates some form of speed control like Tailwind to outspeed and KO opposing threats. Setters like Talonflame, Pelipper, and Drifblim go well with it, being able to provide guaranteed Tailwind while exerting some form of offensive pressure.</li> </ul>"

  "Pheromosa": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Strong coverage with moves like High Jump Kick and Ice Beam make Pheromosa a threatening offensive Pokemon capable of dealing a lot of damage very quickly due to it naturally outspeeding the entire metagame, barring Choice Scarf users.</li> <li>Pheromosa is one of the few Pokemon in the metagame capable of OHKOing Porygon2, easily putting pressure on it.</li> <li>Pheromosa's fragility makes it vulnerable to priority attacks like Arcanine's Extreme Speed and Metagross's Bullet Punch while also making it take huge amounts of damage even from resisted attacks.</li> <li>Furthermore, Pheromosa's high Speed and frailty makes it totally incapable of functioning inside Trick Room.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>A specially based set of Focus Blast, Ice Beam, Bug Buzz, and Protect carrying Fightinium Z can be used. This set can easily OHKO Porygon2 with All-Out Pummeling while being totally unfazed by Intimidate, but is generally not recommended due to Focus Blast's unreliability once All-Out Pummeling has been used.</li> <li>Pheromosa is generally too frail to run setup sets, but Quiver Dance allows it to form a potentially deadly combination with Oricorio, whose Dancer Ability will copy Quiver Dance. It should never be used on a team without Oricorio, though.</li> <li>Speed Swap allows Pheromosa to trade Speed stats with slow Pokemon like Snorlax or Alolan Marowak. This can be used on an ally to make it incredibly fast, or on an opposing Pokemon to allow Pheromosa to function in Trick Room.</li> <li>Quick Guard allows Pheromosa to block priority moves, which is useful given its vulnerability to priority, but this should generally be left to bulkier Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting resistances and immunities</strong>: Pokemon such as Drifblim, Mimikyu, Gengar, and Alolan Marowak boast an immunity to High Jump Kick while fearing nothing from Pheromosa's coverage, allowing them to handle Pheromosa with ease. Similarly, Gyarados and Araquanid both resist High Jump Kick while not particularly caring about its coverage moves and can OHKO with Waterfall and Liquidation, respectively. Furthermore, Gyarados has Intimidate to further weaken Pheromosa, although Araquanid will have to be on the lookout for U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Being naturally faster than the entire metagame turns Pheromosa into a liability in Trick Room, as it will be virtually guaranteed to be moving last, which is a death sentence for a Pokemon as frail as Pheromosa is. However, Pheromosa can easily threaten Porygon2, the most common Trick Room setter. Similarly, Tailwind gives a boost in Speed, which allows Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Garchomp, which are normally defeated by Poison Jab and Ice Beam, respectively, to outspeed and OHKO Pheromosa.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users</strong>: Choice Scarf allows Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Garchomp, which are normally outsped by Pheromosa, to outspeed and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: As a predominantly physical attacker, Intimidate and Burns hamper Pheromosa's damage output. However, these will not cripple specially oriented Pheromosa sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Arcanine's Extreme Speed does a minimum of approximately 64% to Pheromosa, allowing Arcanine to revenge kill a worn-down Pheromosa. Likewise, Metagross's Bullet Punch always 2HKOes Pheromosa while Pheromosa cannot OHKO it in return with High Jump Kick. Talonflame deserves a special note here thanks to being able to OHKO Pheromosa with Gale Wings Supersonic Skystrike, even through Protect.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>High Jump Kick is Pheromosa's strongest STAB move, hitting for a consistent 130 Base Power, but costing it 50% of its health if the attack misses or lands into Protect.</li> <li>Poison Jab allows Pheromosa to threaten Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu, making it a move you should almost always have on it.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Pheromosa to OHKO Garchomp without taking Rough Skin damage or worrying about High Jump Kick missing.</li> <li>U-turn allows Pheromosa to deal solid damage to a target and immediately switch out for an ally that can take a hit.</li> <li>Protect is a VGC staple, allowing Pheromosa to be safe for a turn while its ally handles a threat like Gengar or Alolan Marowak.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>A simple EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is best for Pheromosa, as any investment in bulk will be meaningless given its nonexistent bulk. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into HP to give it an odd HP number, allowing High Jump Kick to miss or land into Protect twice.</li> <li>Focus Sash allows Pheromosa to take one attack, something it could only dream of accomplishing without it.</li> <li>Life Orb boosts Pheromosa's power, enabling it to always OHKO Porygon2 with High Jump Kick and always OHKO Tapu Koko with Poison Jab.</li> <li>Pheromosa already outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame without a Speed-boosting nature, making Naughty the preferred nature to give Pheromosa more power and allow it to get an Attack boost from Beast Boost without weakening Ice Beam.</li> <li>An Adamant nature should be used if Pheromosa runs U-turn instead of Ice Beam, as there is no need to run a Naughty nature if Pheromosa does not have any special attacks.</li> <li>An EV spread of 36 HP / 212 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe gives Pheromosa a boost in Speed from Beast Boost instead of Attack. This makes it less susceptible to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users but makes it more susceptible to Intimidate.</li> <li>A Naive or Jolly nature will reduce Pheromosa's damage output, but they allow it to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, which is one of the most common methods of checking Pheromosa.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Never switch Pheromosa into an attack. Its nonexistent bulk means it will take a lot of damage, even from resisted hits. Instead, switch it in after something else has fainted. Leading with Pheromosa is also a surefire way to make sure it can get on the field safely.</li> <li>Be careful about using High Jump Kick, as its target can easily use Protect to force Pheromosa to lose 50% of its health. Try to use it only if the target used Protect the turn before or doesn't have Protect. This is mostly important for Focus Sash variants of Pheromosa, as High Jump Kick landing into Protect will break the Focus Sash; Life Orb variants don't care nearly as much.</li> <li>If you see Porygon2 in Team Preview, you should probably bring Pheromosa to the match in the lead spot in order to immediately threaten Porygon2 and potentially prevent a Trick Room setup. However, if your opponent's team has a secondary setter like Mimikyu, or if their team has a Fake Out user, it won't be as simple as just leading with Pheromosa to prevent Trick Room, so you will need to adjust your leads in order to handle those scenarios. For example, leading with a Roar user will prevent Mimikyu from setting up Trick Room, while leading with something like Tapu Lele or your own Fake Out user will help against a Fake Out lead.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Fake Out users like Salazzle, Togedemaru, and Alolan Persian make for good teammates for Pheromosa, as they can immobilize one opponent while Pheromosa takes care of the other one.</li> <li>Tapu Lele shields Pheromosa from priority attacks like Arcanine's Extreme Speed and Metagross's Bullet Punch, but it should be noted that this will conflict with the aforementioned Fake Out users as well.</li> <li>As Gengar and Alolan Marowak are huge problems for Pheromosa, Dark-types like Krookodile, Alolan Muk, and Alolan Persian make for good teammates. Alolan Muk is particularly noteworthy here thanks to its ability to use Imprison, which prevents any opponent from using Protect in order to block High Jump Kick.</li> <li>Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Pelipper, Aerodactyl, and Drifblim allows Pheromosa to get past Choice Scarf users, one of the most common ways of checking Pheromosa.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Swords Dance is a good option because it Kartana gets many opportunities to use it and it can help counteract Intimidates, but Kartana loses a valuable coverage option or Protect.</li> <li>Substitute takes advantage of Kartana's great Speed and the fact that it's only often threatened by a single Pokemon on the field. It can be used to scout for Fire moves and heavily punish switches and incorrect targeting. However, Focus Sash is not a suitable item for Substitute Kartana. Figy Berry is a great item to go along with Substitute, replenishing a lot of HP, while Substitute and Kartana's great Speed allows it to activate it with reliability.</li> <li>Guillotine can be used as a filler move on the Assault Vest to randomly pick up OHKOs, but it is highly unreliable and Kartana puts out heavy offensive pressure already. Kartana also does not have enough bulk to fire Guillotines repeatedly.</li> <li>Razor Leaf is Kartana's only real option of a spread move, but since the Night Slash slot on the Assault Vest set is situational anyway, Razor Leaf can be a viable option despite how weak it is.</li> <li>Z-Crystals can boost Kartana's moves to terrifying levels of power and pick up surprising KOs to activate Beast Boost. With Grassium Z, Leaf Blade can OHKO Garchomp, for example.</li> <li>Scope Lens increases Leaf Blade and Night Slash's crit chances to 50%. This allows Kartana to pressure opponents while affected by Intimidate.</li> <li>Salac Berry can be run with Substitute to make Kartana fast. The lack of priority moves in the format helps here.</li> <li>Choice Scarf enables it to outrun Pokemon such as Pheromosa and +1 Gyarados and avoid the dreaded Kartana Speed ties for the most part.

They can click a Fire-type move to make Kartana disappear.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type attacks</strong>: Perhaps more threatening than Fire-type Pokemon are unexpected Fire attacks from foes that Kartana is expected to be able to play against. Flamethrower Alolan Muk and Hidden Power Fire Tapu Koko are examples. Additionally, Flamethrower Celesteela hard counters Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Pheromosa, Buzzwole, and Hariyama can all destroy Kartana with a powerful Fighting-type attack, but they must be wary of its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 takes any attack and significantly threatens Kartana with Ice Beam or sets up Trick Room. Keep in mind that Assault Vest Kartana can actually take a few Ice Beams, though.</p> <p><strong>Vikavolt</strong>: Vikavolt resists Kartana's STAB attacks and Sacred Sword and takes neutral damage from Night Slash, which is a 4HKO. In return, Vikavolt solidly 2HKOes even the bulkiest Assault Vest Kartana with Bug Buzz.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Kartana isn't very strong, and Intimidate heavily hampers its sweeping power. Salamence and Arcanine are especially threatening, as they can OHKO it with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room turns Kartana's great Speed against it. However, it should be noted that Kartana's defensive capabilities are not bad and it can still function fine under TR.</p> <p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: Unless Kartana is using Assault Vest and/or has significant defensive investment, it'll take a ton from even resisted hits. To give an idea of how frail Kartana is without defensive investment, it is 2HKOed by Life Orb Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Leaf Blade is Kartana's most powerful STAB attack and its strongest attack in general. It is used to threaten a number of Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon</li> <li>Smart Strike heavily threatens Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Alolan Ninetales, Nihilego, and Mimikyu and allows Kartana to target evasive foes such as Minimize Muk and a Smeargle that picked up an evasion boost from Moody.</li> <li>Sacred Sword can threaten Steel- and Normal-type Pokemon such as opposing Kartana, Magnezone, Porygon2, Porygon-Z, Drampa, and Snorlax. It is especially useful against Snorlax, as it slices through Snorlax's attempts to boost its Defense via Curse.</li> <li>Kartana is often a high-priority threat, and Detect enables it to save itself from double targets. It also allows Kartana to scout for Fire attacks such as Flamethrower from Celesteela and Fire Fang from Garchomp. Detect is chosen over Protect to minimize the risk of getting affected by Imprison.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed allows Kartana to outrun Garchomp and Nihilego while Speed tying with opposing Alolan Ninetales and Kartana.</li> <li>Maximum Attack is used to maximize power. However, with such a high base Attack already, it is not a bad idea to cut off some Attack and invest in Special Defense instead. This reduces Kartana's reliance on Focus Sash and makes better use of its amazing defensive typing.</li> <li>Focus Sash protects Kartana from a single powerful special attack or Fire- or Fighting-type moves.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Kartana is best used as a late-game sweeper, when its foes are low on health and are easy pickings for Beast Boost activation. This also allows it to better avoid Intimidates, which are often more prevalent in the early-game, and gives you greater control of its Focus Sash.</li> <li>However, its incredible Speed, offensive pressure, and life insurance from Focus Sash also makes it a viable lead, especially if the opponent lacks a Pokemon with Intimidate.</li> <li>Try to eliminate Fire-types or put Kartana in a position where Fire-type Pokemon are hesitant to stay in. Pairing it with a Water-type or Rock-type Pokemon helps with this. Kartana can usually threaten the Pokemon that threaten its Water- and Rock-type partner.</li> <li>It is not difficult to position Kartana in such a way that it can threaten a foe while the other doesn't threaten it a whole lot. This is a prime opportunity to make a read and catch a switch-in with the appropriate coverage move or switch Kartana back out in anticipation of that switch to maintain momentum.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Kartana can fit into teams very easily and is not difficult to support.</li> <li>Water-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Pelipper, Politoed, Gyarados, and Milotic are strong options to support Kartana, as they can take down Fire-type Pokemon. The Pokemon mentioned here all provide additional utility. Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain blocks status, allowing Kartana to switch into a Scald and not fear getting burned if it has to. Pelipper and Politoed provide rain support to further dissuade the use of Fire-type Pokemon. Keep in mind, however, that Pelipper also commonly holds Focus Sash, creating a conflict with this Kartana set due to Item Clause. Gyarados provides the generally useful Intimidate support, while Milotic deters the use of opposing Intimidate. Tapu Fini, Gyarados, and Pelipper also all resist Fighting, covering Kartana's only other weakness. In return, Kartana can remove the especially troublesome Gastrodon for many of these Water-type Pokemon with Leaf Blade.</li> <li>Rock-types such as Nihilego and Gigalith also provide additional coverage against Fire-type Pokemon, while Kartana takes care of Water- and Ground-type Pokemon for them.</li> <li>Fire-type Pokemon such as Arcanine and Alolan Marowak appreciate Kartana's ability to remove Water-type Pokemon and support Kartana by checking Celesteela and providing another switch-in to predicted Fire-type attacks.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Leaf Blade is Kartana's most powerful STAB attack and its strongest attack in general, not counting Giga Impact. It is used to threaten a number of Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon.</li> <li>Smart Strike heavily threatens Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Alolan Ninetales, Nihilego, and Mimikyu and allows it to reliably hit evasive foes such as Minimize Muk and a Smeargle that picked up an evasion boost from Moody.</li> <li>Sacred Sword can threaten Steel- and Normal-type Pokemon such as opposing Kartana, Magnezone, Porygon2, Porygon-Z, Drampa, and Snorlax. It is especially useful against Snorlax, as it slices through Snorlax's attempts to boost its Defense via Curse.</li> <li>Night Slash is mostly filler, but it hits Alolan Marowak and Metagross super effectively. These Pokemon can otherwise tank Kartana's attacks with relative ease.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed allows Kartana to outrun Garchomp and Nihilego while Speed tying with opposing Alolan Ninetales and Kartana.</li> <li>92 HP allows it to survive Garchomp's Fire Fang and Tectonic Rage. The rest are thrown into Special Defense to maximize the function of this set. For example, Tapu Fini will not 2HKO Kartana with Choice Specs-boosted Moonblast.</li> <li>Maximum Special Defense enables Kartana to avoid being 2HKOed by Tapu Koko's Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt in Electric Terrain 91% of the time. It also enables Kartana to survive two Blizzards from Alolan Ninetales plus two rounds of hail damage. The investment can be lowered, however, should you wish for more physical bulk. The minimum benchmark to look for is surviving Golduck's Hydro Vortex in rain.</li> <li>No Attack investment is used because, due to its high base Attack, Kartana is really not getting much mileage out of it anyway. This set needs bulk. However, 52 Attack EVs can be used to guarantee a 2HKO on uninvested Garchomp with Leaf Blade.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>The purpose of Assault Vest Kartana is to make great use of its incredible defensive typing and switch into Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Nihilego, Milotic, and Gastrodon without taking too much damage or getting horribly chunked by a weak special attack. Thus, Assault Vest Kartana finds its home in more balanced or defensively styled teams, as it can now make good use of its resistances.</li> <li>Be extra careful of Fire attacks, as Kartana doesn't have Protect or Focus Sash to scout for it, so switch out if your opponent's Pokemon could reasonably be carrying one. Once your opponent deduces that you are running Assault Vest Kartana, they may begin to double-target your Kartana slot to checkmate either the Kartana or its replacement. Make use of Kartana's increased bulk to pivot and bait your opponent into trying to trap you into the aforementioned awkward position.</li> <li>Remember that, even with all this Special Defense investment, Kartana's special bulk is still unimpressive, so avoid taking powerful neutral special attacks whenever possible.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Water-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Pelipper, Politoed, Gyarados, and Milotic are strong options to support Kartana, as they can take down Fire-type Pokemon. The Pokemon mentioned here all provide additional utility. Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain blocks status, allowing Kartana to switch into Scald repeatedly without the fear of getting burned. Pelipper and Politoed provide rain support to further dissuade the use of Fire-type Pokemon, and the combination of rain and Assault Vest actually allows Kartana to survive Fire attacks. Gyarados provides the generally useful Intimidate support, while Milotic deters the use of opposing Intimidate. Tapu Fini, Gyarados, and Pelipper also all resist Fighting, covering Kartana's only other weakness.</li> <li>Rock-types such as Nihilego and Gigalith also provide additional coverage against Fire-type Pokemon, while Kartana takes care of Water- and Ground-type Pokemon for them.</li> <li>Fire-type Pokemon such as Arcanine and Alolan Marowak appreciate Kartana's ability to remove Water-type Pokemon and support Kartana by checking Celesteela and providing another switch-in to predicted Fire-type attacks.</li> </ul>"
