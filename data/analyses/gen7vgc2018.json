Trace copies foes' abilities, and this can come in handy against foes like Landorus-T and Salamence, or scouting foes' abilities. The moveset can also be adjusted to employ utility moves like Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Destiny Bond.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a Trick Room user, Mega Gardevoir's low physical bulk and high Speed can be detrimental. Mega Gardevoir is easily overwhelmed by a myriad of common physical attackers even when running bulk investment, and it is slower than foes like Tapu Bulu and Porygon2 under Trick Room. This leaves Mega Gardevoir somewhat reliant on its teammates to effectively function, and this combines with the fact that Mega Gardevoir takes up a Mega slot to make it somewhat of a Pokemon that must be built around.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gardevoir has little to do against Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Aegislash, Heatran, and Ferrothorn due to them resisting its STAB combination.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Mega Gardevoir may seem to be able to run a fast, offensive attacker set, its susceptibility to priority moves and the presence of faster threats like Kartana, Tapu Koko, and Mega Gengar make any sets other than Trick Room hard to justify over other threats like Tapu Lele.</p> </li> </ul>",

It is the most effective option for Mega Gardevoir to deal with Dragon-types like Mega Salamence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychic hits a number of important foes that are resistant to Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, such as Mega Charizard Y, Amoonguss, and Nihilego for high damage. Psyshock is an alternative to OHKO the latter two and generally hit specially defensive foes like Snorlax harder at a cost of slightly less power.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mega Gardevoir's role as a Trick Room setter, access to a spread attack, and frailty entice attacks from foes often. Protect therefore makes a good option to temporarily guard it from offensive pressure.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Mega Gardevoir survives two Earthquakes from Jolly Landorus-T and a Sludge Bomb from Mega Gengar. 36 Special Attack EVs allow Mega Gardevoir to benefit the most from its Special Attack-boosting nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>An alternative Relaxed nature works if Mega Gardevoir will have to survive Double-Edge from Mega Salamence and avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p>36 Speed EVs can be run with a Modest or Bold nature so that Mega Gardevoir can outspeed everything up to Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T with Tailwind support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Various slow physical attackers can work with Mega Gardevoir to take down each other's checks while running rampant when Trick Room is active. Incineroar is a notable partner for easing Mega Gardevoir's attempt to set up Trick Room by weakening foes with Intimidate and using Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other slow teammates like Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Araquanid can take advantage of Trick Room. All of them can run viable countermeasures to deal with Steel-types and specially defensive foes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Landorus-T is a viable teammate that also appreciates Trick Room due to its middling Speed. It offensively checks some of Mega Gardevoir's biggest checks like Mega Metagross, Aegislash, and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tailwind is also a viable option to support Mega Gardevoir. Offensive teams often lack a proper way to deal with Gardevoir and therefore the Speed boost from Tailwind makes it notoriously difficult to deal with. Zapdos is a viable setter due to its ability to threaten Celesteela and keep Calm Mind Tapu Fini in check, while Kartana is a good teammate thanks to it threatening Steel-types with Sacred Sword and specially defensive foes.</p> </li> </ul>"

High Horsepower and Fire Punch hit the Ghost-types that it otherwise wouldn't be able to touch like Mega Gengar and Aegislash and OHKO many Pokemon that resist its Normal STAB attacks at +6 like Mega Metagross. After Belly Drum, High Horsepower OHKOes Tyranitar and even Shuca Berry Heatran, whilst Fire Punch OHKOes Drifblim, non-Focus Sash Kartana, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn. High Horsepower is generally preferred over Fire Punch, as it has better neutral coverage alongside Return.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect is a strong option to allow Snorlax to stall while a teammate either sets Trick Room or sets up board position or for protection against a predicted Z-Move. Typically Protect should not be dropped in most cases unless you have redirection and Fake Out support to help set up Snorlax. Recycle, bringing back Wiki Berry, effectively functions as a 50% HP recovery move and can be used to take advantage of opposing passive play or when both the opposing Pokemon do little to threaten Snorlax.</p> </li> <li> <p>The combination of Wiki Berry and Gluttony enables Snorlax to immediately regain the 50% HP lost from using Belly Drum, preserving its bulk. Wiki Berry is chosen over other 50%-healing Berries to confuse potential Adamant Bug Bite users like Mega Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EVs and nature focus on Snorlax's weaker physical bulk whilst providing an even HP number so that Wiki Berry activates after using Belly Drum and ensuring that Tapu Lele's Shattered Psyche cannot OHKO Snorlax in Psychic Terrain.

This set trades power for not having to be as committed to setting up as Belly Drum Snorlax.</p> </li> <li> <p>Double-Edge is preferred over Return for the higher damage. With Curse boosting Defense without cutting Snorlax's HP, the recoil isn't as harmful as on a DrumLax set. Return is still viable as a non-recoil STAB attack, however. High Horsepower and Fire Punch both offer useful coverage against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Snorlax's STAB move. High Horsepower is generally preferred over Fire Punch, as it deals more damage against targets weak to both moves like Mega Metagross. High Horsepower is better against Mega Gengar, Tyranitar, and Heatran, whilst Fire Punch is better against Kartana, Celesteela, and Drifblim. Recycle takes advantage of the Defense boosts and helps Snorlax set up multiple Curses.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EVs give Double-Edge a near-guaranteed 2HKO on 236 HP / 116 Def Zapdos without a Curse boost and then maximize its weaker Defense stat. Curselax does not need to run as much Defense investment as DrumLax because of Curse enabling more Attack investment. Minimum Speed is preferred to make Snorlax as slow as possible under Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gluttony and Wiki Berry enable an automatic 50% HP recovery when Snorlax loses half its HP, which can be reactivated with Recycle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snorlax should attempt to sweep mid- to late-game when its threats have been weakened or removed, coming in either after a free switch or on a weak attack like Cresselia's Ice Beam. Afterwards it should usually set up Curse once or twice to boost its stats before attempting to sweep, using Recycle as needed after Wiki Berry has been used to bring it back.</p> </li> <li> <p>This Snorlax requires less team support than Belly Drum Snorlax. However, it still benefits from Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Gothitelle, and Tapu Fini, which protects Snorlax from status with Misty Terrain, in particular burn and poison.

Knock Off OHKOes Aegislash 87% of the time.</p> </li> <li> <p>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 156 Atk / 4 Def / 92 SpD / 4 Spe with a Careful or Sassy nature will always survive Overheat from Mega Charizard Y in the sun. This spread works well to balance more between physical and special defense at the sacrifice of offensive pressure. Scrafty does have access to Foul Play, which would be the recommended Dark-type STAB move for this set to alleviate the weakened offenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty is an excellent choice for Trick Room teams, as the combination of Fake Out, Knock Off, and Fighting coverage can threaten several threats to Trick Room setters such as Aegislash, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. A core of Scrafty, Cresselia, and Stakataka is one of the most reliable ways to ensure Trick Room gets set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stakataka and Scrafty alone form a very reliable and offensive Trick Room duo capable of winning entire games if Trick Room is set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle and Mega Gengar appreciate Scrafty's Intimidate and Fake Out to help weaken and distract the opponent to allow for either Trick Room or Perish Song. Scrafty running Snarl + Gothitelle + Mega Mawile can become an extremely hard core to play against, as the multiple Intimidates and Snarls will make it very difficult for the opponent to KO anything. Eject Button can also be run to allow for two Intimidates in one turn if Scrafty is hit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mega Gardevoir is a great complementary offensive Trick Room setter alongside Scrafty. Mega Gardevoir appreciates Intimidate and strong Fighting-type coverage to handle common Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Stakataka, which prey on Gardevoir's poor physical defense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute users such as Aegislash and Heatran appreciate Scrafty's Fake Out causing a foe to flinch, which provides them the chance to get Substitute up or safely attack a threat late in the game. This also often pairs well on Trick Room teams, as common threats like Hydreigon, Tapu Lele, and Metagross often will lose the matchup to either Aegislash or Heatran coupled with Scrafty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty pairs well with weather setters such as Mega Charizard Y and Pelipper thanks to its ability to counter Tyranitar effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty is naturally not a very offensive Pokemon, and the main set is your strongest and most viable way of utilizing it. Scrafty can be modified to be more defensive if the team calls for it, like shown in the alternate EV spread. Scrafty can fit onto a variety of teams with minimal support, but Scrafty does appreciate the removal of Fairy-type and Flying-type attacks from Pokemon like the island guardians, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, Mega Salamence, Pelipper, Togekiss, Azumarill, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Gothitelle's bulk is above average,  it isn't enough to survive some of the bigger hits Trick Room setters like Cresselia and Porygon2 can take.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle typically only run one attacking move, which leaves it extremely weak to Taunt and being ignored. Gothitelle will not do much damage to Pokemon that aren't weak to Psychic-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul>",

      "Trick Room Trapper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Trick Room is a necessity for Gothitelle to allow its teammates to become the fastest attackers on the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect allows Gothitelle to scout out Z-Moves and stall out Perish Song turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychic or Psyshock prevents Gothitelle from being completely shut down by Taunt and deals significant damage to Pokemon like Amoonguss, which  is often used as a check to Trick Room teams. Psychic does more damage thanks to its higher Base Power, but Psyshock is an option to do more damage to Pokemon like Assault Vest Landorus-T, specially defensive Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Ludicolo.</p> </li> <li> <p>The  fourth slot is open to mainly whatever fits your team best. Helping Hand is great once Trick Room is up, as Gothitelle can help its teammates do large damage. Heal Pulse will help to keep your teammates alive while they attack. Helping Hand is best for teams lacking true offensive power and Heal Pulse helps to keep  offensive power going.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle appreciates the recovery from Aguav Berry, but a Sitrus Berry can be used to survive hits that Aguav won't activate from. For example, the combination of Mega Metagross's Iron Head and Tapu Lele's Moonblast will often KO Gothitelle with Aguav Berry whereas Sitrus Berry will survive with ease. Mental Herb gives Gothitelle the ability to escape Taunt and still get Trick Room up, although Gothitelle will often appreciate recovery more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shadow Tag is a necessity,  as it is the main reason to use Gothitelle over other Trick Room setters.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Sassy nature makes Gothitelle as slow as possible for Trick Room and helps to boost its already good Special Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread allows Gothitelle to survive a rain-boosted Hydro Vortex from Ludicolo and recover enough health with an Aguav Berry to survive any teammate attack from a Pelipper or Politoed. Mega Charizard Y's Overheat will never OHKO under the sun. After Intimidate, Gothitelle will also survive a Tectonic Rage from Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle does have access to the ability Competitive, which would make for a surprise deterrent to Intimidate users, but it is significantly weaker than other Competitive and Defiant users  that do the job much better, like Milotic and Bisharp.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ally Switch and Skill Swap are runner-up to Helping Hand and Heal Pulse for the  fourth slot. Ally Switch can force a lot of mind games but can very quickly become predictable. Skill Swap can allow you to pass the torch for Perish trap teams, passing on Shadow Tag to a healthier teammate to bridge the turns  until Perish Song activates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tickle, Taunt, and Fake Tears are also great move options for the last slot, but in most situations,  Helping Hand and Heal Pulse will be the most reliable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle appreciates the support of Intimidate users or Pokemon that can deal with strong Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, Incineroar, Aegislash, and Mega Gengar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty and Mega Mawile are excellent teammates that fit the bill, but Mega Mawile must be wary of Flamethrower from Hydreigon and Flare Blitz from Incineroar. Bringing the two of these on the same team with Gothitelle will form a really solid core that can spread Intimidate and Snarl to weaken the foes into oblivion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snorlax is another great partner for Gothitelle that can take advantage of a good matchup and set up Belly Drum or several Curses and become untouchable. Snorlax and Gothitelle form a dangerous combination  that can obliterate unprepared teams. Shadow Tag can often trap the opponent in a poor  matchup for them to face a Snorlax, such as with more defensively inclined Pokemon like Zapdos and Suicune on the field, allowing Snorlax to set up and sweep. Be careful with the aforementioned Pokemon, as they can run Roar to phaze out Gothitelle or Snorlax.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle also fits the bill for Perish trap teams where Shadow Tag users are far and few between. Politoed is a great Perish Song user that has relatively decent staying power. Politoed also pairs up well with Mega Mawile, providing rain support to weaken Fire-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>In general, Fake Out users like Scrafty, Incineroar, and Hitmontop all have synergy with Gothitelle. Scrafty and Hitmontop provide Intimidate, and Incineroar can offer a great ability in Intimidate and a strong Fire attack in Flare Blitz to fend off Amoonguss, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko to prevent them from taunting or immobilizing Gothitelle before Trick Room can be set up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle can take most non-super effective Z-Moves and recover back health thanks to its Aguav Berry. Gothitelle's biggest weakness is being ignored while teammates are targeted. It is very important for Gothitelle to provide accurate support, so make sure to analyze the set and change what works best for your team. Gothitelle can provide support on a variety of Trick Room or Perish trap teams.</p> </li> </ul>"

These can be used to survive a non-Terrain-boosted Zen Headbutt from Mega Metagross.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini are minor threats to Amoonguss, as their Terrains make Spore unusable against grounded Pokemon. However, Amoonguss does decent damage to Tapu Fini with both Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain, and it can redirect Electric-type moves from Tapu Koko and easily take them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amoonguss forms a nice duo with Mega Kangaskhan and Tyranitar to defend them against incoming Fighting-type moves they are weak to. In addition to this, Tyranitar can safely set up with Dragon Dance with the assistance of redirection from Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amoonguss is a good lead, as it can be immediately threatening, and you shouldn't be overly concerned about it taking damage early-game, because its recovery tools will allow it to continue supporting its teammates late-game. You don't want to focus too much on recovery, because it is not very good if it remains as your last Pokemon. Sometimes sacrificing Amoonguss is alright if it saves its partner from a strong hit in doing so.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T's high usage has made it the face of Battle Spot Doubles, something most attributable to a level of versatility that allows it to fit on almost any team. The variety of sets Landorus-T can run is one aspect of this, as they're different enough to still catch foes off guard despite Landorus-T's popularity. Access to the universally appreciated Intimidate is just as much of a factor, as the team support it provides synergizes with Landorus-T's pivot playstyle. Specifically, though, Landorus-T stands above other Intimidate users by being the best Ground-type in the metagame. Ground-types are highly favored in Battle Spot Doubles for hitting common foes such as Tapu Koko and Heatran hard as well as for providing great neutral coverage. That said, while Landorus-T is the best Ground-type overall, others can be more situationally appropriate. Excadrill, for example, often works better on dedicated sand teams, as does Mega Swampert under rain. While it's seldom appropriate to have doubts about including Landorus-T on teams, this in itself also paints a target on Landorus-T's back; all competent teams should, and will, have multiple answers to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Tomb deals more damage to a single target than Rock Slide and grants Landorus-T speed control to support its teammates. Stone Edge is another Rock-type alternative. Its inaccuracy makes it inconsistent, but it can notably OHKO bulky Mega Charizard Y and offensive variants of Zapdos. Explosion, while sacrificial, is Landorus-T's strongest attack and works particularly well with a boosting item like Life Orb or Choice Band. Hammer Arm's initial damage is less than Superpower, but it can be used repeatedly without decreasing Attack, and the Speed decreases can be considered a bonus under Trick Room. A special set utilizing Earth Power and Hidden Power Ice is also an option, working especially well on teams that otherwise struggle against opposing Landorus-T. Choice Band can catch foes off guard with a substantial power boost, but being Choice locked with a middling Speed stat can leave Landorus-T quite vulnerable. Focus Sash allows Landorus-T to survive any one move without the need for defensive investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, particularly bulky ones such as Tapu Fini and Suicune, can threaten Landorus-T with their super effective STAB moves, and they frequently make use of Ice Beam or Icy Wind for coverage as well. Milotic is also notable, as its Competitive ability boosts its Special Attack when Landorus-T's Intimidate activates and it is often bulky enough to take multiple Earthquakes, although it's OHKOed by Tectonic Rage after chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While more check than counter against Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T thanks to a Rock Slide weakness, Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Weavile nevertheless have an easy time inflicting lethal damage. Bulky attackers such as Zapdos and Porygon2 can also retaliate with their own Ice-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: As a physical attacker reliant on moves already weakened by spread damage reduction, Landorus-T is quite vulnerable to Intimidate users such as opposing Landorus-T and to Will-O-Wisp users such as Mimikyu.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that use Ice-type moves and are faster than Landorus-T such as Pheromosa and Nihilego check it. Ice Punch Mega Metagross outruns non-Choice Scarf variants and avoids Intimidate with its pre-Mega ability in Clear Body. Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo outpace Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO it with rain-boosted STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Tailwind and Trick Room</strong>: The momentum Landorus-T can gain is often by use of its Speed, so removing that with Tailwind users such as Zapdos and Trick Room users such as Cresselia eliminates this advantage. Bear in mind that these will be less effective against slower variants such as bulky Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Grassy Terrain</strong>: Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain reduces the damage of Landorus-T's Earthquake, neutering the majority of Landorus-T variants. Bear in mind that this reduction doesn't affect Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Celesteela prevent the use of Earthquake and Rock Slide. That said, they, particularly Aegislash, do need to be careful about Tectonic Rage.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's strongest STAB move, sporting good power and perfect accuracy, although it does also hit the partner. Rock Slide completes the SlideQuake combination, primarily hitting Flying-types super effectively, but it is also a means to hit Fire-types without damaging an ally. Its chance to flinch pairs well with Landorus-T's high Speed with Choice Scarf. U-turn hits threats such as Cresselia and provides a means of escaping bad matchups while inflicting chip damage. The increase in the amount of safe switching out Landorus-T can achieve is also valuable for reusing Intimidate. Superpower's high power and great super effective coverage make it valuable against foes such as Mega Kangaskhan and Kartana, and it provides a strong neutral single-target option with which to finish off weakened foes. Knock Off's utility and coverage might be tempting here, but it's not recommended, as it's a poor move to be locked into given its diminished power on the following turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate, Landorus-T's only ability, offers support by dropping the Attack stats of both foes when switched in. Choice Scarf allows Adamant Landorus-T to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame, barring Pheromosa. That said, if outpacing Pheromosa and other foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is desired, a Jolly nature can be used at the cost of damage output. Maximizing Speed EVs may seem excessive, but given how common Landorus-T is, ensuring a Speed tie at worst is often worth it. Since Landorus-T aims to hit as hard and fast as possible, investing all remaining EVs in Attack is fine. The four remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to guarantee survival against Timid Tapu Lele's Psychic. If you prefer more bulk, a spread such as 68 HP / 156 Atk / 4 Def / 100 SpD / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature is an option. This enables Landorus-T to 2HKO bulky Tapu Lele with Earthquake, outrun positive-natured base 130 Speed Pokemon, and survive non-STAB Ice Beam from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Politoed, which commonly run some investment to OHKO uninvested variants of Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to be the backbone of a team by dealing damage before any other Pokemon and constantly switching to reuse Intimidate. It works particularly well in the lead position, as Intimidate is then activated for free, and even in a bad lead matchup, it can simply use U-turn to easily switch out. Be wary of using U-turn on a foe using Protect, though, as this prevents the switch and leaves Landorus-T vulnerable to the defending Pokemon's partner. One situation you'll want to think twice about leading with Landorus-T in is against Competitive or Defiant users such as Milotic and Bisharp, which receive a boost from Intimidate's Attack drop. Don't overly worry about switching into non-lethal attacks, as Choice Scarf Landorus-T's high Speed will often leave it unthreatened even after injury. Finally, if all else fails, remember that Rock Slide has a 51% chance of making at least one foe flinch and therefore makes a good last resort.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Utilizing one of the Guardian Deities not named Tapu Bulu is recommended to remove Grassy Terrain, which reduces Earthquake's damage. Tapu Fini is a fine option, as it threatens opposing Landorus-T with its Water-type STAB moves, a trait shared with other Water-types such as Suicune. Another option is Tapu Koko, which, among other Electric-types such as Zapdos, can scare problematic Water- and Flying-type foes. Maximizing the number of airborne partners on the team by using allies such as Cresselia and Mega Charizard Y is useful to allow the free use of Earthquake without Protect; this is particularly valuable given Landorus-T's tendency to be Choice locked into Earthquake. Furthermore, Cresselia's access to Ice Beam and Icy Wind presents another means of eliminating opposing Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is also notable for threatening Grass-types resist Ground. Its Drought weakening the STAB moves of Water-type attackers and allowing the instant use of Solar Beam is as much of a boon. Grass-types of your own such as Rage Powder Amoonguss and Ferrothorn can also prove effective in stopping threatening Water-types thanks to redirection and a powerful STAB move in Power Whip, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "3 Attacks + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake's excellent spread damage makes it a staple of this set and enables the use of Tectonic Rage with Groundium Z. Rock Slide notably hits Ground-immune Flying-types and grants a spread attack that leaves allies unharmed. U-turn hits Grass-types and common foes such as Cresselia super effectively, but it is largely used to pivot out of bad scenarios and make Intimidate available next turn. Superpower's main use is to hit common foes such as Mega Kangaskhan, Shuca Berry Heatran, and Tyranitar. Knock Off can remove items from foes, which is particularly potent against Berry users such as Snorlax, though it also helps deal with foes such as Cresselia and Wide Guard Aegislash. Protect allows Landorus-T to shield itself to punish double targets and safely stall out undesirable field conditions. It being so uncommon on Landorus-T makes it especially strong, as foes will rarely play around it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Groundium Z transforms Earthquake into Tectonic Rage, dealing more than double the damage to a single target. Life Orb's consistent power boost is a good alternative if you have many Z-Crystal users on the team as is. Intimidate is a great ability, as it provides support by dropping both foes' Attack stats when Landorus-T is switched in. Jolly is often the better choice of nature, as it allows Landorus-T to outspeed foes such as neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, Arcanine, and Jolly Gyarados. That said, an Adamant nature can be situationally important for OHKOs such as with Tectonic Rage on Mega Kangaskhan. The set's aim is to outrun and deal as much damage to as many foes as possible, so EVs of 252 Atk / 252 Spe are recommended.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions less as a pivot and instead aims to capitalize on Choice Scarf's popularity by picking up surprise KOs. Foes lacking Protect such as Mega Kangaskhan make good targets for this, as do unsuspecting Shuca Berry Heatran. Landorus-T works well as a lead, as leading makes a great opportunity to activate Intimidate and gain early momentum. Be wary of Competitive and Defiant users such as Milotic and Bisharp from Team Preview, though, to avoid boosting their offensive stats. Once the battle begins, Landorus-T's goal is largely to use its spread attacks in Earthquake and Rock Slide until a foe is in KO range of its stronger single-target moves in Tectonic Rage and Superpower. In general, you should avoid switching Landorus-T directly into attacks, as this set lacks the speed of Choice Scarf variants and the added bulk of Assault Vest variants, although Intimidate's value will sometimes outweigh this factor. Take advantage of this being the only set that uses Protect; you'll occassionally want to save it against unsuspecting opponents until a pivotal moment, but bear in mind that Intimidate's ability prompt may give this away early.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Earthquake is weakened by Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain, so using other Guardian Deities is wise in order to expel it. Tapu Fini accomplishes this and, like other Water-types such as Suicune, can deal with opposing Landorus-T. Tapu Koko is another option and, akin to Electric-types such as Zapdos, grants an offensive check to Water-types. As this set lacks Choice Scarf's Speed boost, speed control from Pokemon such as Tailwind Zapdos and Icy Wind Cresselia can be valuable to offset this. These Pokemon also join Mega Charizard Y as great examples of airborne allies that are immune to Earthquake. Mega Charizard Y also deals with the common Wide Guard Aegislash and weakens Water-types with Drought. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Kartana provide a more direct response to Water-types.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's main means of offense, dealing good spread damage albeit targeting the partner. Rock Slide usefully harms Flying-types that are immune to Ground and is a spread attack that doesn't harm allies. Superpower has great super effective coverage, hitting common foes such as Mega Kangaskhan and Tyranitar. U-turn allows Landorus-T to pivot out of bad matchups, such as against Cresselia, and activate Intimidate later in the match. Knock Off has utility in removing items and hits potentially problematic foes such as Aegislash and Metagross hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest supports Landorus-T's role as a pivot by raising Special Defense, allowing it to switch into attacks more easily. Intimidate complements Assault Vest by allowing Landorus-T to take attacks well on both fronts. Jolly is generally the preferred nature for outpacing foes such as base 100 Speed Pokemon and Hydreigon, but an Adamant nature offers more damage if Speed is less important. While simple EVs may seem odd with Assault Vest, Landorus-T's natural bulk means further investment isn't strictly needed. That said, a spread such as 148 HP / 124 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 228 Spe with a Jolly nature is an option to ensure victory against Mega Charizard Y. It does so by allowing Landorus-T to outspeed and KO Modest Mega Charizard Y and survive Timid Mega Charizard Y's Overheat. This is in addition to OHKOing Tapu Koko with Earthquake and taking two of Jolly Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Araquanid's Liquidation with Intimidate. This set's bulk makes it most able to drop Speed EVs, so take advantage of this if you don't find the Speed as necessary, for example, on a Trick Room team, and prefer more bulk. For instance, dropping to 148 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature still lets Landorus-T outrun Modest Heatran, while zero EVs can be used to maximize bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Landorus-T works well at all game stages, but especially so as a lead thanks to Intimidate and access to U-turn. Using this set well is a balance of dealing maximum spread damage and keeping it available as a switch-in to attacks; most of that shouldn't be a problem, but since Landorus-T lacks recovery, severe blows may impede its ability to maintain a presence late-game. Strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y are the main culprits in regards to dealing more damage than is comfortable. Opponents will expect the more common Choice Scarf set, so maintaining that bluff until a critical moment can be valuable to catch your opponent off guard. Bear in mind that using U-turn on a foe using Protect prevents a switch and leaves Landorus-T vulnerable to the defending Pokemon's partner; if this risks excessive damage, it may be better to manually switch. Against potential Wide Guard users, it's often better to not risk momentum loss and use a move from either the third or fourth moveslots.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Make use of a Guardian Deity not named Tapu Bulu to prevent Grassy Terrain from reducing the damage of Earthquake. Tapu Koko is great for this, since it can also check Water-types and use Taunt to stop speed control and Wide Guard. Zapdos and Thundurus-T are other Electric-type options and have the benefit that they're immune to Earthquake use. While airborne partners like the aforementioned are less crucial to this set because it can switch moves freely, they're nonetheless a bonus. Grass-types like Rage Powder Amoonguss and Ferrothorn can also check Water-types; the former is particularly useful through redirecting their moves. Ferrothorn also joins other Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross in checking threatening Ice-types. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran likewise check Ice-types, in addition to Wide Guard Aegislash. Mega Charizard Y, along with Cresselia and Hydreigon, is yet another example of a partner that is safe to use with Earthquake.</p>"

It can also provide speed control for its team with Tailwind or set up with moves like Swords Dance and Substitute, both of which put a great deal of pressure on the opposing Pokemon. Unfortunately, Kartana's paper-thin Special Defense will leave it easily OHKOed by even weak special attacks such as Porygon2's boosted Ice Beam or Mega Salamence's Hyper Voice. Additionally, Kartana also struggles with Fire-types like the commonplace Incineroar and Charizard, as well as Flying-types like Zapdos and Mega Salamence, which it cannot hit hard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<p>Leaf Blade is Kartana's primary STAB move, as it hits several Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Politoed for super effective damage and does considerable damage to neutral targets like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele. Sacred Sword hits Pokemon like Porygon2, Mega Kangaskhan, and Snorlax for massive damage while also ignoring Defense and evasion stat changes. Combined with Focus Sash, Kartana can usually push out a Tailwind early-game to gain the Speed advantage for the party, or as a last ditch effort while it hangs on with 1 HP. Swords Dance is an alternative to Tailwind that lets Kartana become an unstoppable offensive threat if left unattended for too long. Detect helps preserve Kartana or bait foes when it's barely hanging on, and it bypasses Imprison users running Protect. Focus Sash lets Kartana focus all of its EVs in Attack and Speed.</p> <p>Focus Sash Kartana pairs up well with Mega Charizard Y. Kartana’s coverage allows it to cut down Pokemon like Tyranitar and Politoed, which pose a threat to Mega Charizard Y as well as the sun it brings. Tailwind also allows for the two to outrun foes like Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Landorus-T to sweep with powerful physical and special attacks. Kartana also pairs well with Tapu Fini and Incineroar, as these two are strong switch-ins to make up for its weaknesses, as well as providing it Fake Out and Misty Terrain.

Sacred Sword lets Kartana hit Normal-types and Steel-types for more damage than Leaf Blade, and All-Out Pummeling with Fightinium Z lets it break through some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the format like Snorlax, Porygon2, Incineroar, and Heatran, which can all withstand several Sacred Swords. Substitute allows Kartana to preserve itself and take hits it would never realistically survive. Substitute also has the added benefit of blocking Intimidate. Swords Dance similarly lets Kartana counteract Intimidate and snowball through teams unmatched.

All three of these third-moveslot moves allow Kartana to capitalize on positions where its offensive pressure forces the opponent to play safely. Detect shields Kartana from any unfavorable attacks that might OHKO it; however, the given EV spread lets Kartana survive some of the format’s strongest special attacks like Tapu Lele Psychic and Life Orb Tapu Koko Thunderbolt. It can also withstand Gigavolt Havoc from Tapu Koko with Electric Terrain removed.</p> <p>Z-Move Kartana prefers partners that it can clear paths for, or that help it set up. Incineroar and Tapu Fini provide valuable Fake Out for setup and bulky switch-ins for the frail Kartana. Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos also make good partners, as they can use strong Electric-type attacks to help put Pokemon like Incineroar and Tapu Fini in range for Kartana to pick off, as well as helping defeat Mega Charizard Y. Mega Gengar is a superb partner, as Shadow Tag lets Kartana easily pick off trapped foes, and it can assist Kartana with strong special attacks, high Speed, and support moves like Icy Wind. Mega Kangaskhan lets Kartana set up with Fake Out, and the two can push through teams together with powerful physical attacks.</p>"

      "Bulky Berry": {
        "description": "<p>Leaf Blade is Kartana's main attack, as it is powerful and reliable. Sacred Sword lets Kartana hit Steel-types like Stakataka and Bisharp, as well as bulkier targets like Incineroar. Tailwind lets Kartana boost its Speed considerably, as this set is only built to outrun 252 Speed Landorus-T. Substitute gives Kartana a strong option to preserve itself and more chances to activate its Aguav Berry, since its HP is divisible by four. Detect lets Kartana also preserves it, as well as helping it take most Z-Moves, which other sets cannot shrug off as easily even with a quarter of the initial power. The given bulky EV spread helps Kartana pave through foes at a slower pace. While slowing it, the Adamant nature lets it keep up with 252 Attack Kartana, and bulk investment lets it survive what no other Kartana can, like Mega Gengar Shadow Ball and Tapu Koko Gigavolt Havoc in Electric Terrain. Aguav Berry's longevity complements this the slow pace of this set perfectly to boot.</p> <p>Due to this Kartana's lacking Speed investment, it often prefers to be paired with speedy Pokemon. Mega Gengar and Choice Scarf Landorus-T make fast, strong partners that help Kartana with their abilities as well, allowing it to survive longer and push out more attacks. Tapu Koko and Nihilego are fast and also can pressure threats like Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos that outspeed Kartana with Z-Move OHKOs.</p>"

Sludge Bomb is the main attacking move, while the options in the third move slot cover foes that resist it. Flamethrower is often preferred, although Hidden Power Ground covers Heatran. Focus Sash ensures Tailwind can be used when against Choice Scarf users, and guarantees Naganadel a hit afterwards. Life Orb and Poisonium Z give Naganadel the ability to OHKO Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele respectively. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan help provide the opportunity to use Tailwind. Mega Charizard Y appreciates the removal of the Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko and benefits greatly from Tailwind.</p>"}},

In the fourth moveslot, Wide Guard can replace Protect to shield against Earthquake and defend partners such as Mega Charizard Y from Rock Slide. A Lonely nature and 17 Defense IVs ensure Beast Boost increases Attack when a foe is KOed, although Brave and maximum Defense IVs are an option if you’d prefer a chance of survival against attacks such as Landorus-T’s Earthquake and Tyranitar’s Low Kick. Cresselia is recommended as a secondary Trick Room setter on hard Trick Room teams, as it can set Trick Room in the face of Fighting- and Ground-type moves from foes such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan.</p>"}},

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Blacephalon is among the fastest usable Fire-types in VGC, and its access to Beast Boost and Heat Wave can allow it to sweep through weakened teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blacephalon has enough Special Attack to deal serious damage, even before a Beast Boost</p> </li> <li> <p>Ghost is a good secondary offensive typing that allows Blacephalon to hit Cresselia and Tapu Lele hard and avoid Fake Out, with the exception of Scrappy Kangaskhan's Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blacephalon's defenses are pathetic, with most strong neutral hits at least 2HKOing it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blacephalon has a poor offensive movepool that mostly limits it to Fire- and Ghost-type coverage in addition to a Hidden Power, so it'll almost always be walled by something.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blacephalon becomes much easier to handle when rain is up, which is fairly common in VGC.</p> </li> </ul>",

Mind Blown may be tempting, but it's extremely awkward to be locked into, since it 2HKOes Blacephalon and hits your teammate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shadow Ball is Blacephalon's strongest Ghost-type attack, 2HKOing offensive Cresselia and being Blacephalon's strongest attack in the rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hidden Power Ice is hard to pass up, since it OHKOes offensive Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Hidden Power Ground can be used to severely damage Heatran, but the move doesn't take advantage of Choice Scarf as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blacephalon will need a single target Fire-type attack to deal with Wide Guard. Flamethrower is the most reliable option, OHKOing Mega Metagross, but Fire Blast offers extreme power at the cost of accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Blacephalon can be used early-game to pressure certain leads, it often works best late-game where it can use Heat Wave to clean weakened teams or get a reliable Beast Boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pairing Blacephalon with sun support is a good idea, making its Fire-type STAB moves extremely powerful and Water-types more manageable. Mega Charizard Y is an easy option for this due to Drought, but manual users of Sunny Day such as Cresselia and Whimsicott can also work to surprise rain teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tapu Lele is another teammate to consider, since its Psychic Terrain blocks deadly Sucker Punches from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, and it can scout for leading Choice Scarf Landorus-T for Blacephalon to target.</p> </li> </ul>"

Flamethrower can also be used as a back-up Fire-type attack if Wide Guard is in play from the likes of Celesteela or Aegislash, while Overheat is a more powerful option for use with Firium Z.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect allows Blacephalon to take advantage of its tendency to become the target of attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ghostium Z allows Blacephalon to OHKO offensive Cresselia, and deal 81% minimum to specially defensive Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p>Life Orb is a reliable item for dealing extra damage, at the cost of the recoil making Blacephalon more vulnerable to weak priority attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Firium Z is also an acceptable option, especially if Overheat or Mind Blown is chosen as a secondary Fire-type attack, since Inferno Overdrive from these base moves will OHKO Mega Kangaskhan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Speed control of some sort is highly recommended for Blacephalon, since this helps it deal with common speedy Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Tailwind is a prime example of this, with plenty of possible users such as Mega Charizard Y, Suicune, and Mega Salamence. Icy Wind from the likes of Cresselia and Tapu Fini can also be useful.</p> </li> </ul>"
