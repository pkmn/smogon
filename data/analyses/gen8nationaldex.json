        "description": "<p>As a Psychic / Fighting wallbreaker, Mega Gallade often draws comparison to Mega Medicham. Although Mega Medicham has more immediate power, Mega Gallade's access to Swords Dance, a higher Speed tier, and Knock Off differentiate it enough to give it a niche. Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to clean up easier in the late game, when checks such as defensive Landorus-T are weakened into Zen Headbutt range. Knock Off can be used to threaten Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Slowking and cripple Pokemon that rely on their item, such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Moltres. Ice Punch can be used to revenge kill Garchomp as well as nailing Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Landorus-T. It is important to note that upon Mega Evolving, Mega Gallade gains Inner Focus, protecting it from Landorus-T's Intimidate. Justified is the chosen ability prior to Mega Evolving to get an Attack boost by absorbing a weak Knock Off from Tangrowth or Toxapex. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Mega Gallade to outspeed Kartana and Garchomp as well as Speed tying Mega Latias and threatening the aforementioned Pokemon with an OHKO.</p> <p>Quite possibly the best partner for Mega Gallade is Tapu Lele, as it appreciate Mega Gallade's ability to break through Corviknight, Slowking, and Heatran, and it provides Psychic Terrain to boost the power of Mega Gallade's Zen Headbutt, allowing it to break through Clefable. Other teammates that appreciate Mega Gallade's ability to pressure Corviknight, Slowbro, and Heatran include Garchomp, Volcarona, and Serperior. Additionally, solid checks to Fairy-types are appreciated, such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi. Jirachi is an especially great teammate, as its Healing Wish gives Mega Gallade a second opportunity to sweep. Solid entry hazard removal is also mandatory to give Mega Gallade more longevity, so Defoggers such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and Rotom-W pair well. Mega Gallade also appreciates Tyranitar and Weavile's ability to threaten Zapdos and trap Psychic-types.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur is a decent defensive check to a number of prominent offensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Mega Mawile, Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Kartana lacking Normalium Z. Thick Fat separates Mega Venusaur from other defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, as it isn't immediately forced out by Ice- and Fire-types like Heatran, Kyurem, and Weavile. However, that's where Mega Venusaur's strengths end. Mega Venusaur's lack of consistent long term recovery, extreme four-moveslot syndrome, and susceptibility to entry hazards accentuate how easy it is to wear down quickly. Other defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth both provide more for teams and are much more consistent in the long run. Tangrowth's Regenerator makes it less burdened by entry hazards and gives it more longevity than Mega Venusaur, while its better typing and freedom in its moveslots allow it to dually check Ground-types and also fit utility moves such as Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Knock Off more easily. Ferrothorn also has a myriad of utility options such as Spikes, Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Knock Off which it can easily fit while also utilizing its Steel typing to better check threats such as Tapu Lele and Mega Tyranitar. Mega Venusaur struggles to shine offensively with such tough competition from Kartana and Serperior; its low Speed and lack of threatening presence hold it back even further. All of these Pokemon can also hold an item to assist them in either defensively checking or offensively threatening foes, making Mega Venusaur generally a worse choice on a team compared to its competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Solar Beam can be used instead of Giga Drain due to its much higher power; however, it is generally an inferior option, as Venusaur never really needs the extra power, and the extra longevity and usability out of sun with Giga Drain is usually preferred. Furthermore, it also worsens Venusaur's matchup against opposing weather as it doesnt provide immediate pressure, and leaves Venusaur in a bad spot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Weather setters such as Pelipper, Alolan Ninetales, and Tyranitar can change the weather, thus removing Venusaur's Speed boost and halving the efficiency of its Growth. This renders Venusaur much less threatening as a result and causes it to get outsped by other weather sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Arctozolt, and Excadrill; however, neither Alolan Ninetales nor Tyranitar want to switch into Venusaur, as they can get KOed or take significant damage, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Heatran, Volcarona, and Victini can all threaten out Venusaur with their STAB options, but all of them fear switching into a boosted Earth Power. The likes of Mega Diancie and Clefable can deter Venusaur from freely switching in with their Fire-type coverage; however, they are both forced out by it normally.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mega Latias counters nearly all Venusaur sets, as Venusaur can't do enough damage even with a Growth Boost; however, it does fold to the rare Poisonium Z sets. Other Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Mega Latios, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele all force out Venusaur, but they all fold to a boosted Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Weavile and Kyurem are consistently able to force Venusaur out, with the former boasting a strong Ice Shard to revenge kill a weakened Venusaur in sun, and the latter is bulky enough to take a hit. Ice-type coverage options from the likes of Mega Lopunny, Clefable, and Greninja all pressure Venusaur out.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats such as Unburden Hawlucha, Choice Scarf Greninja, as well as priority from the likes of Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Mawile can all revenge kill Venusaur under the sun; however, they cant switch in.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to force out Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior as well as threaten status on switch-ins such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, making Mega Venusaur more annoying to switch into. Sludge Bomb also lets it threaten Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini, forcing them out. Earth Power lets Mega Venusaur threaten Steel- and Fire-types such as Heatran, Victini, and Mega Mawile while pressuring Toxapex. Hidden Power Fire lets Mega Venusaur nail Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and pressure Skarmory. Leech Seed is another option that lets Mega Venusaur chip down its switch-ins like Zapdos, Mega Scizor, and Mega Latias and provide additional recovery, although it means it is easily taken advantage of by the aforementioned Hidden Power Fire targets. The given EV spread allows Mega Venusaur to outspeed Mega Mawile and avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes, with the rest in Defense to maximise its capability to check the likes of Mega Mawile and Kartana. Defog users such as Tapu Fini, Gliscor, and Corviknight are solid partners, as they help alleviate Mega Venusaur's susceptibility to entry hazards and form a strong defensive backbone alongside it. Wish support from Clefable in particular is extremely useful to help make up for Mega Venusaur's lack of consistent recovery. Mega Venusaur is a mediocre Pokemon that fits in very specific teams and needs a lot of support to perform well, making it a lackluster choice most of the time.</p>"

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll doubling its Speed under the sun and making it faster than every unboosted Pokemon in the NatDex metagame, Venusaur is a staple on dedicated sun teams. Thanks to Growth giving a +2 boost under the sun, it allows Venusaur to quickly power up and threaten opposing teams. However, Venusaur struggles to hit everything it wants due to needing both Sludge Bomb for Unaware Clefable and Mega Latios and Weather Ball for Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its lack of immediate power, middling bulk, and reliance on the sun make it an inconsistent and one dimensional sweeper. Giga Drain is Venusaur's main STAB option thanks to the recovery letting Venusaur stay healthy in spite of Life Orb chip damage and other hits while also allowing it to beat Chansey and Blissey more comfortably. Earth Power hits one of the biggest threats to sun in Heatran, as well as Galarian Slowking, which otherwise walls Venusaur. Weather Ball is the primary option due to it allowing Venusaur to blast through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which otherwise wall it. Sludge Bomb can also be run, as it provides a much stronger STAB option that allows Venusaur to break through Mega Latios and Unaware Clefable, but it is generally an inferior option due to it rendering Venusaur unable to break past certain Steel-types. Poisonium Z can also be used in place of Life Orb to allow Venusaur to break past Mega Latias, which its sun teammates like Blaziken and Victini really appreciate, but this sacrifices the overall power it gets from Life Orb. A Modest nature is used because the extra power is needed to secure crucial KOes on Pokemon like Mega Latios, as well as consistently beating Chansey and Blissey, and the Speed increase from a Timid Nature is generally unneeded and is only useful for Choice Scarf Greninja.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on dedicated sun teams due to its reliance on sun to function effectively. Thus, Torkoal is a needed partner alongside Venusaur, as it's able to set sun and provide Stealth Rock to help Venusaur clean better. Furthermore, Torkoal also checks the Steel-types that non-Weather Ball Venusaur is unable to break through. Fire- resistant Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Garchomp are also great partners alongside Venusaur due to them checking the likes of Heatran and Volcarona, which are often an issue for sun teams as a whole, and they appreciate Venusaur eliminating Unaware Clefable for them. Pokemon such as Victini, Heatran, and Blaziken are stellar partners for Venusaur, as they can punch holes in the opposing team for Venusaur to clean late game. Lastly, naturally fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T make up for Venusaur's low Speed stat outside of sun, and can also clean weakened teams.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Mega Charizard Y</h4> <p>Weather Ball is an interesting STAB move option, as it has slightly higher Base Power than Flamethrower and smacks Pelipper even in rain, although it's usually not worth the opportunity cost of not having a STAB move in rain or sand. Defog is an option, as Mega Charizard Y has a good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, but its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with it losing to hazard setters like Garchomp makes it an unreliable Defogger. It also dislikes giving up an important moveslot for it.</p> <h4>Mega Charizard X</h4> <p>On more offensive teams that do not require Mega Charizard X's longevity and defensive utility, you can remove Roost and use both Dragon Claw and Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Mega Charizard Y</h4> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock halves Mega Charizard Y's health, severely limiting its ability to switch in and wallbreak. To add insult to injury, some Stealth Rock setters can even set the hazard up in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are near impossible for Mega Charizard Y to break through due to their massive special bulk, and they can then proceed to either status it or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Mega Latios, Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Garchomp are tough for Mega Charizard Y to deal with due to their resistance to Fire and Grass. The former two are particularly difficult to deal with due to their good bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are huge threats to Mega Charizard Y, as they can switch in and override sun with sand to weaken its STAB move and force Solar Beam to charge, and they then proceed to either KO it with their Rock-type moves or damage it as it tries to switch out with Pursuit. However, they must watch out for Scorching Sands burns and the rare Focus Blast. Pelipper is similarly dangerous, as it can switch in on Mega Charizard Y, override sun with rain, and proceed to either KO it with its Water-type moves or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex resists Fire while not being weak to Solar Beam, letting it check Mega Charizard Y well although Scorching Sands and Future Sight support threaten it to a degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp can revenge kill Mega Charizard Y; however, they, with the exception of Garchomp, cannot switch in on it at all.</p> <h4>Mega Charizard X</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can take Mega Charizard X's STAB moves with ease and pressure it with their own STAB moves, but they must watch out for the rare Thunder Punch and, in Toxapex's case, Earthquake. Toxapex can also be 2HKOed by +1 Dragon Claw into Earthquake, while Tapu Fini is 2HKOed by +1 Flare Blitz after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T can weaken Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and threaten it with Earthquake, forcing it to switch. Hippowdon can switch in and force Mega Charizard X out with Earthquake or phaze it, removing its boosts. However, offensive variants of Landorus-T can be OHKOed by Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock, while defensive variants can be easily worn down due to their lack of recovery. Gliscor can also tank one boosted Flare Blitz if it is at full health and KO back with Earthquake in combination with recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Mega Diancie can switch in and KO Mega Charizard X with their Rock-type STAB moves, but they have to be careful about Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving makes it difficult to switch in, and, after Mega Evolving, it gets crippled by all entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage and Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and Heatran reduce Mega Charizard X's longevity, making it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and Flare Blitz do the same. However, these Pokemon cannot switch in on Mega Charizard X's attacks, with the exception of Garchomp if is not running Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Outs, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T can revenge kill Mega Charizard X if it gets chipped enough, but they cannot come in safely against its attacks and are outsped after a Dragon Dance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker in National Dex because of its sky high Special Attack stat, great ability in Drought, and passable Speed tier that lets it threaten much of the metagame. Drought sets Mega Charizard Y apart by boosting its Fire-type moves, weakening Water-type moves, ands also letting it use Solar Beam effectively, which makes it a Fire-type that is able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowking. Mega Charizard Y's typing and access to Roost let it check Pokemon like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor reliably throughout a game . Flamethrower has perfect accuracy and high PP, but Fire Blast has explosive power, easily OHKOing Landorus-T and possibly Zapdos as well as 2HKOing offensive Garchomp. Solar Beam complements Mega Charizard Y's STAB move well, severely denting bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro that may try to switch in on Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scorching Sands rounds off its coverage by OHKOing offensive Heatran while also 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and its burn chance can ruin Tyranitar. Focus Blast is an option to replace Scorching Sands, notably hitting Tyranitar extremely hard while retaining the ability to smack Heatran. However, it has terrible accuracy and it also leaves Mega Charizard Y completely helpless against Toxapex without Future Sight support, so it is generally not advised. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off residual damage and check Pokemon like Rillaboom throughout the game. A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y absolutely hates Stealth Rock, as its health is halved by it, so good Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Synthesis Kartana are absolutely mandatory partners for it. Blissey and Chansey are also huge thorns in Mega Charizard Y's side, as it cannot 2HKO them due to their massive special bulk, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kartana that can take advantage of them are good partners. Heatran is also a good choice to trap and remove them. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Aegislash can greatly pressure Mega Latias, which can potentially use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder, and also force damage onto Blissey. Mega Charizard Y struggles with Toxapex, especially if running Focus Blast, so Slowbro and Slowking can pressure it with Future Sight and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Heatran can beat it directly. Due to Mega Charizard Y's only passable Speed tier, it is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, so pivots like the aforementioned Slowbro and Blissey can both switch in on these Pokemon and give it free switches via slow pivoting. Similarly, faster pivots like Tapu Koko can lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn that give Mega Charizard Y free turns while also helping wear down their shared checks, like Blissey. Due to how prolific Mega Charizard Y is as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaners Kartana make good partners for it, as it can break through their checks like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp helps force damage onto Mega Charizard Y's checks, mainly Toxapex, as it can 2HKO it with Scorching Sands after Stealth Rock.</p>"

Its typing lets it switch in on and force out common Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Rillaboom, granting it setup opportunities. Flare Blitz deals serious damage to common Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Dragon Claw is preferable in the second moveslot to not be walled by other Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. However, this leaves it walled by Heatran and more easily checked by Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides a way to hit Toxapex, and Steel-types weak to it such as Excadrill and Magnezone without taking recoil from Flare Blitz, while also OHKOing Heatran and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance and 2HKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch could be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Pelipper more effectively, but it gives worse neutral coverage. Roost recovers HP lost from Flare Blitz recoil and residual damage, letting Mega Charizard X check Grass-types like Rillaboom more easily. A Jolly nature is better to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Hydreigon and Kyurem.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X functions as a early- or mid-game wallbreaker that can take advantage of Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which benefits Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Tapu Koko. In return, they can pressure some of its checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Due to Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are mandatory partners. Tapu Fini can also protect Mega Charizard X from status through Misty Terrain, giving it more opportunities to setup Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Clefable, and Gliscor chip some of boosted Mega Charizard X's answers; offensive Landorus-T turns from a decent check to a likely OHKO, Toxapex becomes a likely 2HKO, and Tapu Fini becomes a guaranteed 2HKO. Garchomp can also break through Landorus-T and Gliscor with its Z-Move to help Mega Charizard X sweep. Due to its Ground weakness after Mega Evolving, checks to Ground-types like Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Corviknight make good teammates, with the latter also providing Defog support and Rillaboom pressuring common checks like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro. It's important to note that Rillaboom's and Tapu Fini's terrains make Earthquake and Dragon Claw too weak to use, respectively.</p>"

Calm Mind makes it an extremely potent Pokemon against bulky teams that do not have a way of preventing it from setting up freely. Thunder is largely preferred over Thunderbolt because of its extremely high paralysis chance, letting Clefable cripple Pokemon such as Heatran, and its ability to easily 2HKO Toxapex without any Calm Mind boosts.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Nasty Plot alongside Blizzard and Moonblast turns Alolan Ninetales into an offensive threat. However, it's typically not worth forgoing the defensive utility to run this set, as it still cannot break through threats like Mega Scizor, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking, and hail teams usually pack more than enough offensive pressure. A set dedicated to setting Aurora Veil can be used on hyper offense teams, as Alolan Ninetales can provide immediate dual screens support unlike other Pokemon, which have to set Light Screen and Reflect separately, but it is generally a much worse dual screens setter than Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl, as it has no way to prevent Defog. Hypnosis is another option to punish switch-ins and provide opportunities for teammates to switch in for free, but it is highly inconsistent, and forgoing another support option is usually not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales is unable to threaten Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Corviknight out, and all of them either use it as setup fodder or threaten a heavy hit on whatever switches in. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's passivity and set up entry hazards on it, while Corviknight can use it to generate momentum, bringing another Pokemon in for free.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Volcarona, and others easily threaten Alolan Ninetales out with their STAB moves and use it as setup fodder due to its inability to hit them back. In particular, Mega Charizard Y is an extremely strong check, as it also replaces hail and prevents Alolan Ninetales from setting Aurora Veil.</p> <p><strong>Mega Tyranitar and Tyranitar</strong> Both Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar have immense special bulk under Sand and underspeed Alolan Ninetales, so they will always win the weather war and threaten it out with a Stone Edge. If Alolan Ninetales switches out, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap it, cutting deeply into its HP.</p>",

      "Hail Setter": {
        "description": "<p>Alolan Ninetales is the tier's only viable Hail setter, functioning as a strong support member on Hail teams while providing a solid resistance to Dark to help with Ash-Greninja. It can set hail throughout the game because of its respectable Speed tier that lets it outspeed the likes of Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T and its good support movepool that consists of options such as Pain Split and Aurora Veil. However, Alolan Ninetales is extremely weak and has terrible bulk, which is further exacerbated by its horrid Stealth Rock weakness. Furthermore, its extreme passivity allows threats such as Mega Medicham and Heatran to switch in for free. Aurora Veil allows Alolan Ninetales to provide increased opportunities to switch in for teammates like Arctozolt, as well as let partners like Volcanion and Corviknight more comfortably check threats such as Heatran and Mega Medicham. Pain Split serves the dual purpose of providing Alolan Ninetales with a form of recovery to aid its poor longevity so that it can more consistently provide Hail support and wearing down bulkier teams due to its low HP stat. Encore prevents threats like Mega Latias and Clefable from taking advantage of its passivity, as well as letting teammates like Arctozolt, Volcanion, and Mega Diancie switch in unpunished. Freeze-Dry is a solid STAB option that allows Alolan Ninetales to threaten Ground- and Water-types and prevent the likes of Gastrodon, Pelipper, and Gliscor from completely taking advantage of it. It also allows you to win the weather war against Pelipper and generally pressure rain teams hard.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales works best on hail teams, so Arctozolt is its premier partner, as it can make use of the hail to annihilate unprepared teams. Arctozolt also appreciates Alolan Ninetales luring and weakening Gastrodon for it, as well as providing safer opportunities to switch in through Encore and Aurora Veil. Due to its susceptibility to being taken advantage of by Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Mega Scizor, strong Fire- and Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Volcanion, and Heatran are solid partners. Volcanion in particular checks Ash-Greninja together with Alolan Ninetales thanks to its immunity to Water. Finally, Alolan Ninetales's severe weakness to Stealth Rock basically mandates extremely strong entry hazard control. As such, Pokemon like Corviknight and Mega Diancie work really well with it.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam may use Recover over Shadow Ball, which gives it a lot of longevity, but it loses its ability to hit its most important targets in Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and Mega Latias. Alakazam can utilize Counter with Focus Sash to punish faster Pokemon and priority users such as Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Victini.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Alakazam's horrible defenses, it is very vulnerable to priority moves from the likes of Rillaboom, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor; however, they cannot revenge kill Alakazam if it still has its Focus Sash intact. Rillaboom in particular can remove Psychic Terrain for its own terrain, allowing it to use its priority without struggle, but it doesn't want to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Alakazam naturally, such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny, can be huge roadblocks for it. Mega Lopunny in particular is a terrible matchup for Alakazam, as it can break Focus Sash with Fake Out before finishing it off.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Alakazam is extremely crippled by paralysis, as it makes it even easier to overwhelm and revenge kill; as such, Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Serperior and Clefable can be annoying for it. However, none of them want to switch in, especially after Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While most Steel-types are threatened by Focus Blast, ones that are not such as Mega Scizor and Jirachi can be a pain for Alakazam to handle. Either listed Steel-type can often outspeed it with priority or a Choice Scarf, respectively, and knock it out. However, while Mega Scizor can handle Alakazam's moves fine, Jirachi cannot switch into Shadow Ball.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Alakazam stands as a potent setup sweeper due to its high Speed, coverage options, access to Nasty Plot, and amazing ability in Magic Guard. However, it is a very niche pick due to its extreme frailty, which leaves it helpless against Choice Scarf users, priority, and faster Pokemon once its Focus Sash is broken. Its frailty also means it cannot switch in at all without taking a large amount of damage. Psychic can overwhelm Pokemon that Psyshock cannot, such as Clefable, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; however, Psyshock can be used over it to more consistently deal with Blissey and Chansey. Focus Blast allows Alakazam to blow past Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Corviknight, and especially Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar, which can otherwise wall it and Pursuit trap it. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon that resist the other two moves, most notably Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and Mega Latias. Focus Sash lets Alakazam more easily set up and revenge kill faster Pokemon or priority users, which would otherwise KO Alakazam due to its frailty, and it cannot be broken by entry hazards or weather chip damage due to Magic Guard. However, Life Orb can be used over Focus Sash to more easily overwhelm Pokemon such as Clefable, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor; however, this set is very susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> <p>Alakazam fits primarily on bulky offense teams, as its high Speed and great Special Attack allow it to sweep late-game for those teams. Mega Tyranitar is a great partner for Alakazam, as it can Pursuit trap Slowking, Aegislash, and Mega Latias, which can all break Alakazam's Focus Sash, leaving it unable to revenge kill Pokemon like Rillaboom. Ferrothorn's Spikes is very beneficial to Alakazam, as it can make Alakazam harder to pivot around and wear down Pokemon that it can struggle with, such as Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Weavile. Tapu Lele is also a good partner for Alakazam, as its Psychic Terrain boosts Alakazam's STAB move to dangerous levels, allowing it to beat Pokemon such as Clefable and Gliscor after a Nasty Plot. Psychic Terrain also prevents Alakazam from being revenge killed by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Aegislash.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running Thunder Wave or Toxic over Scald lets Slowbro further annoy the opposing team by crippling common switch-ins such as Mega Latias, Slowking, and Hydreigon. However, running no attacking moves outside of Future Sight is incredibly passive, and can easily be taken advantage of by the likes of Gliscor and Reuniclus. A Colbur Berry is another option for a held item, as it lets Slowbro absorb a Dark-type move from the likes of Weavile, Mega Tyranitar, or Mega Mawile to potentially turn the tide of a battle, but it's generally more situational and less useful than its other options. It can also run Body Press in tandem with a Colbur Berry to hit Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar harder, but this tends to be less useful than Scald or Future Sight.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Slowbro's Special Defense is quite average, which can be taken advantage of by common special attackers such as Clefable, Ash-Greninja, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon, Greninja, Weavile, and both Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar all threaten Slowbro with their super effective STAB moves and are able to switch into and absorb its Future Sight. Roost variants of Hydreigon can especially easily switch into and wall Slowbro, hindering its ability to make progress. However, neither Tyranitar nor Weavile like to switch into Scald for fear of a burn, and Greninja hates any and all forms of chip damage, including chip from a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Serperior are able to force out Slowbro with their STAB Grass-type moves. However, the former two can't switch in safely due to Scald's burn chance.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Magnezone are able to force Slowbro out and can take advantage of the forced switch by using Volt Switch to gain momentum. However, Zeraora cannot switch into Slowbro due to the threat of a Scald burn.</p>",

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro functions as a great defensive pivot due to its access to Teleport and Regenerator, which together allow Slowbro to safely pivot its teammates in multiple times throughout a match. The combination of Future Sight and Teleport reliably sets up teammates like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny to break through troublesome defensive walls such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Clefable. Its good physical bulk allows it to check many key physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny. Scald lets Slowbro threaten the likes of Corviknight and Excadrill with a burn. Ice Beam is another option that lets Slowbro threaten Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T better, but causes it to struggle to check other physical attackers. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowbro ignore damage from entry hazards, which is key in keeping it healthy throughout longer games. It can also run Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers like Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Mega Lopunny, but this makes its longevity much worse. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed EVs ensures the slowest possible Teleport, guaranteeing a speed tie in Teleport mirrors against opposing Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <p>Slowbro tends to fit on bulky offense builds, where it can be paired with other Pokemon with pivoting moves, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Corviknight. Fast and frail wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Kartana appreciate Slowbro pivoting them onto the field safely and providing Future Sight support, which lets them more easily KO their checks like Landorus-T, Toxapex, Corviknight, and Tangrowth. Due to Slowbro's weakness to Electric-types such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko, pairing it up with Ground- and Grass-types that can switch into these Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth makes for a solid defensive backbone. Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth deserve a special mention, as they are able to check Ash-Greninja, which Slowbro tends to let in for free. Pokemon that resist Dark such as Clefable and Kommo-o make for good teammates, as they're able to switch into Dark-type moves from the likes of Tyranitar, Greninja, and Hydreigon, which threaten Slowbro. Lastly, Blissey forms a stellar defensive core alongside Slowbro, as its ability to switch into special attacks directed at Slowbro, alongside its access to Teleport, lets these two cover most offensive Pokemon while keeping up momentum.</p>"

Landorus-T can also provide entry hazard support for Gengar, helping it punish switch-ins and securing OHKOs on bulkier Pokemon like Garchomp, and gives it a crucial Ground immunity to switch into. Pursuit trappers like Weavile and Tyranitar threaten Gengar heavily, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Mega Lopunny that can take them on. Gengar also likes Mega Lopunny's ability to pressure and take out offensive Pokemon that threaten it like Garchomp and Greninja, and Gengar helps pressure Fairy-types in return.

Seismic Toss lets Chansey deal consistent damage, allowing it to be less passive against Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Ash-Greninja. Toxic cripples most switch-ins, especially those that don't mind taking Seismic Toss much, such as Slowbro and Roost Mega Latias. Aromatherapy is an option if the team already has a Stealth Rock setter or doesn't need Toxic on Chansey to check the aforementioned threats, allowing Chansey to act as a cleric by removing status inflictions.

Unaware users like Quagsire and Clefable enjoy the cleric and status absorber support Chansey provides to them, while they can check Pokemon that could try to turn Chansey into setup fodder like Gengar. They also appreciate Chansey wearing the opposing team down thanks to Toxic and Stealth Rock if they are running Curse or Calm Mind, respectively, allowing them to win late-game. Clefable also can free up a slot for Chansey by running Aromatherapy itself. Mega Sableye is also a good teammate for Chansey, since it is able to sponge Knock Off for it, bounce back Taunt and entry hazards, and check Mega Medicham, while Chansey can check certain specially offensive Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye, such as Tapu Koko and Choice Specs Kyurem.</p>"

However, it faces heavy competition for the Mega slot on hyper offense teams from Mega Gyarados, Mega Garchomp, and Mega Scizor, which are much better because they bring defensive utility to a team, whereas Mega Pinsir has next to none. It also cannot hit all of the metagame for significant damage at once, as it only has room for one coverage move; Close Combat variants are walled by Zapdos, while Stone Edge variants struggle with Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Melmetal. It also must run Earthquake to even consider touching Aegislash, which lets Corviknight and Rotom-W wall it completely. Additionally, faster Flying-resistant Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Zeraora, halt Mega Pinsir in its tracks. Priority moves from Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny can mess with it as well. Mega Pinsir's unfortunate Speed tier also leaves it outpaced by several common Pokemon that survive even a +2 Quick Attack; Mega Latias, Kartana, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Jirachi all fall into this category. Mega Pinsir's horrible 4x weakness to Stealth Rock also complicates matters, as it can require a lot of support and careful play to get around.

Earthquake hits Toxapex, Hydreigon, and Rotom-W hard.</p> <p>Mega Gyarados works best on hyper offense teams. Since it often struggles to find opportunities to set up and gets chipped too easily, dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl is extremely beneficial. Entry hazard support from dedicated hyper offense leads such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mew wears down Mega Gyarados's checks such as Tangrowth, Toxapex, and Alomamola. Rillaboom, Hawlucha, and Serperior assist Mega Gyarados against faster teams and benefit from it beating bulkier teams. Due to its middling Speed and subpar defensive typing, Mega Gyarados is very vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Kartana, Rillaboom, and Hawlucha, so checks to them such as Volcarona, Thundurus-T, and Kommo-o are imperative. Hawlucha is an exceptional partner, as it appreciates Mega Gyarados dealing with bulkier teams and pressuring Zapdos and Toxapex.</p>"

It is possible for a copied recovery move, such as Corviknight's Roost or Clefable's Soft-Boiled, to heal up Ditto; however, it tends to dislike being locked into a non-damaging move.

It can purposefully take Knock Off in matchups where it won't need Choice Scarf to revenge kill anything, which gives it a lot more utility in simply copying other Pokemon. Imposter granting more PP on every switch also makes it excellent in stall mirror matches. The HP EVs boost Ditto's only relevant stat after transforming, while the remaining EVs and nature maximize its chances of winning Struggle wars against opposing Ditto. The IVs guarantee that copied Hidden Power is Ground-type, which lets Ditto trap and remove Magnezone, while minimizing Speed for Struggle wars. Hidden Power can't be Ground-type with 0 Speed IVs, and make sure to select Hidden Power Ground in the teambuilder.</p> <p>Due to it only fitting on stall, Ditto's teammates tend to be stall staples such as Mega Sableye, Clefable, Chansey, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Toxapex is notable because it can bait in other Regenerator Pokemon such as Slowking and Tangrowth relatively easily, which Ditto can copy for HP recovery. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes, which really bothers Ditto long-term. Meanwhile, Mega Sableye, Gliscor, and Corviknight can keep entry hazards away, significantly improving Ditto's longevity.

However, the loss of power is noteworthy against bulkier targets, such as never KOing Ferrothorn with Hurricane into Supersonic Skystrike after Leftovers recovery. Volt Switch can be used over Discharge on defensive sets to get out of disadvantageous positions while also providing momentum for teammates; however, it makes it harder for Zapdos to beat Pokemon such as Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex. Pressure can be used over Static on stall teams to PP stall entry hazards from Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory for example, but it is very team specific. Thunderbolt can also be used on stall for its significantly lower paralysis chance, since full paralysis can hinder PP stalling, and higher PP. If Zapdos is using Defog over Hidden Power Ice, Hurricane can replace Heat Wave, as it threatens Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor; however, Zapdos loses its ability to heavily damage Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: As offensive Zapdos cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, its Stealth Rock weakness is exposed, limiting the amount of times it can switch in and use Volt Switch to wear opponents down</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Mega Swampert can easily take advantage of Zapdos and force it out, as they can wear it down with Toxic or overwhelm it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Kyurem and Weavile are very problematic for Zapdos, as they can easily KO it.

Additionally, Landorus-T and Garchomp can often force Zapdos out with Continental Crush.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are not threatened in the slightest by Zapdos, especially given their reliable recovery, and freely spread Toxic. Furthermore, Blissey can use Zapdos for momentum for its teammates through Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kommo-o, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon aren't threatened by Zapdos's attacks and can use it as entry hazard or setup fodder; however, the latter two do not enjoy a Discharge paralysis.</p>",

While bulkier Ground-Types such as Gastrodon and Hippowdon avoid the OHKO, they struggle to survive Supersonic Skystrike + Hurricane. With opposing Ground-Types removed, Zapdos can freely wear down its checks, such as Chansey, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar, with Volt Switch. However, the lack of bulk investment and Heavy-Duty Boots means it is an unreliable check to Kartana, Serperior and Mega Lopunny, especially if Stealth Rock is up. Thunderbolt is chosen as its primary Electric STAB move over Discharge to maximise its role as a wallbreaker. Roost increases its longevity against passive foes such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini, as well as offsets Stealth Rock chip. It also allows Zapdos to stay out of range of the likes of Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Zapdos's EV spread outspeeds Modest Tapu Lele and Kyurem whilst maximising its power, notably KOing bulkier variants of Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This Zapdos set fits best on offensive teams that can capitalize on its strong Volt Switch and its ability to remove Ground-types. It pairs exceptionally well with offensive pivots like Mega Lopunny and Urshifu-R, as well as strong but frail wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie, Mega Medicham, and Weavile. These attackers threaten the slow special walls that Zapdos pivots out of, like Chansey and Mega Tyranitar. In return, the former two bring Zapdos back in by using U-turn on bulky physical walls like Clefable and Toxapex. Mega Diancie helps block Stealth Rock while benefitting from Zapdos removing Ferrothorn and Gliscor. Weavile can Pursuit trap Mega Latias and Chansey and remove key items from foes with Knock Off. Due to Zapdos's Stealth Rock weakness and tendency to use Volt Switch, Defog support from the likes of Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Landorus-T allows it to switch in and pivot more frequently and minimize the need for Zapdos to use Roost. Zapdos also offensively threatens Kartana and Serperior for these teammates. Alternatively, entry hazard pressure from Zapdos's teammates such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran may also force the opponent to use Defog themselves, removing their own entry hazards to Zapdos's benefit.

Heat Wave allows Zapdos to threaten Rillaboom, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and especially Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice can consistently threaten Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which would otherwise stuff out Zapdos; however, Defog can be used over it to remove entry hazards against Pokemon like Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, Zapdos has a very poor matchup against many other hazard setters in the tier, most notably Mega Tyranitar and the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp, making it somewhat unreliable as a hazard remover. Static is preferred over Pressure to potentially cripple offensive threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Mawile. The EV spread shown allows Zapdos to outspeed Modest Heatran.</p> <p>Zapdos fits on many team archetypes as a solid defensive presence.

Zapdos especially has a poor matchup versus Heatran, as it can easily force out Zapdos using Magma Storm and Toxic, giving it an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Because of this, checks to Heatran such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Gastrodon are necessary teammates for Zapdos.

Roost gives it longevity and allows it to consistently check Pokemon that rain struggles with such as Tangrowth, Kartana, and Rillaboom.

In addition, it can stall out the low-PP of moves used to target it, such as Tyranitar's Stone Edge and Heatran's Magma Storm. Its excellent special bulk allows it to answer threats such as opposing Zapdos, Serperior, and Galarian Moltres, although a lack of Defense investment means it falters against the likes of Kartana and Mega Lopunny. Also, since it plans to stall, it must beware stray burn or poison from otherwise free switchins into foes like Toxapex, Tapu Fini and Rotom-W. Substitute lets Zapdos safely attack passive Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Discharge spreads paralysis, with the reduction in Speed and potential full paralysis giving it more opportunities to use Substitute and chip foes. Meanwhile, Hurricane provides strong coverage, hitting Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Gastrodon neutrally and Serperior super effectively. Hurricane's confusion chance compounds with Discharge's paralysis in limiting the foes' opportunities to move. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to outpace Modest Heatran, with the rest of the EVs ensuring Moonblast from uninvested Clefable never breaks its Substitute.</p> <p>SubRoost Zapdos excels on balance and semi-stall teams, which aid in slowly weakening its checks with residual damage. Spikes support from Skarmory, Mew, and Ferrothorn wears down Tyranitar, Chansey, Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, all of which take little damage from Zapdos's attacks. Similarly, Toxapex provides Toxic Spikes to wear down the former three while limiting the opportunities of revenge killers such as Weavile, Kyurem, and Mega Diancie to force Zapdos out. Mega Latias is another fantastic partner that baits in Zapdos checks like Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chansey. It wears them down, limiting Tyranitar's chances to nail Zapdos with Pursuit, stifling Heatran's long-term Leftovers recovery, and forcing Chansey to burn Soft-Boiled PP in longer games. Additionally, Mega Latias answers Kartana effectively, reducing the risk of Zapdos losing its item, while Ice Beam variants threaten to KO Gliscor, which walls Zapdos. Pokemon that can cripple Weavile such as the aforementioned Toxapex holding Rocky Helmet, Volcarona, and Colbur Berry Mew help, as Weavile's Triple Axel can KO even Zapdos behind a Substitute. Knock Off support from Gliscor, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex removes items such as Chansey's Eviolite, Heatran's Leftovers, and Tapu Koko's and Gastrodon's Heavy-Duty Boots, making them take more damage when switching into Zapdos.</p>"

Close Combat threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Corviknight, Heatran, and Rotom-W, outright KOing them or putting them in range of Brave Bird. U-turn pivots out of unfavorable situations, especially against defensive cores that are tougher for it to break, but it also has to be wary of contact effects.

Rock-types like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie are stellar partners due to their ability to threaten out Zapdos, and the former especially is able to Pursuit trap it, potentially wearing it down enough for Galarian Zapdos to break through it. Mega Diancie on the other hand can form a potent entry hazard stack core by reflecting opposing hazards, while setting its own Stealth Rock. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp can help out against Electric-types trying to revenge kill Galarian Zapdos, while simultaneously wearing down Zapdos and Corviknight for it, allowing Galarian Zapdos to more freely use Brave Bird. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W also work well with Galarian Zapdos, as it takes advantage of Ground- and Grass-types for them.

However, Moltres is completely outclassed as a Defogger by Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Zapdos, since all three have better typing, bulk, and matchup against other common Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, and Landorus-T. A plethora of Pokemon it wants to check, such as Mega Mawile, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor, often carry Knock Off, which Moltres does not want to switch into, as it relies heavily on its Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid its crippling Stealth Rock weakness, making it a poor check in the long run. Mystical Fire allows Moltres to check Mega Charizard Y and Calm Mind Clefable more easily. Scorching Sands is a fantastic coverage move, as it notably 2HKOes Heatran and can also punish Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar due to its burn chance. Flame Body is chosen to cripple physical attackers like Rillaboom, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and U-turn from Corviknight and Mega Lopunny. Roost allows Moltres to stay healthy, letting it check Kartana and Mega Scizor better in the long run. U-turn and Toxic are also fine options to gain momentum or punish switch-ins.

Lastly, a Sitrus Berry can be run to provide Galarian Moltres with a quick burst of recovery which can allow it to live priority moves such as Weavile's Ice Shard, Mega Lopunny's Fake Out, and Greninja's Water Shuriken, as well as potentially let it accrue an extra Berserk boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: The likes of Clefable and Tapu Fini easily pivot into Galarian Moltres's Fiery Wrath and force it out with their Fairy-type STAB. However, they all hate switching into Hurricane and Supersonic Skystrike. Tapu Koko, Mega Mawile, and Mega Diancie resist both of Galarian Moltres's STAB attacks and threaten it out.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Zapdos, Rotom-Wash, and Magnezone resist Galarian Moltres's Flying-type STAB move, with the former two being able to recover off the damage dealt. However, all three dislike boosted Fiery Wraths and can be easily beat if chipped, especially since the latter two lack of consistent recovery. Furthermore, Electric-type coverage options from the likes of Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Victini can chunk Galarian Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Tyranitar and Diancie resist both of Galarian Moltres's STAB options and can easily switch into it and threaten it out, with the former being able to Pursuit trap it. Rock-type coverage from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp also greatly hurt Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its reliance on Agility and weakness to Stealth Rock, faster Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko can easily revenge kill Galarian Moltres if it hasn't used Agility. Furthermore, priority from the likes of Mega Medicham, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny can revenge kill Galarian Moltres if it has been heavily chipped.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Galarian Moltres is a decent wallbreaker and sweeper on offensive teams, sporting a great offensive STAB move combination and a passable speed tier, which sets it apart from breakers such as Hydreigon and Tapu Lele. Furthermore, it also sports a solid defensive typing, as well as really good overall bulk, which allows it to pivot into Pokemon like Kartana, Greninja, and Landorus-T and live super effective and strong attacks like Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, Mega Lopunny's Close Combat, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Moonblast. However, Galarian Moltres has faults which limit its capabilities to be consistent throughout a match, such as its Stealth Rock weakness, being relatively weak without a boost, and its mediocre Speed stat before an Agility boost that leaves it outsped by the likes of Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Mega Lopunny. Its lack of recovery also means that it is easily worn down and can't always take advantage of its bulk. Taunt allows it to use would-be checks like Toxapex and Blissey as setup fodder and break past Unaware Clefable to ease the stall matchup. However, Agility can be used instead, as it allows Galarian Moltres to demolish most offensive team structures. Fiery Wrath provides Galarian Moltres with a consistent STAB option, hitting common Flying-type resistant Pokemon like Corviknight, Heatran, and Zapdos. Hurricane lets Galarian Moltres hit Dark-type resistant Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon and becomes a nuclear option when used in tandem with Flyinium Z that can even break the likes of Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie.</p> <p>Galarian Moltres fits best on offensive teams where its unique wallbreaking capabilities fit right in. Steel-types are mandatory partners for Galarian Moltres due to its inability to consistently deal with Fairy-types such as Unaware Clefable, Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Mega Mawile. Thus, bulky Steel-types like Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor are all incredible teammate choices. Due to its susceptibility to Stealth Rock, Galarian Moltres greatly appreciates solid entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Landorus-T. Galarian Moltres is easily revenge killed if unboosted or by priority if it has used Agility, so faster partners such as Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele work well with it. The aforementioned Pokemon also appreciate Galarian Moltres breaking bulkier teams for them. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are stellar teammates, as they can absorb the Electric-types attacks from Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Zapdos that Galarian Moltres brings in. Lastly, due to Galarian Moltres's lack of consistent recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, pivots like Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are excellent partners that can help bring it in safely.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensively oriented variant taking advantage of Mew's amazing coverage in tandem with Nasty Plot can make for a terrifying sweeper on paper. However, it tends to falter against many common defensive Pokemon, such as Slowking, Corviknight, and Heatran, and is generally outclassed as a setup sweeper by the likes of Tapu Lele, Hydreigon, and Reuniclus. Meanwhile, Body Press gives Mew a way to pressure both Dark-types and Heatran in one slot. Furthermore, Toxic lets Mew wear down the likes of Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Mega Latias. However, these options tend to be less useful than the other options Mew has available. Flare Blitz can be great on the suicide lead set for preventing Excadrill from removing hazards through Rapid Spin while also helping Mew KO itself, but its use outside of pressuring Excadrill is pretty barren, making it a worse option than Explosion overall. Skill Swap can be used over Explosion to let Mew set entry hazards against Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, although it's generally an extremely fringe option due to them being very uncommon. Focus Sash can be used over Red Card to guarantee one layer of hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar are able to threaten Mew out with their STAB moves. The latter three are also able to Pursuit trap Mew, rendering it unable to check the likes of Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham. However, they all have to worry about a Will-O-Wisp burn and the occasional Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Four-Moveslot Syndrome</strong>: Mew's inability to run every move it wants to on one set hinders it in certain matchups; lacking Ice Beam against Gliscor, Taunt against Corviknight, or Earthquake against Heatran turns Mew into a free opportunity to set up, use Defog unpunished, or switch in, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Mew can be KOed by Ghost-types such as Gengar and Aegislash from their powerful STAB moves, preventing it from setting entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fast wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon that are strong enough to 2HKO Mew or use it as setup fodder such as Garchomp, Kartana, and Tapu Koko can limit Mew's ability to set entry hazards for its teammates. However, defensive sets can handle these Pokemon more easily thanks to Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mew's access to the somewhat rare Spikes lets it act as an entry hazard setter. It also has defensive utility, being able to check the likes of Mega Medicham, Hawlucha, and Gliscor. Due to its deep movepool it has immense adaptability, being able to run different coverage moves on a team-by-team basis. Ice Beam allows Mew to threaten various Ground-types, notably Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Garchomp, while also letting it hit Rillaboom. Earthquake is another option, as it allows Mew to hit Heatran, which usually walls it otherwise. Will-O-Wisp lets Mew punish physical attackers like Tyranitar, Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Melmetal while also punishing Corviknight attempting to Defog on it. Taunt lets it prevent Defog attempts from Corviknight and Tapu Fini and block status-inflicting and recovery moves from the likes of Blissey, Toxapex, and Clefable. Knock Off lets Mew force progress by removing opposing held items, notably Heavy-Duty Boots, making its Spikes matter more in the long term, as well as Leftovers from the likes of Heatran and Tapu Fini. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item choice, as it allows Mew to punish Mega Medicham, Weavile, and Mega Swampert. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to let Mew ignore opposing entry hazards. However, Leftovers's passive recovery aids Mew in staying healthy. Mew can also use a Colbur Berry to either absorb Knock Off from the likes of Kartana and Mega Mawile or safely switch out of Pursuit from foes like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Furthermore, a faster spread to outspeed Mega Garchomp can be used as well. However, this set needs Heavy-Duty Boots to check Mega Medicham if entry hazards are up. 136 Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed Adamant Rillaboom.</p> <p>Mew fits best on balance teams where its defensive utility can shine and where Pokemon that take advantage of Mew's Spikes, such as Hydreigon, Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Life Orb Clefable can be easily paired up alongside it. Teammates like Garchomp, Magnezone, and Mega Tyranitar that pressure Defoggers can help Mew's Spikes stay on the field while also taking advantage of its Spikes for their offensive utility. While Mew is able to soft check physical attackers such as Mega Garchomp, Excadrill, and Hawlucha, it's quite easily overwhelmed and appreciates having teammates to form a defensive backbone with it; Toxapex, Gliscor, and Corviknight are able to help relieve some pressure for Mew. Additionally, these cores appreciate Mew's ability to consistently handle Mega Medicham for them. Dark-types like Ash-Greninja, Mega Tyranitar, and Hydreigon can threaten Mew if it doesnt have a Colbur Berry, so having Dark-resistant Pokemon that can switch into Dark-type moves like Tapu Koko, Kommo-o, and Clefable as teammates helps Mew a lot. However, these Dark-types must be wary of Will-O-Wisp and the rare Body Press. Lastly, Knock Off users such as Tangrowth, Toxapex, Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Zeraora are able to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, making Mew's Spikes matter a lot more in the longterm.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Mew is a very solid lead in National Dex OU due to its great Speed tier and access to Taunt and Explosion, allowing it to set up and keep up entry hazards consistently and effectively for hyper offensive teams while also preventing opposing hazard setters from setting up their own. Taunt combined with Mew's Speed tier consistently prevents Defoggers such as Corviknight and Zapdos from removing hazards and lets Mew retain a niche over Landorus-T even though Mew is generally overshadowed by it. Explosion allows Mew to take itself out in exchange for a heavy hit on a foe, generate momentum for its dangerous offensive teammates, and prevent Excadrill from removing hazards with Rapid Spin. Red Card synergizes great with Taunt to prevent setup sweepers from taking advantage of Mew and forces out strong attackers; both of these cases can provide Mew with more chances to set entry hazards. Mew typically fits on offensive teams as a suicide lead, as its ability to set up and keep up multiple layers of hazards allows its dangerous teammates to wreak havoc. Setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Garchomp as well as wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko and Rillaboom make great teammates as Mew's consistency in setting up hazards are very beneficial for these Pokemon.</p>"

While these attributes might make it look like a solid sweeper for dual screens hyper offense teams, this is not the case; Azumarill has to contend with an exceptionally hostile metagame, as faster Water-resistant Pokemon, such as Kartana, Rotom-W, Serperior, Kyurem, and Tapu Bulu all halt it in its tracks. Priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny also presents issues, while Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain removes Aqua Jet from the equation entirely. Chip damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet doesn't help either, as it can quickly wear down Azumarill into range of other priority users. While Azumarill can break through and OHKO slow Water-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage, these Pokemon are often paired with teammates that can deal with Azumarill more naturally, such as faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Mega Latias and Kartana or powerful priority users like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham. These drawbacks leave Azumarill as a very inconsistent sweeper with no real niche in the metagame.</p> <p>Z-Belly Drum fully heals Azumarill before its use, ensuring Azumarill receives the boost and therefore giving it its best shot at potentially sweeping opposing teams. If your team already has a Z-Move user, Sitrus Berry is an option that can give Azumarill a bit more health after setting up in a best-case scenario, but such scenarios are quite rare, and the loss of health from Belly Drum makes it much harder for Azumarill to find opportunities to set up while also preventing it from effectively checking Weavile and Ash-Greninja. Knock Off is the preferred last move in order to OHKO Toxapex and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage. This set works best on hyper offense and rain teams, as Azumarill can theoretically work as an early-game wallbreaker on hyper offense, while rain significantly boosts the power of Aqua Jet and gives it more favorable rolls against threats like Zapdos and Garchomp, which can make it easier for Azumarill to sweep via giving Aqua Jet. However, both playstyles have far better options available to them; hyper offense can utilize numerous other, more consistent sweepers, such as Kommo-o, Rillaboom, and Volcarona, while Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy are all far superior rain sweepers.</p>"

It checks various dangerous threats such as Tapu Lele and Heatran, and it can easily set up advantageous situations for its teammates like Mega Lopunny and Weavile with Future Sight and Teleport. However, it is a specially bulky Water-type that cannot handle Ash-Greninja at all, and it's completely outclassed by Slowbro and Galarian Slowking in the Future Sight department. Its low Defense and Dark weakness leave it vulnerable to physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Garchomp, and Pursuit users like Weavile and Tyranitar, even though all of these fear Scald. Thus, Slowking struggles to fit on teams, and it's almost entirely outclassed by other Water-types such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. Future Sight prevents Pokemon such as Toxapex, Clefable, and Kommo-o from switching in safely on Slowking's teammates like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Lopunny until it lands, often leading to checkmate situations. Teleport grants free switches in for Slowking's frail teammates like Weavile and Mega Medicham. Slack Off and Regenerator make it a good long-term check to threats like Heatran and Tapu Lele. Heavy-Duty Boots cancels entry hazard damage, letting it pivot more easily.

Also, its good Special Attack and great movepool make Galarian Slowking a hard Pokemon to pivot around. Thanks to Assault Vest, good natural bulk, Regenerator, and good defensive typing, it can easily tank special attacks such as Kyurem's Ice Beam and Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, letting it use Future Sight to provide advantageous situations for its teammates or punish its switch-ins. While Knock Off doesn't completely ruin Galarian Slowking, losing its item does notably compromise its bulk, preventing it from pivoting into threats like Ash-Greninja and Kyurem. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking's crippling weakness to Pursuit can discourage it from entering the field, since Weavile and Mega Tyranitar can trap and KO it. Finally, Galarian Slowking faces competition from Slowking as a special wall due to its better immediate recovery, access to Teleport, and ability to check threats well without Assault Vest. Flamethrower punishes Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight that try to pivot in Galarian Slowking's STAB attacks. Scald is used over Hydro Pump due to its burn chance discouraging switch-ins from Pursuit trappers, like Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor without its Toxic Orb activated. It also wins the one-on-one Heatran matchup. 252 HP and 140 SpD EVs along with a Calm Nature allow Galarian Slowking to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to improve its ability to punish switch-ins.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate Future Sight support and need a sturdy check to strong special attackers and Fairy-types.

Tangrowth likes Galarian Slowking's ability to check Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. In return, Tangrowth checks Ground-types like Garchomp and other physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Swampert, and Mega Tyranitar for it, as well as forming a great Regenerator core. Urshifu-R, Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja appreciate the Future Sight support to prevent Toxapex, Clefable, and Kommo-o from safely switching into them. Due to Galarian Slowking's weakness to Pursuit, Knock Off, and Dark-types such as Weavile and Tyranitar generally, offensive Dark-type checks like Mega Lopunny and defensive checks like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn work well with it. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar and Clefable help Galarian Slowking check Ash-Greninja more easily. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T also tend to force Galarian Slowking out, making Corviknight, Synthesis Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom good partners. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu are especially good, as they both provide Grassy Terrain support, decreasing Earthquake damage and giving it a form of passive recovery.</p>"

Superpower allows Mega Scizor to hit Steel-type Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Sand Tomb allows Mega Scizor to trap and remove the likes of Heatran, Toxapex, and Magnezone for its partners such as Volcarona and Serperior to clean late-game. Dual Wingbeat is a strong coverage option with Technician, allowing Mega Scizor to break through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and  Slowbro with Swords Dance, nailing specific physical walls such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Amoonguss, and discouraging the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona from switching in directly. Knock Off is another option to hit the likes of Slowbro and Mega Latias, as well as enabling other hyper offense sweepers better with the item removal, such as removing Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots so Rillaboom can KO it after Stealth Rock. Knock Off is best used in conjunction with Sand Tomb, as the two provide Mega Scizor with solid neutral coverage. Light Metal is the ability before Mega Evolution to weaken opposing Ditto, as well as the rare Low Kick Greninja and Weavile. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to outrun Modest Magnezone and specially defensive Heatran, allowing it to KO them before they can retaliate.</p> <p>Mega Scizor provides a solid defensive backbone for hyper offense teams, and pairing it up with Pokemon that tend to be checked offensively such as Kommo-o, Serperior, and Manaphy can provide it many setup opportunities during a game. Teammates that can set Sticky Web such as Shuckle and Ribombee are solid assets, alleviating its middling Speed tier so it can outspeed threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Due to its crippling weakness to Fire-type moves, teammates that can pivot into these moves such as Manaphy and Kommo-o work well with it. Hyper offense staples such as Rillaboom, Volcarona, and Hawlucha help it overwhelm shared checks like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight to pave the way for a late-game sweep, and Mega Scizor also appreciates the passive recovery Grassy Terrain provides, although it makes Toxapex harder to remove. Other entry hazards are greatly appreciated to wear down the opposing team to be easily cleaned up late-game, with Knock Off making the hazards matter more on Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Victini and Zapdos.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Scizor is an excellent offensive presence, thanks to its great Attack stat and an excellent ability in Technician to pick off weakened Pokemon. Its excellent typing and great natural bulk allow it to check many of the tier's powerful breakers like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Weavile. Bullet Punch is a strong STAB priority move that somewhat makes up for Mega Scizor's terrible base Speed revenge killing faster Pokemon like Kyurem, Mega Diancie, and Weavile. Roost gives it longevity. Sand Tomb allows Mega Scizor to eliminate would-be switch-ins, such as Heatran and Magnezone, while also trapping and removing Toxapex at the risk of a burn. Light Metal before Mega Evolving reduces damage from Greninja's Low Kick. The listed EVs allows Mega Scizor to outspeed specially defensive Heatran and maximum Speed Magnezone, and it still has the bulk to check Pokemon like Mega Latias, Kyurem, and Clefable.</p> <p>This set fits on balance and bulky offense teams, as they appreciate Mega Scizor switching into many attacks using its bulk and typing, acting as a potent late-game cleaner, and revenge killing.  Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Koko, which benefit from the removal of Heatran and Magnezone, are ideal teammates. Mega Scizor tends to invite in counters like Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Slowbro; Pokemon like Heatran and Rotom-W that can take advantage of these Pokemon make good partners. Victini is also a great partner, as it shares many checks with Mega Scizor while checking Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Lele for it. Water-types such as Gastrodon, Slowbro, Rotom-W, Slowking, and Tapu Fini cover Mega Scizor's nasty 4x Fire weakness. Tapu Fini is particularly good, as it summons Misty Terrain, which potentially allows Mega Scizor to trap Toxapex without the risk of getting burned by Scald. In return, Mega Scizor can switch in on the Grass-type moves that annoy Tapu Fini. Mega Scizor removing Toxapex could pave way for setup sweepers like Quiver Dance Volcarona, Calm Mind Clefable, and Swords Dance Weavile.</p>"

Bisharp is an essential teammate for Shuckle, as Defiant helps it easily deter Defoggers such as Corviknight and Zapdos, and it's a very threatening wallbreaker and setup sweeper.

However, its low Speed and lack of recovery means it struggles to deal with faster teams, and it's often denied opportunities to setup with enough offensive pressure. It also takes up a team's Mega slot and faces severe competition from other wallbreakers and Mega Evolutions such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile. Close Combat can notably OHKO Skarmory and physically defensive Tangrowth after Stealth Rock once boosted. Rock Blast allows Heracross to hit Flying-types that resist Close Combat, such as Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, to have near-perfect neutral coverage, achieving feats such as OHKOing specially defensive Toxapex once boosted after Stealth Rock. Pin Missile nails bulky Psychic- and Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Mew, Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Tangrowth. Substitute lets Mega Heracross use its great bulk to gain even more setup opportunities on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn and Kommo-o, as well as easing prediction, making Mega Heracross much harder to pivot on than it already is. Bullet Seed nails the likes of Unaware Clefable under Grassy Terrain, as well as OHKOing Tapu Fini; however, both it and Substitute leave Mega Heracross open to pressure from Psychic-types like Mew and Mega Latias. A slightly bulkier EV spread of 32 HP / 232 Atk / 24 Def / 220 Spe can be used alongside Substitute to let Substitute survive an Earthquake from Landorus-T while still outspeeding the likes of Timid Magnezone and Adamant Bisharp. Moxie lets Heracross KO a weakened Pokemon before it Mega Evolves to gain an early Attack boost.</p> <p>Mega Heracross fits on bulky offense teams that can capitalize on its wallbreaking capabilities and repeatedly bring it in. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Discharge Zapdos, Clefable, and Serperior works well with it. If foregoing Pin Missile for Substitute, Pursuit users such as Weavile and Tyranitar work well to trap Mew, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias, which otherwise checks it. If running Bullet Seed, Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom or Tapu Bulu is near essential to 2HKO Unaware Clefable, as well as providing passive recovery. Furthermore, entry hazard support from the likes of Mew, Greninja and Ferrothorn is excellent to capitalize on the many switches Mega Heracross forces. Mega Heracross greatly appreciates pivoting support from the likes of Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W to bring it in easily. Teammates such as Weavile, Garchomp and Rillaboom like the pressure Mega Heracross puts on Pokemon like Skarmory, Toxapex, and Zapdos.

However, it tends to be shaky defensively because it's easy to overwhelm, forcing it to constantly use Roost, as well as being incredibly weak to Knock Off. Haze lets Mantine comfortably check Manaphy and Volcarona by negating their setup. Meanwhile, Toxic allows it to punish switch-ins like Slowking, Tangrowth, and Hydreigon. Defog is another option, but since Mantine loses to or gets crippled by many Stealth Rock setters in the tier such as Garchomp, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar, it is generally not a good sole Defogger.

Due to Mantine's crippling weakness to Electric-types, it appreciates partners that are able to handle the likes of Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone.

It's also susceptible to Rock-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie, so it appreciates teammates such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn, which are able to switch into their attacks. Meanwhile, Mantine checks Fire- and Water-types for them in return. Its weakness to Knock Off means it likes Pokemon that don't mind taking Knock Off such as Mega Scizor, Gliscor, and Z-Move variants of Hydreigon and Heatran. Due to Mantine's amazing matchup against rain teams, Pokemon that struggle with rain such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Heatran appreciate having it to fall back on defensively in this matchup.</p>"

Spikes helps wear down the opposing team and makes it easier for Skarmory’s teammates to sweep.

Clefable can check dangerous setup sweepers that threaten Skarmory like Mega Heracross and Mega Latias thanks to Unaware. Mega Sableye is great to pair with Skarmory due to Magic Bounce preventing Stealth Rock from wearing it down and Will-O-Wisp making physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Scizor, and Kartana easier to handle. Alomomola can provide Wish support while also coming in on attacks from Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Victini that Skarmory struggles with, while in return Skarmory can come in on strong attacks from Rillaboom and Garchomp for it.

Both Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus on balance teams love Skarmory for its Spikes support, which makes it easier for these two to set up and sweep.

Teleport allows it to safely pivot in teammates like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Mawile and take advantage of the many switches that it forces; Blissey's ability to viably hold Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it hard to wear down via entry hazards, unlike its pre-evolution Chansey. Toxic allows Blissey to chip away at threats such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Targeting Mega Latias is especially important, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably come in on it and cripple it in the long term with Toxic. It must be noted, however, that Toxic forces Blissey to use Teleport more often, as it invites Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Kartana to easily pivot in. Thunder Wave is another good choice for the last move, as it allows Blissey to effectively cripple offensive Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Kartana. It also gives Blissey a weapon against a couple of the select few special attackers that otherwise handily beat Blissey, such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, a reckless Gengar on the switch, and Calm Mind Clefable. Stealth Rock can be run over a status move if your team can't fit a Stealth Rock setter elsewhere, but Blissey is even more passive than normal without Toxic or Thunder Wave and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Blissey finds its home on balanced and bulky offensive teams. There it should be used to pivot into threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja and regain momentum with Teleport while also spreading status. Blissey really hates powerful physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. A physically bulky partner is therefore appreciated. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution are very solid switch-ins to Fighting-type attacks, are capable of checking many of the tier's physical attackers, and can also form a very strong double Teleport core with Blissey. Corviknight effectively rounds out the Slowbro + Blissey core, taking on the likes of Kartana, Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as well as offering Defog support and additional pivoting support with U-turn. Zapdos is another option that meets the previously mentioned positives bar checking Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also provide pivoting support with Volt Switch if desired. Toxapex can also handle Mega Lopunny and can beat other powerful physical attackers that Blissey dislikes like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile. Blissey's Teleport makes it a very solid pivot, which is appreciated by Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Greninja, and Weavile. The latter two are also capable of revenge killing Gengar, a special attacker that completely shuts down Blissey, with Weavile in particular heavily limiting additional threats such as Mega Medicham with Pursuit. Physical walls, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex, appreciate Blissey taking on special attackers they can't handle, such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Koko. Thunder Wave variants of Blissey can also be paired with slower wallbreakers that appreciate the paralysis support, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Heracross. Toxic variants of Blissey dislike Steel-types, with Landorus-T, Victini, and Garchomp helping out in that category.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is an obscenely strong wallbreaker, near-impossible to check defensively, sporting an amazing offensive typing alongside good bulk while sand is active. However, Tyranitar‘s middling Speed stat and poor defensive typing mean it struggles to come in and dish out multiple hits throughout the match. Stone Edge is Tyranitar’s main STAB move, being extremely hard to switch into due to its sheer power. Crunch is Tyranitar’s most spammable move due to the tiers‘s lack of sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon, and it also KOes Pokemon like Mega Latias and Slowbro that can live a Stone Edge comfortably and retaliate. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that it forces out, such as Aegislash and Mega Latias. It can also trap Choice-locked Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, Chansey, and Zapdos, which otherwise can‘t threaten it back. Superpower lets Tyranitar immediately threaten a KO on Chansey, which can otherwise use Soft-boiled to scout its move, and also hits Ferrothorn and Heatran hard. Fire Punch OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn without risking a Stone Edge miss or getting chipped multiple times by Iron Barbs. Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar nail Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone without dropping its Attack and Defense, and it gives it near-perfect neutral coverage. The given EV spread allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Mega Mawile, always live a +1 Bug Buzz from Volcarona, and always survive Choice Specs Tapu Lele Moonblast.</p> <p>Tyranitar fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate it breaking holes in opposing teams and Pursuit trapping key threats such as Mega Latias and Reuniclus. It works best with partners that appreciate it Pursuit trapping their checks, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Latias, and Calm Mind Clefable. Teammates such as Amoonguss and Tapu Fini that can deal with pesky Water-types such as Ash Greninja and Rotom-W, help Tyranitar—so do Pokemon that can handle Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana, such as Corviknight and Tangrowth. Partners that can manage Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny are also appreciated, so Clefable and Reuniclus are great with it. Skarmory and Mega Latias can deal with Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Excadrill benefits greatly from Tyranitar providing sand and wearing down the bulky Grass- and Flying-types that normally check it, such as Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Landorus-T. Teammates that can stack entry hazards such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory appreciate Tyranitar being great against the majority of the tier‘s hazard removal.</p>"

Inferno Overdrive lets Blaziken get past Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as granting a terrifying nuke in sun that can KO the likes of Toxapex and Mega Latias, but this set struggles to break past bulkier Water-types such as Slowbro and is very situational due to requiring sun to function its best. Breakneck Blitz gives Blaziken a strong neutral hit against all of its checks but is much weaker in general. Overall, Z-Move sets focus on targeting one specific Pokemon or group of Pokemon, and they can't break through Blaziken's other checks. A Choice Band set gives much greater immediate power but struggles due to how easy it is to scout and wear down. An Adamant nature can also be used for much more offensive prowess, but it misses out on a lot of important Speed tiers such as those of Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny when boosted. A mixed Life Orb set with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Ice can hit the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor without a Z-Move or taking recoil, but it cuts into Blaziken’s power and coverage options. Earthquake can be used on the main set to hit the likes of Toxapex harder and hit Heatran without reducing Blaziken’s bulk, but dropping Thunder Punch lets other bulky Water-types easily wall it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Without sufficient chip damage or a Z-Move, the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex can take a boosted hit and retaliate with their STAB moves or Haze.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Blaziken’s low initial Speed, the likes of Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Tapu Fini easily outspeed it. Pokemon with Swift Swim and Sand Rush such as Excadrill and Mega Swampert easily outspeed a boosted Blaziken, and they can force it out consistently.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Because of Blaziken’s terrible bulk, even resisted priority moves such as Choice Band Rillaboom's Grassy Glide can revenge kill a chipped Blaziken, so Pokemon like Fake Out Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, Water Shuriken Ash-Greninja, and Aqua Jet Urshifu-R and Crawdaunt definitely hurt it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Blaziken is extremely prone to chip damage from Flare Blitz and Life Orb recoil, entry hazard damage, and Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, which often means it faints after only getting one hit off.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias and Mega Latios</strong>: Both Mega Latias and Mega Latios resist both of Blaziken’s STAB options, as well as its common coverage, and their high bulk combined with reliable recovery lets both of them consistently check Blaziken and force it out.</p>",

However, Blaziken’s frailty and middling initial Speed tier mean it struggles immensely to find setup opportunities. The likes of Ash-Greninja and Choice Scarf Landorus-T easily revenge kill it, and it tends to quickly faint to its own recoil. Flare Blitz is its main STAB move, hitting a large portion of the tier at least neutrally, including Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Clefable, and Rillaboom. Close Combat nails certain Fire-resistant and immune Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Heatran, as well as KOing Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Blissey without inflicting recoil damage. Thunder Punch allows Blaziken to nail bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro. Life Orb vastly improves Blaziken’s damage output, letting it score OHKOs on Toxapex, Gliscor, and Mega Garchomp when boosted.</p> <p>Due to Blaziken's low bulk, dual screens are practically a requirement to set up, so Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl work well with it. Pokemon like Hawlucha and Mega Gyarados appreciate Blaziken wearing down bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini. Since it struggles to break through its checks without chip damage, entry hazard setters such as Mew, Landorus-T, and Excadrill are good teammates. As Blaziken can struggle against bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Toxapex, Pokemon such as Serperior and Rillaboom that exploit them are superb partners. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain lets Blaziken set up consistently on Amoonguss and boosts its Thunder Punch damage, Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain stops moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet from revenge killing it, and Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain increases its longevity greatly in the face of recoil and chip damage.

Bulk Up, while appealing, wastes valuable turns of rain while simply not being better than any other available option. Liquidation's slightly higher Base Power than Waterfall might also look appealing, but it doesn't improve any notable damage rolls, and Waterfall's chance to flinch is more useful overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Physically bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Alomomola threaten out Mega Swampert due to the risk of a Scald burn. Rotom-W also forces out Mega Swampert with Will-O-Wisp while being immune or resistant to all of its STAB attacks. Toxapex cannot switch into Earthquake, but it can stomach an Earthquake from full health and threaten a Scald burn in return. However, Mega Swampert can use Flip Turn to bring in a teammate such as Manaphy or Zapdos to take advantage of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Rocky Helmet Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur take minimal damage from Mega Swampert's attacks and threaten it back with an OHKO from Giga Drain. Ferrothorn also threatens Mega Swampert with Power Whip, but it is exploitable due to how easily Mega Swampert and its teammates can wear it down, and it fears Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Priority moves bypass Mega Swampert's excellent Speed in rain. Rillaboom threatens to OHKO Mega Swampert with Grassy Glide, resists both of its STAB attacks, and is passively kept healthy due to Grassy Terrain, making it a very effective check. However, Rillaboom does have to beware catching an Ice Punch if it switches into Mega Swampert. Ash-Greninja can't switch in to Mega Swampert but threatens it with rain-boosted Water Shuriken. Other priority moves, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham's Fake Out and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, can wear Mega Swampert down quickly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon Outside of Rain</strong>: Mega Swampert's dependence on rain to outspeed the entire metagame can be exploited by Pokemon such as Kyurem, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham when rain is not active. Mega Charizard Y deserves special mention, as it immediately removes rain while scaring out Mega Swampert with Solar Beam.</p>",

Earthquake hits most common Pokemon resistant to Waterfall, such as Toxapex, Kartana, and Gastrodon. Ice Punch hammers Garchomp and Kommo-o while also scoring a 2HKO on Mega Latias after Stealth Rock damage. Flip Turn allows Mega Swampert to act as an offensive pivot against threatening Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Slowbro for teammates such as Zapdos and Manaphy to take advantage of them.

Additionally, due to its poor matchup against bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Alomomola, teammates such as Ash-Greninja, Manaphy, and offensive Zapdos are important partners. Zapdos is an especially fantastic partner, as not only does it threaten Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth for Mega Swampert, but it can also defensively handle Rillaboom. Mega Swampert also helps the aforementioned teammates punch through Gastrodon and Ferrothorn while being immune to the Electric-type attacks that they are commonly weak to. Finally, Ferrothorn is an especially nice partner, as it provides entry hazards to weaken Mega Swampert's checks while defensively answering Ash-Greninja and Kyurem.</p>"

Tapu Lele is much more useful in matchups outside of bulky teams while still maintaining the ability to tear down balance teams, has the ability to hold items to further increase its power, and boasts a stronger Psychic-type STAB attack under Psychic Terrain. Mega Gardevoir also is unable to outperform Clefable, Reuniclus, Tapu Fini, or Mega Latias as a Fairy- or Psychic-type Calm Mind sweeper, due to their respective individual advantages over it such as an immunity to damage from status, access to recovery options, or better bulk.

Mystical Fire allows Mega Gardevoir to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, which otherwise wall it. Focus Blast can be used to let Mega Gardevoir hit Heatran, which otherwise walls it; however, this choice leaves Mega Gardevoir struggling to break past Corviknight and Mega Scizor. Taunt is used to cripple Chansey, Blissey and Slowking by preventing their recovery, letting it break past these Pokemon, as well as preventing it from being statused, which can cut into its longevity and its nifty Speed tier. Trace is the chosen pre-Mega Evolution ability in order to potentially give Gardevoir a free switch in against the likes of Heatran or Gastrodon. Healing Wish and Will-O-Wisp can also be used to utilize Mega Gardevoir’s vast supportive options; however, running these moves severely limits Mega Gardevoir’s wallbreaking capabilities, and as a result it is greatly outperformed by Pokemon such as Clefable and Mew due to their superior recovery options and longevity. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Gardevoir wallbreaking early-game, such as Rillaboom and Bisharp, serve as great teammates. Mega Gardevoir should never be used on any serious team as the few advantages it has over its other competitors don't even come close to outweighing the cons.

Shedinja's teammates, specifically Mega Sableye, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, commonly carry Knock Off, which causes Poltergeist to fail. Shadow Claw doesn't need items to be intact and also has more PP than Poltergeist, but it is incredibly weak and makes contact, meaning Shedinja is vulnerable to Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage.

Toxic and Will-O-Wisp allow Shedinja to capitalize on the switches that it forces by crippling the incoming Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats immune to Toxic such as Kartana and Mega Scizor.

Knock Off is used to remove Leftovers from key threats like specially defensive Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Corviknight. Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers that may try to advantage of Mega Sableye, like Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp, along with crippling Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T, letting Mega Sableye keep Stealth Rock off the field.

Additionally, faster defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Moltres can outrun Mega Mawile and hit it super effectively; they can also punish Mega Mawile with adverse contact effects.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Rocky Helmet Skarmory reliably checks non-Focus Punch Mega Mawile with chip damage and Iron Defense boosts. Heatran outruns Mega Mawile, resists Play Rough, and forces it out with the threat of an OHKO. However, Heatran must be cautious of Fighting coverage or Knock Off if attempting to switch in, and +2 Sucker Punch can take it down after some chip. Substitute + Z-Move Magnezone can also trap Mega Mawile fairly easily, but it must be careful not to switch into super effective coverage or a boosted Sucker Punch. Melmetal is a decent check as well, but it is outsped by Mega Mawile and can't safely switch into super effective coverage options or boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Excadrill are capable of checking Mega Mawile offensively, and some, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and the rarer Hippowdon, are capable of switching into certain Mega Mawile sets. They must be careful of being chipped into range of a boosted Sucker Punch, however, and many of them fear Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mega Mawile only uses attacks that make contact, so it is vulnerable to getting chipped down by Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs. This is especially effective when the targets pivot around Mega Mawile to chip it down. This can limit its longevity in certain matchups against users like Ferrothorn, Rocky Helmet Corviknight, or Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, where it would otherwise be a massive threat.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Mawile struggles against Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Y, Volcarona, and Moltres, with the latter two threatening to burn it with Flame Body. Defensive Volcarona is also extremely annoying for Mega Mawile that lack Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Mega Mawile is an extremely dangerous wallbreaker and sweeper. It's Huge Power-boosted Attack stat combined with Swords Dance and good coverage allows it to annihilate common defensive Pokemon, such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Clefable. Additionally, Sucker Punch puts pressure on faster offensive threats, such as Heatran, Garchomp, Victini, Magnezone and Kartana especially when boosted. Mega Mawile's decent natural bulk, great defensive typing, and Intimidate before it Mega Evolves give it set up opportunities against physical attackers like Rillaboom, Weavile, and Tyranitar. Knock Off gives Mega Mawile neutral coverage against Fairy-resistant foes such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Melmetal. Thunder Punch, on the other hand, gives up the coverage provided by Knock Off to hit Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Skarmory super effectively. The given Speed allows Mega Mawile to outrun Skarmory, with the rest dumped into HP to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Mega Mawile is a good fit on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and sweeping potential. Mega Mawile enjoys pivoting support that can get it in safely while also potentially wearing down its checks, such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Additionally, the latter three check Heatran, which Mega Mawile can struggle against. Mega Mawile appreciates entry hazard support from users like Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Greninja to weaken its checks like Heatran and Landorus-T. These entry hazards can also wear down fast Pokemon that aren't OHKOed by +2 Sucker Punch, such as Ash-Greninja, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny. Alternatively, defensive partners such as Landorus-T and Gastrodon can help Mega Mawile cover opposing threats such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Heatran. Many teams also enjoy Mega Mawile acting as a decent interim check to Weavile; this can give teams relying on physically defensive Pokemon that are weak to Weavile, such as Landorus-T and Zapdos, some breathing room.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>All-out attacker Mega Mawile sacrifices some of its anti-offense tools for better coverage against traditional defensive cores. Ice Punch allows Mega Mawile to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, and Thunder Punch puts pressure on Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight. Fire Fang destroys Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana with the notable exception of Heatran. Brick Break is an alternative to Fire Fang that also hits Heatran, Magnezone, and Melmetal, but leaves Mega Mawile unable to break through Mega Scizor. Focus Punch is a more prediction reliant but rewarding option that hits most neutral targets for extreme damage while also allowing Mega Mawile to beat Mega Scizor and Iron Defense Skarmory. Intimidate is the preferred ability to weaken attacks from the likes of Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Rillaboom. 204 Speed EVs are enough to outspeed Mega Scizor, but an alternative EV spread of 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe is preferred on sets without Fire Fang or Focus Punch.</p> <p>All-out attacker Mega Mawile fits best on teams that appreciate its ability to break down common balance cores for faster teammates. Late-game cleaners, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Weavile, appreciate Mega Mawile pressuring common defensive core staples such as Landorus-T, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn; these Pokemon also shore up Mega Mawile's subpar offense matchup. Spikes support from Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja is also helpful to wear down some of Mega Mawile's checks like Heatran, Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Pivoting support from the likes of Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, Slowbro, and Rotom-W can give Mega Mawile safe switch ins. Notably, Landorus-T and Rotom-W can force out Heatran for Mega Mawile, and Rotom-W and Slowbro can pressure irritating Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor, therefore reducing the need for Mega Mawile to predict these Pokemon switching in. Paralysis support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Serperior, and Clefable can also help out Mega Mawile against faster teams.</p>"

Drain Punch may also seem appealing due to its heightened accuracy and recovery when compared to High Jump Kick, but it lacks power. Similarly, Poison Jab appears attractive to break Clefable, but it offers little else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Mega Latias, and Mew resist both of Mega Medicham's STAB attacks and can use it as setup fodder. However, Mega Latias must be wary of Ice Punch. Mew is especially dangerous, as it can burn Mega Medicham with Will-O-Wisp, effectively taking it out of commission. Also, both Slowbro and Slowking will wall Mega Medicham lacking Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Aegislash and Gengar are immune to High Jump Kick, threatening to switch in and cause crash damage whenever Mega Medicham uses the move, and threaten it back with Shadow Ball. In spite of this, Gengar cannot freely switch into Mega Medicham due to its poor bulk and Zen Headbutt. Aegislash can also revenge kill Mega Medicham easily with Shadow Sneak. Mega Sableye is particularly problematic, as it is immune to both of Mega Medicham's STAB attacks and takes minimal damage from its coverage moves, all while threatening to burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Mega Medicham's mediocre bulk and middling Speed, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Weavile can outspeed and inflict massive damage onto it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Mega Medicham's average bulk leave it vulnerable to strong priority the likes of Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Mega Mawile or Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko can take a hit and threaten to OHKO Mega Medicham back. They can't sustainably switch into hits, though, as they either lack recovery or cannot switch directly into Zen Headbutt. Clefable deserves special mention, as Bold Clefable can repeatedly hold off Mega Medicham, though it runs the risk of being flinched by Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Though lacking recovery, defensive Landorus-T can cause Mega Medicham to take massive amounts of Rocky Helmet chip damage. It does have to watch out for Ice Punch variants of Mega Medicham, though.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: High Jump Kick crash damage can be fatal for Mega Medicham.

Fake Out allows Mega Medicham to wear down and potentially revenge kill faster offensive threats, such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile. Zen Headbutt nails the Poison, Flying, and Fairy-types that resist High Jump Kick, such as Toxapex, Zapdos, and Clefable. Ice Punch slams Mega Latias and Mega Latios, as well as eliminating Gliscor and Landorus-T immediately rather than wearing them down with Zen Headbutt. Bullet Punch can allow Mega Medicham to revenge kill Mega Diancie, as well as remove Pokemon like Weavile, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko in tandem with Fake Out. Thunder Punch hammers Slowbro, Moltres, Slowking, and Tapu Fini while also damaging Mega Sableye. Telepathy is the preferred ability to take less damage from opposing Ditto that copy Medicham prior to Mega Evolution. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Mega Medicham to make use of its base 100 Speed, notably outspeeding Gliscor, Tapu Lele, and offensive Landorus-T. An Adamant nature can also be utilized, notably scoring 2HKOes on Slowbro with Thunder Punch and Clefable with Zen Headbutt. The loss in Speed, however, is detrimental, as it leaves Mega Medicham vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Specs Kyurem, offensive Landorus-T, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Due to Mega Medicham's mediocre bulk, pivots such as Slowbro, Blissey, and Corviknight are great partners to allow it free entry. Knock Off or Toxic support is very useful to break defensive cores more effectively. Most notably, poisoning Slowbro and removing Clefable's Leftovers let Mega Medicham 2HKO them. Entry hazard support is also phenomenal due to the amount of switches Mega Medicham forces, which let it accumulate a great deal of residual damage on the opponent's team. This makes Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Greninja very strong partners. Additionally, Pursuit support is invaluable given how much Mega Medicham struggles with Ghost- and Psychic-types, so Weavile and Tyranitar can aid Mega Medicham's ability to wallbreak greatly. Also, Pokemon like Gengar and Ash-Greninja can threated Ghost- and Psychic-types while also benefitting from the amount of pressure Mega Medicham applies to Blissey. Tapu Koko is also quite a good partner, as it powers up Mega Medicham's Thunder Punch with Electric Terrain, allowing it to 2HKO Slowbro. Tapu Lele adds Psychic Terrain to power up Mega Medicham's Zen Headbutt, notably letting it score a 2HKO on Bold Clefable. However, be aware that Psychic Terrain will render Mega Medicham unable to use Fake Out. Mega Medicham is best used as a mid-game wallbreaker, so late-game wincons such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Calm Mind Tapu Lele synergize well with it.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp provides Torkoal with a consistent way to burn switch-ins; however, it is often not worth running over its other support options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert easily force out Torkoal, although the former gets worn down quickly and the latter fears a Lava Plume burn. Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Toxapex easily switch into Torkoal, although the former two hate getting poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp and Landorus-T pressure out Torkoal, although they cannot safely switch in due without risking a Lava Plume burn. Gliscor is immune to status after its Toxic Orb activates and can easily heal off the damage from Lava Plume with Poison Heal. All three are also Stealth Rock setters that Torkoal is unable to Rapin Spin in front of, and Gliscor can also Defog Torkoal's own Stealth Rock away.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Torkoal's lack of recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock means it's quickly worn down over the course of a game which limits the amount of support Torkoal can provide for its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather Setters</strong>: Both Tyranitar and Pelipper can switch into Torkoal and easily force it out and reset the weather, with Tyranitar also able to Pursuit trap it; however, the former folds to Body Press and dislikes being burned by Lava Plume, and both hate Toxic. Alolan Ninetales is unable to switch into Torkoal, and can't really do much back, but it can reset the weather, which forces Torkoal out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Due to how Torkoal's main role in dedicated sun teams is setting the sun, Torkoal despises getting its Heat Rock knocked off. Pokemon such as Kartana and Weavile often force Torkoal to sacrifice its Heat Rock in order for it to check them sufficiently.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Torkoal is a staple for dedicated Sun teams in the tier due to Drought and its ability to hold a Heat Rock, unlike its competitor Mega Charizard Y, which lets it provide extra turns of sun to enable dangerous wallbreakers and sweepers like Blaziken, Victini, and Venusaur. It provides additional utility for its team with access to Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, as well as the ability to spread status effects with Lava Plume, Yawn, and Toxic. Its high physical bulk and high burn chance with Lava Plume allows it to check threats like Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile. However, its weakness to Stealth Rock, low Special bulk, and lack of recovery make it easily taken advantage of by Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Hydreigon, and Heatran. Lava Plume is Torkoal's STAB move of choice, threatening burns on common switch-ins such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Tyranitar. Rapid Spin is extremely helpful for Torkoal's partners, as they are often also weak to Stealth Rock. Body Press allows it to pressure Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ash-Greninja, all three of which threaten sun teams, while also letting it win the weather war against the former. Yawn allows it to dissuade switch-ins, as sleep can create a free setup opportunity for its teammates. Toxic allows it to put Pelipper, Mega Latios, Gastrodon, and Kommo-o on a timer.</p> <p>Due to Torkoal's extremely specific niche, it only fits on dedicated sun teams. Venusaur, in particular, is a mainstay alongside Torkoal, as sun doubles Venusaur's Speed, doubles Growth's effectiveness, and boosts its Weather Ball. Venusaur, in return, pressures Water- and Ground-types that threaten Torkoal out. Strong wallbreakers such as Blaziken and Victini greatly appreciate Torkoal boosting the power of their Fire-type STAB moves, making them nigh unwallable. Pokemon that resist Water- and Fire-type moves like Hydreigon, Tapu Fini, and Kommo-o also work well alongside it, as they deal with both Ash-Greninja and Heatran which can be issues for dedicated sun teams. Mega Garchomp is a stellar partner alongside Torkoal, as it takes advantage of sand teams, which sun has struggles against otherwise, while also using Torkoal's Drought to boost Fire Fang's damage, allowing it to break through checks like Skarmory and Corviknight easier. Lastly, other entry hazard removal options such as Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Landorus-T alleviate Torkoal's weakness to Stealth Rock, allowing it to stay alive longer.</p>"

Heal Bell or Refresh over Earthquake allows Mega Altaria to care much less about status, although the coverage loss is often not worth it. Other STAB options such as Facade and Body Slam can be used over Frustration, with the former letting Mega Altaria take advantage of being statused, and the latter spreading paralysis, although these are much more situational and inconsistent, making them less useful overall. Lastly, a bulky special attacking set utilizing Hyper Voice, Flamethrower, and a utility move could hone in on Mega Altaria's unique defensive capabilities but gets worn down incredibly easily and doesn't make much progress.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor and Skarmory hard wall Mega Altaria, taking negligible damage from both its attacks and healing up safely, and they can take advantage of it by either using Swords Dance or laying down Spikes. Other Steel-types such as Melmetal and Ferrothorn are also solid checks, but they are prone to being worn down by entry hazards and repeated Earthquakes.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Status completely neutralizes Mega Altaria. Poison and burn sink its longevity and damage output, and, although less detrimental than the former two, paralysis makes it much easier to revenge kill and reduces its setup opportunities. The rare Facade, Heal Bell, and Refresh make Mega Altaria much more resilient to status.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to its middling Speed tier even at +1, Mega Altaria is still outsped and forced out by a plethora of faster Pokemon such as Weavile, Protean Greninja, Kartana, and common Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T after a boost. However, none of these Pokemon can safely switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable can take unboosted hits from Mega Altaria and pressure it out with Moonblast and Thunder Wave, although it falters to two boosted Frustrations. Mega Mawile and Tapu Fini can take a boosted attack and retaliate if healthy but are unable to switch in safely. Other Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko outspeed it after a Dragon Dance and force it out if brought in safely, but they can't switch in on their own due to their frailty.</p>",

However, its average Speed tier and relatively poor damage output without multiple boosts make it mediocre in practice. Frustration is Mega Altaria's best attacking move, its already solid Base Power further bolstered by Pixilate and STAB, denting even resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Corviknight hard when boosted. Earthquake allows Mega Altaria to pressure Steel- and Poison-types, which resist Fairy, such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Melmetal. The given EV spread allows Mega Altaria to 2HKO defensive Clefable at +1, survive two Mega Lopunny Frustrations—allowing Mega Altaria to set up on it—and outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem after a Dragon Dance. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to take hits from Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja better.</p> <p>Mega Altaria fits on bulky teams that can wear down its checks like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Mega Scizor to facilitate a late-game sweep.

In return, these Pokemon provide a solid defensive backbone against Steel- and Ice-types such as Mega Scizor, Melmetal, and Weavile. Entry hazards such as Spikes from Greninja and the aforementioned Ferrothorn enormously benefit Mega Altaria, as they help wear down its checks into range of its boosted attacks. Pokemon such as Heatran and Fightinium Z Kartana work extremely well with Mega Altaria, as they force out, pressure, and force damage on the Steel-types that check it. Magnezone in particular deserves a special mention, as it can instantly trap and remove pesky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, paving the way for a Mega Altaria sweep. Volcarona with Psychic, Electrium Z Rotom-W, and Groundium Z Greninja bait in and remove Toxapex, which Mega Altaria can struggle to break through.</p>"

It even eviscerates defensive Pokemon like Clefable, specially defensive Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. However, its middling Speed and bulk limit its switch-in opportunities. Knock Off is Crawdaunt’s most spammable move, letting it cripple switch-ins by removing their items and KOing the bulky Grass-types that attempt to tank a boosted hit. Crabhammer nets KOs on Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Tyranitar. Aqua Jet lets Crawdaunt pick off weakened foes, clean late-game, and revenge kill Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Diancie that would otherwise end a sweep. Waterium Z is the preferred item, as it gives Crawdaunt a one-time nuke on many of its usual switch-ins and almost always KOes a neutral target, while Life Orb is a secondary option to pull off ridiculous feats such as OHKOing physically defensive Tangrowth and Toxapex after a boost.</p> <p>Crawdaunt fits on bulky offense teams that can safely bring it in multiple times throughout the match; it therefore appreciates slow pivoting from the likes of Corviknight, Slowbro, and Slowking. Reliable speed control such as Mega Lopunny complement this further by helping to deal with faster teams, while Crawdaunt shreds through bulkier teams for them. As Crawdaunt is prone to being revenge killed by even resisted and neutral hits due to its pitiful defences, a strong defensive core to fall back on complements it perfectly. Specifically, checks to offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Serperior such as Corviknight and Zapdos deny these Pokemon a free boost or KO each time it comes in.

Aqua Jet is Crawdaunt’s main way of damaging faster foes that threaten to revenge kill it such as Mega Lopunny, Zeraora, and Tapu Koko, doing over half to all three of them. Knock Off synergizes well with Crabhammer due to most of the tier’s Dark-resistant Pokemon fearing Crabhammer, which is also Crawdaunt's hardest hitting move. Crunch is the usual fourth option for Choice Band Crawdaunt, as it provides a secondary STAB option if the target has already lost its item or uses a Mega Stone or Z-Crystal. Close Combat is an extremely niche option and is used for nailing Hydreigon, which can switch in to scout Crawdaunt’s move, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Crawdaunt fits perfectly on VoltTurn teams that can repeatedly bring it in to further pressure the opponent. A good defensive core that focuses on bringing Crawdaunt in is a must, with Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Slowbro, and Slowking as Crawdaunt is extremely susceptible to being revenge killed and is a huge momentum sink after getting a KO.

        "description": "<p>Mega Latias is incredibly hard to knock out thanks to its good defensive typing, which lets it check multiple threatening Pokemon, notably Rillaboom, Mega Charizard Y, and Urshifu-R, access to Levitate, and amazing base stats; notably, it packs a stellar Speed stat for a defensive Pokemon, outspeeding common threats such as Kartana, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele. These traits allow it to find multiple opportunities to set up Calm Mind throughout a match. This, in tandem with its diverse movepool, makes it a fantastic sweeper on bulky teams. Psyshock is the preferred Psychic-type move, as it's able to hit Chansey and Blissey and also allows Mega Latias to beat opposing Calm Mind users such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Reuniclus by hitting their unboosted Defense stat. It's nicely complemented by Aura Sphere, which hits Steel- and Dark-types that resist Psyshock, like Heatran, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Mystical Fire can also be used, as it hits Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn harder, as well as giving it a way to hit Mega Sableye. However, with enough boosts, Latias can break through the former two, and without Aura Sphere, Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, and Hydreigon are able to freely come in on Latias and beat it.</p> <p>Mega Latias fits incredibly well on balance teams, where its defensive qualities can be supported by other Pokemon, like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight, to create incredibly tough defensive cores. They also help check Pokemon that threaten Latias, like Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Mega Garchomp. Offensive teammates such as Weavile, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Calm Mind Clefable are also useful for pressuring Pokemon that check Latias, like Reuniclus, Heatran, Toxapex, and Weavile. Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Ash-Greninja can pivot into Mega Latias and threaten it with their STAB attacks. As such pairing it up with Pokemon that resist Dark like Buzzwole, Clefable, and Tapu Fini is greatly appreciated. Mega Latias is also incredibly prone to being chipped down long term, either by status from foes like Toxapex, Blissey, and Heatran, or by Stealth Rock. As such, teammates that can help mitigate these weaknesses are incredibly useful. Status absorbers such as Chansey, Clefable, and Gliscor are incredibly potent teammate for Latias; the former two are also able to provide Latias with cleric support, which can relieve it of any status conditions. Defog support from teammates like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Gliscor is also incredibly valuable for removing Stealth Rock, which bothers Latias.</p>"

      "BoltBeam": {
        "description": "<p>The near-perfect coverage of Ice Beam and Thunder makes it incredibly hard to switch into Mega Latias, especially once it is boosted. It also gives it better defensive utility, as it checks foes like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Manaphy, and Rockium Z Garchomp. Thanks to its defensive profile, it can be run alongside offensive Pokemon like Weavile, Greninja, or Kartana. Thunder is preferred over Thunderbolt, as despite its inaccuracy, its increased chance to paralyze lets Latias potentially beat Pokemon like Clefable, Reuniclus, and Toxapex. However, it's unfortunately very weak against neutral foes when unboosted, which causes it to require more support in terms of entry hazards and status effects. Due to the lack of Psyshock, it struggles against opposing Calm Mind users.</p> <p>Due to Latias's lack of immediate power, entry hazard support from teammates like Clefable, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can help it wear down checks like Heatran, Gastrodon, and Mega Tyranitar. Other bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable, Bulk Up Corviknight, and Swords Dance Gliscor appreciate Latias's ability to spread paralysis with Thunder to defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Ferrothorn, allowing these teammates to find more setup opportunities to devastate opposing teams. Teammates like Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clefable appreciate Latias's ability to check Manaphy and offensive Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, making them stellar teammates.</p>"

      "Stored Power": {
        "description": "<p>Stored Power Mega Latias trades immediate power and defensive utility for the potential to become a devastating Calm Mind sweeper, capable of breaking through every non-Dark-type Pokemon in the tier. This set forgoes a secondary coverage move in favor of utility moves that help Latias with some of its biggest issues and can even allow it to use status-reliant checks like Gastrodon, Heatran, and Ferrothorn as setup fodder. Substitute lets it dodge status conditions; however, it has to play more carefully around them, as it cannot directly switch into them. It also comes with the added benefit of allowing Latias to dodge critical hits and pesky secondary effects from foes like Greninja, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele while also allowing it to escape from Weavile and Tyranitar's Pursuit. Refresh allows Latias to shrug off status conditions from foes like Toxapex, Clefable, Heatran, and Landorus-T. This lets it stay healthy and not force it to Roost as much, making it more efficient at sweeping; it also makes it easier to set up on the aforementioned foes, as Latias doesn't have to worry about getting crippled by status. Reflect Type can be used to copy the type from foes like Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, allowing it to ignore their status moves and resist their and other foes', like Mega Mawile, Ash-Greninja, and Hydreigon, attacks.</p> <p>Because Mega Latias needs time to set up in order to be threatening, and it is practically useless until it sets up, pairing it with other setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor or Calm Mind Reuniclus help should Mega Latias fail to find a setup opportunity. Teammates such as Choice Band Weavile and Heatran that present an immediate offensive presence complement Latias nicely. Due to this set's complete inability to hurt Dark-types like Weavile, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Ash-Greninja, pairing it with status spreaders like Heatran, Gliscor, and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex is near mandatory; furthermore, teammates that can deal with these Dark-types, like Tapu Fini, Buzzwole, and Clefable, make for stellar teammates. Since it needs to boost to function properly, Latias is completely walled by Haze Toxapex, and as such, teammates that can take advantage of it like Tapu Lele, Gliscor, and Whirlpool Tapu Fini make for good teammates.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mystical Fire is an option over Aura Sphere in order to hit Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor harder, but leaves Mega Latios walled by Heatran. Draco Meteor can be used over Ice Beam to give Mega Latios a strong nuke, netting KOs on Mega Medicham and Mega Latias, as well as chipped Victini; however the Special Attack drop makes Mega Latios much less effective at wallbreaking and at checking Grass- and Ground-types. Substitute can also be used over Ice Beam to bypass status, but this reduces its longevity and means it has fewer coverage options. Earthquake can be used over Aura Sphere to allow Mega Latios to always KO Heatran, although it forces Mega Latios to use a Naive nature and does not hit Mega Tyranitar as hard. A set utilizing Calm Mind might seem appealing, but this role is better accomplished by its counterpart in Mega Latias due to the latter's superior bulk allowing for more setup opportunities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Weavile can easily force out Mega Latios with their STAB moves. Pursuit from the latter three can also consistently trap and KO Latios. However, all of these Pokemon have to fear Aura Sphere when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran, Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn can easily force Mega Latios out with their strong STAB moves or cripple it with status. However, they fear its coverage options in Aura Sphere or Mystical Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko force out Mega Latios with their STAB moves, although they can be overpowered by repeated hits from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated special walls such as Chansey, Blissey, and Gastrodon stonewall Mega Latios, as they are able to tank any of its moves, recover back any damage it deals to them, and punish it with a status move.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Latios functions as a strong special wallbreaker, thanks to its amazing Special Attack stat and impressive coverage. It also has a good Speed tier, notably outspeeding key threats such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Hydreigon. It also has great defensive utility that, thanks to its natural bulk and typing, lets it come in on threats like Kartana, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran. However, despite its good coverage, Mega Latios struggles to fit all the moves it wants to have. Variants without Psychic struggle to break past Toxapex and Clefable cores, while ones with Psychic are walled by Slowking and Corviknight and can't consistently break through Tapu Fini. Furthermore, Mega Latios is susceptible to being Pursuit trapped by Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and struggles to break past the numerous Fairy- and Psychic-types that plague the tier, such as Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus. Psychic is Mega Latios’s main STAB option, letting it pressure foes like Toxapex and Clefable. Thunder can be used instead for its ability to 2HKO Slowking, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini while still maintaining the ability to hit Toxapex, although by forgoing Psychic, Mega Latios loses out on having a consistent STAB option against Clefable and Toxapex. Aura Sphere nails Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Weavile. Ice Beam allows Mega Latios to be a consistent check to Grass- and Ground-types such as Rillaboom, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Serperior.</p> <p>Mega Latios fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence alongside its defensive utility. Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Kartana that appreciate Mega Latios pressuring common defensive staples such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini work well with it. Steel-types such as Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight are amazing partners because they can switch into the Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves. In return, Mega Latios can pivot into Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks. Entry hazard support from Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T are greatly appreciated by Mega Latios, as entry hazards chip its checks, such as Tyranitar and Toxapex, into OHKO range. Pursuit support from Weavile and Tyranitar helps Mega Latios by removing bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias, allowing it to make progress more easily. Magnezone is a terrific partner alongside Mega Latios, removing pesky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Zen Headbutt can be run over Trick or Healing Wish on the Choice Scarf set, as they target Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Garchomp, and Toxapex, but sacrificing this utility in exchange for extra coverage is often not worth it. A specially defensive set with Iron Head / U-turn and two of Stealth Rock / Wish / Protect lets Jirachi act as a solid pivot that can provide Wish and Stealth Rock support while fulfilling an important defensive niche in checking Psychic- and Fairy-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Heatran, Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Jirachi’s Iron Head and U-turn. Mega Scizor, Firium Z Heatran, and Ghostium Z Aegislash are particularly dangerous, as they’re immune to Trick, while Ferrothorn can wear down Jirachi with Iron Barbs. However, specially defensive Heatran and Ferrothorn must be wary of Trick, as losing their Leftovers and being Choice-locked does them no favors.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex and Slowbro don’t mind Iron Head and don’t even need to risk a flinch while healing thanks to Regenerator. In the meantime, both can burn Jirachi, Toxapex can remove its Choice Scarf with Knock Off, and Slowbro can set up Future Sight or Teleport out. Jirachi is able to Trick them, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona, Heatran and Mega Charizard Y easily stomach all of Jirachi’s attacks and hit back with their powerful STAB moves. All three can also avoid Trick provided the former two run a Z-Crystal.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp, defensive Landorus-T, and Gliscor are capable of switching into Jirachi and eliminating it with STAB Earthquake. The former two can wear down Jirachi with Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet, respectively, while Gliscor easily switches in thanks to Poison Heal and it not caring about Trick after its Toxic Orb has activated. Garchomp and Landorus-T need to be wary of Trick, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most Electric-types easily switch into Jirachi thanks to their Steel resistance, and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Zapdos is especially troubling, as it has the potential to paralyze Jirachi with its ability, ruining its Speed. Magnezone can trap Jirachi locked into Iron Head and remove it with Thunderbolt. Rotom-W despises Trick, but it easily takes Iron Head and cripples Jirachi with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jirachi is a solid Choice Scarf user due to its decent Speed and access to a reliable and disruptive move in Iron Head. On top of that, Jirachi boasts a good defensive typing and great utility in U-turn, Trick, and Healing Wish. Iron Head is Jirachi’s main tool to revenge kill numerous Pokemon in Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Mega Diancie. In conjunction with Serene Grace, Iron Head can situationally defeat a wide range of additional threats as well, including Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. As Jirachi’s damage output is mediocre outside of Iron Head, the remaining three moves are dedicated to utility in order to make the best out of Jirachi’s solid defensive typing. U-turn allows Jirachi to capitalize on switch-ins and preserve momentum while letting its offensive teammates in for free. Healing Wish lets Jirachi completely heal a weakened teammate at the cost of sacrificing itself, offering offensive partners a second chance to break open or clean up the opponent’s team. Trick can allow Jirachi to cripple nearly every switch-in to it, as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos don’t like being locked into a move. Serene Grace gives Iron Head a 60% flinch chance, making it quite spammable against Pokemon that don’t resist Steel.</p> <p>Jirachi’s ability to fully heal a teammate is incredible for a number of offensive teammates, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Swords Dance Kartana. Its ability to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Heatran, and Slowbro with Trick and pivot out of them with U-turn is also fantastic for the aforementioned partners. Jirachi can act as a solid check to Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that may struggle with these threats like Mega Latias, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny make good teammates. As Jirachi lacks the necessary longevity to continuously withstand these Fairy- and Psychic-types, additional soft checks such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight are advisable teammates. Jirachi cannot reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ash-Greninja, so counterplay to these threats like bulky Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Blissey is essential. In addition, all of these Pokemon can form a pivoting core with Jirachi. Jirachi baits in Pokemon that aren’t bothered by its moves and can take advantage of it, like Heatran, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor. Jirachi’s best way of making progress against these Pokemon is either crippling them with Trick or pivoting out of them with U-turn into teammates that can exploit such as Garchomp, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p>"

However, Deoxys-D can often beat these Pokemon with Rocky Helmet, and Seismic Toss risks being affected by adverse contact effects like Static, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs. Deoxys-D can run Spikes, but such a set is completely outclassed by Mew, which boasts higher Speed and more utility in Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Weavile is capable of heavily denting Deoxys-D with Knock Off, which can also remove its item. Similarly, both Tyranitar formes can decimate it with Crunch and Ash-Greninja can 2HKO with Dark Pulse. However, all four cannot defeat Deoxys-D if it has gained enough Cosmic Power boosts, and risk losing to the combination of Rocky Helmet + Night Shade. Mega Sableye cannot directly threaten Deoxys-D, but can remove its item, burn it, and is effectively immune to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Chip damage from entry hazards usually cuts into Deoxys-D’s longevity too much, causing it to faint early. However, this can be avoided with solid entry hazard removal like Tapu Fini and careful play.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status hampers Deoxys-D's sweeping potential immensely. Paralysis slows it down and prevents it from utilizing Taunt, while burn and poison hamper its ability to stall out foes. While Taunt can stop slower status users, it cannot help against moves like Scald.</p> <p><strong>Regenerator</strong>: Regenerator in tandem with Pokemon like Gliscor or a Normal-type denies any progress Deoxys-D attempts to make, as foes can simply switch around its moves and status it or waste its PP.</p>",

Cosmic Power makes Deoxys-D nearly unbreakable; after a few boosts, it can even shrug off super effective damage from foes like Weavile. Above-average Speed in tandem with Taunt deters debilitating status from Melmetal, Chansey, and Landorus-T, opposing Taunt users like Heatran and Tapu Fini, and Toxapex’s attempts to remove its boosts with Haze. Taunt also denies recovery from walls like Clefable and Skarmory, allowing it to win the war of attrition. Night Shade lets Deoxys-D avoid adverse contact abilities like Iron Barbs and Static while dealing reliable damage to all but Normal-types. Maximum Speed investment gets the jump on Timid Heatran, allowing Deoxys-D to Taunt and wear it down. Rocky Helmet punishes the various physical attackers who attempt to deter Deoxys-D‘s setup, such as Mega Lopunny, Chansey, and Mega Tyranitar, making it less reliant on PP stalling them. Alternatively, Leftovers grants Deoxys-D passive healing, allowing it to negate residual damage and be less reliant on Recover.</p> <p>Deoxys-D fits best on balance teams with status spreaders and entry hazard support. In return, it can check certain wallbreakers like Mega Medicham and ease the matchup against opposing balance teams with Taunt. Dark-types like Weavile and Tyranitar can often be a huge annoyance to Deoxys-D, especially if it's unboosted, so checks to them like Clefable and Mega Lopunny are greatly appreciated. The former can directly switch into Dark-type attacks and use Knock Off to remove recovery items from Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Heatran, letting Deoxys-D beat them faster, while the latter offers revenge killing services against fast offensive Pokemon that may threaten Deoxys-D, such as the aforementioned Dark-types. Defog support can mitigate Deoxys-D's weakness to entry hazards, so Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini are great teammates. Tapu Fini also makes a great Weavile and Ash-Greninja check and defends against status with Misty Surge. Deoxys-D lacks utility beyond its niche and is relatively passive when unboosted, so it requires a solid defensive core composed of Pokemon like Clefable, Gliscor, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex. Ferrothorn and Skarmory are notable defensive partners that can lay down Spikes, which allows Deoxys-D to defeat Regenerator Pokemon by chipping them for more than they can heal. Offensive Heatran is also notable for luring and dealing heavy damage to Gliscor, who has the potential to outstall Deoxys-D. Clerics like Chansey and the aforementioned Clefable can cure debilitating status, letting Deoxys-D be more reckless where it wants to set up.</p>"

Offensive Grass-types such as Serperior, Kartana, and Rillaboom all force out Gastrodon with their STAB attacks, but the latter two fear a Scald burn and therefore struggle to switch in consistently. Coverage moves such as Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y and Energy Ball from Manaphy completely demolish Gastrodon as well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to its vulnerability to status and entry hazards, Gastrodon gets worn down incredibly quickly throughout the match, often getting easily overpowered in the long term by the Pokemon it would normally check.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to its mediocre physical bulk, strong physical wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile can overpower Gastrodon extremely quickly, but all fear a Scald burn, so they have to be careful when switching in.</p>",

However, it tends to get worn down and overpowered with constant offensive pressure, status effects, and entry hazards.

Due to Gastrodon's vulnerability to Toxic, Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable that can absorb and/or remove status effects work well with it.

Toxic and Thunder Wave can be run over U-turn in order to harass defensive answers, but they aren’t worth dropping the ability to reliably pivot on most teams. Quick Attack and Facade can be offensively useful, but only situationally. Healing Wish is an option but faces competition from Choice Scarf Jirachi, which boasts a better defensive typing, as well as the ability to effectively cripple walls before sacrificing itself.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: The likes of Toxapex, Bold Clefable, and defensive Zapdos can easily take all of Mega Lopunny’s attacks. However, all of these must be at or near full health, cannot switch in whatsoever if Future Sight also hits that turn - and bar Static Zapdos - are susceptible to a loss of momentum from U-turn. Slowbro can afford chip damage, but its Psychic typing exacerbates the effectiveness of Mega Lopunny’s U-turn. This can lead to scenarios where the combination of Return and U-turn either forces Slowbro to waste turns using Slack Off or risk being excessively whittled down over the course of the match.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Excadrill in sand, and Mega Swampert in rain can take advantage of Mega Lopunny’s defensive woes and either KO it outright or take advantage of the forced switch into a passive wall. However, none of these can switch in reliably, and they are additionally susceptible to being chipped down by Fake Out with the exception of Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Attackers with priority moves, such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Rillaboom, can easily revenge kill Mega Lopunny due to its awful defensive attributes. However, they cannot come in directly, struggle with Fake Out, and - with the exception of Rillaboom - require significant chip damage to actually KO Mega Lopunny.</p>",

Fake Out can force respectable chip damage onto faster threats and priority users, like Rillaboom and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and even slower attackers that it brings to KO range like Mega Medicham. U-turn takes advantage of how easily Mega Lopunny can force switches by keeping up momentum on the likes of Slowbro, Clefable, Toxapex, and Slowking. Ice Punch can be run over U-turn to handle Gliscor and Landorus-T more effectively, but Mega Lopunny loses out on a lot of offensive utility. Limber can prevent paralysis before Mega Evolving.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the Speed and ability to pivot on forced switches that it provides. As such, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kyurem, Ash-Greninja, and Choice Band Victini make excellent partners, and Mega Lopunny can clean up holes in cores they make. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Hydreigon also appreciate being pivoted into passive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Mega Lopunny’s defensive stats are quite subpar, so walls like Clefable and specially defensive Heatran are good partners. Pivots such as U-turn Greninja variants, Rotom-W, and Choice Band Rillaboom make great options as well to get Mega Lopunny in safely. Slowking and Slowbro deserve special mention, as they can fulfill the aforementioned defensive role while using Future Sight + Teleport to let Mega Lopunny break through almost all common counterplay options, such as Toxapex, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Magnezone can trap and remove common switch-ins to Mega Lopunny, like Mega Scizor and Corviknight, and pressure others like Clefable and Toxapex. Entry hazards from the likes of Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Garchomp are fantastic with Mega Lopunny in order to maximize the pressure it places on defensive cores and chip down foes into Fake Out range faster.

Furthermore, Mega Lopunny's extremely high Speed stat allows it to utilize Power-Up Punch extremely well, as it is hard to revenge kill, and teams often rely on defensive checks to it. However, due to this set lacking the ability to pivot on defensive switch-ins, it is forced to rely on Encore to break down its defensive checks, which can sometimes prove inconsistent due to its predictability once the set is revealed, such as relying on Corviknight or Clefable to instantly use their recovery move when they get attacked instead of retaliating. Power-Up Punch allows Mega Lopunny to function as a potent cleaner in the late-game. Encore functions alongside Power-Up Punch to use passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Skarmory as setup fodder by locking them into their recovery to boost its Attack stat with Power-Up Punch as these Pokemon are left unable to retaliate. Limber is the chosen ability to allow Lopunny to avoid paralysis before it Mega Evolves to let it pressure Static Zapdos.</p> <p>Power-Up Punch + Encore Mega Lopunny fits on a wide array of team archetypes, from offense to balance. Due to its ability to lure and eliminate or severely chip down multiple key threats such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable, teammates like Weavile, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem work extremely well with it, as they complement each other offensively. Ash-Greninja and Weavile, in particular, also help secure Mega Lopunny's shakier matchup against offensive teams. Although Mega Lopunny can lure and eliminate these Pokemon, it is unable to beat them in a 1v1 scenario; thus, the likes of Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Victini are common partners. Furthermore, the aforementioned Pokemon can also threaten the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Tangrowth, which can cause issues for Mega Lopunny. Pokemon which can set entry hazards such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T are stellar partners, as the additional chip damage generated by the hazards allows Mega Lopunny to break its checks like Corviknight much easier, as well as wear down foes for it to clean late-game. Lastly, as Mega Lopunny can't switch into offensive threats due to its poor defensive capabilities, defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are necessary alongside it, and they can also switch into the likes of Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T, which can revenge kill it.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scale Shot can be run to turn regular Garchomp into a sweeper, but it is generally outclassed in this role by its Mega counterpart. Due to its stellar bulk and good defensive ability in Rough Skin, Garchomp can also run a defensive Stealth Rock set with a Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin to rack up chip damage against opposing physical attackers, However, this set is outclassed in this role by Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and is unsuitable for checking anything in the long run. Garchomp can also run a mixed Life Orb set with Draco Meteor or Fire Blast to bait in and punish physical walls that would usually give Garchomp problems, though Garchomp’s poor Special Attack makes the set difficult to pull off consistently, and this set is also outclassed by its Mega Evolution. Endure is a niche option on its Tank set as a last-ditch effort to wear down Pokemon such as Weavile, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet, although it is quite hard to slot it over Garchomp's other move options. A mixed offensive Stealth Rock set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast not only lures and beats common Mega Garchomp answers such as Tangrowth and Skarmory, but it also sets up Stealth Rock and overpowers common entry hazard control options such as Mega Sableye, Corviknight, and Kartana. However, this set becomes easy to counterplay after it's been revealed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that have good physical bulk and don't take super effective damage from any of Garchomps common moves like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon can survive any unboosted hit from Garchomp and force it out with status or super effective coverage moves. Pokemon with Unaware such as Clefable and Quagsire can also completely stop Garchomp from wallbreaking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Naturally fast Pokemon or Choice Scarf users like Greninja, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, Weavile, and Ice Beam Latias can revenge kill Garchomp. Priority users like Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Scizor can also knock out a weakened Garchomp but they don't enjoy the chip from Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Garchomp absolutely hates status conditions, as all of them severely cripple its wallbreaking capabilities and defensive utility. Scald burns from Slowbro, Slowking or Gastrodon seriously limit its wallbreaking potential, while Toxic poisoning from Clefable, Blissey, or Gliscor will seriously dent its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Corviknight</strong>: Garchomp cannot reliably break either Skarmory or Corviknight without Continental Crush. Iron Defense or Bulk Up variants of these two will completely wall Garchomp; not only can they clear Garchomp's Stealth Rock with Defog, but they can set their own hazards up as well.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Mega Garchomp's crippling weakness to Ice-types leaves it vulnerable to the likes of Weavile and Kyurem, both of which outspeed and force it out. Faster Pokemon that tend to run Ice-type coverage moves such as Greninja, Mega Latias, and Zeraora can also revenge kill Mega Garchomp, unless its Speed has been boosted.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Because of Scale Shot's lowering of Defense, it leaves Mega Garchomp vulnerable to be revenge killed by physical priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: The likes of Buzzwole, Landorus-T, and Slowbro temporarily hinder Mega Garchomp with status. The former two are also prone to Intimidate shuffling, and Buzzwole and Slowbro threaten Mega Garchomp with Ice-type coverage moves. Tangrowth gets chip damage on Mega Garchomp between Rocky Helmet and Hidden Power Ice. Slowbro, with its insane Defense stat, eats most hits from Mega Garchomp. However, Mega Garchomp eventually breaks through even these physical walls thanks to Swords Dance quickly raising Mega Garchomp's attacking power.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Because of its stellar Attack, good STAB combination and coverage moves, solid Speed tier, and above average bulk, Garchomp is one of the premier offensive Stealth Rock setters and wallbreakers in the tier. It also has some solid defensive utility with its typing, letting it provide an Electric immunity and check common Pokemon like Heatran and non-Hidden Power Zapdos. Swords Dance allows Garchomp to beat a lot of common Defoggers like Zapdos, Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, allowing it to easily keep Stealth Rock up. Rockium Z with Stone Edge gives Garchomp a strong Rock-type move to beat Defoggers like Zapdos and Corviknight. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Outrage allows Garchomp to deliver a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and it can also catch a Mega Latias expecting a Stone Edge off guard. However, having a much worse matchup against Corviknight and Skarmory and the lack of a spammable STAB move once Devastating Drake has been used, make Dragonium Z an inferior option overall. Rough Skin is the preferred ability on most sets, as it punishes physical attackers like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha.</p> <p>Due to its role as both a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, Garchomp fits best on offensive teams, where it can be paired up with teammates that enjoy its ability to break down or threaten out bulkier Pokemon like Toxapex, Zapdos, and Blissey. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham make for stellar teammates, as they benefit from its ability to break down defensive foes like Zapdos, Slowbro, and Corviknight. The former three can also bring Garchomp in safely on defensive Pokemon, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or use Swords Dance easily. Garchomp is very easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Kartana, and Tapu Koko, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Gastrodon make for solid teammates. Tapu Fini is an especially good partner for non-Outrage sets, as Misty Terrain can let Garchomp freely switch into bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking without fearing a Scald burn. Due to it beating many of the common Defoggers in the tier, Garchomp pairs well with Spikes users like Ash-Greninja and Ferrothorn, as it can threaten opposing Defoggers and keep Spikes on the field. It also has some very good defensive utility, being able to check Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Victini.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Garchomp compresses Stealth Rock while being a solid check to the likes of Mega Lopunny and Volcarona, as well as forcing a lot of chip damage onto Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor with Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. The HP investment also makes it solid at blocking Volt Switch. However, Garchomp's lack of reliable recovery and its susceptibility to chip damage make it unreliable in the long term, and it can easily be overwhelmed. Earthquake is Garchomp's best STAB option, allowing it to force out the likes of Heatran, Magnezone, and Tapu Koko effectively. Stomping Tantrum can also be run in place of Earthquake on teams that have Grassy Terrain, as its damage isn’t halved, although it is much weaker overall. Toxic lets Garchomp punish common switch-ins such as Landorus, Zapdos, Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, putting them on a timer. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp chip and wear down the likes of Corviknight, Gliscor, and the aforementioned Zapdos while dissuading setup attempts from Pokemon such as Volcarona, Gliscor, Gyarados, and Hawlucha. However, Flamethrower allows Garchomp to immediately chunk Mega Scizor and KO Kartana, letting it check it the former effectively when healthy while forcing out the latter. Flamethrower also surprises and heavily dents Skarmory and Tangrowth, which switch into other Garchomp sets well. The given EV spread allows Garchomp to outspeed offensive Heatran, while increasing its physical bulk lets it check Pokemon like Mega Lopunny better.</p> <p>Garchomp fills the role of a defensive pivot on bulky offense and offense teams, compressing a short-term check to Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Mega Lopunny in one Pokemon. Due to its glaring weaknesses to Ice and Fairy, Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran pair amazingly well with it, checking the likes of Weavile, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. In return, Garchomp pivots into Mega Lopunny and opposing Heatran, which force the aforementioned Steel-types out. Garchomp running Stealth Rock gives Heatran a free moveslot or vice versa. Physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Kartana are amazing teammates alongside it, as they appreciate their shared checks in Skarmory and Tangrowth being worn down. If you want to add Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos as well, you can. Spikes from Pokemon such as Greninja and the aforementioned Ferrothorn is exceptional alongside chip damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin, and it synergizes extremely well with Dragon Tail variants.</p>"

      "Scale Shot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its colossal Attack stat, good bulk, typing, and solid coverage Mega Garchomp has established itself as a dangerous wallbreaker. Swords Dance boosts Mega Garchomp’s already immensely high Attack stat to allow it to break through the likes of Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Gliscor. Scale Shot is not only a decent multi-hit Dragon-type attack, but the Speed boost it confers means Mega Garchomp outspeeds the likes of Greninja, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny. Fire Fang breaks through defensive threats such as Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory, though Fire Blast takes better advantage of the latter two’s lackluster Special Defense stats. However, the latter is not boosted by Swords Dance, is unable to reliably break through the likes of Tapu Bulu and Corviknight, and forces Mega Garchomp to sacrifice its bulk by running a Naive nature. This leaves it vulnerable to specially offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Heatran. An Adamant nature offers more power against the likes of Pyukumuku, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, but Mega Garchomp is then more easily revenge killed by faster threats like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> <p>Mega Garchomp tends to fit best on offensive teams with teammates that clean up after it has broken holes through the opposing team such as Kartana, Hawlucha, and Weavile. Mega Garchomp's weakness to Ice-type attacks makes Water- and Steel-types such as Tapu Fini and Jirachi, respectively, good partners, although the former weakens Mega Garchomp's Scale Shot due to Misty Terrain. Mega Garchomp struggles in a similar fashion against opposing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu who are able to pivot into Scale Shot and prevent it from boosting its Speed. Running partners that can deal with these threats, such as Bisharp and Gengar, makes for good synergy. Volcarona switches into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks directed towards Mega Garchomp, which creates opportunity for it to set up. In return, Mega Garchomp beats common Volcarona checks such as Toxapex, Blissey, and Heatran. It also fuctions amazingly in tandem with dual screens support from the likes of Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Grimmsnarl, giving it plenty of opportunity to set up.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive variant can theoretically be used, as it checks Zeraora, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar. However, Hippowdon is strictly inferior to the other Ground-types in the tier at checking these. Ice Fang can threaten Landorus-T and Garchomp but Toxic and Whirlwind are more useful. Sand Force can also be run if your team dislikes the chip damage from sand, and it avoids powering up Mega Garchomp, but generally chipping down the opposing team is more worth it than not.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types Not Weak to Ground</strong>: The likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor freely come in on Hippowdon, as it's unable to meaningfully damage them. This allows them to remove its entry hazard, set up their own, or use non-Whirlwind variants as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic from the likes of Heatran, Zeraora, and Toxapex completely removes any longevity Hippowdon has, letting the likes of Heatran, Zeraora, and Magnezone overpower it. Meanwhile, getting burnt by Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, or Toxapex makes it entirely passive.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Kartana, Tangrowth, Rillaboom, and Serperior can switch into Hippowdon and force it out with their STAB moves, Rillaboom is notable because its Grassy Terrain makes Hippowdon's Earthquake weaker, letting other teammates switch in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Both offensive and defensive Water-types pose a serious issue to Hippowdon. The likes of Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini threaten it with Scald and shrug off its Earthquake, while Greninja, Urshifu-R, and Manaphy can force it out with their powerful Water-type attacks, but they struggle to switch due to Earthquake.</p>",

It does, however, face severe competition as a Ground-type from Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T, which bring more defensive utility and offensive presence, making Hippowdon difficult to justify despite its better raw bulk. It's also quite a subpar Stealth Rock setter, as it loses to the most common removal options in the tier, notably Tapu Fini and Corviknight. Toxic lets it limit its passivity, punishing switch-ins such as Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. Whirlwind is just as good to phaze Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Calm Mind Clefable, and Mega Scizor that try to take advantage of it. Whirlwind also racks up chip damage on the opposing  team thanks to the Stealth Rock and sand Hippowdon provides. However, since both moves compete for one moveslot, Hippowdon will always be passive against a substantial number of Pokemon. Leftovers is the preferred item to help it check Tapu Koko and Magnezone. However, Heavy-Duty Boots can also be run to bypass Hippowdon's overbearing weakness to Toxic Spikes and Spikes. The Attack investment lets Hippowdon's Earthquake always OHKO Excadrill.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Hippowdon checking Electric-types, such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Toxapex, make stellar defensive cores alongside it; in return, they can help cover its weakness to Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth, Rillaboom, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy. Status severely cripples Hippowdon, as Toxic severely worsens its longevity, while burn makes it unable to threaten the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Therefore, clerics like Chansey and Clefable make for good teammates; Chansey also appreciates Hippowdon freeing up its Stealth Rock moveslot. Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Gliscor totally wall Hippowdon and remove its Stealth Rock or set up on it, so teammates that can handle these threats such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, Weavile, and Mega Latias are key to having Hippowdon function.</p>"

  "Weavile": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to the multi-hit nature of Triple Axel, it is very easy to rack up contact chip damage from Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and various Rocky Helmet users. Icicle Crash avoids this chip damage while having a reliable damage output and a flinch chance; however, Icicle Crash does not always OHKO Mega Latias, so Triple Axel is preferred. An Adamant nature compounds an extra boost to Weavile's offense at the cost of its great Speed tier, notably not being able to outspeed Serperior, Mega Diancie, and Greninja. Life Orb is seen on hyper offense builds to boost Weavile's damage to truly devastating levels, notably being able to OHKO Corviknight with a boosted Triple Axel. However, entry hazard damage caused by the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots combined with Life Orb recoil greatly reduces Weavile's longevity. Since hyper offense playstyles focus on breaking down the opponent's team quickly, this lack of longevity is less noticeable for a comparatively huge damage boost. Alternatively, Wide Lens boosts the accuracy of Weavile's notoriously unreliable Triple Axel, but the greatly reduced longevity and lack of damage boost makes this option less ideal as well. While Low Kick helps to break past Ferrothorn and Melmetal, the loss of a valuable moveslot is often not worth it. Icium Z is an interesting option for a consistently powerful attack to break past certain targets like Ferrothorn and Corviknight while also bypassing the unreliability of Triple Axel; however, as with many of the other items, the lack of longevity makes it hard to fit. Darkinium Z also provides a high-power move that allows Weavile to potentially break through its checks, but this comes at the cost of the incredible utility of Knock Off. Groundium Z with Dig allows Weavile to bait in and KO Toxapex and Heatran, but the opportunity cost of dropping Ice Shard makes this hard to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Weavile's frailty, faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko can outspeed it and threaten an OHKO with their STAB moves. Additionally, strong priority moves such as Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Greninja's Water Shuriken, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide will all deal heavy damage to Weavile and should be avoided at all times.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Melmetal all take minimal damage from Weavile and threaten to OHKO it in return. Mega Scizor deserves special mention, as it is an extremely consistent counter due to its longevity through Roost.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini, though they dislike the loss of their item, can switch into Weavile repeatedly over the course of the match and threaten it back with Scald burns or an OHKO after Stealth Rock in Tapu Fini's case. Toxapex and Alomomola can also remain healthy to continually check Weavile courtesy of Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Contact-related Effects</strong>: Because Triple Axel makes contact three separate times, Weavile does not appreciate adverse contact effects like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Corviknight and Flame Body from Volcarona. The chip damage and status effects garnered up from these items and abilities make Weavile more susceptible to getting revenge killed and more easily dealt with defensively.</p>",

Triple Axel threatens to OHKO common offensive Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Latias, and Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off helps Weavile cripple its defensive answers such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while hitting offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Aegislash rather hard. Additionally, Pursuit allows Weavile to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Gengar. Offensive Pokemon that Weavile forces out are also good Pursuit targets, such as Mega Medicham, Serperior, and Mega Charizard Y.

Weavile's frailty and typing leave quite a bit to be desired defensively, making it vulnerable to priority users and faster offensive threats such as Rillaboom, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny. Pokemon that can pivot into these threats like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable fit well alongside Weavile. Also, Weavile's susceptibility to Stealth Rock necessitates Defog support from the likes of Corviknight and Zapdos. Corviknight is especially noteworthy because it invites in Garchomp and offensive Landorus-T in order to pivot out with U-turn into Weavile. Additionally, Mega Scizor and Toxapex counter Weavile, so Pokemon that threaten them such as Taunt Heatran and Mega Medicham make for excellent partners.

Very few of its checks function in the long term; since Weavile uses Heavy-Duty Boots to ignore chip damage from entry hazards its often able to outlast its checks, and it only needs minimal chip damage to break through physical walls like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clefable. However, Weavile's lack of immediate power allows offensive threats such as Mega Mawile and Urshifu-R to switch in freely while additionally losing out on the ability to Pursuit trap susceptible foes. Triple Axel is the preferred Ice-type option due to its power, notably doing significantly more damage to Clefable and Corviknight, whereas Icicle Crash is more accurate, does not make contact, and has a handy flinch chance at the cost of a significant power drop. Knock Off is the Dark-type move of choice due to its excellent secondary effect of item removal, allowing Weavile to weaken foes like Heatran, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini, which helps with its ability to clean in the late game. Meanwhile, Ice Shard allows Weavile to pick off faster targets like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and weakened Tapu Koko, while also being able to revenge kill sweepers like Hawlucha and Mega Garchomp.</p> <p>Weavile's amazing offensive profile nets it a role on teams that appreciate its offensive capability and have the defensive backbone to support its subpar bulk. However, Weavile's inability to directly switch into attacks during games makes it difficult for Weavile to consistently break down teams. As such, Pokemon that can help safely pivot Weavile onto the field such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Mega Lopunny make for excellent teammates. Magnezone is an excellent pairing for Weavile due to its ability to trap Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn which Weavile might have trouble breaking through, as well as providing a strong Volt Switch which can potentially allow Weavile a free switch-in. Due to its potency as a late-game cleaner, Weavile appreciates being paired up with powerful wallbreakers like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile which can help it sweep after overwhelming shared checks like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran which can provide support in the form of entry hazards make Weavile's job against Pokemon like Corviknight and Melmetal much easier. Furthermore, these Pokemon help to defensively check Pokemon that might try to revenge kill Weavile, such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. In return, Weavile is able to Knock Off Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Volcarona, Clefable, and opposing Weavile, helping their hazards matter more in the long term.</p>"

Volt Switch maintains momentum versus Pokemon Magnezone matches up poorly against, such as Blissey, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. It also allows Magnezone to keep momentum as it finishes off some targets, such as Corviknight.

Also, it has a good matchup against defensive Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex not only address Magnezone's high vulnerability to fast, strong offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, but also benefit from it trapping Ferrothorn.

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf lets Magnezone trade in its wallbreaking capabilities for being able to trap Kartana and offensive Mega Scizor comfortably while still trapping threats like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. With a Choice Scarf, Magnezone can also revenge kill threats such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele, which would otherwise be able to outspeed and KO it. However, due to its low Speed even with Choice Scarf, Magnezone mandates secondary revenge killing which can make teambuilding with it harder. Magnezone also often needs a Steel-type teammate, adding more overlap and stacking weaknesses, as it's too frail to have the defensive properties most Steel-types have. Volt Switch lets it maintain momentum while escaping unfortunate situations, as well as chipping down Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal, which Magnezone can’t consistently trap and remove. Hidden Power Fire lets it OHKO Kartana and beat Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Steel Beam dents common checks such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon, and it can KO Magnezone to safely bring in a check for more offensive pressure. Alternatively, Flash Cannon is a relatively spammable Steel-type STAB move, which allows it to pressure the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele better, although it means Magnezone is walled by Gliscor and Pokemon like Mega Latias that can easily recover off the damage dealt. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive a unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone can fit on a variety of teams from balance to offense teams due to its unique trapping capability. The likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Lopunny, and Kyurem appreciate it removing Steel-types such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for them, with the former two also functioning as proper revenge killers, which Magnezone is too slow to do. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Fini appreciate it removing Kartana. Landorus-T is an amazing partner for Magnezone, luring in and pivoting out of Corviknight and Skarmory to consistently trap them with Magnezone, and the pair form a potent VoltTurn core. Landorus-T can also pivot into and out of Kartana for Magnezone to safely trap it. Other Steel-types such as Corviknight and Mega Scizor also are solid partners, as they provide the defensive Steel-type utility that Magnezone is unable to, such as checking the likes of Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Weavile. Ground-immune and resistant Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Gliscor are needed alongside Magnezone due to its 4x Ground weakness. Lastly, Knock Off users such as Landorus-T, Weavile, and Clefable can assist Magnezone in trapping Corviknight and Skarmory, luring them in and removing Shed Shell if they run it.</p>"

Substitute allows Magnezone to take advantage of most trapped foes, such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Most importantly, it allows Magnezone to trap and remove Mega Mawile without having to worry about Sucker Punch mindgames. Substitute also takes advantage of passive Pokemon, such as non-Calm Mind Clefable, Toxapex, and Alomomola. Hidden Power Fire allows Magnezone to trap Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Electrium Z is the preferred item, as it can help alleviate pressure from Heatran while still safely trapping Mega Mawile. Steelium Z alongside Steel Beam is another option, most notably dealing heavy damage to Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar. Steel Beam should only be used alongside Steelium Z, though, as Magnezone will otherwise lack a spammable Steel-type STAB move to chip Ground-type Pokemon and threaten Clefable.</p> <p>Teammates that are vulnerable to Mega Mawile, such as Mega Latias, Tapu Lele, Kommo-o, and Gastrodon, greatly appreciate Magnezone's ability to reliably trap and remove it.

Additionally, Pokemon that can break through Blissey and Chansey are excellent, such as Mega Mawile, Rillaboom, and Kartana. Rillaboom and Kartana are particularly good partners, as they also handle Ground-types that are immune to Magnezone's Electric-type attacks, and they appreciate the removal of Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and especially Mega Mawile. Finally, Pokemon such as Excadrill and Tyranitar greatly appreciate Steelium Z Magnezone being able to reliably remove Mega Mawile, dent Ground-type Pokemon, and trap Steel-type Pokemon effectively.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sludge Bomb can be used over Sleep Powder to hit opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom, opposing Tangrowth, and Serperior, but most of them dislike Knock Off and Hidden Power Ice anyway or have a secondary typing that removes their weakness to the move. A set utilizing Infestation and Worry Seed can trap Gliscor and remove its Poison Heal. This also allows Tangrowth to more easily run Hidden Power Fire. Earthquake can be used over Sleep Powder to surprise Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone on the switch while allowing Tangrowth to more effectively check Excadrill. Stun Spore can also be used to push paralysis onto threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Corviknight. Rock Slide can be used over Sleep Powder, as it nails Mega Charizard Y, Moltres, and Volcarona as they switch in, but Tangrowth's other moves tend to be more consistently useful. Focus Blast is a niche option in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice to hit both Kartana and Ground-type Pokemon at the same time, but it has no use outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Charizard Y easily breaks through Tangrowth and takes minimal damage from anything bar the extremely rare Rock Slide. Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Victini, and Moltres are threatening as well, but the latter three dislike Knock Off, and the former three have to be careful to not blunder into an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Zapdos, Hawlucha, Corviknight, and Flyinium Z Landorus-T all force out Tangrowth, either getting a free setup opportunity or gaining momentum. However, Landorus-T can't switch in due to fearing Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile and Kyurem are capable of busting through Tangrowth with their powerful STAB moves, although Weavile will take heavy damage due to Rocky Helmet if it uses Triple Axel on Tangrowth, and neither wants to eat Knock Off. Ice-type coverage from Slowbro and Mega Latias can also prove problematic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Tangrowth's meager special bulk means that strong special attackers such as Mega Latios, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele can all break through it with relative ease, although they must watch out for Sleep Powder and coverage moves, and they should confirm that the Tangrowth is not a rarer Assault Vest variant. The lack of special bulk also leaves Tangrowth wide open to Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro and Slowking, which can prevent it from effectively dealing with physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur completely walls Tangrowth and can threaten it with Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss doesn't love taking Knock Off but also effortlessly forces out Tangrowth. Certain offensive Grass-types, such as Swords Dance Kartana and Serperior, are also capable of taking care of Tangrowth once they boost up.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye takes virtually no damage from any of Tangrowth's standard moves, denies progress-making by absorbing Knock Off and Sleep Powder, and proceeds to cripple it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Due to Assault Vest Tangrowth's heavy reliance on Assault Vest to check special attackers such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko, losing its item means it struggles to check these Pokemon and can quickly be overwhelmed by them. Pokemon that Tangrowth normally checks such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T often carry Knock Off and thus can easily cripple it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's immense physical bulk in conjunction with Regenerator makes it a very sturdy check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T without Flyinium Z. It also has access to useful utility moves such as Sleep Powder and Knock Off, which can punish Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Kyurem that would switch in rather freely otherwise. Unfortunately, Tangrowth doesn't effectively deal with some very common physical attackers, such as Victini, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, and its terrible special bulk leaves it open to threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Life Orb Clefable, and Heatran. A lack of reliable recovery also leaves it open to very powerful physical wallbreakers such as Dragonium Z Garchomp, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran and Zapdos. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred coverage move, dealing big damage to Landorus-T and Garchomp while also working together with Giga Drain to force Gliscor to spam Roost in order to avoid fainting. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, however, to force immediate damage onto Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana, but losing pressure on the aforementioned Ground-types is very detrimental. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to put a foe out of commission completely, therefore giving a teammate a free switch in and punishing a threat such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, or Clefable. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Kartana, therefore making it less passive overall. A Relaxed nature is preferred, as Tangrowth uses both of its attacking stats and its Speed is already very low.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on balance teams that need a very sturdy check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Rillaboom. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate Tangrowth taking on Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Mega Swampert. They are capable of blocking Volt Switch from the likes of Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as Tangrowth is not a suitable check to any of these on its own. Examples such as Garchomp and Gliscor work well to check the aforementioned while also switching into Heatran. These Ground-types can also can set Stealth Rock, which is important for Tangrowth, as it allows its team to better pressure dangerous Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Heatran. Tangrowth's special bulk is meager, so having a very bulky specially defensive wall is recommended. Specially defensive Heatran pairs well with Tangrowth, as it can take on threats such as Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. Mega Tyranitar can also help Tangrowth out against Heatran, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias. Slowking can deal with threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Tapu Fini also pairs well with Tangrowth due to it taking care of Ash-Greninja as well as Heatran, while Blissey can also act as a general sponge to Ash-Greninja, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. These teammates appreciate Tangrowth taking care of dangerous physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Rillaboom. Tangrowth needs good entry hazard removal on its side, as hazard damage can put it in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Weavile and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. Zapdos, Tapu Fini, and Excadrill are all potentially good partners as a result. Additional checks to physical attackers Tangrowth can't deal with are also beneficial; Toxapex or Melmetal can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight can work with a revenge killer that can finish off Ground-types, such as Weavile or Ash-Greninja, to deal with Swords Dance variants of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Teammates like Swords Dance Garchomp and Mega Mawile appreciate Sleep Powder giving them a setup opportunity.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest to improve its lackluster Special Defense and Regenerator, Tangrowth is a solid switch-in to threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, absorbing their hits and forcing them out. However, Tangrowth is extremely susceptible to getting worn down by entry hazards and status and is generally passive. Physical attackers can overload it given its lack of Defense investment, and it's extremely reliant on its Assault Vest to handle special attackers, so taking Knock Off means it struggles to check anything. Tangrowth also faces major competition from the likes of Amoonguss, which boasts an additional Poison typing, can run a passive recovery item, and has additional utility in Clear Smog. However, Tangrowth still has a solid niche over it due to checking Ground-type threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, as well as having its own great support move in Knock Off. Giga Drain provides additional recovery and reliability, while Power Whip allows Tangrowth to consistently check Calm Mind Tapu Fini and pressure Mega Tyranitar more. Knock Off lets it consistently make progress on switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Heatran, vastly reducing their longevity and effectiveness. Sludge Bomb pressures opposing Grass-types, such as Rillaboom and Serperior, while also threatening to poison Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos. Earthquake denies Heatran a free switch in, threatening a KO on offensive variants after Stealth Rock, while also solidly damaging Electric-types like Magnezone and Tapu Koko. Hidden Power Ice lets Tangrowth soft check Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T and Gliscor. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Fire lets it soft check Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread allows Tangrowth to survive two Mega Swampert Ice Punches after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check to Grass-, Water-, and Electric-types such as Serperior, Ash-Greninja, and Tapu Koko. Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Heatran are stellar teammates, greatly appreciating Tangrowth checking threats such as Ash-Greninja and Serperior, respectively. In return, they cover the Fire- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Weavile and Volcarona directed at it. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Tyranitar threaten Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Corviknight for it. Despite Tangrowth's Assault Vest, Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulses can still easily overwhelm it, so Dark-resistant teammates such as Clefable and Tapu Koko are solid partners. Solid entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini is a great asset given Tangrowth's frequent pivoting.</p>"

However, it is considerably weaker against neutral targets, and forgoing Facade invites dangerous wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Rillaboom into battle. Gliscor may run utility-oriented sets with moves such as Stealth Rock, Defog, and U-turn as well. However, Gliscor fails to keep Stealth Rock up against the popular Corviknight, and thus requires support from Magnezone as an entry hazard setter. Meanwhile, Defog sets aren't viable outside of stall teams due to how passive they are. Taunt is an option on utility sets to shut down foes like Ferrothorn, Corviknight, Clefable, and Chansey, but is generally not as useful as its other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Ice-types such as Weavile and Kyurem pressure Gliscor immensely with their STAB moves.

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its fantastic utility movepool, notably including Defog, Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Toxic, Gliscor can run utility-based sets to support its teammates. Gliscor is a solid Defogger, as it can keep opposing Heatran's Stealth Rock off the field and outlast Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Tyranitar. It can also run Stealth Rock, but its an incredibly lackluster Stealth Rock setter, as it has terrible matchups against common Defoggers, notably Corviknight, Kartana, and Tapu Fini. U-turn gives Gliscor a reliable way to keep up momentum by pivoting in teammates like Weavile, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Meanwhile, Knock Off cripples foes such as Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W; notably on Stealth Rock variants, Knock Off lets Gliscor remove Tapu Fini's Leftovers, which lets it consistently outlast and beat it. Toxic is an option to cripple Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon. The listed EV spread lets Gliscor outspeed Timid Heatran, and the Defense investment allows it to live an unboosted Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch after Play Rough. An alternative spread of 244 HP / 52 Def / 188 SpD / 24 Spe allows it to still outspeed Modest Heatran and deal with foes like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Modest Heatran more comfortably.</p> <p>Utility Gliscor primarily fits on balance teams that appreciate the role compression it offers. Teammates like Kyurem, Charizard-Y, and Weavile greatly appreciate its ability to reliably clear entry hazards. Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Melmetal are good teammates, as they're able to pivot into Weavile, Kyurem, Tangrowth, Kartana, and Mega Latias for Gliscor. Since Gliscor is threatend by common Water-types like Ash-Greninja, Manaphy, and Mega Gyarados, Pokemon that resist Water like Toxapex, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon make for stellar teammates. Threatening wallbreakers such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham appreciate the pivoting support Gliscor brings. Other pivots such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Magnezone can also create VoltTurn cores with Gliscor. Lastly, Stealth Rock variants appreciate teammates like Magnezone, Heatran, and Serperior that can take advantage of Defoggers like Corviknight, Kartana, and Tapu Fini that beat it.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor sports a great typing, reliable recovery, and an amazing ability in Poison Heal, which allows it to ignore the effects of status afflictions and the omnipresent Knock Off once it is activated. Said traits make Gliscor a very resilient wincon in National Dex, capable of outlasting many Pokemon that can pressure it offensively, such as Weavile, Kyurem, and Ash-Greninja. These characteristics also allow it to check huge threats in Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Mega Tyranitar, take advantage of defensive staples such as Toxapex, Zapdos lacking Hidden Power Ice, and bulky Landorus-T, and serve as a Volt Switch blocker and source of Ground immunity. Swords Dance uses the abundance of free turns Gliscor gets against passive Pokemon to boost its average Attack stat to dangerous levels. Roost helps Gliscor in continuously checking strong attackers such as Heatran and Mega Tyranitar, allows it to shrug off any damage passive Pokemon may cause, and minimizes Hidden Power Ice damage from Landorus-T. Facade is a good coverage option, nailing common switch-ins to Earthquake such as Landorus-T and Zapdos. The given EV spread allows Gliscor to outspeed Modest Heatran with a Jolly nature and heal more HP from Poison Heal. 52 Defense EVs are run in order to take a Play Rough into Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile once Poison Heal is in effect. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense to let Gliscor better take on threats such as Heatran and Clefable. 112 Speed EVs can be run instead in order to outspeed the likes of Timid Heatran, Adamant Rillaboom, and Jolly Bisharp, but this noticeably compromises Gliscor's bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that are in need of a wincon capable of taking advantage of Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, and Toxapex. As Gliscor forces many switches due to its resiliency paired with its boosting prowess, pairing it with entry hazard-stacking cores of Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Ferrothorn is often a good idea, allowing Gliscor to overwhelm offensive checks such as Kyurem, Weavile, and Ash-Greninja. Clefable and Ferrothorn can also provide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Slowbro, Zapdos, and Blissey, whereas Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap a roadblock to Gliscor in Mega Latias, as well as Weavile and Ash-Greninja locked into Dark-type moves. Even though Gliscor, is immune to Ground, it can be overwhelmed by the likes of Swords Dance Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill. Pokemon that better limit these threats, such as Corviknight, Ice Beam Slowbro and Mega Latias, and Tangrowth, are useful teammates to have. Revenge killers in the form of Weavile, Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko are important to limit the likes of Kyurem and Kartana. A few Steel-types in Curse Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Skarmory have the typing, bulk, and recovery to take Gliscor on indefinitely. Therefore, Pokemon that can pressure or defeat them, such as Heatran and Magnezone, make for good partners as well. Furthermore, Gliscor can easily fall prey to dangerous offensive threats, particularly Kyurem, Mega Charizard Y, Ash-Greninja, and Weavile. Thus, sturdy counterplay to these, such as Clefable for the former and Toxapex for the latter three, is important. Lastly, as Gliscor is a capable wallbreaker, it benefits late-game cleaners such as Mega Lopunny, Swords Dance Mega Mawile, and Mega Scizor. All of them hugely appreciate Gliscor's ability to take advantage of Toxapex, and in case of the latter two, Heatran as well.</p>"

A Choice Scarf set can also be run with Trick, which has a lot of surprise factor, but losing Leftovers hurts and Rotom-W is a subpar Choice Scarf user. Rocky Helmet garners chip damage on the likes of Landorus-T and Corviknight, but it's generally not worth using over Leftovers. Lastly, Thunder Wave is another option that can be run instead of Will-O-Wisp, letting Rotom-W slow foes for the rest of your team to generate momentum easily and drastically punish Pokemon like Serperior for getting too greedy, but this lets Pokemon such as Mega Scizor set up on it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-Types</strong>: Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn can safely pivot in on Rotom-W and and freely set up entry hazards, or chip it down with their STAB moves.

Pain Split gives Rotom-W longevity together with Leftovers, although unreliably. Defog is another option over Pain Split for role compression, as it also has a good matchup against two of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier, Heatran and Landorus-T.

Protect can be used on specially defensive sets to rack up Toxic and Magma Storm chip damage on the likes of Garchomp, as well as rack up Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery and force dangerous mind games with Mega Medicham, but it makes Heatran incredibly easy to take advantage of, with Pokemon like Garchomp and Volcarona using it as setup fodder, as well as it taking up a valuable moveslot. Air Balloon's temporary Ground immunity lets Heatran annoy its Ground-type checks like Gliscor and Garchomp, but the passive recovery of Leftovers and the nuking ability of Z-Moves make them generally preferred. Flame Body can be used on any of its sets to burn physical attackers like Weavile and Mega Mawile while also punishing U-turns from the likes of Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T, possibly with physical defense investment, but being unable to beat Fire-types like Volcarona and Victini and potentially being broken through by Serperior make this generally not preferred. Stone Edge can be used to immediately KO Volcarona while soft checking Mega Charizard Y, but it is very hard to fit and Toxic wears both of them down anyways. Hidden Power Ice can be used to beat Ground-types like Garchomp and Gliscor without using the Z-Move, but it takes up a valuable moveslot and does not do much to its other checks like Tapu Fini. Sets using Eruption and either Choice Scarf or Choice Specs may seem usable, but these sets are extremely prone to chip damage, forfeit most of Heatran's defensive utility, and can be easily pivoted around using bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Ground-types like Gliscor and Garchomp are great checks to Heatran, as they can take most of its hits and OHKO it back with Earthquake. Gliscor, in particular, is immune to Toxic and has reliable recovery, but Garchomp has no recovery and is annoyed by Toxic. However, Gliscor can be OHKOed by Inferno Overdrive or Corkscrew Crash off Steel Beam, while Garchomp is OHKOed by any form of Corkscrew Crash. Landorus-T can also revenge kill it, but it struggles to switch in. Ground-type coverage from the likes of Mega Scizor, Kyurem, and Mega Diancie can also severely dent or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Manaphy, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon are great checks to Heatran, as they can tank most of its hits and can beat it with their Water-type STAB moves. However, Tapu Fini fears Corkscrew Crash, while Gastrodon and Rotom-W are annoyed by Toxic, and all of them fear Bloom Doom. Offensive Water-types like Greninja and Mega Swampert can revenge kill it, but struggle to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias</strong>: Mega Latias can comfortably switch in to most of what Heatran does and has reliable recovery as well. Substitute Mega Latias can also use Heatran as setup fodder. However, Toxic heavily cripples Mega Latias and it should thus be careful upon switching in. Corkscrew Crash can also KO after slight chip and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Revenge Killers</strong>: Naturally fast Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja can take advantage of Heatran's low Speed tier and force it out with ease. Mega Swampert in rain can also outspeed and revenge kill it. Choice Scarf Kartana can use Sacred Sword to KO it after slight chip damage, as well.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can take most of Heatran's hits due to its immense special bulk while under sand, and either Pursuit trap it or hit it for great damage with its STAB or coverage moves. However, it is prone to being chipped down, hates getting burned by alternative options like Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp, and is severely damaged by Corkscrew Crash.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Heatran is prone to being chipped down through entry hazards, Leech Seed, and other forms of chip damage, due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p>",

      "Z-Move": {
        "description": "<p>Z-Move Heatran is an insanely devastating wallbreaker that can beat almost all its checks with the right Z-Move. It's also one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters, as it can threaten many forms of entry hazard control such as Kartana and Landorus-T. Its great natural bulk along with its stellar typing means it can act as a great offensive check to the likes of Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile, though its lack of recovery means it can only check these for so long and is very easy to wear down. It is also hindered by its low Speed tier, which leaves it outsped by key threats like Gliscor, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp. Magma Storm traps threats like Toxapex and Blissey and inflicts chip damage on threats like Garchomp and Tapu Fini. Earth Power provides crucial coverage, hitting Toxapex and opposing Heatran. Taunt stops passive Pokemon such as Blissey, Toxapex, and Slowbro from pivoting out or using a recovery move, letting Heatran overwhelm them. Toxic cripples threats like Mega Latias, Rotom-W, and Mega Charizard Y, severely ruining their longevity. However, missing out on Taunt ruining walls can be detrimental in some matchups. Stealth Rock can be used as Heatran is a very reliable entry hazard setter, forcing out common forms of entry hazard removal. Grassium Z with Solar Beam is the primary combination, as it allows Heatran to adequately bait and OHKO Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon while also heavily chipping Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar. However, it makes Heatran much worse into Calm Mind Clefable and unable to punish Gliscor as well. Heatran can also use Flash Cannon or Steel Beam along with Steelium Z, as Corkscrew Crash can significantly dent if not outright OHKO common Heatran checks such as Tapu Fini, Garchomp, and Tyranitar, and it also lets it soft check Calm Mind Clefable. Steel Beam is used for its extra power, especially notable against Mega Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Gliscor, and it still retains necessary power with a Timid nature, but it means that Heatran essentially has a dead moveslot after using its Z-Move. Flash Cannon gives Heatran a usable move even after using its Z-Move to pressure Calm Mind Clefable, but it is significantly weaker. However, both of these options prevent Heatran from running an additional utility move. Heatran can also use Firium Z to fire off an insanely powerful Inferno Overdrive, which OHKOes most Gliscor and Landorus-T sets and, frees up a moveslot for an extra utility move; however, outside of a strong STAB nuke, it doesn't let Heatran break past checks like Gastrodon and Tapu Fini. Flash Fire is used, as it lets Heatran check Volcarona, Serperior, and Victini. The given EV spread lets Heatran survive a +2 Mega Mawile Sucker Punch from full HP and a Kartana Sacred Sword after Stealth Rock. A Timid nature lets Heatran outspeed Pokemon like opposing Heatran and most Gliscor sets, while a Modest nature gives it better damage rolls against Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Gliscor.</p> <p>Heatran fits best on bulky offense and balance teams. Due to its weakness to Ground-types like Gliscor and Garchomp, it appreciates teammates that can handle these, such as Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Weavile. Heatran is generally weak to Water-types like Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, so Pokemon that can take advantage of or check these Water-types such as Kartana, Tapu Koko, and Ferrothorn are good partners for it. Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Weavile appreciate Heatran pressuring Steel- and Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor, and the latter two can potentially clean up after Heatran has broken holes in teams. Ash-Greninja is a great teammate for Heatran, as it can wear down Heatran's checks with Spikes and help overwhelm or lure shared checks in Tapu Fini and Gastrodon if Heatran is lacking Grassium Z. Due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and complete lack of recovery, Heatran appreciates having teammates that can remove hazards, like Gliscor and Tapu Fini. While it can soft check threats like Calm Mind Clefable, Volcarona, and Serperior, it cannot handle these in the long-term due to its lack of recovery, so other checks to these like defensive Volcarona, Toxapex, and Swords Dance Gliscor are good partners for it. Heatran also likes partners that can switch into Fighting-types, like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, that can revenge kill Heatran, like Landorus-T and Zapdos. Grassy Terrain support from the likes of Tapu Bulu and Rillaboom can give it highly appreciated passive recovery and power up its Bloom Doom if using Grassium Z.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is a tank that uses its great typing and natural bulk to check threats like Calm Mind Clefable, Mega Mawile, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona, with Leftovers giving it consistent recovery while not being passive due to its great Special Attack stat and ability to spread large amounts of chip damage with Magma Storm and Toxic. However, it is still fairly easy to wear down due to its lack of reliable recovery, and it becomes a lot easier to check without a Z-Move or Special Attack investment. Magma Storm applies crucial chip damage on threats like Garchomp and Tapu Fini while also trapping Pokemon such as Toxapex. Alternatively, Lava Plume can be used for its perfect accuracy and ability to burn Pokemon like Tyranitar and Garchomp, but its lower Base Power and inability to trap threats like Toxapex mean it is generally not preferred. Earth Power provides important coverage for threats like Toxapex, Mega Diancie, and opposing Heatran. Heatran is a good Stealth Rock setter, as it can threaten most Defoggers like Corviknight and Kartana, though it is annoyed by ones like Tapu Fini. Heavy Slam can be used to deal with Calm Mind Clefable much better while doing good chip damage to Tapu Fini. Taunt lets Heatran beat passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Slowbro. Toxic lets it harshly punish Pokemon that may want to take advantage of it such as Mega Latias, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W. Flash Fire is used, as it lets Heatran beat Volcarona and Victini. The given EV spread lets it outspeed Adamant Tyranitar and Modest Magnezone. If using Heavy Slam, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 180 SpD / 72 Spe with a Sassy Nature should be used to 2HKO Bold Clefable while still outspeeding uninvested Mega Scizor.</p> <p>Specially Defensive Heatran can fit on a wide variety of teams, ranging from offense to balance. Pokemon like Toxapex, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile appreciate Heatran's ability to check dangerous Psychic- and Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Clefable. Heatran is weak to Ground-types like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Gastrodon, so checks to these like Corviknight, Weavile, and Slowbro are good partners for it. Weavile, in particular, provides crucial Knock Off support that makes Tapu Fini easier to wear down. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Ash-Greninja appreciate Heatran pressuring opposing Grass- and Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Good Defoggers like Gliscor and Tapu Fini are good teammates for it, as it is annoyed by entry hazards. Because of Heatran's weakness to Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Tapu Fini, it appreciates having teammates that can handle these, like Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Good switch-ins to the Fighting-types that revenge kill Heatran, like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, are good partners for it, like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Clefable.</p>"

Either a Wacan or Rindo Berry is the preferred item for this set, and a Timid nature with maximum Speed investment should be ran to outspeed as much as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive pressure</strong>: Due to Manaphy's supoptimal Speed, offensive pressure through the likes of Mega Medicham, Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, Kartana, and Mega Charizard Y is often the best method of dealing with it.</p> <p><strong>Set-dependant switchins</strong>: Manaphy will have trouble breaking through Calm Mind Mega Latias if forgoing Ice Beam. Similarly, Clear Smog Gastrodon walls any Manaphy lacking Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Mantine</strong>: Mantine takes any of Manaphy's attacks pretty comfortably, even after a Tail Glow boost. Mantine can then proceed to Haze away Manaphy's boosts and stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Shedinja is immune to any combination of attacks Manaphy is most often seen running.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Under rain, Manaphy is one of the metagame's most incontestable stallbreakers, as it has access to a deadly setup move in Tail Glow as well as the formidable combination of Hydration and Rest, which essentially makes it immune to status ailments and immediately replenishes its entire health without any negative consequences as long as rain is active. Furthermore, the aforementioned Tail Glow in combination with a Z-Move makes Manaphy a fearsome wallbreaker as well, as it is capable of effortlessly breaking through common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Tangrowth after a boost from rain. Energy Ball is the preferred coverage option, as it allows Manaphy to preserve the Z-Move against Tapu Fini and Rotom-W and break through Gastrodon, which is one of the very few options teams may employ in their endeavor to handle Manaphy defensively. Psychic can be run instead, allowing Manaphy to overwhelm Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss without expending its Z-Move. Alternatively, Ice Beam may be used in order to preserve the Z-Move against the likes of Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Tangrowth while still severely denting Amoonguss. Waterium Z is paramount to Manaphy's breaking prowess, as it enables Manaphy to break through the bulkiest of threats such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Tapu Fini after a boost under rain. The given EV spread allows Manaphy to outspeed everything up to Timid Magnezone. 72 Speed EVs may be run instead in order to outspeed Modest Heatran, which may allow Manaphy to dodge a lethal Bloom Doom.</p> <p>Manaphy's full potential is realized only when rain is active. As such, Manaphy only fits on rain teams as a dedicated stallbreaker that can also reliably wallbreak major portions of the metagame. Rain support from Pelipper is mandatory, as it allows Manaphy to make full use of Hydration in conjunction with Rest while also crucially boosting the power of Hydro Vortex to an extent where many Water-resistant Pokemon are OHKOed after a boost from Tail Glow. Ferrothorn is a very useful teammate due to its ability to pivot into many threats Manaphy has a negative matchup against, such as Tapu Koko and Kyurem. Moreover, Ferrothorn can also provide Knock Off or Thunder Wave support, situationally easing Manaphy's wallbreaking by removing crucial items from the likes of Chansey and Mantine, and letting it outspeed faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, respectively. Ferrothorn can also provide valuable hazard support, which helps Manaphy in picking up more KOs. For example, one layer of Spikes nearly guarantees the OHKO with Hydro Vortex on Chansey under rain after using Tail Glow. Furthermore, Manaphy is easily threatened out by faster Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana. Therefore, Corviknight and Zapdos are good partners because of their ability to easily pivot into said Grass-types and threaten them out. Lastly, late-game cleaners that benefit from Manaphy's tremendous wallbreaking capabilities such as Mega Swampert, which is mandatory on rain teams, and Ash-Greninja make for excellent partners by easily cleaning up after Manaphy has concluded its wallbreaking as well as strengthening the matchup against offensive teams.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive Victini set utilizing Expanding Force can be used alongside Tapu Lele, giving amazing offensive synergy by threatening a majority of Tapu Lele's common switch-ins. However, this set is extremely reliant on Tapu Lele‘s Psychic Terrain to function properly. Will-O-Wisp is a neat option to immediately threaten physical attackers such as Garchomp and Tyranitar that switch in, as well as forcing dangerous mindgames with opposing Mega Mawile and Bisharp’s Sucker Punch. However, forgoing Toxic means Victini can't punish the likes of Mega Latias and Gastrodon, and Will-O-Wisp has much more niche uses compared to Toxic. Glaciate quickly disposes of the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, although it is fairly terrible coverage otherwise, and Victini can beat the former two in the long term regardless due to their lack of recovery. Energy Ball and Scorching Sands are niche options to instantly punish would-be counters in Gastrodon and Heatran, although they're only useful for those two Pokemon and are not good choices compared to other coverage options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran completely walls Victini and can recover any damage over time with its Leftovers. It is also immune to Toxic and can use Victini's Fire-type moves to boost its own damage with Flash Fire. However, Victini can lock Heatran into a status move with Encore and pivot out. Z-Move sets can bypass Encore, but Bolt Strike can quickly wear them down.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Water-types such as Gastrodon, Slowking, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini can consistently switch into Victini and force it out with their STAB moves, and the best standard Victini can do is pressure the former three with Toxic and wear the latter down with Psychic. However, both Tapu Fini and Slowking do not appreciate a Bolt Strike. Offensive Water-types such as Mega Swampert, Greninja, and Manaphy can easily force Victini out, although the latter two can't consistently switch in for fear of a Bolt Strike, and Mega Swampert hates being burnt.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Greninja, Weavile, and Tyranitar scare Victini with their attacks, with the latter two being able to Pursuit trap it. However, the former two are unable to consistently switch in, and Tyranitar hates being burnt. Hydreigon is a notable check, as it can consistently switch in, recover any damage with Roost, and force Victini out, although it is prone to getting worn down by Toxic and constant U-turns.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Victini easily gets worn down by repeated hits from Pokemon it's supposed to check like Tapu Lele and Mega Latias due to its lack of recovery, so it will lose to them in the long term.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor can consistently switch into Victini without fearing a burn if Poison Heal is activated. Other Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill can force it out, but they fear a burn or Toxic and struggle to switch into it.</p>",

      "Heavy-Duty Boots Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Victini uses its good defensive typing and all-around solid bulk to function as a solid defensive pivot, checking the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, and Mega Latios, while also boasting a decent offensive profile with its high Base Power moves. However, its mediocre offensive stats, reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots to be a consistent pivot, and lack of recovery mean it struggles to check threats in the long term. Victini is also extremely weak to Pursuit, so oftentimes it struggles to check Pokemon more than once. Blue Flare boasts a nifty burn chance to punish switch-ins such as Garchomp and Mega Swampert, and it can 2HKO defensive Landorus-T, which V-create can't. V-create is still viable, however, to break through specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking and check threats like Volcarona, although the Defense and Speed drops make Victini more vulnerable to Pursuit and revenge killers. Psychic pressures common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Kommo-o, Garchomp, and Tapu Fini, as well as being a strong spammable STAB move. Future Sight is a support option that, in conjunction with U-turn, boosts teammates' wallbreaking capabilities but lowers Victini's immediate offensive presence. Bolt Strike hits bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini much harder while still pressuring specially defensive Toxapex, although it means Victini can't pressure the likes of Garchomp and Kommo-o consistently. Toxic allows it to check the likes of Mega Latias, prevents Pokemon such as Volcarona from setting up on Blue Flare variants, and punishes switch-ins like Slowbro and Slowking. Encore discourages Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Latias from trying to set up on it. This can make Pursuit trapping Mega Latias much easier due to Weavile and Tyranitar not needing to fear Aura Sphere. If running V-create or Bolt Strike, a Jolly or Hasty nature with Attack investment should be used instead of Timid to bolster its damage output. A bulkier spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Rillaboom and maximize bulk to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Latias better, although it loses out on outspeeding crucial threats like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Victini works best on offense teams that appreciate its compressed defensive capabilities in checking the likes of Mega Latias and Tapu Lele, as well as the offensive pressure it brings to the table. Partners like Toxapex and Kommo-o work well with it as they appreciate Victini checking these threats. Strong wallbreakers that struggle to get onto the field such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Mega Medicham appreciate it wearing down checks like Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias with Toxic, as well as giving them more entry opportunities with U-turn and Encore. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Koko can deal with Dark-type Pokemon that pressure Victini such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Water-resistant partners such as Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth work extremely well because Victini is often pressured by Water-types like Greninja, Manaphy, and Mega Swampert. In return, Victini deals with the Fire- and Grass-types that pressure these Pokemon, such as Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and Volcarona. Similarly, Ground-types like Gastrodon, Gliscor, and Garchomp threaten Victini as well, so the likes of Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem form a strong offensive core with it.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Victini compresses speed control and a way to check several dangerous offensive threats in Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y, along with crippling the opposition thanks to Trick and Final Gambit or pummeling them with strong V-creates. U-turn makes Victini a great scout and momentum grabber, taking advantage of forced switches to bring its teammates in unscathed. Trick is a great way to cripple walls like Slowbro, Heatran, and Toxapex, forcing them to lose momentum every time they come in. Final Gambit can eliminate a defensive target entirely, as well as getting a teammate in freely, though this comes at the cost of Victini itself. Therefore, use it with caution if there's another threat Victini wants to check. Maximum HP investment allows Victini to make the most of its Final Gambit while improving its overall bulk to let it check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham better.</p> <p>Victini fits on offensively geared teams, with hyper offensive teams in particular enjoying its ability to sacrifice itself to take out a defensive Pokemon they may not be able to break through. Therefore, hyper offensive staples like Rillaboom, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Garchomp make excellent partners. Suicide lead variants of Landorus-T can aid Victini in this role by setting up Stealth Rock and exploding on key defensive targets like Zapdos. This in conjunction with Victini's Final Gambit can often mean that the remaining teammates can clean up very easily. Bulkier offense archetypes enjoy Victini's defensive utility, as its ability to pivot in on huge threats like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham is often a godsend for them. Victini likes to get in unharmed so it can take advantage of its bulk as best as possible, so pivots like Corviknight, Blissey, and Slowbro make good teammates. Similarly, Defoggers like Zapdos and the aforementioned Corviknight make excellent partners because they can remove Stealth Rock, which often hinders Victini's defensive utility. Pokemon that appreciate Victini crippling or KOing Pokemon like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Slowbro, such as Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Gliscor, make fantastic partners. Victini can struggle with sturdy Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T that can tank its V-creates decently while wearing it down with Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin, so Pokemon like Weavile, Kyurem, and Ash-Greninja are good choices to deal with them. These three also appreciate Victini's ability to bait in these Ground-types and U-turn on them.</p>"

Hidden Power Ground may be used to target Heatran, but leaves Serperior walled by many of the metagame's common Grass-type resists with the only target being Heatran. A set consisting of Leech Seed, Glare, Leaf Storm, and Substitute also seems potent, but requires much more support to function properly and still leaves Serperior walled by many bulky Grass resists.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Corviknight</strong>: Corviknight's Pressure cuts into Leaf Storm's low PP, and it can pivot out on a +2 Hidden Power Fire with relative ease to a revenge killer or respond with heavy damage from Brave Bird. While it's not immune to paralysis, its longevity with Roost can make it a nuisance to remove.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y can take repeated Leaf Storms and are able to KO Serperior back with their respective STAB move. However, Heatran lacking Leftovers can fall apart after being crippled by Glare, and Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y both dislike the Speed drop.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass Resists</strong>: Mega Latias, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur can all take repeated Leaf Storms, don't mind +2 Hidden Power Fires much, and can damage Serperior back with Psyshock or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Amoonguss is even able to wall Serperior by removing boosts with Clear Smog. However, Mega Latias lacking Refresh still greatly fears paralysis.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Serperior plays a unique role in the metagame, as its Speed and ability in Contrary allow it to quickly threaten a sweep through repeated Leaf Storms granting it +2 Special Attack on each use, and combined with its ability to reliably dish out paralysis to its checks, it's both crucial team support and a threatening late-game sweeper. Hidden Power Fire ensures Serperior is not walled by Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight. Substitute allows Serperior to either capitalize on switches forced by Leaf Storm, or take advantage of more passive Water-types such as Toxapex and Slowking, easing prediction. Glare is generally preferred, as paralysis is key in crippling its checks, such as Corviknight and Amoonguss, and allows Serperior to support slow wallbreakers, but Leech Seed is an option to more safely break through Blissey and Heatran while remaining safe behind Substitute. 56 HP EVs are used so that Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip don't break Substitute.</p> <p>Generally, Serperior pairs well with Pokemon that benefit from the paralysis support, as it lets them bypass their low speed, and it pressures their checks. Thus, Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Mega Mawile make excellent partners. Tyranitar in particular works well with Serperior, as paralysis forces targets like Heatran and Mega Latias to switch, making for easy pickings with Pursuit, clearing the way for Serperior. Melmetal also abuses the paralysis on checks such as Heatran and Corviknight, being able to outspeed and KO them after they have been crippled, and Double Iron Bash's flinch rate paired with paralysis can put any slower foe into a sticky situation. Garchomp and Mega Garchomp are both potent wallbreakers by themselves, but appreciate the paralysis to set up on Heatran more easily and pressure Corviknight more. On hyper offense teams, Manaphy appreciates Glare, as potentially crippling Mega Latias lets Manaphy wallbreak more easily, and a paralyzed Heatran turns into Tail Glow setup fodder. On Sticky Web teams, Serperior's snowballing ability is compounded with Sticky Web slowing down any would-be revenge killer, while Contrary deters the use of Defog, as it would boost Serperior’s evasion instead. When faced with a wall like Corviknight, teammates like Bisharp and Thundurus-T can take advantage of it and set up.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Steelium Z is a niche option that can push more damage onto Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Gliscor, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Landorus-T, but these targets can be pressured by Normalium Z anyway while also causing headaches for Zapdos and Rotom-W. Air Balloon reverses the matchup against Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, these matchups aren't worth being stonewalled by Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. A specially defensive set can be used to check a myriad of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele while providing Rapid Spin, but it is easy to wear down and overwhelm. On the Stealth Rock Lead set, Steel Beam may seem like a nice option over Rock Tomb to perform more as a suicide lead, but due to it needing Excadrill to be at a lower HP to effectively work, it is rather undesirable, and it still struggles to keep Stealth Rock up versus Corviknight. Toxic is another option that can cripple bulky switch-ins like Tangrowth and Zapdos, but both it and Steel Beam come at the cost of losing Rock Tomb, which opens up a lot of faster Pokemon to be less threatened by Excadrill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Corviknight, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y are immune to Excadrill's Earthquake and take its Iron Head decently well, while they can all retaliate with super effective coverage. Mega Charizard Y can also remove potential sand, causing Excadrill to be slower than it. However, the former must be wary of Substitute variants if it lacks Body Press, and the latter two are shattered by +2 Normalium Z.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: When unboosted by sand or Rapid Spin, Excadrill sits are at a poor Speed tier. As a result, faster Pokemon like Garchomp, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny are capable of revenge killing it. Ash-Greninja in particular has a powerful Water Shuriken to dispatch of Excadrill even when its boosted. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Excadrill directly and cannot beat it if its Speed is boosted.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Physically defensive Tangrowth is incredibly difficult for Excadrill to break if it has used its Z-Move, and Tangrowth can wear Excadrill down with Rocky Helmet and Giga Drain or neutralize it with Sleep Powder. However, Tangrowth can be crippled by Toxic long-term. Rillaboom, while unable to switch in directly, deals heavy damage to Excadrill with a priority Grassy Glide. Even if Rillaboom is taken out, Excadrill may have to contend with Grassy Terrain weakening its Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exploiting Focus Sash</strong>: Fake Out users like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny are able to break Excadrill's Focus Sash without Excadrill being able to do anything and can immediately OHKO it in the following turn. Water Shuriken from Greninja can be troublesome, as it lets Greninja transform into Ash-Greninja and it denies Stealth Rock, provided it gets enough hits.

        "description": "<p>Excadrill is a cornerstone on sand teams, serving as a capable wallbreaker and sweeper for the archetype thanks to its high Attack, access to Swords Dance, and doubled Speed under sand. Additionally, its solid bulk and fantastic defensive typing give it many opportunities to set up against the likes of Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko. Swords Dance alongside a Z-Move lets Excadrill clean up weakened defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini. Giga Impact gives it access to Breakneck Blitz, allowing Excadrill to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos as well as chipped Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Rapid Spin can be used if Excadrill's team can't fit Defog elsewhere and gives Excadrill the ability to limit Stealth Rock Clefable, patch up its Speed without the need for sand, and remove entry hazards for Pokemon weak to them like Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to wear down Slowbro, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, especially alongside sand damage. Substitute is an option to use non-Body Press Corviknight as setup fodder. Leftovers allows for Excadrill to take advantage of its solid defensive typing, giving it easier setup on Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Koko. However, forgoing Normalium Z can be detrimental against teams carrying Slowbro, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Jolly is the preferred nature to Speed tie with opposing Excadrill, but if adequate Excadrill counterplay is on your team, Adamant can be used for its higher power, which is notable for dispatching Slowbro and Tangrowth a bit easier.</p> <p>Excadrill necessitates sand to function properly, so either Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar are mandatory alongside it. Mega Tyranitar is also a great Stealth Rock setter, chipping Excadrill's answers into the range of its attacks. Both Tyranitar formes are also notable for being able to beat Zapdos one-on-one for Excadrill and having Pursuit to cripple Mega Latias. Corviknight effortlessly walls Excadrill, so teammates that can deal with it, such as Zapdos and Magnezone, make excellent teammates. Both are also notable for tearing open physically defensive Tangrowth, which would otherwise halt Excadrill's sweep. Swords Dance and Choice Band Kartana sets are also capable of forcing damage onto Corviknight and Zapdos, causing them to falter at checking Excadrill. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny can exploit Excadrill's mediocre Speed outside of sand, with Ash-Greninja revenge killing it even under sand with Water Shuriken, so partners such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight are needed to help remedy this issue. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are notable partners for their ability to set Spikes, allowing Excadrill to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise check it like Tangrowth. Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus are solid partners for Excadrill, as they appreciate Excadrill dismantling Steel-types that can halt their sweep. They also provide a solid defensive backbone which Excadrill can fall back on once sand has run out.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Lead Excadrill serves as an important member on hyper offense teams to set up Stealth Rock, as well as keep opposing entry hazards off the field for Pokemon like Volcarona and Gyarados. Adding onto the fact that there are not many Electric-type immunities featured on hyper offense, Excadrill's inclusion is all the more important. However, even with this advantage, it still finds itself outclassed by Mew and Landorus-T due to it being unable to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Tapu Fini from using Defog and it not having a good defensive typing like the other two do. Setting up Stealth Rock is Excadrill's main role, and when paired with Mold Breaker, it can even set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Mold Breaker also lets Excadrill's Earthquake hit Levitate users like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Mega Latias, letting Excadrill not be complete setup fodder against them. Rapid Spin defines Excadrill's niche over other entry hazard leads like Landorus-T and Mew, letting it keep hazards off the field before it gets KOed. Rock Tomb can slow down faster Stealth Rock users like Garchomp and Landorus-T so that Excadrill can use Rapid Spin before they KO it. It can also slow down setup Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Excadrill like Mega Gyarados and Thundurus-T. Focus Sash is chosen as the item so that Excadrill is usually able to get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed.</p> <p>Lead Excadrill exclusively fits on hyper offense teams and, as such, has teammates that are commonly found there. Pokemon that appreciate Excadrill's ability to keep entry hazards off the field such as Gyarados and non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants of Volcarona, Weavile, and Thundurus-T serve as great teammates to pair with it. Excadrill can also function on Sticky Web teams to provide Stealth Rock when the Sticky Web setter is Ribombee while also giving the team a form of entry hazard removal, which Shuckle cannot do. Additionally, due to the nature of hyper offense being rather slow at first, Tapu Koko is especially threatening to the archetype, making Excadrill an important teammate because it resists or is immune to both of Tapu Koko's STAB moves. Pokemon like Weavile and Greninja who have multi-hit moves are also invited in by Excadrill, so it appreciates partners like Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, and Kommo-o that can pivot into these Pokemon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stored Power alongside Acid Armor seems appealing to make Reuniclus a difficult-to-handle sweeper after a few boosts; however, this set is completely walled by Haze Toxapex as well as Dark-types, making it very inconsistent. This set necessitates Toxic Spikes support to wear down Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Greninja. Colbur Berry can also be used to take a hit from Weavile or Tyranitar in a pinch and OHKO back with Focus Blast. Life Orb is also a fine item if the Z Crystal has been taken by a teammate such as Excadrill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Weavile threaten Reuniclus with their super effective STAB attacks, but they cannot switch in for fear of Focus Blast. The latter two can also Pursuit trap and ruin Reuniclus. All of these Pokemon are susceptible to entry hazard support from Reuniclus's teammates though. Mega Sableye completely walls and can PP stall Reuniclus lacking Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Aegislash are able to scare Reuniclus out with the threat of their STAB Ghost-type attacks. It is worth noting that Gengar cannot switch in and can only OHKO Reuniclus with Never-Ending Nightmare if Reuniclus has multiple Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Garchomp, and Tyranitar can handle Reuniclus, even after it has accrued multiple Calm Mind boosts. None of these Pokemon want to take multiple Focus Blast or Psyshock, making them less durable checks than one would think.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt Heatran can prevent Reuniclus from setting up, but it does not want to have to stomach a Focus Blast. Other Taunt users such as Tapu Fini and Grimmsnarl can impede Reuniclus setting up.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Take Advantage of Reuniclus Setting Up</strong>: Unaware Calm Mind Clefable does not care for Reuniclus's stat boosts, and can beat it with its own Calm Mind boosts. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can carry Punishment, which shatters Reuniclus after multiple Calm Mind boosts due to its scaling Base Power.</p>",

Focus Blast complements Psyshock nicely, demolishing Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Fightinium Z avoids the risk of missing Focus Blast on Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Taunt Heatran. Alternatively, Stored Power can be utilized alongside Thunder to have a better matchup against stall, as Mega Sableye cannot take a boosted Thunder and Unaware users falter to Stored Power's scaling Base Power. Thunder alongside Electrium Z nails Slowking and Toxapex. Thunder is also able to spread paralysis, but it does not hit Dark-types, which leaves Reuniclus more vulnerable to Pursuit. Magic Guard gives Reuniclus an immunity to entry hazards and sand, making it very difficult to wear down and a great switch-in to Toxapex. 44 Speed allows Reuniclus to outspeed and beat Haze Toxapex. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense with a Bold nature to allow Reuniclus to set up in the face of strong physical attackers such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny.</p> <p>Reuniclus appreciates entry hazard support from partners like Clefable, Mega Tyranitar, Ash-Greninja, and Ferrothorn to wear down the few natural checks that it has, such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar. In particular, Reuniclus appreciates Toxic Spikes support from Toxapex to swiftly wear down opposing Pokemon, which allows it to clean up weakened teams late-game. Due to Reuniclus's inability to touch Mega Sableye as well as bad matchup against Aegislash, teammates such as Calm Mind Clefable and Mega Mawile make for solid partners. Reuniclus's Pursuit weakness is also a nuisance, but if paired with Mega Latias, the pair can easily overwhelm opposing Pursuit trappers such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar. Reuniclus can struggle with strong special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Gengar, especially if it is unboosted. Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Heatran, and Kommo-o can deal with these Pokemon.

Stun Spore can be used to spread paralysis, but Amoonguss tends to miss out on important targets if it drops any of its moves. Toxic can also be run to spread the status onto threats that are generally crippled by it, such as Mega Latias, Hydreigon, Slowbro, Slowking, and Zapdos, but this runs into the same moveslot issues as Stun Spore. An Assault Vest set makes Amoonguss an even bulkier check to threats such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko while also allowing it to lure Heatran via Stomping Tantrum; however, losing out on Spore is annoying, and the Heatran luring strategy can fall apart if your opponent sees that your Amoonguss isn't running Black Sludge. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, but losing Hidden Power Fire prevents Amoonguss from checking Kartana or pushing any sort of meaningful damage onto Ferrothorn or Mega Mawile</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran, Victini, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona all threaten Amoonguss with their STAB moves, although none of them want to get put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types threaten Amoonguss with their STAB moves, and many of them take very little damage from its standard moves. Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Hawlucha all fit with this. Gliscor, while not running any Flying-type STAB moves, can't be put to sleep after its Toxic Orb activates and easily sets up on variants not running Clear Smog or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, such as Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias can all threaten Amoonguss greatly. Slowbro and Slowking can also use Future Sight to apply extra pressure and prevent Amoonguss from switching into what it's normally tasked with. They all have to beware of Spore, however.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Weavile and Kyurem force out Amoonguss with their powerful STAB moves.

This is especially effective considering most Grass-types, as well as the sleep blocking Tapu Fini, cannot safely switch into Amoonguss. This also makes Pokemon that would otherwise be able to absorb Sludge Bomb easily, such as Corviknight and Toxapex, hesitant to switch in due to the threat of Spore. Hidden Power Fire hits Kartana and Ferrothorn while also applying some chip to other Steel-types, such as Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Mega Mawile. Clear Smog can be used over Sludge Bomb to shut down setup attempts from Calm Mind Clefable, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Gliscor, and a reckless Manaphy, but Sludge Bomb's poison chance and ability to apply more damage to Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Serperior makes it the preferred option. 56 Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to tank a +2 Smart Strike from Kartana and a +2 Life Orb Knock Off from Rillaboom. 204 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature allow Amoonguss to tank two Dark Pulses from a transformed Ash-Greninja if at full health. Regenerator is the preferred ability, as it allows Amoonguss to regain health every time it switches out, therefore letting it pivot into threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora consistently.</p> <p>Amoonguss is bait for most of the metagame's Fire-types, especially if Spore has already been used.

The aforementioned Water-types appreciate Amoonguss checking Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora, while the Dragon-types appreciate Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini. Slowking also appreciates Amoonguss checking Ash-Greninja, while the two of them can work together to form a Regenerator core that is tough to break. A Ground-type, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, or Gliscor, can also prevent Amoonguss from being pivoted on by Volt Switch by the aforementioned Electric-types. A Dark-resistant Pokemon, such as Clefable or Mega Tyranitar, can also help Amoonguss pivot around Ash-Greninja effectively. Amoonguss is a Grass-type that is incapable of properly checking Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, as well as Rillaboom.

However, Alomomola faces competition from Toxapex, Quagsire, and Gastrodon as a bulky Water-type, since they provide much more utility with Toxic Spikes, Unaware, and an electric immunity, respectively. Scald lets Alomomola cripple physical attackers like Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Rillaboom. Knock Off punishes multiple Alomomola switch-ins such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko by removing their items. Wish lets Alomomola safely heal itself or its teammates, while Protect lets Alomomola scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Ash-Greninja, and Magnezone. Toxic can cripple setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Alomomola's passivity such as Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon. Rocky Helmet is used to punish physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Swampert, and Mega Scizor.

Chansey can handle most of the special attackers that threaten Alomomola, like Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Mega Charizard Y, and appreciates Alomomola's Wish support relieving the pressure that Chansey suffers during the course of battle. Skarmory and Corviknight are fantastic teammates because they can deal with problematic Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana. In return, Alomomola can check Mega Charizard X and Victini for them. Corviknight can also provide Defog support, reducing Alomomola's tendency to be worn down by entry hazards. Mega Sableye can deny entry hazards from common setters like Ferrothorn and Toxapex, letting Alomomola pivot more safely.

This dissuades the opposing team from using Defog altogether, which lends Bisharp a very useful niche seeing as keeping entry hazards up is integral to enabling dangerous teammates on hyper offense. Defiant also makes Bisharp a physical attacker that Landorus-T cannot check, as Intimidate will raise Bisharp's Attack instead of lowering it.

A specially defensive EV spread with Defog over Nasty Plot can be run to better check Ash-Greninja and Heatran, but it doesn't beat any Stealth Rock setters aside from Heatran and is incredibly passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Because of Hydreigon's typing and usual coverage options, Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Diancie can check it, provided it has not set up yet. Flash Cannon variants can threaten Clefable after enough boosts, and Mega Diancie cannot reliably switch into Hydreigon; after enough boosts, it can also threaten Clefable and Tapu Fini with Tectonic Rage after minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kommo-o resist Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and threaten it with their STAB attacks.

Nasty Plot allows Hydreigon to break down common defensive staples such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Gastrodon, and Gliscor. Earth Power hits important targets such as Toxapex, Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Mega Tyranitar while also being a good neutral option against Fairy-types. After Nasty Plot, Groundium Z allows Hydreigon to OHKO foes such as physically defensive Clefable, Toxapex, and Mega Tyranitar.

The given EV spread lets Hydreigon survive 2 Hydro Pumps from Choice Specs Greninja after Stealth Rock as well as Kartana's Sacred Sword from full HP.</p> <p>Hydreigon fits best on balance teams with offensive and defensive teammates to support it. Due to Hydreigon's average Speed tier and vulnerable defensive typing, it has a tendency to get revenge killed by offensive threats, so it appreciates teammates that can give it a solid defensive backbone and offensively check these threats. Hydreigon is capable of soft checking Heatran and Ash-Greninja, but it can get overwhelmed easily and isn't good as the only form of counterplay to them. Toxapex, Gastrodon, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Slowking aid Hydreigon in handling these Pokemon. Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn help cover Hydreigon's Fairy- and Ice-type weaknesses, with the latter two appreciating it acting as a Fire-resistant partner in return. Toxapex and Clefable can help against annoying Fighting-types trying to revenge kill Hydreigon, like Mega Lopunny and Kommo-o. Zeraora, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Victini check offensive threats like Weavile and Tapu Koko, which prove troublesome for Hydreigon. Blissey tends to render Hydreigon useless offensively, so pairing it up with Pokemon such as Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny helps out Hydreigon.</p>"

Psychic hits many of its checks, such as Toxapex and Kommo-o. Volcarona can also run Hidden Power Ground to hit one of its best counters in Heatran, but this causes it to falter against Pokemon like Toxapex and Kommo-o. Heavy-Duty Boots maintains Volcarona's defensive utility through Stealth Rock and gives it better opportunities to set up; meanwhile, Psychium Z allows it to deal incredible neutral damage with a Shattered Psyche at the cost of taking entry hazard damage. Flame Body can punish physical attackers like Rillaboom, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, while a Timid nature lets it naturally outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Excadrill, and Urshifu-R, as well as Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. Modest can be used if more power is desired, grabbing notable KOs such as Kommo-o, Mega Tyranitar, and Garchomp, but Volcarona ends up easier to revenge kill by the likes of Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Garchomp before a boost.</p> <p>Volcarona mainly fits on hyper offense, teams as they appreciate the defensive utility and firepower it brings; in return, Volcarona appreciates hyper offense teammates weakening its checks and counters, as there are a lot of situations where it cannot set up and sweep. Entry hazards delay it if it's been hit by Knock Off, and a healthy Tyranitar, Garchomp, or Heatran can take a hit and KO it back. Good examples of powerful teammates are Bisharp, Rillaboom, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. Meanwhile, cleaners like Hawlucha, Rillaboom, and Mega Gyarados can clean up late-game after Volcarona has broken through the opposing team. Serperior makes a stellar offensive core with Volcarona as Volcarona handles many of Serperior's checks such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Amoonguss, and Serperior's Glare can give Volcarona better opportunities to set up. Hazard control is also incredibly important when using Volcarona, encouraging teammates like Kartana, Corviknight, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants used on hyper offense absolutely need hazard removal through the likes of Excadrill or Regieleki to function. Leads such as Taunt Mew and Excadrill can stop Stealth Rock from being on the field, which Volcarona appreciates, and dual screens support through Grimmsnarl or Tapu Koko makes Volcarona harder to take down and give it more opportunities to set up. Lastly, Gliscor can freely set up on Volcarona's best counters: Heatran, Toxapex, and Blissey.</p>"

While it may seem appealing as a Nasty Plot sweeper, it has major flaws, being frail, easily revenged killed, and overall passive toward team styles like Sticky Web. It does have a redeeming quality in its base 111 Speed, which enables it to outspeed Pokemon such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Mega Latias and revenge kill all three. Even this advantage is diluted, however, since it's vulnerable to common priority moves like Ice Shard from Weavile and Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile. Thundurus is also harder to fit into a hyper offense team than other staples such as Volcarona and Mega Garchomp, which have superior defensive utility and are also more difficult to revenge kill than Thundurus. Most pressingly, it's near entirely outclassed by Thundurus-T, which has the exact same niche on hyper offense, especially since Sticky Web mitigates Thundurus-T's Speed disadvantage. However, Thundurus's Speed helps it on hyper offense styles without Sticky Web, like dual screens, which Thundurus-T does not work on well.</p>",

A set utilizing Substitute, Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Smack Down with Groundium Z can be used to take advantage of Body Press Corviknight and Skarmory. Bulky sets carrying Fly with Flyinium Z and U-turn can be useful, as they allow Landorus-T to threaten immediate damage onto offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Medicham and Rillaboom. It also takes advantage of the standard bulky pivot sets tending to lure in Tangrowth. However, the loss of Toxic and Rocky Helmet makes this set worse against Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Mawile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro is capable of forcing damage onto Landorus-T and potentially burning it with Scald while also eating unboosted hits rather comfortably, although it fears Toxic and a boosted Supersonic Skystrike. Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Manaphy, and Mega Swampert are all capable of threatening Landorus-T with their STAB moves as well, although Ash-Greninja can't switch into any set and the other two must be careful of Z-Moves or Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Landorus-T's quadruple Ice weakness means that any Ice-type move will deal heavy damage, if not OHKO. Weavile and Kyurem both outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO it with a STAB move. In addition, Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Mega Medicham can carry Ice-type moves, allowing them to threaten Landorus-T with enormous damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Corviknight only fears Knock Off from the Choice Scarf and Defensive sets and can proceed to remove Landorus-T's Stealth Rock rather comfortably. Gliscor doesn't even fear Knock Off, but it must be careful of Swords Dance variants. Rotom-W is threatened by a stray Toxic but can force out Landorus-T with its STAB Hydro Pump. Skarmory can use Landorus-T to freely set up Spikes. However, all of these Pokemon must be cautious of the Rockium Z set, and the rare Smack Down variant completely invalidates all of these as answers.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Landorus-T is rather susceptible to residual damage, as it is often tasked with checking several prominent threats on the opposing team.

It gives teams offensive and defensive weapons against threats such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. U-turn allows Landorus-T to keep up the momentum and take advantage of the switches it forces from common Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Toxapex, and Heatran. Stone Edge 2HKOes Zapdos, OHKOes Moltres, and allows Landorus-T to revenge kill Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off, on the other hand, removes important items from the likes of Slowbro, Zapdos, Moltres, Tapu Fini, and Tangrowth. Punishment allows Landorus-T to deal with Calm Mind Mega Latias, 2HKOing it after a Calm Mind, as well as Calm Mind Reuniclus. It works especially well with teammates that force Mega Latias to use Calm Mind multiple times, such as Corviknight. Explosion allows Landorus-T to deal more damage to certain threats, such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Kommo-o, and Rotom-W; however, keep in mind that all of them require chip damage before being KOed. Defog can be used if the role compression of having revenge killing and hazard removal in the same teamslot is needed. Unfortunately, being locked into Defog gives foes free turns. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp. Earth Power can work on teams that are desperately in need of a reliable Kartana revenge killer and need Landorus-T's role compression. A neutral nature and 76 Special Attack EVs should be run in this case in order to secure the OHKO on Kartana. 244 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used to outrun Arctozolt in hail.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Toxapex, work well with Landorus-T. Slowbro can also form a pivoting core with Landorus-T with Teleport, while Toxapex is capable of taking on Ash-Greninja for Landorus-T. These Water-types also appreciate Landorus-T's Electric immunity, and Toxapex also appreciates the Ground immunity. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele appreciate Landorus-T solidly handling fast threats for them and pivoting them in with U-turn. Mega Mawile and Kyurem are capable of taking advantage of Slowbro, a physical sponge that can generally pivot into Landorus-T safely, and Kyurem can additionally deal with Zapdos. Choice Scarf Landorus-T will get worn down over the course of a game, so having Defog support in the form of Corviknight, Zapdos, or Kartana is very helpful.

U-turn is useful, as it lets Landorus-T pivot out of bad matchups against Corviknight and Slowbro. Toxic is used to punish threats such as opposing Landorus-T, Mega Latias, Kyurem, and Slowbro that might look to come in on Landorus-T. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option for teams that need a buffer against Kartana and Mega Scizor. It also gives Landorus-T a more reliable way to wear down Ferrothorn.

Rocky Helmet is preferred to punish U-turn from the likes of opposing Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Corviknight, as well as general contact moves from threats such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile. 16 Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outspeed Modest Magnezone and Adamant Tyranitar, with the rest being put into Defense to maximize its bulk. 88 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Bisharp, as well.</p> <p>Defensive Landorus-T finds its place on more offensive builds that appreciate it checking threats such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny while also keeping up momentum and setting Stealth Rock.

Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack to titanic levels, allowing Earthquake to do enormous damage to even bulky neutral targets and making Explosion much more powerful, notably allowing it to OHKO Zapdos, Gliscor, and Slowbro while doing over 50% to Corviknight. Focus Sash lets Landorus-T live one hit from full, allowing it to get Stealth Rock up reliably in most situations.</p> <p>Suicide Lead Landorus-T fits well on hyper offense teams that need to get the game started with a bang and keep Stealth Rock up if possible. Landorus-T is a great lead, as it matches up well against the vast majority of entry hazard removal options. The only notable ways to stop Landorus-T from getting Stealth Rock up are a faster Taunt user, such as Mew, or a Magic Bounce user such as Mega Sableye. Hyper offense teams utilizing Choice Scarf Victini can also make Victini the lead instead, as Landorus-T tends to trade Stealth Rock with opposing Stealth Rock setters, and it can be therefore more valuable at times to deny the opponent's Stealth Rock first and send in Landorus-T next. This pair can also take two foes with it quite easily. Staple sweepers on hyper offense such as Mega Gyarados, Belly Drum Kommo-o, Mega Garchomp, and Rillaboom are good teammates, as they all appreciate Stealth Rock wearing down the opposition and Landorus-T opening up a big hole with Explosion early-game.</p>"

Swords Dance Landorus-T is also one of the best Pokemon for breaking stall teams, as the immense power combined with a Z-Move makes checking Landorus-T quite hard for them, even with Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Quagsire. Fly with Flyinium Z allows Landorus-T to smash through common defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Stone Edge with Rockium Z, on the other hand, lets Landorus-T directly threaten common Defoggers like Corviknight and Zapdos while also allowing it to break through Rotom-W with greater efficiency. It also still has enough power to OHKO Tapu Fini at +2. Its targets are rather limited, however, which makes Flyinium Z the overall superior choice. The Rockium Z set also faces competition from Garchomp, which sits at a significantly better Speed tier that gives it the jump on Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Hydreigon, but Landorus-T retains a niche due to compressing a Ground immunity and getting better damage rolls against Corviknight.</p> <p>Late-game cleaners are excellent partners for Landorus-T, as they greatly appreciate Landorus-T weakening or straight up removing bulkier Pokemon while also setting up Stealth Rock.

Ash-Greninja also forms a dangerous hazard-setting duo while appreciating Landorus-T’s ability to defeat Toxapex, Blissey, Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini. U-turn variants of Ash-Greninja can also be employed to get Landorus-T in safely and exploit Pokemon such as Toxapex and Blissey. Mega Lopunny appreciates Landorus-T’s ability to weaken Corviknight and Zapdos, letting them wreak havoc later on. Landorus-T appreciates pivot support that can get it in safely. Blissey, Mega Scizor, and Slowbro are good partners as a result. Magnezone also stands out as an exemplary partner, as it can take out Corviknight and Skarmory for Landorus-T, allowing it to use its Z-Move on other targets. Landorus-T's teammates can be tuned depending on what Z-Crystal it is using. Pokemon that appreciate Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon removed make for good partners for the Flyinium Z variant, with Mega Lopunny working in this regard. Teammates that appreciate the removal or denting of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Zapdos work well as partners for the Rockium Z set.

A Modest nature is preferred to improve Kyurem's offensive prowess; however, Timid is an option to outspeed Mega Garchomp, offensive Landorus-T, and Modest Zapdos. Never-Melt Ice boosts Kyurem's damage against switch-ins like Clefable and Corviknight and makes it harder for them to check Kyurem. Icium Z is another option that allows Kyurem to break through common checks like Clefable, Reuniclus, and Corviknight, and also free up a moveslot to run Hidden Power Fire to beat Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. However, Never-Melt Ice is usually preferred since it is more consistent and does not take up the team's Z-move slot.</p> <p>Kyurem fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can supply it with the support it needs to function effectively. Defog support is required, as Kyurem is greatly hindered by entry hazards. As such, Defoggers like Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tapu Fini make for good teammates. Pivots like Slowbro, Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny can also help bring Kyurem onto the field safely. The latter three also help lure in Grass-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Serperior, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Zapdos, which Kyurem can threaten out. Mega Lopunny is one of the best teammates for Kyurem, as Kyurem can easily switch into most of Mega Lopunny's checks while Mega Lopunny can pressure Pokemon that try to revenge kill Kyurem like Greninja, Kartana, and Weavile. Magnezone is a solid partner, as it is able to handle Steel-types that hinder Kyure, like Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from teammates like Greninja, Heatran, and Landorus-T is greatly appreciated, as it makes it harder for foes to switch into Kyurem's attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Because of its very high natural bulk, SubRoost Kyurem excels at taking advantage of passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Blissey, and Tangrowth by setting up Substitutes so that their status moves can't affect it. This pairs nicely with Pressure and Roost, allowing it to effectively PP stall these targets. Freeze-Dry has high PP and super effectively hit Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini that'd resist its other Ice-type STAB options, and Earth Power covers the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Freeze-Dry like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Victini. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes so that Seismic Toss from Blissey and Chansey can't break it in one hit.</p> <p>Fast pivots with U-turn like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Greninja make excellent teammates to Kyurem by baiting in bulky passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Chansey and giving Kyurem a free switch to set up Substitute. If Kyurem can't safely get a Substitute up, it is fairly vulnerable to Pokemon like Clefable, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight that can eat hits from it and break its Substitute. As a result, Kyurem greatly appreciates having teammates like Magnezone and Heatran that can deal with the Steel- and Fairy-types that can threaten it. Magnezone is notable due to its ability to completely trap and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. Because of Kyurem's lack of immediate power, it's also very much setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus, so Pokemon that can stop these setup sweepers make for good teammates. Crippling them with a status move like Toxic or Thunder Wave works well, so Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex can be useful, Toxapex can also remove boosts from Reuniclus and Clefable, which are not crippled by status too heavily. If you choose to not run Heavy-Duty Boots, hazards are also a massive threat to Kyurem, so it should always be paired with a reliable Defogger like Zapdos, Corviknight, or Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kyurem is a powerful wallbreaker that focuses more on doing big damage to the opposing team's defensive core. Freeze-Dry lets it super effectively hit Water-types, whereas Ice Beam can 2HKO Pokemon that Freeze-Dry can't like Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight. The last slot can be either Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, both of which hit Steel-types. Earth Power is better for Heatran, but Hidden Power Fire is better against Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, at the cost of being less reliable against other Steel-types. Focus Blast is an option to hit Steel-types as well as Blissey, but Blissey does not get 2HKOed unless Kyurem is running a Modest nature, and it is less reliable than the other options.</p> <p>Because of Kyurem being able to fire off such powerful attacks, it really likes having faster teammates that can clean up late-game. Mega Lopunny, Greninja, and Jirachi can all clean up games quite easily once Kyurem has punched a few holes in the opposing team's defensive core. Due to its subpar Speed stat, notable threats such as Victini, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko naturally outspeed and OHKO or deal a lot of damage to Kyurem. The Specially bulky pivots that can eat multiple hits from Kyurem like Blissey, specially defensive Corviknight, and Mega Scizor can pose a big threat to it in combination with faster pivots like the aforementioned Victini, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. Because of this, you want to pair Kyurem up with Pokemon that can punish opposing pivots. Tyranitar and Weavile can Pursuit trap some of the more physically frail answers to Kyurem, like Blissey, Corviknight, and Reuniclus. Furthermore, offensive entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Heatran can help weaken Pokemon switching in against Kyurem and allow it to achieve 2HKOs that it couldn't before. Kyurem itself is very weak to hazards, so you should always run it with a good Defogger like Corviknight or Zapdos. Tapu Fini is also an option, but it should only be paired with Kyurem if it elects not to run any Dragon-type attacks.</p>"

However, Substitute allows Keldeo to sponge Volt Switch from Rotom-W and take hits Pokemon that would revenge kill it, like Kartana and Tapu Lele, and deal huge damage back. It's often the superior choice as a result. Choice Specs gives Keldeo immediate wallbreaking potential against the likes of Clefable and Zapdos. While this set is strong, it is much easier to play around, as Pokemon like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Mega Latias can scout much more easily against it. A Choice Scarf set with Stone Edge is able to revenge kill +1 Volcarona, but this set sacrifices all of Keldeo's power and makes it much easier to take advantage of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini easily revenge kill Keldeo after it KOes some foe. However, Tapu Lele is unable to switch in safely. Pokemon that are naturally faster than Keldeo like Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Kartana deter it from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Toxapex and Tapu Fini wall Keldeo entirely; Toxapex can use Haze to get rid of any accumulated boosts and resists both of its STAB moves, while Tapu Fini can use Taunt to block Calm Mind and also resists both its STAB moves. Rotom-W can also break Substitute with Volt Switch and pivot into a faster threat like Tapu Lele to take care of Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Calm Mind Users</strong>: Reuniclus and Mega Latias are two notable setup sweepers that pose a massive threat to Keldeo. Both completely ignore its accrued Special Defense boosts with Psyshock and force it out accordingly. Mega Latias is especially troublesome, as it resists both of Keldeo's STAB moves and is naturally faster than it, walling it entirely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Serperior, Rillaboom, and Tangrowth make it incredibly hard for Keldeo to pull off a sweep, as Serperior boosts alongside Keldeo with Leaf Storm and is naturally faster, Rillaboom revenge kills it with Grassy Glide, and Tangrowth prevents Keldeo from setting up entirely because of Giga Drain recovering more than Secret Sword can damage it.</p>",

Keldeo's STAB combination also lets it force out the likes of Gliscor, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T. Afterwards, it can use Substitute to safely set up Calm Mind or throw out an attack, all while avoiding debilitating status from Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran. Secret Sword is essential in giving Keldeo a niche over Ash-Greninja, beating Pokemon like Chansey and Ferrothorn after Keldeo accrues enough boosts beforehand. It can also let Keldeo beat setup sweepers like Calm Mind Tapu Fini one-on-one. Keldeo also has a good matchup against rain teams, threatening wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and using Weavile as setup fodder. The Special Defense boost from Calm Mind prevents Clefable from 2HKOing with Moonblast after Leftovers recovery, which lets Keldeo retaliate with a boosted Scald, 2HKOing Clefable. Defensively, Keldeo's typing and Leftovers let it check threats over the course of a game, such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Scald burns also make Tapu Lele and Toxapex easier to wear down over the course of a game. Despite all these benefits, Keldeo can be hard to justify over wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Ash-Greninja. It is completely walled by the likes of Mega Latias, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex, whereas Urshifu-R can use U-turn on them to gain momentum, and Ash-Greninja can use Spikes to make it harder for Tapu Fini and Toxapex to switch in. Defensive utility with no recovery moves can see it worn down over the course of a game, eventually KOed by Pokemon it needs to check, like Heatran and Weavile. Keldeo lacks immediate power compared to other wallbreakers and is therefore easier to switch into initially, though it can uniquely break through defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Mega Scizor with enough boosts gained beforehand.</p> <p>Keldeo fits well on bulky offense teams looking for a potential wincon that also has solid defensive utility. Ferrothorn is a fantastic partner for adequately dealing with Tapu Fini and Clefable. It can also set Spikes, which makes Keldeo even more difficult to switch into. Spikes also wears down checks over the course of a game, like Assault Vest Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini, which lack reliable recovery. Weavile is an amazing partner that can Pursuit trap Mega Latias, which Keldeo cannot get past whatsoever. Tapu Lele appreciates Keldeo taking care of Steel-types and can take advantage of Keldeo checks like Mega Latias and Toxapex. Heatran wears down Tapu Fini for Keldeo and appreciates it heavily pressuring Ground-types. Heatran can also make use of Stealth Rock or Toxic to wear down Tapu Fini and Mega Latias, respectively. Sand Tomb Mega Scizor is able to pressure Toxapex for Keldeo, enabling it to clean late-game.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam may be used over Spikes on rain teams with Ferrothorn as the Spikes setter so that Ash-Greninja can lure in and damage Hydreigon and Kommo-o for teammates to take advantage of. It is, however, strictly inferior to U-turn and Spikes outside of rain teams, as it leaves Ash-Greninja unable to make progress against many of its other checks and easily taken advantage of. U-turn enables Ash-Greninja to take proper advantage of Blissey, but it fails to make much of any progress against Toxapex and Amoonguss, who are more relevant roadblocks for Ash-Greninja. For Protean Greninja, Psychium Z with Extrasensory can be used on a specially-based set to remove Toxapex and Amoonguss, but since both generally invest in Special Defense, it struggles to break them without substantial chip damage. Expert Belt can be used with Greninja's great coverage for much higher wallbreaking power, but lacking a Z-Move means more prediction is required. Hidden Power Fire can also be used over Gunk Shot or Hydro Pump on the Heavy-Duty Boots set to pressure Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, but lets Tapu Fini wall it and Mega Diancie constantly pivot into Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Most bulky Water-types are some of the best available options to check Ash-Greninja, as they can easily switch into Hydro Pump and take a few Dark Pulses as well. Tapu Fini is excellent even among these, resisting both of its STAB types, potentially setting up on it, and removing Spikes with Defog. Toxapex, especially if running Baneful Bunker, is another solid check that can easily deny Battle Bond activation. Gastrodon and the more niche Mantine are immune to Water-type attacks courtesy of their abilities, and they have the bulk and recovery to repeatedly tank Dark Pulse as well. Mantine is also capable of removing Spikes. However, Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery and is therefore prone to being overwhelmed in the long run, whereas both Toxapex and Gastrodon are prone to getting overwhelmed by either Spikes or Dark Pulse flinches if they aren't paired with sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Tyranitar. Ash-Greninja can also gain momentum from all of these checks with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey sport tremendous special bulk and do not mind Ash-Greninja's attacks at all. Blissey is particularly effective due to its standard Heavy-Duty Boots set blocking entry hazard damage and its ability to preserve momentum with Teleport. Both can be taken advantage of with U-turn, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types are great options for checking Ash-Greninja, as they too resist Hydro Pump, and they often have the bulk to take repeated Dark Pulses as well. Ferrothorn, especially with Protect, is able to prevent Battle Bond from activating for quite some time and can punish U-turn with Iron Barbs. However, it lacks reliable recovery and is therefore prone to getting overwhelmed by repeated Dark Pulses. The rare Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can preserve momentum with Regenerator, but they must watch out for a stray Ice Beam. Mega Venusaur is also capable of taking on an untransformed Ash-Greninja for quite some time. However, Synthesis having low PP greatly restricts it long-term. All of these are also prone to being taken advantage of by U-turn or overwhelmed by Spikes and stray Dark Pulse flinches if they aren't paired with satisfactory Dark-resistant Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Hydreigon and Kommo-o</strong>: Hydreigon and Kommo-o are capable of directly pivoting into an untransformed Ash-Greninja, as they resist both of its STAB moves, and Hydreigon is immune to Spikes as well. From there, Hydreigon can force Ash-Greninja out and recover the damage with Roost, while Kommo-o can use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or cripple a switch-in with Toxic. However, Ash-Greninja remains capable of making progress with U-turn or Spikes. In addition, both must watch out for Ice Beam on rain teams.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Ash-Greninja suffers from mediocre bulk and is therefore prone to faster attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Victini, as well as Tapu Koko before it transforms. However, Ash-Greninja's access to a strong priority move does help it to an extent in these matchups. Moreover, Ash-Greninja also resists common forms of priority such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile and Bisharp, and Water Shuriken from opposing Ash-Greninja. This makes priority outside of Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Mega Medicham's Fake Out not a big concern as long as Ash-Greninja is fairly healthy. Due to Protean Greninja's frailty, the Heavy-Duty Boots and Z-Move sets are extremely easy to revenge kill with faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn are all formidable checks to Greninja, as it struggles to fit the coverage moves necessary to stop them from walling it outright.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon Not Weak to Coverage Moves</strong>: Greninja suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, with every combination of coverage moves letting different Pokemon wall it. For example, picking Hydro Pump over Gunk Shot lets Tapu Fini wall Heavy-Duty Boots Greninja, but the reverse lets Heatran counter it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ash-Greninja is an incredible offensive threat in National Dex due to its great Special Attack and Speed, formidable offensive typing, and access to potent priority in Water Shuriken. Said traits make Ash-Greninja one of the best late-game cleaners and a good way to limit threats such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Mega Mawile. However, Ash-Greninja's bulk is quite mediocre, meaning it cannot repeatedly pivot into even resisted hits such as Heatran's Magma Storm. This also makes it prone to faster attackers and priority users such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Rillaboom. Moreover, Ash-Greninja's full potential is only reached once it has claimed a KO and activated Battle Bond, which restricts its initial breaking prowess. Even when transformed, Ash-Greninja can't break through all of its most common checks at once, with Tapu Fini and Toxapex being popular Pokemon that can stonewall it.</p> <p>Surf may be used over Hydro Pump on rain teams to have both accuracy and power, but its considerably lower power outside of rain may hinder Ash-Greninja's overall wallbreaking prowess by situationally missing out on KOs. Spikes gives Ash-Greninja an option to punish the opponent in the long run for switching in checks such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini lacking Defog, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Ash-Greninja generally fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams capable of providing it with a sturdy defensive backbone it can fall back on, as well as proper offensive support in order to assist it in activating Battle Bond and cleaning up. Depending on the set, either Toxapex or Blissey will be the largest roadblock to activating Battle Bond. If running U-turn, run teammates that can take advantage of both Toxapex and Blissey after Ash-Greninja pivots out of them. Mega Medicham, Garchomp, Taunt Heatran, and Tapu Lele are some great options in this regard. If running Spikes, forcing progress against Blissey with smart double switches into teammates such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Kartana is especially crucial. Tapu Fini and Hydreigon are some other Pokemon Ash-Greninja may struggle against initially, with both comfortably stomaching its STAB moves. Thus, strong means of pressuring them like Kyurem and Tapu Koko can prove helpful. Knock Off support from the likes of Clefable, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn assists Ash-Greninja by removing crucial items from checks such as Blissey, Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex. Ferrothorn is particularly helpful, freeing up Ash-Greninja's last moveslot by virtue of being a great Spikes setter itself. Although Water Shuriken remedies this to an extent, Ash-Greninja remains prone to faster attackers as well as priority and Choice Scarf users such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Rillaboom. A sturdy defensive backbone consisting of Pokemon such as Slowbro, Clefable, Corviknight, and Zapdos can combat these threats. Slowbro and Slowking are particularly effective, pressuring Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini with Future Sight and safely bringing Ash-Greninja in with Teleport. Ash-Greninja is a powerful staple on rain teams, which greatly help it activate Battle Bond by pairing it with wallbreakers and strengthening its Water-type attacks. Wallbreakers that pair well with Ash-Greninja include Mega Swampert, Zapdos, and Manaphy. Lastly, as Ash-Greninja's bulk is quite mediocre, pivoting support from the likes of Slowbro, Corviknight, Blissey, and Mega Scizor can let it safely enter a battle.</p>"

It's also hard to check both defensively and offensively due to its coverage moves and great Speed tier. Dig allows Greninja to fire off a strong Tectonic Rage and KO the likes of Toxapex, which tends to switch in due to being a check to Battle Bond Greninja. It also hits the likes of Mega Mawile and Heatran and makes up for Greninja's general lack of power. Low Kick alongside Fightinium Z enables a powerful All-Out Pummeling, allowing it to break through Blissey and Chansey. Both Z-Moves make sure Greninja is able to beat Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Mawile. Ice Beam lets Greninja hit Grass- and Dragon-types such as Kommo-o, Amoonguss, and Hydreigon, as well as Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Gunk Shot nails the Fairy-types that would otherwise pester it such as Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable.

Due to Greninja's lack of power, it struggles to break through bulkier teams, notably relying on a Z-Move to break through Toxapex, Heatran, and Chansey; teammates that can consistently pressure these Pokemon such as Gliscor and Clefable work well with it.

        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Greninja is a potent Spiker, with its offensive power discouraging many common Defoggers such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini from coming in, and Heavy-Duty Boots improving its lackluster longevity. Its high Speed tier alongside constant U-turn pivoting makes Heavy-Duty Boots especially appealing. Gunk Shot lets Greninja pressure Tapu Fini, helping keep its Spikes up, as well as hitting Tapu Bulu and Serperior harder. Hydro Pump instead lets Greninja pressure Mega Diancie and Heatran, although Greninja then can't stop Tapu Fini from freely coming in and using Defog. Ice Beam nails Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types such as Serperior, Hydreigon, Gliscor, and Garchomp, as well as letting it revenge kill Kartana. U-turn lets Greninja generate momentum on Pokemon that normally wall it such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Slowbro, and bringing in a teammate to take advantage of them like Kartana or Tapu Koko. Lastly, Spikes whittles down common switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth, constantly pressuring opposing teams, especially when alongside other entry hazards.</p> <p>Greninja‘s great Speed tier allows it to clean against weakened teams, so heavy hitters such as Melmetal, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham are amazing partners. Mega Latios and Gliscor greatly appreciate Greninja's Spikes stacking wearing down their checks. Since Greninja struggles to break through opposing entry hazard removers such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini, Pokemon that can pressure them such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Mega Diancie are stellar partners, and they also pair Stealth Rock with its Spikes. Because Greninja can't break through bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor, Magnezone is amazing to remove these problematic Pokemon for it, as well as preventing Corviknight from clearing its Spikes with Defog. Greninja lures Corviknight in by setting Spikes, uses U-turn on the Defog turn, and brings Magnezone in, letting Magnezone trap and eliminate Corviknight for Greninja to continuously set Spikes later. Pokemon that can threaten bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Slowking, such as Kartana, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom, also work well with Greninja, as it can't normally break through them. Knock Off users such as Rillaboom and Toxapex can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Volcorona, Tapu Koko, Blissey, and Slowbro to make Greninja's Spikes more impactful.</p>"

Hawlucha appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Mew and Landorus-T, it allows Haluwcha to more easily offensively pressure Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Tapu Fini. Additionally, Hawlucha enjoys the presence of wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham that can aid it in its sweep Hawlucha struggles a lot with Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini, as they can heavily threaten it due to Moonblast; thus, checks to them such as Bisharp and Victini are very reliable teammates.

In addition, it‘s a terrific wallbreaker thanks to its incredible offenses and good Speed in conjunction with colorful coverage. Diamond Storm is preferred over Power Gem to wear down specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Slowking. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that easily dispatches Pokemon like Garchomp and Mega Latias while also hitting physical walls like defensive Landorus-T quite hard. Mystical Fire is crucial coverage, as it targets Corviknight and Ferrothorn and discourages Mega Scizor from switching in. Instead of Stealth Rock, Earth Power can be used to snipe Heatran and do more damage to Mega Mawile and Excadrill. Encore can also be used in this moveslot to, for example, lock Corviknight into Defog or Tapu Fini into Calm Mind, allowing Mega Diancie to exploit the switch or revenge kill them. Magic Bounce deters status moves and entry hazards, allowing Mega Diancie to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Blissey. 132 Special Attack EVs allow it to 2HKO Corviknight with 72 Special Defense EVs after Stealth Rock, with the remaining EVs going into Attack for better damage rolls against Pokemon like Blissey and Heatran.</p> <p>Mega Diancie fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its monstrous wallbreaking power and Stealth Rock. Magnezone is a phenomenal teammate thanks to its ability to completely remove Steel-types, allowing Mega Diancie to forgo Mystical Fire entirely. Because of Mega Diancie’s frailty, pivots that can bring it in like Blissey, Slowking, and Corviknight make solid partners. Blissey can also paralyze offensive answers to Mega Diancie such as Greninja and Ash-Greninja, Slowking can use Future Sight to make its attacks indirectly stronger, and Corviknight can check defensive Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor that Mega Diancie can’t break through on its own. Wallbreakers and late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Kartana and Kyurem appreciate Stealth Rock and Mega Diancie’s ability to wear down several defensive Pokemon, such as Blissey, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Kartana in particular loves Mega Diancie pressuring Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Corviknight, while Kartana uses the defensive Ground-types that Mega Diancie baits in as setup fodder. Mega Diancie can form solid entry hazard stacking cores with Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja thanks to their collective ability to beat down Defoggers so that entry hazards can stay up. Ferrothorn can also annoy several of Mega Diancie's checks like Heatran and Blissey with Toxic, Leech Seed, and Knock Off, while Ash-Greninja can beat down the checks it shares with Mega Diancie like Ferrothorn and Toxapex.</p>"

Therefore, it appreciates slow pivots such as Corviknight, Slowbro, and Slowking. Mega Scizor is an exceptional partner, as it lures in Pokemon such as Toxapex and Heatran for Hoopa-U to take advantage of, provides excellent defensive synergy by absorbing Fairy- and Bug-type moves, and appreciates Hoopa-U breaking down teams for it to clean late-game. Hoopa-U struggles in the offense matchup, so fast threats such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko are good partners for it; they deal with faster teams and can also bring in Hoopa-U on their checks such as Toxapex and Chansey. Entry Hazard support is extremely beneficial to Hoopa-U, as Spikes wear down foes trying to play around Hoopa-U's attacks, such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Alomomola, so Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Greninja are good partners. A sturdy defensive core to fall back on is also needed due to Hoopa-U's ability to be revenge killed easily, so Pokemon such as Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Slowking work well with it.</p>"

However, due to not being able to run Toxic, Volcanion is often left helpless against the likes of Mega Latias and Slowking, making Pursuit users such as Weavile mandatory alongside it.

Toxapex can pivot into Volcanion, as it resists both of Volcanion's STAB moves and is immune to Toxic; however, Toxapex takes a hefty chunk from Earth Power and often can't consistently pivot into it. Tapu Fini resists both of Volcanion’s STAB options while also being immune to Toxic; however, due to its lack of consistent recovery, it is easily worn down and eventually can lose to Volcanion if it constantly has to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to Volcanion's lack of recovery and susceptibility to all entry hazards, entry hazard chip racks up very quickly in the long term, especially considering Volcanion's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, chip damage from sand and hail can also drastically cut into Volcanion's health.

Furthermore, its ability in Water Absorb and stellar defensive typing allow it to provide solid defensive utility on offense teams, as it can act as a soft check towards threats such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Fini. However, Volcanion is fairly easy to pivot around due to all of its moves having common resistances or immunities, and it is overdependent on Toxic to break through its checks like Gastrodon and Mega Latias. These issues are compounded by Volcanion's awful longevity due to its crippling weakness to entry hazards. These factors mean that Volcanion faces severe competition from other, more effective wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's main STAB move, nailing even neutral targets such as Garchomp and Clefable for large amounts of damage. Flamethrower lets Volcanion hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Serperior. Earth Power is Volcanion's coverage move of choice, letting it threaten Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Toxic allows Volcanion to slowly whittle down would-be checks in Mega Latias, Slowking, and Gastrodon by badly poisoning them on the switch in. Sludge Wave can also be used as an option over Toxic to hit Tapu Fini extremely hard and deter it from switching in, as well as also being a solid midground against Grass-types, although it means that Volcanion can no longer punish Mega Latias and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Volcanion fits best on offensively oriented teams that appreciate its short-term defensive capabilites and its terrifying wallbreaking prowess. Teammates such as Mega Scizor, Tapu Lele, and Arctozolt appreciate Volcanion's ability to pressure bulky Water- and Steel-types, such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, opposing Mega Scizor and Toxapex. These Pokemon baiting in Steel- and Water-types provides natural entry points for Volcanion to come in and act as a wallbreaker. Due to Volcanion's susceptibility to entry hazards, Pokemon such as Mega Diancie that can deflect it or good Defoggers such as Corviknight and Kartana make for solid partners. Pokemon that appreciate Volcanion taking the Water- and Fire-type attacks from Ash-Greninja and Heatran directed at them such as Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, respectively, are also good partners. Although Volcanion can pressure out slower Ground-types, faster ones often force it out instead, so Ground-immune Pokemon such as Corviknight and Landorus-T are excellent partners. Electric- immune Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Gliscor also work well due to Volcanion's tendency to be forced out by Electric-types.

Furthermore, due to how low Kommo-o is left after setting up, it can often be easily killed by a myriad of faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Hawlucha, as well as priority from the likes of Rillaboom and Mega Scizor. Substitute allows Kommo-o to setup safely on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and avoid status such as Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp, Toxapex's Toxic, and Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, as well as protecting Kommo-o from attempts to revenge kill it. The combined HP lost from Substitute and Belly Drum allow Kommo-o to instantly activate its Salac Berry. Drain Punch is used over other stronger options like Close Combat because the damage increase isn't needed, and it allows Kommo-o to recover the health lost from setting up. Thunder Punch provides solid coverage alongside Drain Punch, letting Kommo-o nail common Fighting- resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Clefable. The given EV spread allows Kommo-o to always consume its Salac Berry after Substitute and Belly Drum. If Kommo-o is being used alongside dual screens, it can run 52 HP EVs to avoid having its Substitute broken by Magnezone's Flash Cannon under Light Screen. Bulletproof is the chosen ability to let Kommo-o setup on the likes of Gyro Ball Ferrothorn, as well as Shadow Ball from Gengar and Blacephalon.</p> <p>Belly Drum Kommo-o only fits on hyper offense teams due to its one-time setup nature. Dual screens setters such as Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl are beneficial, as the extra bulk provided gives significantly more setup opportunities for Kommo-o. Tapu Koko in particular is also a solid teammate, as Electric Terrain boosts the damage of Kommo-o's Thunder Punch, letting it score KOs on Pokemon like Clefable, Reuniclus, and Victini when it normally wouldn't. Due to Kommo-o's susceptibility to getting revenge killed by faster threats, Shuckle is a solid partner that can set up Sticky Web for it to outspeed those threats. Hawlucha and Mega Garchomp are exemplary partners for Kommo-o, as they both pressure their shared checks in Landorus-T, Clefable, and Zapdos. Mega Gyarados, Serperior, and Manaphy are stellar partners due to them being able to lure and break Unaware Quagsire and Clefable, which otherwise stonewall Kommo-o. Lastly, Pokemon that can wear down or break Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Gyarados, and Volcarona are good partners.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a very niche option that covers both Ferrothorn and Excadrill. However, it sacrifices Hidden Power Ice, drastically worsening the matchup against Gliscor. On hyper offense teams, Tapu Koko could run a dual screens set with Light Clay and Taunt that can also enable Hawlucha, but the superior dual screens setter in Grimmsnarl can do the same in conjunction with Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain support. Shuca Berry may be used on the pivot set in tandem with Hidden Power Ice to lure Ground-types. However, the chip damage from entry hazards makes Tapu Koko a less effective pivot as it's forced to Roost more often. Defog can also be used, but Tapu Koko doesn't consistently beat any entry hazard setter. Defog also removes its Electric Terrain, making Tapu Koko significantly weaker, and the lost coverage slot hurts its matchup against Ground-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Opposing teams having a Ground-type can really deter Tapu Koko's progress-making by forcing a lot of mind games between Hidden Power Ice and Volt Switch. Some of the more common Ground-types in the tier like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor must be wary of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, but the Ground-types that aren't weak to Ice, like Gastrodon and Excadrill, completely wall Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and the rare Assault Vest Tangrowth resist Tapu Koko's main STAB type and are bulky enough to stomach Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice relatively easily as well. Amoonguss and Tangrowth are particularly pesky, capable of neutralizing Tapu Koko's progress with Volt Switch due to Regenerator. Meanwhile, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs punishes Tapu Koko for using U-turn, forcing it to Roost more frequently.  Although not able to switch in safely, Rillaboom can check Tapu Koko in a pinch as well, owing to its resistance to Electric-type attacks and access to strong priority. However, barring Amoonguss and Tangrowth, none of these Grass-types can maintain a positive or even neutral momentum trade against Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Walls</strong>: Blissey, Chansey, and Galarian Slowking sport tremendous special bulk, which allows them to hold Tapu Koko off for a while. However, they can be overwhelmed with Volt Switch and U-turn in the long run quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong> While Tapu Koko is very fast, there are still Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja. Additionally Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Victini, and Jirachi all outspeed it and can threaten it out with STAB moves. Priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Weaville, and Ash-Greninja can threaten to knock out a previously weakened Tapu Koko as well.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Because of its stellar Speed, good offensive prowess, and access to a strong Volt Switch, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. It has a relatively poor Special Attack stat, but its ability to summon Electric Terrain in tandem with the use of a Choice Specs makes up for that. Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit the Ground-types that are immune to its Electric-type moves like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon. This is incredibly important; a well-timed Hidden Power Ice will cleanly OHKO the former two Ground-types and force the latter two out, and the resulting mind games drastically improve Tapu Koko's ability to generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch lets Tapu Koko scout the opponent and gain free momentum once the opponent's Ground-type has been removed. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Koko a good neutral option against Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt but aren't very threatened by Hidden Power, like opposing Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Alternatively, it can run Roost to improve its longevity in more drawn-out games against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. However, Roost forces Tapu Koko to switch out, thereby losing momentum. Grass Knot is another option that lends Tapu Koko the ability to pressure Gastrodon and Mega Swampert much harder, but it is inferior to Dazzling Gleam otherwise.</p> <p>Due to its role as a fast pivot that can generally keep up momentum well, Tapu Koko fits very well on more offensive teams, but it's a fine fit on balanced teams as well. Tapu Koko pairs particularly well with teammates that can bait in Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Such teammates include the likes of Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor. Moreover, all of these partners bar Heatran are capable of creating pivoting cores with Tapu Koko courtesy of their access to U-turn, with Greninja and Ash-Greninja amplifying progress made through pivoting with Spikes as well. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Ash-Greninja, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Kyurem can easily pressure most of the metagame's Ground-types, including the ones that are particularly annoying for Tapu Koko such as Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill. On the other hand, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran take advantage of Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which can otherwise keep Tapu Koko at bay for extended amounts of time. Due to Tapu Koko's tendency to force plenty of switches and rack up damage with Volt Switch, good entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Heatran, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja make for good teammates that can greatly speed up the rate at which Tapu Koko can break teams down. Tapu Koko also likes having strong physical wallbreakers on its side to deal with the more specially defensive Pokemon that check it such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha make for great teammates to pressure these special walls, with the latter two also having great synergy with Electric Terrain. Lastly, as Tapu Koko is quite frail and prone to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Ash-Greninja as a result, it appreciates a defensive backbone that can sponge up hits from these threats. On bulky offense teams, Pokemon such as bulky Landorus-T, Slowbro, Corviknight, and Blissey can provide said backbone while also maintaining momentum with their pivoting moves. On balanced teams, the likes of Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight can fulfill the same objective.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Speed stat and solid typing, Tapu Koko functions as a stellar offensive pivot, being able to switch into the likes of Corviknight, Mega Sableye, and Toxapex. This, in tandem with U-turn, allows Tapu Koko to safely pivot in teammates like Mega Medicham, Kyurem, and Mega Mawile. However, Tapu Koko's lack of power makes it unable to pressure a plethora of Pokemon, like Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Mega Latias. Its high Speed also lets it revenge kill fast Pokemon like Weavile, Greninja, and Serperior. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred coverage option, as it lets Tapu Koko hit Ground-types such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp trying to switch into Tapu Koko's Electric-type moves while also chunking Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Rillaboom, and Serperior. Dazzling Gleam can be run instead to hit Dragon-types like Kyurem, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon, but at the cost of a much worse matchup against Landorus-T and Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots allows for Tapu Koko to switch in without having to take damage from entry hazards, giving it more longevity and letting it to function as a better pivot. The given EV spread lets it always live an unboosted Gliscor Earthquake from full health.</p> <p>Tapu Koko tends to fit best on offense teams where it can be paired up with powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Kyurem that appreciate it pivoting them in safely. The former also appreciates the Electric Terrain boost making its Thunder Punch stronger, while the latter are able to take advantage of the Ground-types that Tapu Koko lures in. Teammates such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Greninja, and Kartana appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to pressure Water- and Flying-types, such as Skarmory, Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. Due to Tapu Koko's susceptibility to bulky Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon like Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, it needs teammates that can handle these such as Kyurem, Heatran, and Rillaboom.</p>"

Psyshock can be run on Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to threaten Galarian Slowking and Blissey and hit Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefable and Quiver Dance Volcarona harder, but it is overall less useful than its other moves. Thunder or Thunderbolt can be run over Psychic on Choice Specs variants to significantly damage Corviknight and stop it from supposedly checking Tapu Lele. However, it makes it harder to break through Gliscor and Clefable. Nature's Madness can also be run on Choice Scarf variants to break down any Pokemon, but it has trouble causing any further damage once locked into, and dropping Psychic sacrifices great possible damage against defensive cores. Thunder can also be used on Calm Mind sets, and Electrium Z enables Gigavolt Havoc to nuke Corviknight, but it loses out on Focus Blast targets like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Heatran, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor can handle Tapu Lele's STAB moves decently and use the opportunity to generate momentum with entry hazards or U-turn. However, they still have to fear the potential of Fightinium Z, and Ferrothorn and Heatran in specific have to fear Focus Blast. Aegislash also excels at checking Tapu Lele, only fearing Hidden Power Fire from Choice Specs Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Chansey, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey can easily sponge most of Tapu Lele's hits, and force it out with their status or STAB moves. However, Blissey and Galarian Slowking are pressured by Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: With Tapu Lele's average Speed and bulk, the likes of Kartana, Greninja, Garchomp, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny can revenge kill it. It can outpace these Pokemon using a Choice Scarf, but that in itself is an underwhelming option.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit from Choice Band Weavile and Tyranitar can trap Tapu Lele pretty well due Weavile outspeeding it and threatening it with any move, and Tyranitar surviving most hits from Tapu Lele. Choice item sets in particular have to be careful when clicking Psychic-type moves, since the Pursuit users can punish that relatively well.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is a fantastic revenge killer and late-game cleaner, that is able to revenge kill almost every offensive threat in the metagame including the likes of Mega Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja. In the late-game, when its checks like Heatran, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn are weakened, its Speed tier and great STAB combination lets it sweep opposing teams. However, its relative lack of power means that it misses out on OHKOs on the likes of defensive Landorus-T and offensive Heatran, and it can struggle to break through Pokemon like Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey. Focus Blast lets it pressure Steel-types that can tank its STAB moves such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, though it cannot OHKO them. Future Sight can let Tapu Lele's teammates like Urshifu-RS, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile break through their checks like Toxapex and Tangrowth, and these Pokemon can often take advantage of Tapu Lele's checks like Heatran and Blissey to fire off attacks. Aromatherapy can be used to help relieve teammates from status conditions in longer games. Hidden Power Fire can be run in the last slot to 2HKO Mega Scizor while providing an accurate option to hit other Steel-types like Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Lele fits best on offense and bulky offense teams that can offensively pressure its checks and allow it to sweep late-game while also appreciating its cleaning potential and great Speed. It is annoyed by Steel-types like Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Heatran, so Pokemon that can lure or take advantage of these like Fightinium Z Kartana, Sand Tomb Mega Scizor, Heatran, and Victini are good partners for it. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it is able to trap and remove some of these Steel-types. Wallbreakers like Kartana, Choice Band Weavile, and Mega Medicham can soften up the opposing team to let Tapu Lele clean up in the late-game. Defensive pivots like Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Slowbro can help Tapu Lele come in safely.

The former two are also solid Stealth Rock setters, which can aid Tapu Lele in breaking down an opposing team. Tapu Lele is physically frail, and thus checks to various physical attackers like Rocky Helmet Garchomp and Landorus-T are excellent teammates. U-turn and Volt Switch users like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Landorus-T can bring Tapu Lele in unscathed while also chipping the opposing team into the range of its attacks. Late-game cleaners such as Volcarona and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Tapu Lele crippling walls like Corviknight and Toxapex so they can sweep more easily.

Its Speed tier is quite handy, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Landorus-T, Mega Garchomp, and Excadrill, but it misses out on Urshifu-R, Volcarona, Garchomp, and Victini.

Swords Dance and a respectable Attack stat make it an offensive threat as well. However, Tapu Bulu faces competition from more specialized offensive or defensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. It also struggles to switch into defensive Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking, as it fears a Scald burn.

Kartana and Serperior especially are exceptional partners, as each benefits from Tapu Bulu breaking through their checks like Corviknight, Mega Latias, and Amoonguss, and Grassy Terrain makes their main STAB moves harder to switch into. Pokemon such as Heatran and Galarian Slowking appreciate Grassy Terrain lessening their Earthquake weakness. Due to Tapu Bulu's lack of reliable recovery, secondary checks to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Ash-Greninja are needed, like Gastrodon and Tapu Fini, as it can easily get overwhelmed. Due to its Fire weakness, it is easily forced out by the likes of Mega Charizard Y and offensive Heatran, so checks to these such as Toxapex and Gliscor are great teammates.</p>"

Offensive Grass-types such as Serperior, Rillaboom, and Kartana all force it out, but the latter two are threatened by a Scald burn and don't appreciate a Moonblast, so they can't switch in as easily. Grass-type coverage from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Manaphy also greatly threatens it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Zeraora, Magnezone, and Tapu Koko all can threaten Tapu Fini out with their STAB moves, but they can get easily worn down by switching in multiple times. Zapdos is especially a good switch-in due to it easily recovering off the damage dealt to later pressure Tapu Fini out again. Electric-type coverage moves from the likes of Clefable, Blaziken, and Victini can also force it out.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Galarian Slowking and Gengar all pressure Tapu Fini consistently with their STAB moves, although Gengar struggles to switch in repeatedly due to its frailty, and Galarian Slowking fears being rendered much less effective by a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to Tapu Fini’s lack of reliable recovery, chip damage can easily rack up, eventually wearing it down into range of the likes of Greninja and Heatran.

It also checks offensive behemoths such as Ash-Greninja and Heatran. However, due to its low Speed stat and time needed to become a huge threat, it is prone to being revenge killed. Calm Mind, besides boosting Tapu Fini's offense, makes it harder for special attackers to revenge kill. Taunt stops Toxapex's Haze from removing its boosts, as well as denying recovery from the likes of Chansey, Blissey, Clefable, and Toxapex. It also blocks status moves after its Misty Terrain wears off. Scald allows Tapu Fini to effectively check Heatran, as well as threatening burns on Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu.

However, due to its lack of consistent recovery and its vulnerability to all entry hazards, it is easily worn down throughout the match. Scald allows Tapu Fini to threaten burns on the likes of Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Rillaboom, as well as pressuring Heatran consistently. Nature's Madness greatly chips its switch-ins like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn for its teammates. Taunt lets Tapu Fini prevent Pokemon such as Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards in front of it and the likes of Mega Scizor and Clefable from setting up on it; Taunt also lets it force out Pokemon like Toxapex and Slowking in combination with Nature's Madness. Knock Off is another option that can punish common switch-ins such as Tangrowth and Galarian Slowking by removing their items, as well as removing Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Black Sludge from the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, Slowking, and Tapu Bulu, greatly reducing their longevity and effectiveness. The given EV spread allows Tapu Fini to live a boosted Acrobatics from Hawlucha and OHKO it back, as well as outspeeding and 2HKOing offensive Heatran with Scald, with the remaining EVs in Special Defense to check the likes of Heatran and Ash-Greninja better.</p> <p>Tapu Fini fits on bulky offense teams, which appreciate it checking big offensive threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja, as well as providing good Defog support. Physical attackers that fear being burnt such as Kartana, Garchomp, Mega Scizor, and Melmetal, as well as Pokemon generally susceptible to status like Tangrowth, Volcarona, and Mega Tyranitar, synergize well with Tapu Fini due to Misty Terrain protecting them from status. Due to Tapu Fini being weak to Electric- and Grass-type moves, Pokemon that can take these attacks such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Mega Latias are solid teammates. In return, Tapu Fini takes the Ice- and Fire-type attacks directed at them. Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor that appreciate its reliable Defogging are also good partners.

However, it is prone to being worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery and the chip damage it takes when trying to eliminate these Pokemon. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Blissey from using recovery moves, letting Tapu Fini efficiently KO them after trapping them.

While Tapu Fini is traditionally known for other roles, it has a decent offensive presence thanks to its great defensive typing and good bulk, which allow it to check a variety of threats like Mega Lopunny, Heatran, Weavile, and Ash-Greninja to an extent. Misty Surge protects the team from status moves such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Toxic from Toxapex. Hydro Pump is Tapu Fini's strongest move and chunks Gliscor, Heatran, and Landorus-T. However, Surf is a more reliable option and still does decent damage. Defog allows Tapu Fini to clear entry hazards, but it clears Misty Terrain too. Taunt is an option over Defog to further mess with the defensive Pokemon mentioned, denying them healing or preventing them from setting entry hazards. Hidden Power Fire can also be used to 2HKO Ferrothorn and better revenge kill Kartana. Trick debilitates defensive switch-ins to Tapu Fini such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. The EV spread allows Tapu Fini to survive a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha, guarantees an OHKO on Greninja with Moonblast, and still outspeeds +1 Mega Gyarados.</p> <p>Tapu Fini fits best on more offensive teams, as they appreciate it acting as a defensive switch-in to top threats while also being a respectable revenge killer. Pokemon like Weavile, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana that fear Scald burns from the likes of Toxapex are ideal teammates, since they enjoy Misty Terrain. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Heatran that can cover Tapu Fini's weakness to opposing Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Serperior make wonderful teammates. In return, Tapu Fini can remove Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny for them. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T, are amazing partners as they cover Tapu Fini's weakness to Electric and appreciate it switching into Ice- and Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Weavile. Setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Calm Mind Mega Latias, and Swords Dance Landorus-T appreciate Tapu Fini ruining shared checks such as Blissey and Skarmory via Trick. This Tapu Fini set lacks defensive investment, so it can't check many Pokemon it wants to long-term such as Ash-Greninja and Heatran. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Garchomp can provide extra insurance against these Pokemon.</p>"

However, this sacrifices valuable coverage that Nihilego needs to break through its other switch-ins. Hidden Power Ground is an option to help Nihilego lure and destroy specially defensive Heatran, but is generally inferior to Nihilego's other coverage options. A Choice Scarf set with maximum Special Attack investment has late-game sweeping potential, although its lack of power before a boost makes it generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users with more immediate power, such as Kartana. In terms of utility for Nihilego, Knock Off cripples switch-ins like Chansey and Ferrothorn by removing their items, making them easier to break through for Nihilego and its teammates. Nihilego can also opt for entry hazards in the form of Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock to further wear down its checks, but is ultimately outclassed by other entry hazard setters like Heatran and Toxapex.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Nihilego's subpar defensive typing makes it a prime target for priority users. Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Medicham, Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile, and Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja can all easily revenge kill Nihilego. In addition, Choice Scarf Kartana can revenge kill Nihilego even after a Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Ground-Types</strong>: Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Hippowdown, and Gastrodon resist Nihilego's STAB combination and OHKO it with Earthquake. Even with super effective coverage, an unboosted Nihilego cannot typically OHKO these Ground-types and is forced to switch out. However, the Special Attack boost from Meteor Beam makes a potential Hidden Power Ice or Grass Knot notably more threatening to their respective targets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-Types</strong>: Steel-types like specially defensive Heatran, Mega Scizor, Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill don't fear Nihilego's standard coverage much and can force it to switch. Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor must watch out for Hidden Power Fire, however, while Excadrill, Magnezone, and Heatran can be worn down by hazards and repeated attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blissey and Chansey have immense special bulk and have the potential to wall Nihilego entirely. However, they must KO it with Seismic Toss quickly or else Nihilego may aquire enough boosts to break through them. A properly positioned Toxapex can also use Haze to remove Nihilego's boosts.</p>",

Meteor Beam + Power Herb lets it gain a power boost while firing off a strong STAB move. Sludge Wave's higher power is preferred to secure KOs after boosting, but Sludge Bomb is an alternative that trades a bit of power for a higher chance to poison the target, which may prove useful in longer games. Thunderbolt hits Toxapex, Corviknight, and Skarmory hard, while Hidden Power Fire allows Nihilego to break through Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Ground-types not weak to Grass Knot, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor. However, Grass Knot will often be Nihilego's strongest option against bulky Ground-types, such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. While Hidden Power Ice's targets tend to be more common, they usually do not have reliable recovery, while Grass Knot's targets do and are harder to wear down. The given EV spread ensures Beast Boost raises Nihilego's Speed after each KO.</p> <p>Nihilego fits best on offensive teams in need of a late game sweeper. Teammates that can deal with bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp and Excadrill are greatly appreciated. Landorus-T is a good answer to these Pokemon that can also provide U-turn support to help Nihilego enter the field safely. Landorus-T also provides entry hazards and threatens Steel-types that Nihilego can't break through, even wearing down Ferrothorn with Knock Off and Earthquake. Magnezone can help trap Kartana not locked into Sacred Sword, as well as certain bulky Steel-types such as Melmetal and Mega Scizor, all of which threaten Nihilego. As many of Nihilego's checks lack reliable recovery and/or are greatly pressured by Spikes, entry hazard support from Ferrothorn, Mew, and Greninja is appreciated. In particular, many bulky Steel-types that trouble Nihilego such as Heatran and Melmetal are quickly worn down by repeatedly switching into Spikes. Tapu Lele is a strong wallbreaker that can overwhelm some of Nihilego's Steel-type enemies over time, while also providing Psychic Terrain support to block priority attacks such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja, and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R.</p>"

Other coverage options such as Earthquake for Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, Leech Life for Reuniclus, Slowbro, and its passive recovery, and Stone Edge for Zapdos and Volcarona are also feasible options. Poison Jab can also be used to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable. However, dropping either Ice Punch or Thunder Punch will make Buzzwole much worse against bulky Flying- and Water-types.

Ice Punch allows Buzzwole to efficiently check Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor while threatening possible switch-ins such as Flyinium-Z Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Mega Latios. Meanwhile, Thunder Punch is able to pressure bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex.

The one teamstyle Xurkitree can function somewhat decently on is Sticky Web hyper offense, as it outruns most of the metagame after Sticky Web. Unfortunately, Xurkitree has to compete with other, better sweepers that fit on this teamstyle; most notably, Thundurus-T has far better coverage, outruns Landorus-T, has a better defensive typing, and can viably run Z-Moves, therefore making it more powerful and threatening. Additionally, Xurkitree is rather frail, making it vulnerable to priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile. Faster Pokemon that ignore Sticky Web also present issues, with Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Hydreigon as well as Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Zeraora, Victini, and Tapu Koko all fitting the bill.

However, forgoing both Normalium Z and Fightinium Z means Kartana will be unable to adequately pressure its two most common checks in Zapdos and Mega Scizor. Toxic can be used on Choice Scarf sets to cripple checks like Zapdos and Tangrowth, but it’s undesirable to lock into due to the number of Pokemon in the tier that are immune to poison. Swords Dance Kartana can explore other item options, such as Life Orb for more power or Salac Berry with Endure to beat Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Magnezone. However, these options often need to forgo too much of Kartana’s longevity or coverage. A Swords Dance set with 19 Attack IVs and a Timid nature to boost Kartana’s Speed with Beast Boost may seem desirable, as it allows Kartana to outspeed checks such as Weavile, Mega Latias and Latios as well as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny and Greninja. However, it can struggle to properly wallbreak, and can often feel outclassed by Swords Dance and Choice Scarf sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Corviknight, Zapdos, Moltres, Skarmory, and Mega Charizard Y are some of the best checks to Kartana due to their resistance to Leaf Blade. On top of that, Zapdos can heavily cripple Kartana with Static. However, Corviknight and Skarmory must be cautious of boosted Sacred Swords and Zapdos, Moltres, and Mega Charizard Y are pressured heavily by Normalium Z variants and Choice Band-boosted Return. On top of that, none of Zapdos, Moltres, Skarmory, or Corviknight appreciate their item being removed by Knock Off. Landorus-T can soft-check Kartana for a while as well, but its lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being worn down in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias and Mega Latios</strong>: Both Mega Latias and Mega Latios can stomach all of Kartana's attacks relatively easily, bar a Choice Band-boosted Knock Off or the rare Black Hole Eclipse. As they outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants, they can both proceed to use Kartana as setup bait or force it out with strong moves, respectively. However, they must be wary of taking too much damage, as Knock Off from Choice Scarf sets can rip through them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types that aren't weak to Sacred Sword such as Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile are capable of checking Kartana to a degree. However, they can all be overwhelmed by +2 All-Out Pummeling. Other Steel-types can prevent Choice variants of Kartana from spamming Leaf Blade, but they need to be wary of its coverage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: The likes of Tangrowth and Amoonguss can easily scout any of Kartana's attacks and force it out while keeping healthy with Regenerator. Neither of them appreciate a boosted Breakneck Blitz, however. Serperior cannot switch into Kartana, but it can revenge kill all variants without a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Choice Scarf Magnezone is able to trap every non-Choice Scarf Kartana set courtesy of Magnet Pull and Hidden Power Fire. A healthy non-Choice Scarf Magnezone is also capable of surviving non-Choice Band Sacred Sword and finishing Kartana off.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats</strong>: Although they cannot switch into Kartana safely, many offensive Pokemon that can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Kartana will more than likely force it out. Examples include Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and Choice Scarf Victini.</p> <p><strong>Contact Items/Abilities</strong>: Kartana is easily worn down by contact effects such as Tangrowth, Corviknight and Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Tank Garchomp's Rough Skin as well as Volcarona and Moltres' Flame Body and Zapdos' Static. The highest threat would be status effects and therefore Kartana should be very careful if it's a non-z variant.</p>",

Giga Impact alongside Normalium Z allows Kartana to overwhelm some of its best checks in Zapdos and physically defensive Tangrowth after a Swords Dance boost. On the other hand, Fightinium Z can be used to easily remove Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Corviknight, with Knock Off in the fourth slot to cripple Pokemon like Volcarona, Zapdos, and Moltres.</p> <p>Kartana fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams that are capable of providing it with proper support it needs to break open teams. Mega Tyranitar is extremely useful for Kartana, as it is capable of removing many roadblocks to Kartana's sweep with Pursuit, such as Mega Latias and Mega Latios, and heavily pressures Zapdos in case Kartana needs to preserve its Z-Move for another target. It can also set Stealth Rock, which is particularly important for Knock Off variants, as it allows Kartana to punish Zapdos more effectively after removing Heavy-Duty Boots. In a similar vein, Magnezone is a potent teammate due to its ability to trap Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Skarmory, which are some of the very few hard-checks to Normalium Z Kartana. Pokemon that can pressure Kartana's other common checks in Tangrowth and Landorus-T such as Garchomp, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Mawile are great partners. In turn, Kartana can heavily pressure some of their checks in Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Heatran. Kartana requires a good defensive backbone, as it is quite specially frail and prone to being revenge killed by the likes of Mega Lopunny, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Latias. As a result, the likes of Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Mega Tyranitar make for good teammates. Given Kartana’s poor special bulk, Pokemon that can pivot Kartana into battle such as Mega Lopunny, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T are useful teammates. Lastly, late-game cleaners appreciate Kartana's wallbreaking prowess such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny and make for good teammates as well.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Kartana harshly pressures most of its usual checks without having to dedicate a turn to set up. After the boost from Choice Band, Leaf Blade 2HKOes almost every single neutral target in the metagame, making it a very risk-free and spammable move once Kartana's checks have been weakened. A strong Knock Off is another draw of this set, allowing Kartana to greatly damage checks in Mega Latias and Mega Latios and punish sturdier checks such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tangrowth by removing their item. Sacred Sword takes care of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, as well as some other Grass-resistant Pokemon in Hydreigon and Kyurem. Return gives Kartana a strong neutral hit on Pokemon like Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Moltres that would otherwise tank its attacks. Alternatively, Smart Strike can be used to hit the likes of Mega Mawile and Tangrowth harder than anything else, while almost always OHKOing physically defensive Clefable.</p> <p>Kartana fits well on balance and bulky offensive teams as a fearsome wallbreaker that can make great amounts of progress throughout the game if it predicts correctly. Stealth Rock setters are very important, since they allow Kartana to heavily pressure Zapdos and Moltres after removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Thus, the likes of Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, Clefable, and Landorus-T pair well with Kartana. Weavile and Mega Tyranitar can trap and weaken or dispose of Mega Latias, Heatran, and Zapdos, making Kartana's job easier and less prediction-reliant. Magnezone is a notable partner due to its ability to trap some of the best checks to Kartana in Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Other wallbreakers that can pressure Kartana's checks in Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Mega Scizor can also prove to be good teammates. Examples include Heatran and Ash-Greninja. Pivoting support from the likes of Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T can greatly increase the amount of opportunities for Kartana to break walls by granting it safe ways to enter a match. Lastly, late-game cleaners that can wrap up the game after Kartana has done its job such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Swords Dance Weavile are good options as well.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Synthesis, Kartana can reliably check the metagame's dangerous Ground-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Gliscor, as well as Mega Tyranitar lacking Fire Punch. Leaf Blade alongside Grassium Z allows Kartana to properly threaten the Ground-types it checks, taking them out after little-to-no chip with Bloom Doom. Knock Off gives Kartana additional utility in punishing common switch-ins such as Zapdos and Corviknight, as well as removing items from the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran. Alternatively, Sacred Sword may be used to directly threaten Ferrothorn and Heatran, but dropping the utility of Knock Off is undesirable. Defog enables Kartana to fully check Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn by nullifying their attempts at setting up entry hazards. 120 Attack EVs allow Kartana to OHKO Garchomp with Bloom Doom. The remaining EVs are allocated to HP so that Kartana can check Ground-types more consistently.</p> <p>Kartana fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams in need of a sturdy check to Ground-types. As such, Pokemon that appreciate Ground-types out of the picture such as Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Toxapex can prove to be good teammates. Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile is useful, as it pressures Mega Latias and weakens Zapdos, which are some of Kartana's best checks, especially for non-Knock Off variants. However, when pairing Kartana with Mega Tyranitar, be careful with your timing and positioning, as Synthesis recovers less HP in sand. Kartana is easily forced out by special attackers or faster threats such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Latias, and Mega Lopunny. As such, it requires a sturdy defensive backbone to take these threats on, which may consist of Pokemon such as specially defensive Heatran, Slowbro, and Toxapex. All of these bar Slowbro are susceptible to entry hazards due to the amount of times they are required to pivot into various threats throughout a match and therefore appreciate Kartana’s Defog support. Lastly, Kartana has the tendency to force Knock Off on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Toxapex, and Tangrowth, so partners like Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Lele are good options to consider as well.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Kartana functions as a revenge killer early on in games by outpacing common offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, +1 Mega Gyarados, and Weavile and either defeating them or forcing them out. Once the opponent's team has been weakened sufficiently, Kartana can then clean up late-game with the assistance of its enhanced Speed and Beast Boost. Knock Off is a great move that punishes checks such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres. It is also Kartana's best option against Mega Latias and Mega Latios. Sacred Sword is a crucial coverage move, enabling Kartana to hit opposing Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, as well as almost always OHKOing Mega Lopunny. Smart Strike rounds out the set as a reliable secondary STAB move that provides the strongest hit against threats such as Clefable and Kyurem. Defog may be used instead to remove entry hazards for more offensive teams.</p> <p>Kartana fits best in offensive teams in need of a revenge killer and late-game sweeper in one. As Kartana is a good late-game cleaner once the opposing team has been weakened, it is a good idea to pair it with early-game wallbreakers that can threaten or take advantage of Kartana's checks in Zapdos, Mega Latias, Tangrowth, and Corviknight. Good examples include Garchomp, Kyurem, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele. Pursuit support from the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Weavile is appreciated in order to trap the likes of Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Heatran, as this allows Kartana to spam Leaf Blade late-game. Mega Tyranitar also provides Stealth Rock support, which is important to pressure Zapdos and Moltres once Kartana has removed their Heavy-Duty Boots. Similarly, Magnezone is a notable partner due to its ability to trap Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Kartana is incapable of revenge killing a healthy Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Volcarona, so running Pokemon that can deal with them such as Heatran and Toxapex is very advisable.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be considered as a revenge killer that uses Beast Boost to get more powerful and snowball through teams, but Blacephalon's STAB combination is not exceedingly difficult to pivot around when not boosted by Choice Specs, and Blacephalon can generally be revenge killed with bulky Water-types or priority moves from Mega Lopunny and Mega Mawile. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Chansey, but Knock Off achieves similar results and allows Blacephalon to keep its Choice Specs. Additionally, Blacephalon may receive harmful items from Trick, such as Toxapex's Black Sludge, hampering its already bad longevity. A Calm Mind set with 232 HP / 4 Def / 20 SpA / 252 Spe EVs can be used as a sweeper, boosting Speed after KOs; such a set can also consider Grassium Z to surprise Tyranitar. Unfortunately, this set doesn't hit hard enough even when boosted to consistently sweep teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar is by far the best counter to Blacephalon, as it safely switches into any move and easily Pursuit traps it. Weavile Pursuit traps it as well, although it cannot safely switch in. Hydreigon can't safely switch into Blacephalon's Fire-type moves, but its resistance to Shadow Ball and access to Roost make it a great check. Mega Gyarados can also check it, although it can't safely switch in without Mega Evolving beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kommo-o is immune to Shadow Ball due to Bulletproof and defensive variants can take Overheat if necessary. Other Dragon-types like Garchomp, Mega Latias, and Mega Latios can comfortably switch into Blacephalon's Fire-type moves and revenge kill it after, but Shadow Ball destroys them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Certain special walls, such as Toxapex, Blissey, Chansey, and Gastrodon, can scout what move Blacephalon is using and respond accordingly; however, minimal chip damage puts both Toxapex and Gastrodon into Shadow Ball's 2HKO range of Shadow Ball after minimal chip, and both Chansey and Blissey fear Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing</strong>: Most faster Pokemon can't safely switch into Blacephalon, though threats such as Mega Lopunny, Ash-Greninja, Kartana, and Mega Diancie can revenge kill it. Additionally, priority moves from Mega Mawile and Urshifu-R can take care of Blacephalon due to its minimal bulk.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Blacephalon's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock limits its longevity, preventing it from switching in to dent the opposing team as often.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Blacephalon's great STAB combination and high Base Power moves make it a very dangerous wallbreaker. It excels at forcing KOs against several common defensive cores, as they often lack a proper Ghost-resistant Pokemon. It also sits at a nice Speed tier, which lets it outrun and revenge kill some offensive threats, including Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele. However, Blacephalon's frailty and poor defensive profile make it difficult to get into battle at times, and it's very easy for the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar to Pursuit trap it. Overheat is a nuke that achieves titanic feats of strength; it can OHKO Gliscor and 2HKO Garchomp after minimal chip damage while doing enormous damage to frailer resistant foes such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. Fire Blast can also 2HKO Hydreigon and Garchomp and can be used well consecutively. Knock Off is a good midground option that annoys certain defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Gastrodon, allowing Blacephalon to 2HKO the former with Stealth Rock up and potentially 2HKO the latter with Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Most crucially, it removes Chansey's Eviolite, which can allow Blacephalon to 2HKO it with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Flamethrower can be considered over Fire Blast for more consistency, but the drop in power makes Blacephalon worse at breaking through threats like Chansey post Knock Off. Choice Specs is the preferred item for the increase in power, which nicely complements Blacephalon's highly spammable STAB moves. Timid is required in order to outrun Garchomp, Victini, and Mega Medicham.</p> <p>Blacephalon fits well on fast-paced teams, which appreciate it forcing meaningful progress against most defensive cores. Blacephalon is quite difficult to get into battle safely, so pivoting support is highly valuable. Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Tapu Koko can all offer this support; Tapu Koko is especially nice, as it baits in Ferrothorn, while Mega Lopunny forces in Gliscor or Clefable for Blacephalon to prey on. Entry hazard removers like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are also appreciated due to Blacephalon's Stealth Rock weakness. Blacephalon is highly vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped; this can be very difficult to prevent, as both Weavile and Tyranitar can safely come in after Blacephalon picks up a KO get pivoted in after it's already fired off an attack. Consider teammates such as Heatran, Calm Mind Clefable, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile, which can punish these Pokemon by forcing further KOs after they have successfully trapped Blacephalon.</p>"

It's also Zeraora's only way of getting past Gliscor, although Gliscor must not have activated Toxic Orb for it to do so. Alternatively, Close Combat smashes Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Blissey and lets Zeraora revenge kill dangerous offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Kartana. Volt Switch allows Zeraora to keep momentum against Pokemon it cannot break through, such as Tangrowth, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. Toxic cripples Ground-types that can otherwise prevent Zeraora from pivoting with Volt Switch, as well as ruining Mega Latias's and Tangrowth's longevity.</p> <p>Zeraora is completely unable to bypass Ground-types, as the best it can do is wear them down with Toxic. As such, partners like Kyurem, Weavile, and Ash-Greninja are fantastic teammates to remedy this issue. The former two can also handle Grass-types that Zeraora can't deal with. Ash-Greninja appreciates Zeraora's Knock Off support, as its Spikes become even more effective when Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Blissey lack Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Zeraora's mediocre bulk prevents it from coming onto the field easily, so pivots like Slowbro, Slowking, Corviknight, and Blissey make good partners. Corviknight deals with Ground-types well, while Ice Beam Slowbro can lure in Ground-types and surprise them. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y, Swords Dance Kartana, and Tapu Lele wallbreak for Zeraora in the early- and mid-game, giving it an easier time cleaning late-game.

Earthquake slams Heatran, Toxapex, and Victini should they decide to switch in.

Its special bulk is also quite mediocre, and in conjunction with its lack of recovery, this leaves Melmetal easily worn down. Melmetal’s STAB typing is also lackluster, meaning it is relatively easy to pivot into by a majority of the tier. Thunder Punch allows Melmetal to nail Water- and Flying-types that can switch into Double Iron Bash, such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Earthquake is a strong coverage option that always 2HKOes Toxapex while also hitting Heatran. However, Superpower can be used to maintain the ability to hit Heatran while nailing Ferrothorn, which doesn't mind Melmetal's other coverage options. Thunder Wave gives Melmetal the ability to paraflinch checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor or wear them down to assist teammates in overwhelming them. Leftovers is used to increase Melmetal's longevity, letting it check Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Fini better, while Protective Pads is an option to ignore adverse contact effects like Skarmory’s, Landorus’s, and Tangrowth’s Rocky Helmet, as well as Volcarona’s Flame Body and Zapdos's Static.

Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias make solid partners, as they appreciate Melmetal's ability to spread paralysis and check Fairy- and Ice-types. In return, they cover Melmetal's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-types: Garchomp checks Fire-types like Heatran, and Mega Latios and Latias check Ground-types like opposing Garchomp. Due to Melmetal’s lack of reliable recovery, Grassy Terrain support from the likes of Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu is greatly appreciated, and in return, they both pressure Flying-types such as Corviknight and Zapdos to aid Melmetal in wallbreaking. Grassy Terrain also weakens opposing Earthquakes, allowing Melmetal to stay in and pressure Ground-types better. Strong entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Clefable, and Landorus-T augments Melmetal's ability to pressure opposing teams, as the constant chip damage quickly wears down its checks that try to pivot around it. Tapu Fini is a stellar partner, as its Misty Terrain prevents Melmetal from being statused by the likes of Mega Sableye’s Will-O-Wisp and adverse contact effects like Zapdos’s Static. However, it does prevent Melmetal from paralyzing grounded Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Scizor, which can prove costly in games. Lastly, fast revenge killers fast revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Ash Greninja, Glare Serperior, and Tapu Koko all work well with Melmetal, as they can take on the faster threats that Melmetal can't due to its low Speed.</p>"

However, it can activate Static or Flame Body, burning or paralyzing Rillaboom.</p> <p>Swords Dance Rillaboom shines on offensive teams, where its ludicrously strong priority can keep several opposing offensive threats in check. Landorus-T and Mew set up entry hazards, letting Rillaboom break through Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile much more easily. Further, Landorus-T can lure in many of the Flying-types that deal with Rillaboom and nail them with Explosion. Victini can bring Rillaboom in against bulky Water-types for a possible free setup opportunity, or it can eliminate Steel-types with V-create for Rillaboom to clean up. Various setup sweepers, such as Volcarona and Mega Gyarados, can partner up with Rillaboom to provide an easy way to overwhelm defensive cores. Hawlucha enjoys Rillaboom’s Grassy Terrain activating Grassy Seed to let it sweep very easily, as well as its ability to cripple Zapdos and Corviknight.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head is an option over Brave Bird or Body Press, allowing Corviknight to defeat Calm Mind Clefable while still hitting Mega Tyranitar and Kyurem decently hard. Iron Defense in tandem with Body Press can be used on stall teams to keep pace with Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T, but this role is often better filled by Skarmory or Quagsire. Taunt can be used to shut down passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Clefable while also blocking any attempt to set up and blow past Corviknight. Unfortunately, Corviknight's other moves have much greater opportunity costs than Taunt has benefits. Shed Shell can be used to escape Magnezone, but losing Leftovers or Rocky Helmet is extremely detrimental, and having little use against teams without Magnezone makes it very matchup dependent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora all use Corviknight as a free entry point thanks to their Flying resistance. The first in particular poses a huge threat to Corviknight, as it can trap it and remove it from the game. Similarly, Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Mawile often run Electric-type coverage that can beat down Corviknight.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran and Mega Charizard Y are easily capable of breaking past Corviknight with their STAB moves. The latter in particular can repeatedly come in if Stealth Rock is not on the field thanks to Roost. However, both must be wary of switching into too many Brave Birds or Body Presses, or of Corviknight using them to pivot into a wallbreaker like Mega Medicham or Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T and Excadrill are normally walled by Corviknight, but if they decide to run Substitute, they can use it as setup fodder. As Corviknight cannot touch them without the proper move and U-turn can't break their Substitutes, they can simply set up safely behind a Substitute and break past it. It should be noted that Bulk Up and Iron Defense sets can set up alongside these Pokemon, making them non-issues.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Corviknight is burned, its offensive capabilities are greatly hindered, removing its ability to function as a late game win condition due to its low damage output. Paralysis causes Corviknight to get revenge killed more easily and removes Corviknight's ability to check the likes of Rillaboom effectively. However, this issue is generally mitigated by Substitute.</p>",

Its good matchups against common entry hazard setters in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, alongside Pressure to deplete the PP of their entry hazards, make it a fantastic Defogger. Brave Bird is preferred to threaten Rillaboom, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Landorus-T, but Body Press can be used if one's team is weak to Pokemon like Excadrill and Kartana, or if one wants to secure the Mega Tyranitar matchup while discouraging Heatran from switching in. U-turn allows Corviknight to take advantage of the Pokemon it checks by granting free switch-in opportunities to teammates, preserve momentum against Pokemon that seek to take advantage of it such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, and escape Magnezone on the switch.</p> <p>Pressure allows Corviknight to PP stall entry hazard moves of passive setters, such as Ferrothorn and Clefable lacking Calm Mind, as well as PP stall other Pokemon like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar. 184 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Corviknight to not be OHKOed by +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, with the remaining EVs going to Special Defense to let it switch into Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, and Clefable better. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 44 Def / 212 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Hidden Power Fire while also letting it withstand +2 Garchomp's Continental Crush. 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature allows Corviknight to grab as much momentum as possible against Pokemon like Clefable. Leftovers prevents Corviknight from being worn down too quickly. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish U-turn from the likes of Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <p>Corviknight is heavily threatened by Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y. Therefore, bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Toxapex can form strong defensive cores with it. Gastrodon can also deal with a major roadblock in Zapdos; Slowbro and Slowking can form a pivot core with Corviknight; and Toxapex enjoys Corviknight checking most Ground- and Psychic-types. Corviknight has a mediocre matchup against Electric-types and Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Mega Mawile. Teammates that can take these threats on, such as the aforementioned Gastrodon in Tapu Koko's case and Heatran in the case of the latter two, pair well with it. Corviknight can form pivot cores with Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny, with both appreciating Corviknight's ability to lure in Steel-types that they can take advantage of such as Aegislash, Magnezone, and Heatran. Pokemon that appreciate Corviknight's ability to get them in unscathed, such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Weavile, make great partners. Weavile in particular is great at strengthening the matchup against Ground-types that Corviknight cannot properly force out, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p>"

However, Bulk Up Corviknight needs multiple boosts to get going, and it usually ends up being forced out by Pokemon such as Tapu Koko or Heatran just as it starts setting up. Substitute allows Corviknight to bypass status such as burns from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and paralysis from Clefable's Thunder Wave while also being able to reduce much more PP from the likes of Garchomp's Stone Edge, Ferrothorn's Knock Off, and Toxapex's Scald. Bulk Up lets Corviknight boost its Attack and Defense, letting it check the likes of non-Swords Dance Mega Mawile, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Scizor while still being threatening. Brave Bird lets Corviknight consistently check Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-O, Rillaboom, and Hawlucha while dealing decent damage against neutral foes when boosted. The given EV spread allows Corviknight to outspeed Mega Scizor and most Mega Mawile and take a boosted Continental Crush from Garchomp, and the rest of the investment is put into Special Defense to let Corviknight take attacks from the likes of Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Tapu Lele better.</p> <p>Bulk Up Corviknight fits best on bulky teams that appreciate its role as a wincon with defensive utility. Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor that appreciate Corviknight's defensive capabilities in checking threats such as Kyurem, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny work well with it. In return, they check Electric- and Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, Victini, Zeraora, and Tapu Koko for it. Mega Mawile, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor all appreciate Toxapex's Haze being PP stalled, letting them use it as setup fodder later on. Calm Mind Clefable, Mega Latias and Mega Mawile appreciate Corviknight PP stalling opposing Calm Mind Clefable and Heatran. Strong hazard support such as Spikes Greninja, Toxic Spikes Toxapex, and Stealth Rock Clefable are all formidable allies, as the entry hazards they set up wear down switch-ins to Corviknight such as Tapu Koko and Heatran, and Corviknight is able to Pressure stall Defog from opposing Corviknight in return, letting their hazards stay on the field. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Skarmory and Zapdos, partners that can eliminate them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p>"

This makes it a solid lead Pokemon on hyper offense teams. Prankster allows Grimmsnarl to set dual screens before the foe can attack it and Taunt denies Defog attempts from the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tapu Fini, and Kartana, keeping dual screens active. It competes with Tapu Koko as a dual screens setter due to the latter's Electric Terrain support, which facilitates the dangerous Hawlucha, and ability to pivot out with U-turn, effectively giving its teammates more turns to sweep; however, Grimmsnarl separates itself due to having Prankster, solid defensive typing, better special bulk, and more utility outside of screens thanks to Spirit Break. Taunt additionally prevents entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Heatran, and Ferrothorn from setting up hazards, as well as disabling setup from the likes of Mega Latias, Mega Garchomp, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor. Grimmsnarl's solid defensive typing also allows it to hold off Mega Latias and Ash-Greninja. However, Grimmsnarl is extremely vulnerable to common wallbreakers such as the aforementioned Kartana and Heatran, as well as Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham. Spirit Break is used to target Dark-type Pokemon, which are immune to Prankster Taunt, like Weavile, Ash-Greninja, Mega Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Light Clay gives its teammates more turns of dual screens to sweep, an invaluable benefit for hyper offense teams.</p> <p>Grimmsnarl exclusively fits onto hyper offense teams, which include a bevy of wallbreakers and sweepers that benefit from its dual screens. Serperior, Volcarona, Gyarados, and Bisharp highly appreciate dual screens bolstering their mediocre bulk, making their attempt to sweep easier. Serperior and Bisharp also punish the use of Defog with Contrary and Defiant, respectively, making themselves more dangerous and difficult to handle. Due to Grimmsnarl's vulnerability to ferocious wallbreakers like Heatran, Kartana, and Mega Mawile, switch-ins to them like Kommo-o, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Scizor are helpful. Kommo-o, as well as Rillaboom, also checks Ash-Greninja, an otherwise annoying Pokemon for hyper offense teams to face. Entry hazard leads such as Landorus-T and Mew work with Grimmsnarl to assist its teams in sweeping.</p>"

However, Dracozolt is very vulnerable to being worn down quickly through entry hazards, Substitute damage, and Life Orb recoil.

However, Arctozolt suffers from being easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Victini, and Kartana due to its poor defensive typing, mediocre bulk, and Speed tier that's easily outsped, especially outside of hail. Freeze-Dry can be used over Blizzard in order to heavily damage and KO Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, which would otherwise take Blizzard and KO Arctozolt with their Ground-type STAB move; however, Blizzard is a more consistent and threatening move due to its high Base Power, making it superior otherwise. Low Kick allows Arctozolt to bypass would-be checks like Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Substitute is great for taking advantage of Pokemon that get forced out by Arctozolt, such as Toxapex, Garchomp, and Corviknight, while also easing prediction by blocking status and abilities such as Landorus-T's Intimidate, making Arctozolt harder to pivot around. However, Substitute drains Arctozolt's HP and can waste hail turns, making it situational to use. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item for Arctozolt, as it negates entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to wreak havoc against the opposing team regardless of if hazards are on the field; however, Leftovers is a good alternative, as it can keep Arctozolt healthy throughout a match, although it necessitates hazard control as a result.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an absolute necessity for Arctozolt, since it provides hail while also providing utility, such as setting up Aurora Veil to make it less prone to revenge killing and easier for it to switch in and overwhelm the foe. Alolan Ninetales can use Freeze-Dry to help with Arctozolt's Gastrodon and Mega Swampert matchup, allowing Arctozolt to free up Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales can also support it by locking the foe into a move with Encore, allowing Arctozolt to pivot in safely. Mega Diancie is also a great partner for Arctozolt, since it sets up Stealth Rock for Arctozolt to make it harder to switch into and pivot around, and Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce deflects the foe's entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to switch in multiple times and wreak havoc without the worry of taking hazard damage. If Arctozolt isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots, then Defoggers such as Corviknight are very useful for Arctozolt. Priority and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Rillaboom can be annoying for Arctozolt to handle, so checks to them such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Corviknight are great teammates for it. Pokemon that can bring Arctozolt in safely such as Landorus-T and Corviknight work as good teammates. Toxic support from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran can be useful for Arctozolt, as it can ease up its worst matchups in Gastrodon and Mega Latias.</p>"

Jungle Healing allows it to shrug off crippling status, like paralysis and Toxic, and recover any chip damage it has sustained from Scald burns; however, it isn't a reliable source of recovery long term. Darkinium Z allows it to nuke would-be checks such as Zapdos, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, and Darkest Lariat beats the likes of Iron Defense Skarmory and Corviknight by bypassing their Defense boosts. Power Whip is Zarude's strongest move, hitting Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. Furthermore, it lets Zarude hit neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tapu Lele much harder than Darkest Lariat.</p> <p>Zarude fits on bulkier balance teams, which can provide it with long-term support in the form of entry hazard stacking and other sweepers. Strong hazard support from the likes of Toxic Spikes Toxapex and Spikes Skarmory is extremely beneficial to wear down Zarude's checks in the long run, such as Tangrowth and Unaware Clefable. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja appreciate Zarude breaking down bulkier teams and help its struggles with faster-paced teams. Other setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable, Bulk Up Corviknight, and Mega Latias all appreciate Zarude weakening or KOing their checks, with Clefable especially enjoying it KOing Heatran and Mega Scizor. Zarude also needs sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon because they force it to switch out or waste its Z-Move, so partners such as Toxapex, Mega Latias, and Heatran are greatly appreciated. Lastly, Pokemon such as Corviknight and Skarmory that can switch into revenge killers that threaten Zarude, such as Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, Landorus-T, and Kartana, are required. Zarude’s typing gives it amazing defensive utility, allowing it to solidly check Ash-Greninja and switch into Slowbro and Slowking; however, Scald burns forcing it to use Jungle Healing can easily be taken advantage of. It can also reliably switch into Ground-types such as Gliscor and Garchomp and threaten them out. These defensive capabilities make it a good partner with the likes of Heatran, Gliscor, and Mega Diancie.</p>"
