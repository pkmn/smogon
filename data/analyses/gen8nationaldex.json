        "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll doubling its Speed under the sun and making it faster than every unboosted Pokemon in the NatDex metagame, Venusaur is a staple on dedicated sun teams. Thanks to Growth giving a +2 boost under the sun, it allows Venusaur to quickly power up and threaten opposing teams. However, Venusaur struggles to hit everything it wants due to needing both Sludge Bomb for Unaware Clefable and Mega Latios and Weather Ball for Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its lack of immediate power, middling bulk, and reliance on the sun make it an inconsistent and one dimensional sweeper. Giga Drain is Venusaur's main STAB option thanks to the recovery letting Venusaur stay healthy in spite of Life Orb chip damage and other hits while also allowing it to beat Chansey and Blissey more comfortably. Earth Power hits one of the biggest threats to sun in Heatran, as well as Galarian Slowking, which otherwise walls Venusaur. Weather Ball is the primary option due to it allowing Venusaur to blast through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which otherwise wall it. Sludge Bomb can also be run, as it provides a much stronger STAB option that allows Venusaur to break through Mega Latios and Unaware Clefable, but it is generally an inferior option due to it rendering Venusaur unable to break past certain Steel-types. Poisonium Z can also be used in place of Life Orb to allow Venusaur to break past Mega Latias, which its sun teammates like Blaziken and Victini really appreciate, but this sacrifices the overall power it gets from Life Orb. A Modest nature is used because the extra power is needed to secure crucial KOes on Pokemon like Mega Latios, as well as consistently beating Chansey and Blissey, and the Speed increase from a Timid Nature is generally unneeded and is only useful for Choice Scarf Greninja.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on dedicated sun teams due to its reliance on sun to function effectively. Thus, Torkoal is a needed partner alongside Venusaur, as it's able to set sun and provide Stealth Rock to help Venusaur clean better. Furthermore, Torkoal also checks the Steel-types that non-Weather Ball Venusaur is unable to break through. Fire- resistant Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Garchomp are also great partners alongside Venusaur due to them checking the likes of Heatran and Volcarona, which are often an issue for sun teams as a whole, and they appreciate Venusaur eliminating Unaware Clefable for them. Pokemon such as Victini, Heatran, and Blaziken are stellar partners for Venusaur, as they can punch holes in the opposing team for Venusaur to clean late game. Lastly, naturally fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T make up for Venusaur's low Speed stat outside of sun, and can also clean weakened teams.</p> "

Defog is an option, as Mega Charizard Y has a good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, but its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with it losing to hazard setters like Garchomp makes it an unreliable Defogger. It also dislikes giving up an important moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>On more offensive teams that do not require Mega Charizard X's longevity and defensive utility, you can remove Roost and use both Dragon Claw and Earthquake.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock halves Mega Charizard Y's health, severely limiting its ability to switch in and wallbreak. To add insult to injury, some Stealth Rock setters can even set the hazard up in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are near impossible for Mega Charizard Y to break through due to their massive special bulk, and they can then proceed to either status it or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Mega Latios, Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Garchomp are tough for Mega Charizard Y to deal with due to their resistance to Fire and Grass. The former two are particularly difficult to deal with due to their good bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are huge threats to Mega Charizard Y, as they can switch in and override sun with sand to weaken its STAB move and force Solar Beam to charge, and they then proceed to either KO it with their Rock-type moves or damage it as it tries to switch out with Pursuit. However, they must watch out for Scorching Sands burns and the rare Focus Blast. Pelipper is similarly dangerous, as it can switch in on Mega Charizard Y, override sun with rain, and proceed to either KO it with its Water-type moves or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex resists Fire while not being weak to Solar Beam, letting it check Mega Charizard Y well although Scorching Sands and Future Sight support threaten it to a degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp can revenge kill Mega Charizard Y; however, they, with the exception of Garchomp, cannot switch in on it at all.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can take Mega Charizard X's STAB moves with ease and pressure it with their own STAB moves, but they must watch out for the rare Thunder Punch and, in Toxapex's case, Earthquake. Toxapex can also be 2HKOed by +1 Dragon Claw into Earthquake, while Tapu Fini is 2HKOed by +1 Flare Blitz after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T can weaken Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and threaten it with Earthquake, forcing it to switch. Hippowdon can switch in and force Mega Charizard X out with Earthquake or phaze it, removing its boosts. However, offensive variants of Landorus-T can be OHKOed by Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock, while defensive variants can be easily worn down due to their lack of recovery. Gliscor can also tank one boosted Flare Blitz if it is at full health and KO back with Earthquake in combination with recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and Mega Diancie can switch in and KO Mega Charizard X with their Rock-type STAB moves, but they have to be careful about Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving makes it difficult to switch in, and, after Mega Evolving, it gets crippled by all entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage and Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and Heatran reduce Mega Charizard X's longevity, making it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and Flare Blitz do the same. However, these Pokemon cannot switch in on Mega Charizard X's attacks, with the exception of Garchomp if is not running Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Outs, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T can revenge kill Mega Charizard X if it gets chipped enough, but they cannot come in safely against its attacks and are outsped after a Dragon Dance.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker in National Dex because of its sky high Special Attack stat, great ability in Drought, and passable Speed tier that lets it threaten much of the metagame. Drought sets Mega Charizard Y apart by boosting its Fire-type moves, weakening Water-type moves, ands also letting it use Solar Beam effectively, which makes it a Fire-type that is able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowking. Mega Charizard Y's typing and access to Roost let it check Pokemon like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor reliably throughout a game . Flamethrower has perfect accuracy and high PP, but Fire Blast has explosive power, easily OHKOing Landorus-T and possibly Zapdos as well as 2HKOing offensive Garchomp. Solar Beam complements Mega Charizard Y's STAB move well, severely denting bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro that may try to switch in on Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scorching Sands rounds off its coverage by OHKOing offensive Heatran while also 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and its burn chance can ruin Tyranitar. Focus Blast is an option to replace Scorching Sands, notably hitting Tyranitar extremely hard while retaining the ability to smack Heatran. However, it has terrible accuracy and it also leaves Mega Charizard Y completely helpless against Toxapex without Future Sight support, so it is generally not advised. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off residual damage and check Pokemon like Rillaboom throughout the game. A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y absolutely hates Stealth Rock, as its health is halved by it, so good Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Synthesis Kartana are absolutely mandatory partners for it. Blissey and Chansey are also huge thorns in Mega Charizard Y's side, as it cannot 2HKO them due to their massive special bulk, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kartana that can take advantage of them are good partners. Heatran is also a good choice to trap and remove them. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Aegislash can greatly pressure Mega Latias, which can potentially use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder, and also force damage onto Blissey. Mega Charizard Y struggles with Toxapex, especially if running Focus Blast, so Slowbro and Slowking can pressure it with Future Sight and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Heatran can beat it directly. Due to Mega Charizard Y's only passable Speed tier, it is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, so pivots like the aforementioned Slowbro and Blissey can both switch in on these Pokemon and give it free switches via slow pivoting. Similarly, faster pivots like Tapu Koko can lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn that give Mega Charizard Y free turns while also helping wear down their shared checks, like Blissey. Due to how prolific Mega Charizard Y is as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaners Kartana make good partners for it, as it can break through their checks like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp helps force damage onto Mega Charizard Y's checks, mainly Toxapex, as it can 2HKO it with Scorching Sands after Stealth Rock.</p> "

Its typing lets it switch in on and force out common Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Rillaboom, granting it setup opportunities. Flare Blitz deals serious damage to common Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Dragon Claw is preferable in the second moveslot to not be walled by other Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. However, this leaves it walled by Heatran and more easily checked by Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides a way to hit Toxapex, and Steel-types weak to it such as Excadrill and Magnezone without taking recoil from Flare Blitz, while also OHKOing Heatran and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance and 2HKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch could be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Pelipper more effectively, but it gives worse neutral coverage. Roost recovers HP lost from Flare Blitz recoil and residual damage, letting Mega Charizard X check Grass-types like Rillaboom more easily. A Jolly nature is better to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Hydreigon and Kyurem.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X functions as a early- or mid-game wallbreaker that can take advantage of Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which benefits Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Tapu Koko. In return, they can pressure some of its checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Due to Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are mandatory partners. Tapu Fini can also protect Mega Charizard X from status through Misty Terrain, giving it more opportunities to setup Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Clefable, and Gliscor chip some of boosted Mega Charizard X's answers; offensive Landorus-T turns from a decent check to a likely OHKO, Toxapex becomes a likely 2HKO, and Tapu Fini becomes a guaranteed 2HKO. Garchomp can also break through Landorus-T and Gliscor with its Z-Move to help Mega Charizard X sweep. Due to its Ground weakness after Mega Evolving, checks to Ground-types like Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Corviknight make good teammates, with the latter also providing Defog support and Rillaboom pressuring common checks like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro. It's important to note that Rillaboom's and Tapu Fini's terrains make Earthquake and Dragon Claw too weak to use, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Alakazam stands as a potent setup sweeper due to its high Speed, coverage options, access to Nasty Plot, and amazing ability in Magic Guard. However, it is a very niche pick due to its extreme frailty, which leaves it helpless against Choice Scarf users, priority, and faster Pokemon once its Focus Sash is broken. Its frailty also means it cannot switch in at all without taking a large amount of damage. Psychic can overwhelm Pokemon that Psyshock cannot, such as Clefable, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; however, Psyshock can be used over it to more consistently deal with Blissey and Chansey. Focus Blast allows Alakazam to blow past Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Corviknight, and especially Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar, which can otherwise wall it and Pursuit trap it. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon that resist the other two moves, most notably Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and Mega Latias. Focus Sash lets Alakazam more easily set up and revenge kill faster Pokemon or priority users, which would otherwise KO Alakazam due to its frailty, and it cannot be broken by entry hazards or weather chip damage due to Magic Guard. However, Life Orb can be used over Focus Sash to more easily overwhelm Pokemon such as Clefable, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor; however, this set is very susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> <p>Alakazam fits primarily on bulky offense teams, as its high Speed and great Special Attack allow it to sweep late-game for those teams. Mega Tyranitar is a great partner for Alakazam, as it can Pursuit trap Slowking, Aegislash, and Mega Latias, which can all break Alakazam's Focus Sash, leaving it unable to revenge kill Pokemon like Rillaboom. Ferrothorn's Spikes is very beneficial to Alakazam, as it can make Alakazam harder to pivot around and wear down Pokemon that it can struggle with, such as Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Weavile. Tapu Lele is also a good partner for Alakazam, as its Psychic Terrain boosts Alakazam's STAB move to dangerous levels, allowing it to beat Pokemon such as Clefable and Gliscor after a Nasty Plot.Psychic Terrain also prevents Alakazam from being revenge killed by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Aegislash.</p> "

The combination of Future Sight and Teleport reliably sets up teammates like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny to break through troublesome defensive walls such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Clefable. Its good physical bulk allows it to check many key physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny. Scald lets Slowbro threaten the likes of Corviknight and Excadrill with a burn. Ice Beam is another option that lets Slowbro threaten Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T better, but causes it to struggle to check other physical attackers. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowbro ignore damage from entry hazards, which is key in keeping it healthy throughout longer games. It can also run Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers like Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Mega Lopunny, but this makes its longevity much worse. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed EVs ensures the slowest possible Teleport, guaranteeing a speed tie in Teleport mirrors against opposing Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <p>Slowbro tends to fit on bulky offense builds, where it can be paired with other Pokemon with pivoting moves, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Corviknight. Fast and frail wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Kartana appreciate Slowbro pivoting them onto the field safely and providing Future Sight support, which lets them more easily KO their checks like Landorus-T, Toxapex, Corviknight, and Tangrowth. Due to Slowbro's weakness to Electric-types such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko, pairing it up with Ground- and Grass-types that can switch into these Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth makes for a solid defensive backbone. Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth deserve a special mention, as they are able to check Ash-Greninja, which Slowbro tends to let in for free. Pokemon that resist Dark such as Clefable and Kommo-o make for good teammates, as they're able to switch into Dark-type moves from the likes of Tyranitar, Greninja, and Hydreigon, which threaten Slowbro. Lastly, Blissey forms a stellar defensive core alongside Slowbro, as its ability to switch into special attacks directed at Slowbro, alongside its access to Teleport, lets these two cover most offensive Pokemon while keeping up momentum.</p> "

Priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny also presents issues, while Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain removes Aqua Jet from the equation entirely. Chip damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet doesn't help either, as it can quickly wear down Azumarill into range of other priority users. While Azumarill can break through and OHKO slow Water-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage, these Pokemon are often paired with teammates that can deal with Azumarill more naturally, such as faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Mega Latias and Kartana or powerful priority users like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham. These drawbacks leave Azumarill as a very inconsistent sweeper with no real niche in the metagame.</p> <p>Z-Belly Drum fully heals Azumarill before its use, ensuring Azumarill receives the boost and therefore giving it its best shot at potentially sweeping opposing teams. If your team already has a Z-Move user, Sitrus Berry is an option that can give Azumarill a bit more health after setting up in a best-case scenario, but such scenarios are quite rare, and the loss of health from Belly Drum makes it much harder for Azumarill to find opportunities to set up while also preventing it from effectively checking Weavile and Ash-Greninja. Knock Off is the preferred last move in order to OHKO Toxapex and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage. This set works best on hyper offense and rain teams, as Azumarill can theoretically work as an early-game wallbreaker on hyper offense, while rain significantly boosts the power of Aqua Jet and gives it more favorable rolls against threats like Zapdos and Garchomp, which can make it easier for Azumarill to sweep via giving Aqua Jet. However, both playstyles have far better options available to them; hyper offense can utilize numerous other, more consistent sweepers, such as Kommo-o, Rillaboom, and Volcarona, while Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy are all far superior rain sweepers.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Galarian Slowking is a solid option for teams that need a sturdy check to Fairy-types such as Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Fini, and other strong special attackers such as Serperior, Kyurem, and Magnezone. Also, its good Special Attack and great movepool make Galarian Slowking a hard Pokemon to pivot around. Thanks to Assault Vest, good natural bulk, Regenerator, and good defensive typing, it can easily tank special attacks such as Kyurem's Ice Beam and Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, letting it use Future Sight to provide advantageous situations for its teammates or punish its switch-ins. While Knock Off doesn't completely ruin Galarian Slowking, losing its item does notably compromise its bulk, preventing it from pivoting into threats like Ash-Greninja and Kyurem. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking's crippling weakness to Pursuit can discourage it from entering the field, since Weavile and Mega Tyranitar can trap and KO it. Finally, Galarian Slowking faces competition from Slowking as a special wall due to its better immediate recovery, access to Teleport, and ability to check threats well without Assault Vest. Flamethrower punishes Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight that try to pivot in Galarian Slowking's STAB attacks. Scald is used over Hydro Pump due to its burn chance discouraging switch-ins from Pursuit trappers, like Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor without its Toxic Orb activated. It also wins the one-on-one Heatran matchup. 252 HP and 140 SpD EVs along with a Calm Nature allow Galarian Slowking to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to improve its ability to punish switch-ins.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate Future Sight support and need a sturdy check to strong special attackers and Fairy-types. Dragon-types like Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon appreciate Galarian Slowking forcing out Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tangrowth likes Galarian Slowking's ability to check Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. In return, Tangrowth checks Ground-types like Garchomp and other physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Swampert, and Mega Tyranitar for it, as well as forming a great Regenerator core. Urshifu-R, Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja appreciate the Future Sight support to prevent Toxapex, Clefable, and Kommo-o from safely switching into them. Due to Galarian Slowking's weakness to Pursuit, Knock Off, and Dark-types such as Weavile and Tyranitar generally, offensive Dark-type checks like Mega Lopunny and defensive checks like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn work well with it. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar and Clefable help Galarian Slowking check Ash-Greninja more easily. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T also tend to force Galarian Slowking out, making Corviknight, Synthesis Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom good partners. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu are especially good, as they both provide Grassy Terrain support, decreasing Earthquake damage and giving it a form of passive recovery.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set running Swords Dance, Superpower, Bullet Punch, and Dual Wingbeat can be used but is rather niche and generally only seen on select hyper offense builds. Such a set should use a 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe EV spread with an Adamant nature to maximize bulk and power while outspeeding Modest Magnezone. Sand Tomb can be used to trap and eliminate Toxapex but is rather unreliable due to needing certain rolls to work. Sand Tomb can also hit Magnezone and Heatran, but it fails to hit Kartana and Corviknight. Pursuit may also be used to trap and potentially KO Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias but does not have much use otherwise. Curse can be considered over Swords Dance to beat Swords Dance Rillaboom and Gliscor due to the Defense raise, but not setting up twice can leave Mega Scizor fairly passive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type coverage: Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Moltres, and Heatran do well in switching into Mega Scizor and threatening it out. The latter three hate having their Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers removed by Knock Off, though, as it can make switching in much harder when Stealth Rock is up. Other Pokemon with Fire-type coverage like Mega Diancie, Mega Latias, and Clefable also make it hard for Mega Scizor to switch into them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon: Toxapex, Pelipper, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can pivot into Mega Scizor, forcing it out with a burn or Haze, although +2 Mega Scizor can 2HKO them all. Quagsire is a hard counter to Mega Scizor, ignoring its boosts with Unaware and taking negligible damage from its moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Mega Scizor struggles to break past the likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zapdos, the first two being able to pivot out or boost alongside it, and the latter outright KOing it with Heat Wave. However, they all hate Knock Off, and both Corviknight and Skarmory can get overpowered if they lack Defense-boosting moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran and Magnezone pivot well into Mega Scizor's STAB moves and can potentially use it as fodder for setting up Stealth Rock or trap and remove it, respectively. However, both of these fear a boosted Sand Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Burn and entry hazard chip damage can rack up on Mega Scizor very quickly and, alongside the damage it takes from what it has to check, can force it to use Roost. Burn, in particular, can make it hard for Mega Scizor to threaten the foes it has to check and can give Clefable, Mega Latias, and Reuniclus an opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Bullet Punch Answers</strong>: Due to Mega Scizor's dependence on Bullet Punch to beat faster foes, faster Pokemon that resist and survive a +2 Bullet Punch, such as Ash-Greninja and Victini, are able to revenge kill it. Tapu Lele is an exceptional check to Mega Scizor, as its Psychic Surge completely negates Bullet Punch, allowing it to outspeed and retaliate with a Hidden Power Fire.</p> ",

It can also use the aforementioned Pokemon to get momentum, be it through U-turn or Swords Dance. Bullet Punch makes up for Mega Scizor's crippling Speed stat, and it also serves as a great STAB move to revenge kill Kyurem, Mega Diancie, Calm Mind Clefable, and Gengar. U-turn can be used to make Mega Scizor a defensive pivot while also hitting Mega Latias, Slowbro, and Tangrowth. Knock Off can also be used to cripple switch-ins such as Zapdos, Toxapex, and Corviknight, possibly letting Mega Scizor break past them in the long term. Roost gives it longevity to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, Rillaboom, and Kartana in the long term. Light Metal has a niche use over Technician before Mega Evolving in reducing damage from Low Kick Greninja. 248 HP and 16 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature allow Mega Scizor to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Kartana's Sacred Sword after Stealth Rock, while the Special Defense EVs allow it to better take hits from Tapu Lele, Kyurem, Clefable, and Mega Latias.</p> <p>Water-types like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini help Mega Scizor with its one big weakness in Fire-types. Slowking and Rotom-W in particular form a great pivot core with it via Teleport and Volt Switch, respectively. Tapu Fini also provides it with Misty Terrain support, allowing it to set up on Slowbro and Rotom-W without fear of being burnt. Mega Scizor in return can help these Water-types by pivoting into troubling Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom. Ground-types like Gastrodon, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can also help check Fire-types, and they apply pressure to some of Mega Scizor's best counters in Zapdos, Toxapex, and Magnezone. These Ground-types can also support Mega Scizor with Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins like Corviknight, Heatran, and Zapdos, provided Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Mega Scizor can, in return, switch into and threaten annoying Grass-types like Tangrowth and Rillaboom and Ice-types like Weavile and Kyurem.

However, it is overly reliant on Bullet Punch to hit fast threats due to its mediocre Speed, is very vulnerable to Fire-type moves, and easily loses its bulk through chip damage. Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's main STAB  attack and powerful Technician-boosted priority to challenge revenge kilers such as Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp. Superpower allows Mega Scizor to hit Steel-type Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Sand Tomb allows Mega Scizor to trap and remove the likes of Heatran, Toxapex, and Magnezone for its partners such as Volcarona and Serperior to clean late-game. Dual Wingbeat is a strong coverage option with Technician, allowing Mega Scizor to break through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and  Slowbro with Swords Dance, nailing specific physical walls such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Amoonguss, and discouraging the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona from switching in directly. Knock Off is another option to hit the likes of Slowbro and Mega Latias, as well as enabling other hyper offense sweepers better with the item removal, such as removing Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots so Rillaboom can KO it after Stealth Rock. Knock Off is best used in conjunction with Sand Tomb, as the two provide Mega Scizor with solid neutral coverage. Light Metal is the ability before Mega Evolution to weaken opposing Ditto, as well as the rare Low Kick Greninja and Weavile. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to outrun Modest Magnezone and specially defensive Heatran, allowing it to KO them before they can retaliate.</p> <p>Mega Scizor provides a solid defensive backbone for hyper offense teams, and pairing it up with Pokemon that tend to be checked offensively such as Kommo-o, Serperior, and Manaphy can provide it many setup opportunities during a game. Teammates that can set Sticky Web such as Shuckle and Ribombee are solid assets, alleviating its middling Speed tier so it can outspeed threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Due to its crippling weakness to Fire-type moves, teammates that can pivot into these moves such as Manaphy and Kommo-o work well with it. Hyper offense staples such as Rillaboom, Volcarona, and Hawlucha help it overwhelm shared checks like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight to pave the way for a late-game sweep, and Mega Scizor also appreciates the passive recovery Grassy Terrain provides, although it makes Toxapex harder to remove. Other entry hazards are greatly appreciated to wear down the opposing team to be easily cleaned up late-game, with Knock Off making the hazards matter more on Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Victini and Zapdos.</p> "

However, its low Speed and lack of recovery means it struggles to deal with faster teams, and it's often denied opportunities to setup with enough offensive pressure. It also takes up a team's Mega slot and faces severe competition from other wallbreakers and Mega Evolutions such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile. Close Combat can notably OHKO Skarmory and physically defensive Tangrowth after Stealth Rock once boosted. Rock Blast allows Heracross to hit Flying-types that resist Close Combat, such as Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, to have near-perfect neutral coverage, achieving feats such as OHKOing specially defensive Toxapex once boosted after Stealth Rock. Pin Missile nails bulky Psychic- and Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Mew, Slowbro, Mega Latias, and Tangrowth. Substitute lets Mega Heracross use its great bulk to gain even more setup opportunities on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn and Kommo-o, as well as easing prediction, making Mega Heracross much harder to pivot on than it already is. Bullet Seed nails the likes of Unaware Clefable under Grassy Terrain, as well as OHKOing Tapu Fini; however, both it and Substitute leave Mega Heracross open to pressure from Psychic-types like Mew and Mega Latias. A slightly bulkier EV spread of 32 HP / 232 Atk / 24 Def / 220 Spe can be used alongside Substitute to let Substitute survive an Earthquake from Landorus-T while still outspeeding the likes of Timid Magnezone and Adamant Bisharp.

Mega Mawile, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Aegislash take especially good advantage of this, while Corviknight and Skarmory are capable of directly pivoting into Toxic variants as well.

        "description": "<p>Blissey's enormous special bulk allows it to effectively take on most of the tier's many special attackers, with threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y all failing to break Blissey. Teleport allows it to safely pivot in teammates like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Mawile and take advantage of the many switches that it forces; Blissey's ability to viably hold Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it hard to wear down via entry hazards, unlike its pre-evolution Chansey. Toxic allows Blissey to chip away at threats such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Targeting Mega Latias is especially important, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably come in on it and cripple it in the long term with Toxic. It must be noted, however, that Toxic forces Blissey to use Teleport more often, as it invites Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Kartana to easily pivot in. Thunder Wave is another good choice for the last move, as it allows Blissey to effectively cripple offensive Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Kartana. It also gives Blissey a weapon against a couple of the select few special attackers that otherwise handily beat Blissey, such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, a reckless Gengar on the switch, and Calm Mind Clefable. Stealth Rock can be run over a status move if your team can't fit a Stealth Rock setter elsewhere, but Blissey is even more passive than normal without Toxic or Thunder Wave and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Blissey finds its home on balanced and bulky offensive teams. There it should be used to pivot into threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja and regain momentum with Teleport while also spreading status. Blissey really hates powerful physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. A physically bulky partner is therefore appreciated. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution are very solid switch-ins to Fighting-type attacks, are capable of checking many of the tier's physical attackers, and can also form a very strong double Teleport core with Blissey. Corviknight effectively rounds out the Slowbro + Blissey core, taking on the likes of Kartana, Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as well as offering Defog support and additional pivoting support with U-turn. Zapdos is another option that meets the previously mentioned positives bar checking Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also provide pivoting support with Volt Switch if desired. Toxapex can also handle Mega Lopunny and can beat other powerful physical attackers that Blissey dislikes like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile. Blissey's Teleport makes it a very solid pivot, which is appreciated by Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Greninja, and Weavile. The latter two are also capable of revenge killing Gengar, a special attacker that completely shuts down Blissey, with Weavile in particular heavily limiting additional threats such as Mega Medicham with Pursuit. Physical walls, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex, appreciate Blissey taking on special attackers they can't handle, such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Koko. Thunder Wave variants of Blissey can also be paired with slower wallbreakers that appreciate the paralysis support, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Heracross. Toxic variants of Blissey dislike Steel-types, with Landorus-T, Victini, and Garchomp helping out in that category.</p> "

This is unadvisable though, as it severely cuts into Mega Tyranitar's ability to pressure Defoggers and Pursuit trap Mega Latias and Reuniclus. Dragon Dance is a cool option, but Mega Tyranitar loses out on Stealth Rock, and is still slower than Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja after boosting, meaning it can be revenge killed rather easily. A Jolly nature can be used on the Choice Band set to outspeed threats such as Rotom-W and Magnezone, but the lack of power is noticeable, as Tyranitar struggles to break the likes of Tangrowth and Alomomola.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Alomomola, and Landorus-T can all stomach multiple hits and recover the damage dealt or pivot out. Faster Skarmory sets are exceptional Tyranitar checks due to them switching in well, boosting Defense with Iron Defense with Iron Defense, and forcing it out with a boosted Body Press. Physically defensive Tangrowth also can switch into Tyranitar well to scout its move, and it can threaten it out with Sleep Powder, but it can easily lose if it is slightly chipped.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Hippowdon switch into Mega Tyranita's STAB moves and threaten Mega Tyranitar back with Earthquake, set up Stealth Rock, or set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon: Mega Tyranitar's typing does it no favors against the likes of Mega Lopunny and Kommo-o, which can switch freely into Mega Tyranitar.

Additionally, offensive Grass- and Water-type Pokemon like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Tapu Fini threaten Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types such as Mega Mawile, Corviknight, and Melmetal can switch into Mega Tyranitar with ease and threaten to deal heavy damage with their STAB move or Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions: Being burned or paralyzed severely cuts into Mega Tyranitar's ability as a wallbreaker. A burn also wears Mega Tyranitar down over time, and paralysis allows slower Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Melmetal to revenge kill Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Mega Tyranitar's poor defensive typing means that many Pokemon carry coverage moves that hit it. This includes Mega Latias, Reuniclus, Aegislash, Steelium Z Heatran, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Additionally, Mega Tyranitar is afraid of U-turn users such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Rillaboom, Ash-Greninja, and Landorus-T can all force Tyranitar out with ease due to its middling Speed tier, but they can‘t switch in reliably.</p> ",

Additionally, Mega Tyranitar can use its phenomal bulk and typing to Pursuit trap Zapdos, Heatran, Blissey, and Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Ash-Greninja. Crunch lets Mega Tyranitar threaten bulky Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias. It also pressures Aegislash in Shield forme.

Reuniclus and Toxapex in particular are incredible teammates, as they appreciate Mega Tyranitar's ability to Pursuit trap Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Heatran. Skarmory can form a powerful entry hazard stacking core with it, as it checks offensive Ground-types like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Other sturdy checks to Ground-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Landorus-T synergize well with Mega Tyranitar. Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Ferrothorn are solid insurance against Water-types like Ash-Greninja and Tapu Fini.

However, Tyranitar‘s middling Speed stat and poor defensive typing mean it struggles to come in and dish out multiple hits throughout the match. Stone Edge is Tyranitar’s main STAB move, being extremely hard to switch into due to its sheer power. Crunch is Tyranitar’s most spammable move due to the tiers‘s lack of sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon, and it also KOes Pokemon like Mega Latias and Slowbro that can live a Stone Edge comfortably and retaliate. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that it forces out, such as Aegislash and Mega Latias. It can also trap Choice-locked Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, Chansey, and Zapdos, which otherwise can‘t threaten it back. Superpower lets Tyranitar immediately threaten a KO on Chansey, which can otherwise use Soft-boiled to scout its move, and also hits Ferrothorn and Heatran hard. Fire Punch OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn without risking a Stone Edge miss or getting chipped multiple times by Iron Barbs. Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar nail Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone without dropping its Attack and Defense, and it gives it near-perfect neutral coverage. The given EV spread allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Mega Mawile, always live a +1 Bug Buzz from Volcarona, and always survive Choice Specs Tapu Lele Moonblast.</p> <p>Tyranitar fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate it breaking holes in opposing teams and Pursuit trapping key threats such as Mega Latias and Reuniclus.

Teammates such as Amoonguss and Tapu Fini that can deal with pesky Water-types such as Ash Greninja and Rotom-W, help Tyranitar—so do Pokemon that can handle Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana, such as Corviknight and Tangrowth. Partners that can manage Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny are also appreciated, so Clefable and Reuniclus are great with it. Skarmory and Mega Latias can deal with Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Excadrill benefits greatly from Tyranitar providing sand and wearing down the bulky Grass- and Flying-types that normally check it, such as Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Landorus-T.

Breakneck Blitz gives Blaziken a strong neutral hit against all of its checks but is much weaker in general. Overall, Z-Move sets focus on targeting one specific Pokemon or group of Pokemon, and they can't break through Blaziken's other checks. A Choice Band set gives much greater immediate power but struggles due to how easy it is to scout and wear down. An Adamant nature can also be used for much more offensive prowess, but it misses out on a lot of important Speed tiers such as those of Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny when boosted. A mixed Life Orb set with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Ice can hit the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor without a Z-Move or taking recoil, but it cuts into Blaziken’s power and coverage options.

The likes of Ash-Greninja and Choice Scarf Landorus-T easily revenge kill it, and it tends to quickly faint to its own recoil. Flare Blitz is its main STAB move, hitting a large portion of the tier at least neutrally, including Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Clefable, and Rillaboom. Close Combat nails certain Fire-resistant and immune Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Heatran, as well as KOing Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Blissey without inflicting recoil damage.

Toxic and Will-O-Wisp allow Shedinja to capitalize on the switches that it forces by crippling the incoming Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats immune to Toxic such as Kartana and Mega Scizor. Hex synergizes well with Toxic and Will-O-Wisp; however, Shedinja has a paltry Special Attack stat, so even a boosted Hex will not be dealing too much damage. Protect can be used to scout for super effective coverage, such as Flamethrower on Clefable or Hidden Power Fire on Tapu Lele, as well as prolonging passive damage from Toxic poison and Will-O-Wisp burns. Heavy-Duty Boots stops entry hazards from KOing Shedinja. Minimum bulk investment is so Ditto copying Shedinja has as little bulk as possible, as Shedinja can only take one hit regardless.</p> <p>Due to its relative passivity, Shedinja is restricted to stall teams. It appreciates the entry hazard support from Chansey and Skarmory to wear down its foes faster in conjunction with its own status conditions. Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Toxapex, Chansey, Clefable, and Alomomola all appreciate Shedinja's ability to switch into and ward off the threatening Manaphy, Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Kyurem. Also, since Shedinja is very vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped, its teams must play around opposing Weavile and Tyranitar via double switching. Skarmory, Melmetal, and Alomomola are teammates that can double switch into the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Tyranitar in particular poses a huge threat, as Shedinja cannot come in while its summoned sand is active. Pokemon that absorb status such as burn and poison are vital, as these conditions will KO Shedinja. Chansey and Gliscor are exampes of solid status absorbers to pair with it. Gliscor is particularly helpful, as it can switch into the dangerous Heatran, which otherwise can switch into Shedinja freely. Gastrodon can help alleviate pressure from Heatran as well.</p> "

Its typing and bulk also lets it check several dangerous threats, such as Mega Medicham and variants of Reuniclus and Mega Latias that use only Psychic- and Fighting-type coverage. Knock Off is used to remove Leftovers from key threats like specially defensive Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Corviknight. Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers that may try to advantage of Mega Sableye, like Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp, along with crippling Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T, letting Mega Sableye keep Stealth Rock off the field. Protect lets Sableye safely Mega Evolve at any point in time while also scouting the intentions of Choice-locked threats like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem. Prankster grants Sableye priority Will-O-Wisp and Recover before Mega Evolving, which can be used to burn and neutralize threats like Garchomp, Kartana, and offensive Landorus-T. The given EV spread outspeeds Ferrothorn and ensures Mega Medichams Ice Punch never 2HKOs Mega Sableye after Stealth Rock, while greatly improving the matchup against Heatran and letting it take Moonblasts from the likes of Clefable better. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD / 4 Spe can be run to better check Mega Medicham in Electric Terrain, Rockium Z Garchomp, and defensive Landorus-T, while still avoiding the 2HKO from specially defensive Heatrans Magma Storm.</p> <p>Mega Sableye only fits on stall teams due to its immense passivity.

Specifically, Defoggers that can beat these such as Gliscor for Heatran, and Corviknight and Zapdos for Clefable, are excellent. Mega Sableye is very weak to Fairy-type Pokemon like Clefable, Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Mega Mawile, so checks to those like Toxapex, Shedinja, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Unaware Clefable are great partners .

        "description": "<p>Gastrodon is a formidable specially defensive wall on bulkier teams, sporting an amazing defensive typing and good bulk, allowing it to safely check Electric- and Fire-types such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Heatran. A stellar ability in Storm Drain further lets it check the likes of Ash-Greninja and Manaphy lacking Energy Ball. However, it tends to get worn down and overpowered with constant offensive pressure, status effects, and entry hazards. Scald lets Gastrodon threaten physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, Rillaboom, Garchomp, and Kartana with burn. Alternatively, Toxic puts its switch-ins such as Tangrowth, Kommo-o, and Kyurem on a timer. Earthquake lets Gastrodon nail specially defensive Heatran, as well as hitting the numerous Electric-types that it checks, such as Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora. Clear Smog prevents Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Clefable from using it as setup fodder, as well as letting it check Manaphy lacking Energy Ball. Leftovers means Gastrodon doesn't get worn down as quickly.</p> <p>Gastrodon fits best on bulkier balance or stall teams that appreciate it checking the likes of Manaphy, Ash-Greninja, and Clefable. Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Mega Latias are stellar to take the strong Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon from the likes of Rillaboom and Kartana, and it can switch into Fire- and Electric-type moves such as Tapu Koko’s Thunderbolt and Heatran’s Magma Storm for the first two. Due to Gastrodon's vulnerability to Toxic, Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable that can absorb and/or remove status effects work well with it. Gastrodon’s low Defense lets the likes of Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Mega Lopunny easily pressure it, so teammates such as Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable are great partners. Special attackers with super effective coverage such as Mega Charizard Y, Kyurem, and Protean Greninja can break past Gastrodon, so checks to these such as Chansey and Blissey are good partners. Good entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Corviknight is phenomenal, making it harder to wear down.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Lopunny’s expansive movepool leaves a lot of room for theoretical utility either offensively or support oriented. Toxic and Thunder Wave can be run over U-turn in order to harass defensive answers, but they aren’t worth dropping the ability to reliably pivot on most teams. Quick Attack and Facade can be offensively useful, but only situationally. Healing Wish is an option but faces competition from Choice Scarf Jirachi, which boasts a better defensive typing, as well as the ability to effectively cripple walls before sacrificing itself.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: The likes of Toxapex, Bold Clefable, and defensive Zapdos can easily take all of Mega Lopunny’s attacks. However, all of these must be at or near full health, cannot switch in whatsoever if Future Sight also hits that turn - and bar Static Zapdos - are susceptible to a loss of momentum from U-turn. Slowbro can afford chip damage, but its Psychic typing exacerbates the effectiveness of Mega Lopunny’s U-turn. This can lead to scenarios where the combination of Return and U-turn either forces Slowbro to waste turns using Slack Off or risk being excessively whittled down over the course of the match.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Excadrill in sand, and Mega Swampert in rain can take advantage of Mega Lopunny’s defensive woes and either KO it outright or take advantage of the forced switch into a passive wall. However, none of these can switch in reliably, and they are additionally susceptible to being chipped down by Fake Out with the exception of Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Attackers with priority moves, such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Mega Medicham, and Rillaboom, can easily revenge kill Mega Lopunny due to its awful defensive attributes. However, they cannot come in directly, struggle with Fake Out, and - with the exception of Rillaboom - require significant chip damage to actually KO Mega Lopunny.</p> ",

Fake Out can force respectable chip damage onto faster threats and priority users, like Rillaboom and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and even slower attackers that it brings to KO range like Mega Medicham. U-turn takes advantage of how easily Mega Lopunny can force switches by keeping up momentum on the likes of Slowbro, Clefable, Toxapex, and Slowking. Ice Punch can be run over U-turn to handle Gliscor and Landorus-T more effectively, but Mega Lopunny loses out on a lot of offensive utility. Limber can prevent paralysis before Mega Evolving.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the Speed and ability to pivot on forced switches that it provides. As such, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kyurem, Ash-Greninja, and Choice Band Victini make excellent partners, and Mega Lopunny can clean up holes in cores they make. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Hydreigon also appreciate being pivoted into passive Pokemon such as Slowbro. Mega Lopunny’s defensive stats are quite subpar, so walls like Clefable and specially defensive Heatran are good partners. Pivots such as U-turn Greninja variants, Rotom-W, and Choice Band Rillaboom make great options as well to get Mega Lopunny in safely. Slowking and Slowbro deserve special mention, as they can fulfill the aforementioned defensive role while using Future Sight + Teleport to let Mega Lopunny break through almost all common counterplay options, such as Toxapex, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Magnezone can trap and remove common switch-ins to Mega Lopunny, like Mega Scizor and Corviknight, and pressure others like Clefable and Toxapex. Entry hazards from the likes of Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Garchomp are fantastic with Mega Lopunny in order to maximize the pressure it places on defensive cores and chip down foes into Fake Out range faster. Clefable especially makes an excellent partner, as it can fulfill hazard-setting duties and also support Mega Lopunny defensively,</p> "

        "description": "<p>This Mega Lopunny set trades the ability to function as a deadly offensive pivot and some of its ability to beat offense to shut down common defensive checks to Mega Lopunny such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Gliscor with Encore. Furthermore, Mega Lopunny's extremely high Speed stat allows it to utilize Power-Up Punch extremely well, as it is hard to revenge kill, and teams often rely on defensive checks to it. However, due to this set lacking the ability to pivot on defensive switch-ins, it is forced to rely on Encore to break down its defensive checks, which can sometimes prove inconsistent due to its predictability once the set is revealed, such as relying on Corviknight or Clefable to instantly use their recovery move when they get attacked instead of retaliating. Power-Up Punch allows Mega Lopunny to function as a potent cleaner in the late-game. Encore functions alongside Power-Up Punch to use passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Skarmory as setup fodder by locking them into their recovery to boost its Attack stat with Power-Up Punch as these Pokemon are left unable to retaliate. Limber is the chosen ability to allow Lopunny to avoid paralysis before it Mega Evolves to let it pressure Static Zapdos.</p> <p>Power-Up Punch + Encore Mega Lopunny fits on a wide array of team archetypes, from offense to balance. Due to its ability to lure and eliminate or severely chip down multiple key threats such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable, teammates like Weavile, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem work extremely well with it, as they complement each other offensively. Ash-Greninja and Weavile, in particular, also help secure Mega Lopunny's shakier matchup against offensive teams. Although Mega Lopunny can lure and eliminate these Pokemon, it is unable to beat them in a 1v1 scenario; thus, the likes of Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Victini are common partners. Furthermore, the aforementioned Pokemon can also threaten the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Tangrowth, which can cause issues for Mega Lopunny. Pokemon which can set entry hazards such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Clefable, and Landorus-T are stellar partners, as the additional chip damage generated by the hazards allows Mega Lopunny to break its checks like Corviknight much easier, as well as wear down foes for it to clean late-game. Lastly, as Mega Lopunny can't switch into offensive threats due to its poor defensive capabilities, defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are necessary alongside it, and they can also switch into the likes of Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T, which can revenge kill it.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scale Shot can be run to turn regular Garchomp into a sweeper, but it is generally outclassed in this role by its Mega counterpart. Due to its stellar bulk and good defensive ability in Rough Skin, Garchomp can also run a defensive Stealth Rock set with a Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin to rack up chip damage against opposing physical attackers, However, this set is outclassed in this role by Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and is unsuitable for checking anything in the long run. Garchomp can also run a mixed Life Orb set with Draco Meteor or Fire Blast to bait in and punish physical walls that would usually give Garchomp problems, though Garchomp’s poor Special Attack makes the set difficult to pull off consistently, and this set is also outclassed by its Mega Evolution. A mixed offensive Stealth Rock set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast not only lures and beats common Mega Garchomp answers such as Tangrowth and Skarmory, but it also sets up Stealth Rock and overpowers common entry hazard control options such as Mega Sableye, Corviknight, and Kartana. However, this set becomes easy to counterplay after it's been revealed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that have good physical bulk and don't take super effective damage from any of Garchomps common moves like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon can survive any unboosted hit from Garchomp and force it out with status or super effective coverage moves. Pokemon with Unaware such as Clefable and Quagsire can also completely stop Garchomp from wallbreaking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Naturally fast Pokemon or Choice Scarf users like Greninja, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, Weavile, and Ice Beam Latias can revenge kill Garchomp. Priority users like Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Scizor can also knock out a weakened Garchomp but they don't enjoy the chip from Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status: Garchomp absolutely hates status conditions, as all of them severely cripple its wallbreaking capabilities and defensive utility. Scald burns from Slowbro, Slowking or Gastrodon seriously limit its wallbreaking potential, while Toxic poisoning from Clefable, Blissey, or Gliscor will seriously dent its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Corviknight: Garchomp cannot reliably break either Skarmory or Corviknight without Continental Crush. Iron Defense or Bulk Up variants of these two will completely wall Garchomp; not only can they clear Garchomp's Stealth Rock with Defog, but they can set their own hazards up as well.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Mega Garchomp's crippling weakness to Ice-types leaves it vulnerable to the likes of Weavile and Kyurem, both of which outspeed and force it out. Faster Pokemon that tend to run Ice-type coverage moves such as Greninja, Mega Latias, and Zeraora can also revenge kill Mega Garchomp, unless its Speed has been boosted.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Because of Scale Shot's lowering of Defense, it leaves Mega Garchomp vulnerable to be revenge killed by physical priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: The likes of Buzzwole, Landorus-T, and Slowbro temporarily hinder Mega Garchomp with status. The former two are also prone to Intimidate shuffling, and Buzzwole and Slowbro threaten Mega Garchomp with Ice-type coverage moves. Tangrowth gets chip damage on Mega Garchomp between Rocky Helmet and Hidden Power Ice. Slowbro, with its insane Defense stat, eats most hits from Mega Garchomp. However, Mega Garchomp eventually breaks through even these physical walls thanks to Swords Dance quickly raising Mega Garchomp's attacking power.</p> ",

It also has some solid defensive utility with its typing, letting it provide an Electric immunity and check common Pokemon like Heatran and non-Hidden Power Zapdos. Swords Dance allows Garchomp to beat a lot of common Defoggers like Zapdos, Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, allowing it to easily keep Stealth Rock up. Rockium Z with Stone Edge gives Garchomp a strong Rock-type move to beat Defoggers like Zapdos and Corviknight. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Outrage allows Garchomp to deliver a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and it can also catch a Mega Latias expecting a Stone Edge off guard. However, having a much worse matchup against Corviknight and Skarmory and the lack of a spammable STAB move once Devastating Drake has been used, make Dragonium Z an inferior option overall. Rough Skin is the preferred ability on most sets, as it punishes physical attackers like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha.</p> <p>Due to its role as both a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, Garchomp fits best on offensive teams, where it can be paired up with teammates that enjoy its ability to break down or threaten out bulkier Pokemon like Toxapex, Zapdos, and Blissey. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham make for stellar teammates, as they benefit from its ability to break down defensive foes like Zapdos, Slowbro, and Corviknight. The former three can also bring Garchomp in safely on defensive Pokemon, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or use Swords Dance easily. Garchomp is very easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Kartana, and Tapu Koko, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Gastrodon make for solid teammates. Tapu Fini is an especially good partner for non-Outrage sets, as Misty Terrain can let Garchomp freely switch into bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking without fearing a Scald burn. Due to it beating many of the common Defoggers in the tier, Garchomp pairs well with Spikes users like Ash-Greninja and Ferrothorn, as it can threaten opposing Defoggers and keep Spikes on the field. It also has some very good defensive utility, being able to check Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Victini.</p> "

Swords Dance boosts Mega Garchomp’s already immensely high Attack stat to allow it to break through the likes of Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Gliscor. Scale Shot is not only a decent multi-hit Dragon-type attack, but the Speed boost it confers means Mega Garchomp outspeeds the likes of Greninja, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny. Fire Fang breaks through defensive threats such as Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory, though Fire Blast takes better advantage of the latter two’s lackluster Special Defense stats. However, the latter is not boosted by Swords Dance, is unable to reliably break through the likes of Tapu Bulu and Corviknight, and forces Mega Garchomp to sacrifice its bulk by running a Naive nature. This leaves it vulnerable to specially offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Heatran. An Adamant nature offers more power against the likes of Pyukumuku, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, but Mega Garchomp is then more easily revenge killed by faster threats like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> <p>Mega Garchomp tends to fit best on offensive teams with teammates that clean up after it has broken holes through the opposing team such as Kartana, Hawlucha, and Weavile. Mega Garchomp's weakness to Ice-type attacks makes Water- and Steel-types such as Tapu Fini and Jirachi, respectively, good partners, although the former weakens Mega Garchomp's Scale Shot due to Misty Terrain. Mega Garchomp struggles in a similar fashion against opposing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu who are able to pivot into Scale Shot and prevent it from boosting its Speed. Running partners that can deal with these threats, such as Bisharp and Gengar, makes for good synergy. Volcarona switches into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks directed towards Mega Garchomp, which creates opportunity for it to set up. In return, Mega Garchomp beats common Volcarona checks such as Toxapex, Blissey, and Heatran. It also fuctions amazingly in tandem with dual screens support from the likes of Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Grimmsnarl, giving it plenty of opportunity to set up.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to the multi-hit nature of Triple Axel, it is very easy to rack up contact chip damage from Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and various Rocky Helmet users. Icicle Crash avoids this chip damage while having a reliable damage output and a flinch chance; however, Icicle Crash does not always OHKO Mega Latias, so Triple Axel is preferred. An Adamant nature compounds an extra boost to Weavile's offense at the cost of its great Speed tier, notably not being able to outspeed Serperior, Mega Diancie, and Greninja. Life Orb is seen on hyper offense builds to boost Weavile's damage to truly devastating levels, notably being able to OHKO Corviknight with a boosted Triple Axel. However, entry hazard damage caused by the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots combined with Life Orb recoil greatly reduces Weavile's longevity. Since hyper offense playstyles focus on breaking down the opponent's team quickly, this lack of longevity is less noticeable for a comparatively huge damage boost. Alternatively, Wide Lens boosts the accuracy of Weavile's notoriously unreliable Triple Axel, but the greatly reduced longevity and lack of damage boost makes this option less ideal as well. While Low Kick helps to break past Ferrothorn and Melmetal, the loss of a valuable moveslot is often not worth it. Icium Z is an interesting option for a consistently powerful attack to break past certain targets like Ferrothorn and Corviknight while also bypassing the unreliability of Triple Axel; however, as with many of the other items, the lack of longevity makes it hard to fit. Darkinium Z also provides a high-power move that allows Weavile to potentially break through its checks, but this comes at the cost of the incredible utility of Knock Off. Groundium Z with Dig allows Weavile to bait in and KO Toxapex and Heatran, but the opportunity cost of dropping Ice Shard makes this hard to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to Weavile's frailty, faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko can outspeed it and threaten an OHKO with their STAB moves. Additionally, strong priority moves such as Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Greninja's Water Shuriken, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide will all deal heavy damage to Weavile and should be avoided at all times.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Melmetal all take minimal damage from Weavile and threaten to OHKO it in return. Mega Scizor deserves special mention, as it is an extremely consistent counter due to its longevity through Roost.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini, though they dislike the loss of their item, can switch into Weavile repeatedly over the course of the match and threaten it back with Scald burns or an OHKO after Stealth Rock in Tapu Fini's case. Toxapex and Alomomola can also remain healthy to continually check Weavile courtesy of Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Contact-related Effects: Because Triple Axel makes contact three separate times, Weavile does not appreciate adverse contact effects like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Corviknight and Flame Body from Volcarona. The chip damage and status effects garnered up from these items and abilities make Weavile more susceptible to getting revenge killed and more easily dealt with defensively.</p> ",

Triple Axel threatens to OHKO common offensive Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Latias, and Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off helps Weavile cripple its defensive answers such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while hitting offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Aegislash rather hard. Additionally, Pursuit allows Weavile to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Gengar. Offensive Pokemon that Weavile forces out are also good Pursuit targets, such as Mega Medicham, Serperior, and Mega Charizard Y.

However, Weavile's lack of immediate power allows offensive threats such as Mega Mawile and Urshifu-R to switch in freely while additionally losing out on the ability to Pursuit trap susceptible foes. Triple Axel is the preferred Ice-type option due to its power, notably doing significantly more damage to Clefable and Corviknight, whereas Icicle Crash is more accurate, does not make contact, and has a handy flinch chance at the cost of a significant power drop.

Magnezone is an excellent pairing for Weavile due to its ability to trap Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn which Weavile might have trouble breaking through, as well as providing a strong Volt Switch which can potentially allow Weavile a free switch-in. Due to its potency as a late-game cleaner, Weavile appreciates being paired up with powerful wallbreakers like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile which can help it sweep after overwhelming shared checks like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran which can provide support in the form of entry hazards make Weavile's job against Pokemon like Corviknight and Melmetal much easier. Furthermore, these Pokemon help to defensively check Pokemon that might try to revenge kill Weavile, such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.

Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex not only address Magnezone's high vulnerability to fast, strong offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, but also benefit from it trapping Ferrothorn. Magnezone is also vulnerable to Ground-type Pokemon when locked into Thunderbolt or Volt Switch, so sturdy Ground-resistant or immune teammates such as Tangrowth, Gliscor, and Landorus-T are good to have.

With a Choice Scarf, Magnezone can also revenge kill threats such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele, which would otherwise be able to outspeed and KO it. However, due to its low Speed even with Choice Scarf, Magnezone mandates secondary revenge killing which can make teambuilding with it harder. Magnezone also often needs a Steel-type teammate, adding more overlap and stacking weaknesses, as it's too frail to have the defensive properties most Steel-types have. Volt Switch lets it maintain momentum while escaping unfortunate situations, as well as chipping down Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal, which Magnezone can’t consistently trap and remove. Hidden Power Fire lets it OHKO Kartana and beat Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Steel Beam dents common checks such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon, and it can KO Magnezone to safely bring in a check for more offensive pressure. Alternatively, Flash Cannon is a relatively spammable Steel-type STAB move, which allows it to pressure the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele better, although it means Magnezone is walled by Gliscor and Pokemon like Mega Latias that can easily recover off the damage dealt. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive a unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone can fit on a variety of teams from balance to offense teams due to its unique trapping capability. The likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Lopunny, and Kyurem appreciate it removing Steel-types such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for them, with the former two also functioning as proper revenge killers, which Magnezone is too slow to do. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Fini appreciate it removing Kartana. Landorus-T is an amazing partner for Magnezone, luring in and pivoting out of Corviknight and Skarmory to consistently trap them with Magnezone, and the pair form a potent VoltTurn core. Landorus-T can also pivot into and out of Kartana for Magnezone to safely trap it. Other Steel-types such as Corviknight and Mega Scizor also are solid partners, as they provide the defensive Steel-type utility that Magnezone is unable to, such as checking the likes of Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Weavile. Ground-immune and resistant Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Gliscor are needed alongside Magnezone due to its 4x Ground weakness. Lastly, Knock Off users such as Landorus-T, Weavile, and Clefable can assist Magnezone in trapping Corviknight and Skarmory, luring them in and removing Shed Shell if they run it.</p> "

A set utilizing Infestation and Worry Seed can trap Gliscor and remove its Poison Heal. This also allows Tangrowth to more easily run Hidden Power Fire. Earthquake can be used over Sleep Powder to surprise Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone on the switch while allowing Tangrowth to more effectively check Excadrill. Stun Spore can also be used to push paralysis onto threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Corviknight. Rock Slide can be used over Sleep Powder, as it nails Mega Charizard Y, Moltres, and Volcarona as they switch in, but Tangrowth's other moves tend to be more consistently useful. Focus Blast is a niche option in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice to hit both Kartana and Ground-type Pokemon at the same time, but it has no use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard Y easily breaks through Tangrowth and takes minimal damage from anything bar the extremely rare Rock Slide. Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Victini, and Moltres are threatening as well, but the latter three dislike Knock Off, and the former three have to be careful to not blunder into an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Zapdos, Hawlucha, Corviknight, and Flyinium Z Landorus-T all force out Tangrowth, either getting a free setup opportunity or gaining momentum. However, Landorus-T can't switch in due to fearing Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage: Weavile and Kyurem are capable of busting through Tangrowth with their powerful STAB moves, although Weavile will take heavy damage due to Rocky Helmet if it uses Triple Axel on Tangrowth, and neither wants to eat Knock Off. Ice-type coverage from Slowbro and Mega Latias can also prove problematic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Tangrowth's meager special bulk means that strong special attackers such as Mega Latios, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele can all break through it with relative ease, although they must watch out for Sleep Powder and coverage moves, and they should confirm that the Tangrowth is not a rarer Assault Vest variant. The lack of special bulk also leaves Tangrowth wide open to Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro and Slowking, which can prevent it from effectively dealing with physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur completely walls Tangrowth and can threaten it with Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss doesn't love taking Knock Off but also effortlessly forces out Tangrowth.

It also has access to useful utility moves such as Sleep Powder and Knock Off, which can punish Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Kyurem that would switch in rather freely otherwise. Unfortunately, Tangrowth doesn't effectively deal with some very common physical attackers, such as Victini, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, and its terrible special bulk leaves it open to threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Life Orb Clefable, and Heatran. A lack of reliable recovery also leaves it open to very powerful physical wallbreakers such as Dragonium Z Garchomp, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran and Zapdos. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred coverage move, dealing big damage to Landorus-T and Garchomp while also working together with Giga Drain to force Gliscor to spam Roost in order to avoid fainting. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, however, to force immediate damage onto Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana, but losing pressure on the aforementioned Ground-types is very detrimental. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to put a foe out of commission completely, therefore giving a teammate a free switch in and punishing a threat such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, or Clefable. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Kartana, therefore making it less passive overall. A Relaxed nature is preferred, as Tangrowth uses both of its attacking stats and its Speed is already very low.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on balance teams that need a very sturdy check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Rillaboom. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate Tangrowth taking on Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Mega Swampert. They are capable of blocking Volt Switch from the likes of Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as Tangrowth is not a suitable check to any of these on its own. Examples such as Garchomp and Gliscor work well to check the aforementioned while also switching into Heatran. These Ground-types can also can set Stealth Rock, which is important for Tangrowth, as it allows its team to better pressure dangerous Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Heatran. Tangrowth's special bulk is meager, so having a very bulky specially defensive wall is recommended. Specially defensive Heatran pairs well with Tangrowth, as it can take on threats such as Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. Mega Tyranitar can also help Tangrowth out against Heatran, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias. Slowking can deal with threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Tapu Fini also pairs well with Tangrowth due to it taking care of Ash-Greninja as well as Heatran, while Blissey can also act as a general sponge to Ash-Greninja, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. These teammates appreciate Tangrowth taking care of dangerous physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Rillaboom. Tangrowth needs good entry hazard removal on its side, as hazard damage can put it in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Weavile and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. Zapdos, Tapu Fini, and Excadrill are all potentially good partners as a result. Additional checks to physical attackers Tangrowth can't deal with are also beneficial; Toxapex or Melmetal can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight can work with a revenge killer that can finish off Ground-types, such as Weavile or Ash-Greninja, to deal with Swords Dance variants of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Teammates like Swords Dance Garchomp and Mega Mawile appreciate Sleep Powder giving them a setup opportunity.</p> "

However, Tangrowth is extremely susceptible to getting worn down by entry hazards and status and is generally passive. Physical attackers can overload it given its lack of Defense investment, and it's extremely reliant on its Assault Vest to handle special attackers, so taking Knock Off means it struggles to check anything. Tangrowth also faces major competition from the likes of Amoonguss, which boasts an additional Poison typing, can run a passive recovery item, and has additional utility in Clear Smog. However, Tangrowth still has a solid niche over it due to checking Ground-type threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, as well as having its own great support move in Knock Off. Giga Drain provides additional recovery and reliability, while Power Whip allows Tangrowth to consistently check Calm Mind Tapu Fini and pressure Mega Tyranitar more. Knock Off lets it consistently make progress on switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Heatran, vastly reducing their longevity and effectiveness. Sludge Bomb pressures opposing Grass-types, such as Rillaboom and Serperior, while also threatening to poison Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos. Earthquake denies Heatran a free switch in, threatening a KO on offensive variants after Stealth Rock, while also solidly damaging Electric-types like Magnezone and Tapu Koko. Hidden Power Ice lets Tangrowth soft check Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T and Gliscor. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Fire lets it soft check Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.

In return, they cover the Fire- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Weavile and Volcarona directed at it. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Tyranitar threaten Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Corviknight for it. Despite Tangrowth's Assault Vest, Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulses can still easily overwhelm it, so Dark-resistant teammates such as Clefable and Tapu Koko are solid partners. Solid entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini is a great asset given Tangrowth's frequent pivoting.</p> "

Psychic pressures common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Kommo-o, Garchomp, and Tapu Fini, as well as being a strong spammable STAB move. Future Sight is a support option that, in conjunction with U-turn, boosts teammates' wallbreaking capabilities but lowers Victini's immediate offensive presence. Bolt Strike hits bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini much harder while still pressuring specially defensive Toxapex, although it means Victini can't pressure the likes of Garchomp and Kommo-o consistently. Toxic allows it to check the likes of Mega Latias, prevents Pokemon such as Volcarona from setting up on Blue Flare variants, and punishes switch-ins like Slowbro and Slowking. Encore discourages Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Latias from trying to set up on it. This can make Pursuit trapping Mega Latias much easier due to Weavile and Tyranitar not needing to fear Aura Sphere. If running V-create or Bolt Strike, a Jolly or Hasty nature with Attack investment should be used instead of Timid to bolster its damage output. A bulkier spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Rillaboom and maximize bulk to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Latias better, although it loses out on outspeeding crucial threats like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Victini works best on offense teams that appreciate its compressed defensive capabilities in checking the likes of Mega Latias and Tapu Lele, as well as the offensive pressure it brings to the table. Partners like Toxapex and Kommo-o work well with it as they appreciate Victini checking these threats. Strong wallbreakers that struggle to get onto the field such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Mega Medicham appreciate it wearing down checks like Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias with Toxic, as well as giving them more entry opportunities with U-turn and Encore. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Koko can deal with Dark-type Pokemon that pressure Victini such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Water-resistant partners such as Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth work extremely well because Victini is often pressured by Water-types like Greninja, Manaphy, and Mega Swampert. In return, Victini deals with the Fire- and Grass-types that pressure these Pokemon, such as Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and Volcarona. Similarly, Ground-types like Gastrodon, Gliscor, and Garchomp threaten Victini as well, so the likes of Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem form a strong offensive core with it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Victini compresses speed control and a way to check several dangerous offensive threats in Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y, along with crippling the opposition thanks to Trick and Final Gambit or pummeling them with strong V-creates. U-turn makes Victini a great scout and momentum grabber, taking advantage of forced switches to bring its teammates in unscathed. Trick is a great way to cripple walls like Slowbro, Heatran, and Toxapex, forcing them to lose momentum every time they come in. Final Gambit can eliminate a defensive target entirely, as well as getting a teammate in freely, though this comes at the cost of Victini itself. Therefore, use it with caution if there's another threat Victini wants to check. Maximum HP investment allows Victini to make the most of its Final Gambit while improving its overall bulk to let it check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham better.</p> <p>Victini fits on offensively geared teams, with hyper offensive teams in particular enjoying its ability to sacrifice itself to take out a defensive Pokemon they may not be able to break through. Therefore, hyper offensive staples like Rillaboom, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Garchomp make excellent partners. Suicide lead variants of Landorus-T can aid Victini in this role by setting up Stealth Rock and exploding on key defensive targets like Zapdos. This in conjunction with Victini's Final Gambit can often mean that the remaining teammates can clean up very easily. Bulkier offense archetypes enjoy Victini's defensive utility, as its ability to pivot in on huge threats like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham is often a godsend for them. Victini likes to get in unharmed so it can take advantage of its bulk as best as possible, so pivots like Corviknight, Blissey, and Slowbro make good teammates. Similarly, Defoggers like Zapdos and the aforementioned Corviknight make excellent partners because they can remove Stealth Rock, which often hinders Victini's defensive utility. Pokemon that appreciate Victini crippling or KOing Pokemon like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Slowbro, such as Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Gliscor, make fantastic partners. Victini can struggle with sturdy Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T that can tank its V-creates decently while wearing it down with Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin, so Pokemon like Weavile, Kyurem, and Ash-Greninja are good choices to deal with them. These three also appreciate Victini's ability to bait in these Ground-types and U-turn on them.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Steelium Z is a niche option that can push more damage onto Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Gliscor, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Landorus-T, but these targets can be pressured by Normalium Z anyway while also causing headaches for Zapdos and Rotom-W. Air Balloon reverses the matchup against Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, these matchups aren't worth being stonewalled by Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. A specially defensive set can be used to check a myriad of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele while providing Rapid Spin, but it is easy to wear down and overwhelm. On the Stealth Rock Lead set, Steel Beam may seem like a nice option over Rock Tomb to perform more as a suicide lead, but due to it needing Excadrill to be at a lower HP to effectively work, it is rather undesirable, and it still struggles to keep Stealth Rock up versus Corviknight. Toxic is another option that can cripple bulky switch-ins like Tangrowth and Zapdos, but both it and Steel Beam come at the cost of losing Rock Tomb, which opens up a lot of faster Pokemon to be less threatened by Excadrill.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Corviknight, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y are immune to Excadrill's Earthquake and take its Iron Head decently well, while they can all retaliate with super effective coverage. Mega Charizard Y can also remove potential sand, causing Excadrill to be slower than it. However, the former must be wary of Substitute variants if it lacks Body Press, and the latter two are shattered by +2 Normalium Z.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: When unboosted by sand or Rapid Spin, Excadrill sits are at a poor Speed tier. As a result, faster Pokemon like Garchomp, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny are capable of revenge killing it. Ash-Greninja in particular has a powerful Water Shuriken to dispatch of Excadrill even when its boosted. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Excadrill directly and cannot beat it if its Speed is boosted.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Physically defensive Tangrowth is incredibly difficult for Excadrill to break if it has used its Z-Move, and Tangrowth can wear Excadrill down with Rocky Helmet and Giga Drain or neutralize it with Sleep Powder. However, Tangrowth can be crippled by Toxic long-term. Rillaboom, while unable to switch in directly, deals heavy damage to Excadrill with a priority Grassy Glide. Even if Rillaboom is taken out, Excadrill may have to contend with Grassy Terrain weakening its Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exploiting Focus Sash: Fake Out users like Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny are able to break Excadrill's Focus Sash without Excadrill being able to do anything and can immediately OHKO it in the following turn. Water Shuriken from Greninja can be troublesome, as it lets Greninja transform into Ash-Greninja and it denies Stealth Rock, provided it gets enough hits. On a similar note, Weavile's Triple Axel bypasses Focus Sash and KOes Excadrill before it can do anything.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Excadrill is a cornerstone on sand teams, serving as a capable wallbreaker and sweeper for the archetype thanks to its high Attack, access to Swords Dance, and doubled Speed under sand. Additionally, its solid bulk and fantastic defensive typing give it many opportunities to set up against the likes of Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko. Swords Dance alongside a Z-Move lets Excadrill clean up weakened defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini. Giga Impact gives it access to Breakneck Blitz, allowing Excadrill to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos as well as chipped Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Rapid Spin can be used if Excadrill's team can't fit Defog elsewhere and gives Excadrill the ability to limit Stealth Rock Clefable, patch up its Speed without the need for sand, and remove entry hazards for Pokemon weak to them like Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to wear down Slowbro, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, especially alongside sand damage. Substitute is an option to use non-Body Press Corviknight as setup fodder. Leftovers allows for Excadrill to take advantage of its solid defensive typing, giving it easier setup on Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Koko. However, forgoing Normalium Z can be detrimental against teams carrying Slowbro, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Jolly is the preferred nature to Speed tie with opposing Excadrill, but if adequate Excadrill counterplay is on your team, Adamant can be used for its higher power, which is notable for dispatching Slowbro and Tangrowth a bit easier.</p> <p>Excadrill necessitates sand to function properly, so either Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar are mandatory alongside it. Mega Tyranitar is also a great Stealth Rock setter, chipping Excadrill's answers into the range of its attacks. Both Tyranitar formes are also notable for being able to beat Zapdos one-on-one for Excadrill and having Pursuit to cripple Mega Latias. Corviknight effortlessly walls Excadrill, so teammates that can deal with it, such as Zapdos and Magnezone, make excellent teammates. Both are also notable for tearing open physically defensive Tangrowth, which would otherwise halt Excadrill's sweep. Swords Dance and Choice Band Kartana sets are also capable of forcing damage onto Corviknight and Zapdos, causing them to falter at checking Excadrill. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny can exploit Excadrill's mediocre Speed outside of sand, with Ash-Greninja revenge killing it even under sand with Water Shuriken, so partners such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight are needed to help remedy this issue. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are notable partners for their ability to set Spikes, allowing Excadrill to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise check it like Tangrowth. Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus are solid partners for Excadrill, as they appreciate Excadrill dismantling Steel-types that can halt their sweep. They also provide a solid defensive backbone which Excadrill can fall back on once sand has run out.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Lead Excadrill serves as an important member on hyper offense teams to set up Stealth Rock, as well as keep opposing entry hazards off the field for Pokemon like Volcarona and Gyarados. Adding onto the fact that there are not many Electric-type immunities featured on hyper offense, Excadrill's inclusion is all the more important. However, even with this advantage, it still finds itself outclassed by Mew and Landorus-T due to it being unable to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Tapu Fini from using Defog and it not having a good defensive typing like the other two do. Setting up Stealth Rock is Excadrill's main role, and when paired with Mold Breaker, it can even set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Mold Breaker also lets Excadrill's Earthquake hit Levitate users like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Mega Latias, letting Excadrill not be complete setup fodder against them. Rapid Spin defines Excadrill's niche over other entry hazard leads like Landorus-T and Mew, letting it keep hazards off the field before it gets KOed. Rock Tomb can slow down faster Stealth Rock users like Garchomp and Landorus-T so that Excadrill can use Rapid Spin before they KO it. It can also slow down setup Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Excadrill like Mega Gyarados and Thundurus-T. Focus Sash is chosen as the item so that Excadrill is usually able to get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed.</p> <p>Lead Excadrill exclusively fits on hyper offense teams and, as such, has teammates that are commonly found there. Pokemon that appreciate Excadrill's ability to keep entry hazards off the field such as Gyarados and non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants of Volcarona, Weavile, and Thundurus-T serve as great teammates to pair with it. Excadrill can also function on Sticky Web teams to provide Stealth Rock when the Sticky Web setter is Ribombee while also giving the team a form of entry hazard removal, which Shuckle cannot do. Additionally, due to the nature of hyper offense being rather slow at first, Tapu Koko is especially threatening to the archetype, making Excadrill an important teammate because it resists or is immune to both of Tapu Koko's STAB moves. Pokemon like Weavile and Greninja who have multi-hit moves are also invited in by Excadrill, so it appreciates partners like Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, and Kommo-o that can pivot into these Pokemon.</p> "

Focus Blast complements Psyshock nicely, demolishing Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Fightinium Z avoids the risk of missing Focus Blast on Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Taunt Heatran. Alternatively, Stored Power can be utilized alongside Thunder to have a better matchup against stall, as Mega Sableye cannot take a boosted Thunder and Unaware users falter to Stored Power's scaling Base Power. Thunder alongside Electrium Z nails Slowking and Toxapex. Thunder is also able to spread paralysis, but it does not hit Dark-types, which leaves Reuniclus more vulnerable to Pursuit. Magic Guard gives Reuniclus an immunity to entry hazards and sand, making it very difficult to wear down and a great switch-in to Toxapex. 44 Speed allows Reuniclus to outspeed and beat Haze Toxapex.

Defiant allows Bisharp to punish Corviknight and Zapdos's Defog attempts, though Bisharp should watch out for Body Press and Heat Wave, respectively. This dissuades the opposing team from using Defog altogether, which lends Bisharp a very useful niche seeing as keeping entry hazards up is integral to enabling dangerous teammates on hyper offense. Defiant also makes Bisharp a physical attacker that Landorus-T cannot check, as Intimidate will raise Bisharp's Attack instead of lowering it. Fellow Defiant user Galarian Zapdos can fulfill a similar role, but it is held back by its inability to deal with Zapdos. However, Bisharp is both frail and weak to common attacking types, meaning that it cannot reliably switch into much. Additionally, Bisharp heavily relies on Sucker Punch against faster foes, which can be played around. A Jolly nature is preferred to Adamant, as it allows Bisharp to outspeed Heatran, Gliscor, and Zapdos, although the former is not a problem with Sticky Web support. Life Orb notably lets Bisharp OHKO Landorus-T on the switch and OHKO Weavile with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from a teammate like Landorus-T, Mew, or Shuckle is integral to making the most of Bisharp, as the threat of giving Bisharp a Defiant boost with Defog will often prevent your opponent from using it outright until Bisharp has been dealt with. Entry hazard support also allows Bisharp to pick up OHKOs with a boosted Sucker Punch that it would not net without other chip damage, such as on Garchomp and Weavile. Teammates that can take advantage of physical walls like Mega Scizor, Hippowdon, and Toxapex make great partners, such as Mega Charizard X, Tapu Lele, and Serperior. Also, teammates that can weaken or remove Tangrowth, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Hippowdon for Bisharp to break through them are great, including Mega Mawile, Mega Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X. Mega Mawile can also take advantage of Bisharp luring in Kommo-o. Teammates that can lure in Pokemon that Bisharp can set up on are also vital, which includes Mega Pinsir and Hawlucha luring in Slowbro, and Serperior luring in Blissey. Also, Bisharp is especially threatening on Sticky Web teams, as it not only deters the removal of Sticky Web, but also takes advantage of its Speed reduction to outspeed otherwise faster offensive threats, such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem. Teammates that pair well with Bisharp on Sticky Web teams include the aforementioned Mega Scizor, Kommo-o, and Mega Pinsir.</p> "

This pairs nicely with Pressure and Roost, allowing it to effectively PP stall these targets. Freeze-Dry has high PP and super effectively hit Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini that'd resist its other Ice-type STAB options, and Earth Power covers the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Freeze-Dry like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Victini. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes so that Seismic Toss from Blissey and Chansey can't break it in one hit.</p> <p>Fast pivots with U-turn like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Greninja make excellent teammates to Kyurem by baiting in bulky passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Chansey and giving Kyurem a free switch to set up Substitute. If Kyurem can't safely get a Substitute up, it is fairly vulnerable to Pokemon like Clefable, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight that can eat hits from it and break its Substitute. As a result, Kyurem greatly appreciates having teammates like Magnezone and Heatran that can deal with the Steel- and Fairy-types that can threaten it. Magnezone is notable due to its ability to completely trap and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. Because of Kyurem's lack of immediate power, it's also very much setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus, so Pokemon that can stop these setup sweepers make for good teammates. Crippling them with a status move like Toxic or Thunder Wave works well, so Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex can be useful, Toxapex can also remove boosts from Reuniclus and Clefable, which are not crippled by status too heavily. If you choose to not run Heavy-Duty Boots, hazards are also a massive threat to Kyurem, so it should always be paired with a reliable Defogger like Zapdos, Corviknight, or Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> "

The last slot can be either Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, both of which hit Steel-types. Earth Power is better for Heatran, but Hidden Power Fire is better against Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, at the cost of being less reliable against other Steel-types. Focus Blast is an option to hit Steel-types as well as Blissey, but Blissey does not get 2HKOed unless Kyurem is running a Modest nature, and it is less reliable than the other options.</p> <p>Because of Kyurem being able to fire off such powerful attacks, it really likes having faster teammates that can clean up late-game. Mega Lopunny, Greninja, and Jirachi can all clean up games quite easily once Kyurem has punched a few holes in the opposing team's defensive core. Due to its subpar Speed stat, notable threats such as Victini, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko naturally outspeed and OHKO or deal a lot of damage to Kyurem.

Because of this, you want to pair Kyurem up with Pokemon that can punish opposing pivots. Tyranitar and Weavile can Pursuit trap some of the more physically frail answers to Kyurem, like Blissey, Corviknight, and Reuniclus. Furthermore, offensive entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Heatran can help weaken Pokemon switching in against Kyurem and allow it to achieve 2HKOs that it couldn't before. Kyurem itself is very weak to hazards, so you should always run it with a good Defogger like Corviknight or Zapdos. Tapu Fini is also an option, but it should only be paired with Kyurem if it elects not to run any Dragon-type attacks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Belly Drum Kommo-o is a threating sweeper that can clean weakened teams or break holes through teams early-game once boosted. Kommo-o also functions as a soft Greninja and Heatran check on hyper offense teams, although it does have to be careful with its health. However, Kommo-o is extremely reliant on Belly Drum to do significant damage and requires its Salac Berry to be eaten to actually sweep teams due to its low Speed stat. Furthermore, due to how low Kommo-o is left after setting up, it can often be easily killed by a myriad of faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Hawlucha, as well as priority from the likes of Rillaboom and Mega Scizor. Substitute allows Kommo-o to setup safely on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and avoid status such as Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp, Toxapex's Toxic, and Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, as well as protecting Kommo-o from attempts to revenge kill it. The combined HP lost from Substitute and Belly Drum allow Kommo-o to instantly activate its Salac Berry. Drain Punch is used over other stronger options like Close Combat because the damage increase isn't needed, and it allows Kommo-o to recover the health lost from setting up. Thunder Punch provides solid coverage alongside Drain Punch, letting Kommo-o nail common Fighting- resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Clefable. The given EV spread allows Kommo-o to always consume its Salac Berry after Substitute and Belly Drum. If Kommo-o is being used alongside dual screens, it can run 52 HP EVs to avoid having its Substitute broken by Magnezone's Flash Cannon under Light Screen. Bulletproof is the chosen ability to let Kommo-o setup on the likes of Gyro Ball Ferrothorn, as well as Shadow Ball from Gengar and Blacephalon.</p> <p>Belly Drum Kommo-o only fits on hyper offense teams due to its one-time setup nature. Dual screens setters such as Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl are beneficial, as the extra bulk provided gives significantly more setup opportunities for Kommo-o. Tapu Koko in particular is also a solid teammate, as Electric Terrain boosts the damage of Kommo-o's Thunder Punch, letting it score KOs on Pokemon like Clefable, Reuniclus, and Victini when it normally wouldn't. Due to Kommo-o's susceptibility to getting revenge killed by faster threats, Shuckle is a solid partner that can set up Sticky Web for it to outspeed those threats. Hawlucha and Mega Garchomp are exemplary partners for Kommo-o, as they both pressure their shared checks in Landorus-T, Clefable, and Zapdos. Mega Gyarados, Serperior, and Manaphy are stellar partners due to them being able to lure and break Unaware Quagsire and Clefable, which otherwise stonewall Kommo-o. Lastly, Pokemon that can wear down or break Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Gyarados, and Volcarona are good partners.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a very niche option that covers both Ferrothorn and Excadrill. However, it sacrifices Hidden Power Ice, drastically worsening the matchup against Gliscor. On hyper offense teams, Tapu Koko could run a dual screens set with Light Clay and Taunt that can also enable Hawlucha, but the superior dual screens setter in Grimmsnarl can do the same in conjunction with Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain support.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Opposing teams having a Ground-type can really deter Tapu Koko's progress-making by forcing a lot of mind games between Hidden Power Ice and Volt Switch. Some of the more common Ground-types in the tier like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor must be wary of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, but the Ground-types that aren't weak to Ice, like Gastrodon and Excadrill, completely wall Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and the rare Assault Vest Tangrowth resist Tapu Koko's main STAB type and are bulky enough to stomach Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice relatively easily as well. Amoonguss and Tangrowth are particularly pesky, capable of neutralizing Tapu Koko's progress with Volt Switch due to Regenerator. Although not able to switch in safely, Rillaboom can check Tapu Koko in a pinch as well, owing to its resistance to Electric-type attacks and access to strong priority. However, barring Amoonguss and Tangrowth, none of these Grass-types can maintain a positive or even neutral momentum trade against Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Walls: Blissey and Chansey sport tremendous special bulk, which allows them to hold Tapu Koko off for a while. However, they can be overwhelmed with Volt Switch in the long run quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon While Tapu Koko is very fast, there are still Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja. Additionally Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Victini, and Jirachi all outspeed it and can threaten it out with STAB moves. Priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Weaville, and Ash-Greninja can threaten to knock out a previously weakened Tapu Koko as well.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Because of its stellar Speed, good offensive prowess, and access to a strong Volt Switch, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. It has a relatively poor Special Attack stat, but its ability to summon Electric Terrain in tandem with the use of a Choice Specs makes up for that. Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit the Ground-types that are immune to its Electric-type moves like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon. This is incredibly important; a well-timed Hidden Power Ice will cleanly OHKO the former two Ground-types and force the latter two out, and the resulting mind games drastically improve Tapu Koko's ability to generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch lets Tapu Koko scout the opponent and gain free momentum once the opponent's Ground-type has been removed. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Koko a good neutral option against Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt but aren't very threatened by Hidden Power, like opposing Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Alternatively, it can run Roost to improve its longevity in more drawn-out games against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. However, Roost forces Tapu Koko to switch out, thereby losing momentum. Grass Knot is another option that lends Tapu Koko the ability to pressure Gastrodon and Mega Swampert much harder, but it is inferior to Dazzling Gleam otherwise.</p> <p>Due to its role as a fast pivot that can generally keep up momentum well, Tapu Koko fits very well on more offensive teams, but it's a fine fit on balanced teams as well. Tapu Koko pairs particularly well with teammates that can bait in Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Such teammates include the likes of Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor. Moreover, all of these partners bar Heatran are capable of creating pivoting cores with Tapu Koko courtesy of their access to U-turn, with Greninja and Ash-Greninja amplifying progress made through pivoting with Spikes as well. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Ash-Greninja, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Kyurem can easily pressure most of the metagame's Ground-types, including the ones that are particularly annoying for Tapu Koko such as Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill. On the other hand, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran take advantage of Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which can otherwise keep Tapu Koko at bay for extended amounts of time. Due to Tapu Koko's tendency to force plenty of switches and rack up damage with Volt Switch, good entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Heatran, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja make for good teammates that can greatly speed up the rate at which Tapu Koko can break teams down. Tapu Koko also likes having strong physical wallbreakers on its side to deal with the more specially defensive Pokemon that check it such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha make for great teammates to pressure these special walls, with the latter two also having great synergy with Electric Terrain. Lastly, as Tapu Koko is quite frail and prone to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Ash-Greninja as a result, it appreciates a defensive backbone that can sponge up hits from these threats. On bulky offense teams, Pokemon such as bulky Landorus-T, Slowbro, Corviknight, and Blissey can provide said backbone while also maintaining momentum with their pivoting moves. On balanced teams, the likes of Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight can fulfill the same objective.</p> "

Due to Tapu Fini being weak to Electric- and Grass-type moves, Pokemon that can take these attacks such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Mega Latias are solid teammates. In return, Tapu Fini takes the Ice- and Fire-type attacks directed at them. Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor that appreciate its reliable Defogging are also good partners.

The one teamstyle Xurkitree can function somewhat decently on is Sticky Web hyper offense, as it outruns most of the metagame after Sticky Web. Unfortunately, Xurkitree has to compete with other, better sweepers that fit on this teamstyle; most notably, Thundurus-T has far better coverage, outruns Landorus-T, has a better defensive typing, and can viably run Z-Moves, therefore making it more powerful and threatening. Additionally, Xurkitree is rather frail, making it vulnerable to priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile. Faster Pokemon that ignore Sticky Web also present issues, with Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Hydreigon as well as Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Zeraora, Victini, and Tapu Koko all fitting the bill. Xurkitree should therefore almost never be run on any serious competitive team.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice allows Xurkitree to blast through Garchomp and Gliscor while also hitting Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth.

Shuca Berry allows Xurkitree to beat Landorus-T in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice, as Landorus-T is not affected by Sticky Webs and always beats this set otherwise. It also allows Xurkitree to set up on other Ground-types if necessary. Shuckle can set up Sticky Webs and Stealth Rock to support Xurkitree's sweep, and a Defiant user such as Bisharp or Contrary Serperior can help keep the entry hazards up by dissuading and punishing Defog attempts. Other Sticky Web attackers such as Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, Kommo-o, and Thundurus-T are useful teammates.

However, Melmetal has a terrible Speed tier, requiring a lot of investment to even outspeed slow threats, which can cut into its bulk. Its special bulk is also quite mediocre, and in conjunction with its lack of recovery, this leaves Melmetal easily worn down. Melmetal’s STAB typing is also lackluster, meaning it is relatively easy to pivot into by a majority of the tier. Thunder Punch allows Melmetal to nail Water- and Flying-types that can switch into Double Iron Bash, such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Slowbro.

Due to Melmetal’s lack of reliable recovery, Grassy Terrain support from the likes of Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu is greatly appreciated, and in return, they both pressure Flying-types such as Corviknight and Zapdos to aid Melmetal in wallbreaking. Grassy Terrain also weakens opposing Earthquakes, allowing Melmetal to stay in and pressure Ground-types better. Strong entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Clefable, and Landorus-T augments Melmetal's ability to pressure opposing teams, as the constant chip damage quickly wears down its checks that try to pivot around it.

Calm Mind Clefable, Mega Latias and Mega Mawile appreciate Corviknight PP stalling opposing Calm Mind Clefable and Heatran. Strong hazard support such as Spikes Greninja, Toxic Spikes Toxapex, and Stealth Rock Clefable are all formidable allies, as the entry hazards they set up wear down switch-ins to Corviknight such as Tapu Koko and Heatran, and Corviknight is able to Pressure stall Defog from opposing Corviknight in return, letting their hazards stay on the field. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Skarmory and Zapdos, partners that can eliminate them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p> "

However, Dracozolt is very vulnerable to being worn down quickly through entry hazards, Substitute damage, and Life Orb recoil. Substitute allows Dracozolt to take advantage of the many switches it forces on Pokemon like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. Most neutral targets do not want to take a highly powerful Bolt Beak, allowing Dracozolt to set up a Substitute on Blissey, Heatran, and Zapdos. Fire Blast hits the Grass-types that resist Bolt Beak, which includes Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Kartana. Draco Meteor hits Garchomp, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon, all of which can take Bolt Beak. The given EV spread coupled with a Naughty nature allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T while sand is active and OHKO Tangrowth with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Due to Dracozolt's reliance on sand to pose a major threat, it requires sand support from Hippowdon or Tyranitar. Additonally, Dracozolt's ability to threaten Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory enables fellow Sand Rush sweeper Excadrill to wreak havoc. Dracozolt's susceptibilty to Ground-types such as Gliscor and Gastrodon mean that sturdy Ground-immune or -resistant partners are essential, which includes Corviknight, Mega Latias, and Tangrowth. Dracozolt is very susceptible to being chipped down by entry hazards on top of Substitute and Life Orb recoil. As such, entry hazard removal from teammates like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Excadrill are needed.</p> "

An Adamant nature can be used over Naive in order to boost the power of its Bolt Beak and Low Kick; however, it loses its ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Tyranitar and specially defensive Heatran without hail and Zeraora in hail.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Mega Scizor can all take hits from Arctozolt and wear it down with their attacks. However, Ferrothorn cannot switch into Low Kick consistently, and Melmetal and Mega Scizor have to be wary of pivoting into Bolt Beak.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Arctozolt's Speed is very underwhelming when hail isn't active, so Pokemon such as Kartana, Heatran, and Mega Lopunny can revenge kill it fairly reliably. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Victini can revenge kill even in hail. Additionally, Arctozolt can be revenge killed by priority if it isn't behind a Substitute due to its middling bulk, so priority users such as Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Mega Lopunny can be troublesome for it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Pelipper and Tyranitar can change the weather and remove hail, making Arctozolt much less threatening as a result and causing it to be outsped by other weather sweepers such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill; however, neither Pelipper or Tyranitar want to switch into Arctozolt, as they can get KOed or take significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias: After a Calm Mind, Mega Latias can stall out Arctozolt's Blizzard with Roost, as well as stalling out Arctozolt's hail turns, as it cannot be 2HKOed after a Calm Mind.

However, Arctozolt suffers from being easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Victini, and Kartana due to its poor defensive typing, mediocre bulk, and Speed tier that's easily outsped, especially outside of hail. Freeze-Dry can be used over Blizzard in order to heavily damage and KO Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, which would otherwise take Blizzard and KO Arctozolt with their Ground-type STAB move; however, Blizzard is a more consistent and threatening move due to its high Base Power, making it superior otherwise. Low Kick allows Arctozolt to bypass would-be checks like Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Substitute is great for taking advantage of Pokemon that get forced out by Arctozolt, such as Toxapex, Garchomp, and Corviknight, while also easing prediction by blocking status and abilities such as Landorus-T's Intimidate, making Arctozolt harder to pivot around. However, Substitute drains Arctozolt's HP and can waste hail turns, making it situational to use. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item for Arctozolt, as it negates entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to wreak havoc against the opposing team regardless of if hazards are on the field; however, Leftovers is a good alternative, as it can keep Arctozolt healthy throughout a match, although it necessitates hazard control as a result.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an absolute necessity for Arctozolt, since it provides hail while also providing utility, such as setting up Aurora Veil to make it less prone to revenge killing and easier for it to switch in and overwhelm the foe. Alolan Ninetales can use Freeze-Dry to help with Arctozolt's Gastrodon and Mega Swampert matchup, allowing Arctozolt to free up Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales can also support it by locking the foe into a move with Encore, allowing Arctozolt to pivot in safely. Mega Diancie is also a great partner for Arctozolt, since it sets up Stealth Rock for Arctozolt to make it harder to switch into and pivot around, and Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce deflects the foe's entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to switch in multiple times and wreak havoc without the worry of taking hazard damage. If Arctozolt isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots, then Defoggers such as Corviknight are very useful for Arctozolt. Priority and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Rillaboom can be annoying for Arctozolt to handle, so checks to them such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Corviknight are great teammates for it. Pokemon that can bring Arctozolt in safely such as Landorus-T and Corviknight work as good teammates. Toxic support from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran can be useful for Arctozolt, as it can ease up its worst matchups in Gastrodon and Mega Latias.</p> "

Mega Mawile in particular is an exceptional check due to Intimidate before Mega Evolving, good bulk, resistance to both of Zarude's moves, and the power to OHKO even after Defense boosts, which allow it to switch in multiple times and force it out. Unaware Clefable stonewalls Zarude and can use it as setup fodder.

Bulk Up and its amazing Speed tier also make it hard to revenge kill. It outpaces many common threats such as Volcarona, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele, even if it's outsped by common revenge killers such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja. However, Zarude faces competition as an offensive Grass-type from Rillaboom, Kartana, and Serperior due to it lacking immediate power. Jungle Healing allows it to shrug off crippling status, like paralysis and Toxic, and recover any chip damage it has sustained from Scald burns; however, it isn't a reliable source of recovery long term. Darkinium Z allows it to nuke would-be checks such as Zapdos, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, and Darkest Lariat beats the likes of Iron Defense Skarmory and Corviknight by bypassing their Defense boosts. Power Whip is Zarude's strongest move, hitting Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. Furthermore, it lets Zarude hit neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tapu Lele much harder than Darkest Lariat.</p> <p>Zarude fits on bulkier balance teams, which can provide it with long-term support in the form of entry hazard stacking and other sweepers. Strong hazard support from the likes of Toxic Spikes Toxapex and Spikes Skarmory is extremely beneficial to wear down Zarude's checks in the long run, such as Tangrowth and Unaware Clefable. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja appreciate Zarude breaking down bulkier teams and help its struggles with faster-paced teams. Other setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable, Bulk Up Corviknight, and Mega Latias all appreciate Zarude weakening or KOing their checks, with Clefable especially enjoying it KOing Heatran and Mega Scizor. Zarude also needs sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon because they force it to switch out or waste its Z-Move, so partners such as Toxapex, Mega Latias, and Heatran are greatly appreciated. Lastly, Pokemon such as Corviknight and Skarmory that can switch into revenge killers that threaten Zarude, such as Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, Landorus-T, and Kartana, are required. Zarude’s typing gives it amazing defensive utility, allowing it to solidly check Ash-Greninja and switch into Slowbro and Slowking; however, Scald burns forcing it to use Jungle Healing can easily be taken advantage of. It can also reliably switch into Ground-types such as Gliscor and Garchomp and threaten them out. These defensive capabilities make it a good partner with the likes of Heatran, Gliscor, and Mega Diancie.</p> "
