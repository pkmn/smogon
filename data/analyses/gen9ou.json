        "description": "<p>Venusaur uses Chlorophyll and Growth to become a deadly sun sweeper. Venusaur is capable of sustaining itself long-term with Giga Drain, while Weather Ball vaporizes Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight and Grass-types like Meowscarada and Sinistcha. Its last move can be Sludge Bomb to melt Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon, as well as Moltres and Assault Vest Hatterene, or Earth Power to hit Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and Fire-types like Cinderace and Iron Moth. Its Tera type can be Fire to boost the power of Weather Ball even higher; a +2 Tera Fire Weather Ball 2HKOes Tera Poison Ting-Lu while having a high chance to 2HKO Blissey as well. Tera Ground, on the other hand, allows Venusaur to OHKO Raging Bolt unboosted and Galarian Slowking after a Growth.</p> <p>Since Venusaur requires sun to work, pair it with either Torkoal or Ninetales as sun setters. Torkoal has better bulk, Stealth Rock, and Rapid Spin, which can help in both softening the enemies and preventing Venusaur from taking unnecessary chip damage. In contrast, Ninetales has higher Speed, is stronger, has Encore, meaning it can both lock users into setup moves, entry hazards, or healing moves, allowing Venusaur to get a free entry, and can use Healing Wish to give it a second chance at sweeping. Venusaur can struggle against special walls like Blissey, Tera Poison Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking depending on its choice of coverage, and as such pairs incredibly well with Walking Wake. Its power lets it pressure these aforementioned walls and break through most defensive teams with ease, which can be used by Venusaur later on to clean, while Venusaur's greater Speed helps against offensive teams, switching into targets like Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant that would otherwise threaten Walking Wake. Another great breaker for sun teams is Roaring Moon, which helps Venusaur against checks like Galarian Slowking and Blissey and brings it in with U-turn. Great Tusk also helps against Venusaur's aforementioned bad matchups while also both setting Stealth Rock and using Rapid Spin to help in the hazard control department. In return, Venusaur can come in on threats like Primarina, Iron Valiant, and Ogerpon-W. Hatterene can also block hazards thanks to Magic Bounce, cripple fast Pokemon with Nuzzle, letting Venusaur outspeed them even when sun is over, and heal Venusaur thanks to Healing Wish.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging its passable bulk, amazing typing, solid movepool, a  fantastic ability in Magic Guard, Clefable establishes its niche in the OU tier as a solid glue on bulkier team compositions, which appreciate its amazing role compression. Clefable maximizes its physical bulk to handle a myriad of physical attackers and passive Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Clefable is an effective Stealth Rock user, as it threatens Great Tusk from spinning. Thunder Wave cripples threats like Iron Moth, Cinderace, and Pecharunt. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Clefable's Stealth Rock and teammates' Spikes. While Moonlight is usually preferred as Clefable's recovery, Wish and Protect can be used over Moonlight and Stealth Rock, respectively, if Clefable's team already has another Stealth Rock user. Leftovers longevity is always appreciated, but Sticky Barb is an option to incapacitate foes like Corviknight and Gliscor, especially because its Knock Off can make sure Sticky Barb can be transferred to them. Rocky Helmet is also an option to spread chip damage against physical attackers, especially U-turn from Corviknight and Landorus-T as well as Great Tusk and Weavile. Clefable uses Tera Water and Tera Steel to absorb Steel-type attacks in a pinch like Kingambit's Iron Head, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Iron Treads's Steel Beam. Tera Water is preferred due to its good matchups into the physical attackers Clefable aims to check, letting Clefable switch into Barraskewda and Cinderace while granting a good neutral defensive typing. Tera Steel can also be used to become immune to Poison-type attacks like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, but it loses key matchups like Cinderace, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Tera Ghost is also a decent pick, as it preserves Clefable’s good matchups into Fighting-types while also letting it spinblock, but it has a worse matchup against Knock Off users. It's worth noting that Clefable prefers not to Terastallize unless it absolutely needs to, as its base typing is incredibly valuable.</p> <p>Clefable fits on balance and stall teams that appreciate its role compression and typing. Teammates like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clodsire love Clefable’s ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and enable their entry hazards. Gliscor, in particular, is a phenomenal teammate. The two are effective walls that cover each other’s physical weaknesses; Clefable can switch into Knock Off from threats that Gliscor cannot handle, namely Meowscarada, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile, threatening them out with Moonblast. In return, Gliscor can set Spikes, which when combined with Clefable’s Stealth Rock and the pair’s access to Knock Off, forms a potent hazard-stacking core. Galarian Slowking is similarly a good partner, as Clefable can handle many of the aforementioned Dark-types that threaten it. In return Galarian Slowking is an amazing special wall that switches into many strong special attacks that would threaten Clefable, such as Iron Moth's Sludge Wave and Primarina's Moonblast. It can also spread Toxic, which allows Clefable to stay in against physical attackers more comfortably. However, Chilly Reception weakening recovery from Moonlight means that this is typically best paired with Wish and Protect. Encore’s ability to catch setup sweepers is appreciated by Clefable’s more offensively oriented teammates like Kingambit and Dragapult to give them a safe entry point. Additionally, it lets in more defensively oriented Pokemon, notably Alomomola, which can regenerate HP and pass Wish. Offensive partners can compensate for Clefable's lack of offensive pressure, with Weavile and Meowscarada in particular can remove Heavy-Duty Boots so Clefable's Stealth Rock can start racking up damage. Dragapult and Gholdengo are also effective partners, as they pressure or cripple common Pokemon that annoy Clefable and can also spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. In return, Clefable switches into and threatens Dark-types while also forcing out Garganacl. Kingambit is a phenomenal partner, as it threatens common answers to Clefable such as Clodsire, Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo. Zamazenta pressures Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran while equally enjoying Clefable handling Great Tusk and pestering Dragapult. Dragonite is also a decent partner, as it likes Clefable's ability to check and pressure Dragon-types as well as its Encore support, giving it more setup opportunities.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Clefable can function as a great sweeper, as it uses its good bulk, fantastic typing, and useful ability to find itself opportunities to set up. Moonblast can potentially drop the Special Attack of opposing Pokemon like Primarina, making Clefable harder to break. Moonlight is required to give Clefable a healing option, since it is not very fast and is going to take hits while setting up. The last move on this set is variable; since Moonblast hits a lot of the tier neutrally, Knock Off can be used to make progress against Pokemon that might not be threatened by even a boosted Clefable like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey. This also means that Clefable can always make progress even if there is not a clear opportunity for it to set up. Alternatively, Flamethrower is a great option mainly to hit Gholdengo, which can take Moonblast easily and either set up alongside Clefable or threaten it with Make It Rain. It also hits many Steel-types that might pose a threat to Clefable like Kingambit, Iron Crown, Iron Treads, and Tinkaton. Ice Beam can also be run in the last slot to deal with Gliscor. Clefable can also explore other options like Thunder Wave to cripple Iron Moth and Iron Crown on the switch. Magic Guard lets Clefable switch in consistently against entry hazard-stacking teams and set up in front of status users that would cripple it otherwise. Sticky Barb limits ron Valiant once it has consumed its Booster Energy, and it can be transferred to Pokemon like Corviknigh and even Gliscor if Clefable is running Knock Off. However, the longevity provided by Leftovers is usually preferred. Tera Fire flips the script against Steel-types and makes it easier for Clefable to set up against Pokemon like Gholdengo and Moltres. Tera Water keeps its resistance to Steel for Pokemon like Kingambit and the aforementioned Gholdengo while giving it valuable resistances to strong moves like Waking Wake's Hydro Steam; however, Tera Water makes Clefable worse against Ogerpon-W, and losing the resistance to Dark- and Fighting-type moves is relevant versus the likes of Kingambit and Zamazenta. Tera Steel has great use when facing Galarian Slowking and Pecharunt, although Clefable has to be careful of Ground- and Fire-types, like Great Tusk or Cinderace, that the Tera Water variant would be safer against.</p> <p>Clefable fits on balance teams that rely mainly on passive damage to make progress, letting it perform the role of wincon once the opposing team is weakened. Thus, Gliscor is a great partner, since it can soften the opposing team via entry hazards, Knock Off, and even status. Gliscor also is a great Knock Off absorber in situations where Clefable doesn't want to lose its item. Skarmory can set up Spikes for Clefable to take advantage of, and it can deal with Pokemon that give Clefable trouble like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kingambit. Many common Pokemon outspeed and threaten Clefable with super effective damage like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth, and it isn't strong enough to threaten a KO back without a significant number of Calm Mind boosts. Ting-Lu and Moltres are tremendous partners for Clefable, since they deal with all the aforementioned Pokemon and help further via hazards and burns, respectively, while also enjoying the presence of Clefable on their team as a status absorber and late-game wincon where it thrives. Clefable also functions really well alongside Dondozo, which can deal with strong physical attackers like Kingambit, while Clefable absorbs passive damage that can weaken Dondozo like Salt Cure and poison. Clefable's ability to ignore passive damage makes it a great teammate, as it can absorb status like Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult and Toxic from Gliscor that might ruin some of its partners like Zamazenta. Also, Clefable's ability to absorb Knock Off is really useful against Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, and being able to completely ignore Salt Cure's effect is fantastic for teammates like Corviknight and Gholdengo. Clefable's stats aren't high enough for it to find easy windows to set up against offensive teams filled with Pokemon that pressure it, like Ogerpon-W, Landorus-T, and Raging Bolt, making it burn its Moonlight PP rather quickly. Thus, Clefable enjoys the presence of Pokemon that can check dangerous wallbreakers, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire helping against Raging Bolt and Corviknight dealing with Landorus-T. Clefable is also held back by the presence of Galarian Slowking, which can take Clefable's hits with ease and pivot into another threat with Chilly Reception and create momentum; this also limits Moonlight's healing. Since Galarian Slowking often uses Clefable as an entry point, Pokemon that can take advantage of its presence like Ting-Lu, Gholdengo, and Darkrai are great partners. Lastly, Clefable is pretty slow, making it susceptible to status moves that might ruin its setup like Encore from Ogerpon-W, Trick from Gholdengo, and Taunt from Landorus-T; thus, Clefable enjoys paralysis from reliable spreaders like Zapdos and Gholdengo and strong speed control provided by Pokemon like Dragapult, Zamazenta, Darkrai, and Meowscarada. All the previously mentioned support Pokemon benefit from Clefable providing a reliable way to wrap up games.</p>"

  "Ninetales": {
    "sets": {
      "Sun Setter": {
        "description": "<p>Ninetales is an alternative sun setter to Torkoal thanks to its Speed and utility options in the form of Encore and Healing Wish. With its higher Speed that outpaces common tier staples like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Landorus-T, Ninetales is able to pose a threat from the first turn, and its support moves give it value later in the battle. Encore gives Ninetales the ability to lock foes into undesired moves, providing entry and setup opportunities for teammates; it can prevent Ninetales from being turned into setup fodder by foes like Raging Bolt, Iron Moth, and some Zamazenta variants while punishing passive Pokemon like Gliscor and Garganacl. Healing Wish is a great last-resort option when Ninetales has been worn down to re-enable and provide a safe entry to one of its teammates. Will-O-Wisp can shut down physical threats such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Hisuian Samurott and generally cripple bulkier foes such as Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Maximum HP investment allows Ninetales to withstand some hits from common leads such as Glimmora's Power Gem and Ting-Lu's Earthquake and even some stronger attacks such as Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor. Tera Grass allows Ninetales to resist Water-type attacks from Ogerpon-W, Primarina, and Hisuian Samurott. This resistance allows Ninetales to be more effective against rain teams, being able to repeatedly enter the field to change the weather safely. The Ground resistance also facilitates Ninetales's matchup against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. As another option, Tera Flying completely flips the matchup against these foes. Alternatively, Tera Ghost turns Ninetales into a great Zamazenta check, shrugging off its Body Press and threatening to lock it with Encore or burn it; it also offers great utility by blocking Rapid Spin attempts.</p> <p>Ninetales acts as the centerpiece of sun teams, facilitating the whole strategy; it fits over Torkoal in faster and more offense-oriented teams. Common teammates in sun teams include Protosynthesis Pokemon; Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon are excellent wallbreakers. Moreover, sun allows Raging Bolt to forgo Booster Energy for other items such as Leftovers and Air Balloon and Speed-boosting Walking Wake to reliably revenge kill faster threats such as Dragapult and Meowscarada. Chlorophyll sweepers such as Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur are able to outspeed some of the fastest threats in the metagame such as Choice Scarf Darkrai and Booster Energy Iron Valiant, preventing these threats from overrunning the team while being capable of cleaning up late-game themselves. Both Raging Bolt and Venusaur are also able to run Fire-type Weather Ball thanks to Ninetales's sun, which allows them to beat otherwise would-be checks such as Iron Treads and Gholdengo. In comparison to Torkoal, Ninetales lacks entry hazard setting and clearing options, which are crucial to ensure Ninetales's longevity. Great Tusk thus makes for a great partner, being able to clear out hazards with Rapid Spin and set Stealth Rock in the field while also activating its own Protosynthesis; additionally, it is a great answer to Tyranitar in particular, which threatens to nullify Ninetales's sun. Hatterene is a good match too, denying hazards with Magic Bounce and being able to further support their teammates with Healing Wish. Cinderace also fits as a hazard control solution, clearing the field from hazards with Court Change and benefiting from a sun-boosted Pyro Ball. Iron Moth benefits greatly from sun, reaching an absurd power level thanks to its sun- and STAB-boosted Fiery Dance, which can easily spiral out of control if it gets a boost; sun also allows it to tank Water-type moves from Hisuian Samurott and Primarina. Slither Wing provides a check against opposing offensive threats like Roaring Moon, Kingambit, Darkrai, and Deoxys-S that can overrun sun teams; it also makes use of its bulk and typing to reliably switch into the former three and other foes like Speed-boosting Great Tusk and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which can otherwise threaten Ninetales out.</p>"

      "Aurora Veil": {
        "description": "<p>With its unique combination of Aurora Veil, Snow Warning, and a good Speed tier, Alolan Ninetales establishes itself as a premiere lead for setting Aurora Veil, giving it the advantage over fellow dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Deoxys-S, which require two turns instead to set up. Encore shuts down setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's mediocre offensive presence like Kingambit and punishes defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Corviknight, giving Alolan Ninetales's teammates free opportunities to set up. Freeze-Dry threatens common leads like Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor as well as Pelipper, which otherwise removes Alolan Ninetales's snow unthreatened. Freeze-Dry can also target certain threats like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Moonblast serves as a stronger secondary STAB option to slam threats like Darkrai, Zamazenta, and Weavile that Freeze-Dry cannot while hitting Hisuian Samurott slightly harder. Alternatively, Snowscape can be run over either STAB move, allowing Alolan Ninetales to reset snow in the face of weather setters Torkoal, Ninetales, Pelipper, and Tyranitar, ensuring both Aurora Veil and the advantage in the weather wars. Though Alolan Ninetales rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Water is run to shed its Fire and Steel weaknesses, flipping the matchup on Pokemon like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Scizor.</p> <p>With its invaluable ability to set dual screens in one turn, Alolan Ninetales cements itself as a lead for hyper offense teams. One sweeper that pairs exceptionally well with Alolan Ninetales is Kyurem, as its Dragon Dance set heavily appreciates both Aurora Veil and snow extending its already solid bulk to absurd levels. Other setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon similarly enjoy Aurora Veil, able to boost with near impunity then crush the opposing team. In particular, Bulk Up Great Tusk is an excellent teammate for its added entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, which Aurora Veil teams can otherwise struggle with. Rillaboom combines Grassy Terrain's recovery with Aurora Veil to allow even more opportunities for its teammates to set up with ease, which is especially useful for those weak to Earthquake like the aforementioned Raging Bolt and Kingambit. However, Alolan Ninetales's biggest foe, Cinderace, resists both of its STAB moves and can steal Aurora Veil with Court Change. Other major threats include Iron Moth and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Scizor, which similarly ignore Alolan Ninetales's attacks, can threaten an OHKO, and, in Iron Moth's case, can set up a Substitute freely. Thus, a great partner is Manaphy, which is able to shrug off any Steel- and Fire-type attacks while synergizing well with Aurora Veil, especially for its Double Dance set. Iron Moth easily boosts on Cinderace and threatens Steel-types, as well as snowballing through sun and Sticky Web teams that would otherwise give Alolan Ninetales trouble; Aurora Veil allows Iron Moth to take a hit or two, which is especially useful for the Substitute variants. Dragonite can serve as a useful check to Iron Moth, offensive Cinderace, and other offensive threats with its powerful Extreme Speed. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Corviknight, which can remove Aurora Veil with Defog, so teammates like the aforementioned Iron Moth and Raging Bolt are useful to pressure it from ever entering the field and using Defog freely.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its unique traits, Galarian Weezing manages to carve out a niche of its own as an entry hazard remover while using its defensive traits to handle threats like Zamazenta, Lokix, and most Iron Valiant sets. Its main appeal is Neutralizing Gas, which makes it the only hazard remover able to remove hazards with Defog in front of Gholdengo. Neutralizing Gas is also able to help it in other matchups against ability-reliant foes, especially against bulky teams filled with Pokemon such as Gliscor, Alomomola, Garganacl, and Galarian Weezing. Pain Split is its only way of healing, and both Will-O-Wisp and Toxic help it get a turn to remove hazards by forcing out opposing threats; Will-O-Wisp scares off physical attackers like Ogerpon-W, Landorus-T and Kingambit, and Toxic scares off Pokemon that are immune to Will-O-Wisp or not threatened by its Attack drop, like Moltres, Cinderace, and Primarina. 16 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO against Naive Iron Valiant and the 2HKO against Hydrapple with Strange Steam. Heavy-Duty Boots is crucial due to its hazard-removing role, as it lets Galarian Weezing switch in without being chipped down by the hazards it needs to remove, but Leftovers can be considered on teams with multiple hazard removers. Tera Flying covers its major weakness against Ground-type moves, letting it take on threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Tera Grass is an option to handle Ogerpon-W better while providing a way to still take on the aforementioned Ground-types decently without being weak to Raging Bolt. Tera Ghost is an option to completely wall an otherwise huge threat to Galarian Weezing teams in Ursaluna while still retaining its strong matchup against Zamazenta.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing fits on balance and stall teams due to its role as an entry hazard remover with a good defensive profile, so teammates that don't use Heavy-Duty Boots appreciate it removing hazards, such as Ting-Lu, Alomomola, Darkrai, Ogerpon-W. Galarian Weezing is able to absorb Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-type attacks from the likes of Dragapult, Hisuian Samurott, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and due to Galarian Weezing being a Poison-neutral Fairy-type, it is able to soft check Darkrai too. Ting-Lu helps it by taking on the special attackers of the tier, like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Iron Crown, which all target Galarian Weezing on its weaker Special Defense, while it can't do anything back. Galarian Weezing helps Ting-Lu take on Fighting-type threats that threaten it, like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, as well as Grass-type wallbreakers like the Ogerpon formes. Gliscor and Garganacl can be paired with Galarian Weezing, as it deals with bulky Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Sinistcha, and Hydrapple that can threaten them. Ogerpon-W serves as a good offensive partner for Galarian Weezing, physically breaking Ground-types that bother Galarian Weezing like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads, while Galarian Weezing can help it against problematic matchups like Zamazenta, Dragapult, and bulky Grass-types such as Sinistcha and Hydrapple. Partners like Kyurem and Darkrai also help Galarian Weezing by specially breaking through Ground-types, like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, while Galarian Weezing helps them back by walling Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Corviknight and Skarmory can help it deal defensively with Ground-type foes like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Iron Treads. Raging Bolt likes the help from Galarian Weezing pressuring Ground-types, which helps it in wallbreaking later. Alomomola appreciates Galarian Weezing taking on the Grass-types in the tier like Ogerpon-W, Hydrapple, and Sinistcha, while Alomomola is able to take on foes like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Gholdengo helps Galarian Weezing in dealing with Psychic-types like Hatterene, Iron Crown, and Deoxys-S, and it appreciates Galarian Weezing checking foes like Hisuian Samurott and Darkrai. Zamazenta helps Galarian Weezing by beating Steel-types like Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Heatran; in return, Galarian Weezing deals with problematic matchups like Iron Valiant.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Zapdos is a defensive pivot that is able to take hits, spread status, and build momentum for its team. Volt Switch is a strong option for a pivoting move, being both STAB-boosted and non-contact, but U-turn is a solid alternative to avoid being blocked by Ground-types like Gliscor and Ting-Lu. Thunder Wave is a powerful support move for slowing down the opposing team, crippling foes like Iron Moth and Darkrai, whereas Discharge should only be used with U-turn to still give it an Electric-type STAB that also allows Zapdos to paralyze foes, albeit less consistent. Additionally, Discharge even allows Zapdos to paralyze foes that are otherwise not threatened by Thunder Wave, like Gholdengo and Hatterene. Heat Wave is an option that gives Zapdos a coverage option to hit Iron Treads while also 2HKOing other offensive Steel-types like Kingambit and Gholdengo. Heavy-Duty Boots is important for mitigating Zapdos's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Steel gives Zapdos favorable matchups against foes like Kyurem and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to resist attacks like Ice Beam and become immune to status moves like Toxic while giving it the opportunity to spread paralysis, which it may not have been able to do otherwise. Tera Fairy is very useful for giving Zapdos a Dark resistance, allowing it to take hits from Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave, thus providing more chances for Static to activate, as well as emergency Dragon immunity against Dragapult. Tera Water provides a Water and Fire resistance against foes like Primarina, Hisuian Samurott, and Cinderace while granting an Ice resistance against Weavile similar to Tera Steel. Most of the EVs are put into Zapdos's Defense, with 16 Speed EVs allowing it to outspeed neutral-natured base 70s like Volcanion.</p> <p>Zapdos is extremely useful on balance teams. Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice of teammate to tank special attacks from threats like Kyurem and Iron Valiant, while Zapdos can help it in return by switching into Ground-type moves that threaten it from Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, pivoting back and forth between each other to support this. Zapdos can also form strong defensive cores with other bulky Pokemon like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu. Zamazenta is able to deal with less favorable matchups for Zapdos, such as Kyurem and Weavile, and Zapdos is able to help by pivoting to it safely. Ting-Lu can support Zapdos by setting entry hazards that can wear down foes like Gholdengo and Walking Wake so that they can be KOed by Zapdos more easily. Hex Gholdengo becomes much stronger with Zapdos as a paralysis-spreading partner, and it is then able to support Zapdos and its teammates with speed control, taking out threats like Dragapult and Darkrai. Zapdos struggles to make progress against common Ground-types like Gliscor, which are immune to Volt Switch, thus preventing it from pivoting. Gliscor can also threaten Zapdos with Knock Off. Teammates like Weavile and Kyurem are great at putting pressure on these counters, and they in turn appreciate Zapdos's ability to get them in safely. While Weavile and Kyurem make good teammates, they also make difficult foes for Zapdos, both of them outspeeding and KOing it. The aforementioned Zamazenta as well as Kingambit can put pressure on these threats. In exchange, Zapdos can help by taking hits from Pokemon like Great Tusk and opposing Zamazenta and crippling these threats with Static and Thunder Wave, giving a teammate like Kingambit more chances to sweep. Knock Off users like Gliscor and Tinkaton threaten to remove Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots. Pokemon that can take hits from Knock Off, like Clefable and Gliscor, are great at helping Zapdos avoid this.</p>"

Its typing and ability let it punish a multitude of physical attackers in the tier, threatening a burn with Flame Body to stop pivoting from U-turn or reliably walling the likes of Zamazenta lacking Stone Edge, Great Tusk, Enamorus, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant. Hurricane can be used to threaten foes like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W hard. Will-O-Wisp reliably cripples physical attackers like Terastallized Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Dragonite. Roar stops potential setup sweepers like Tera Fire Zamazenta and Iron Moth, as well as being a good way to deal passive damage if entry hazards are up. U-turn lets Moltres get in teammates safely. Scorching Sands can be used to hit foes like Iron Moth and Raging Bolt and can fish for burns against most physical attackers. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that gives Moltres a Dark resistance while keeping its natural Fighting resistance, maintaining its positive matchup versus Zamazenta.

Tera Grass flips Moltres's weakness to Water into a resistance, giving it an easier rain matchup, as well as taking various hits like Hydro Steam from Walking Wake, Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W, and Water-type moves from Primarina to Roar out Calm Mind variants. It also flips Moltres's Electric weakness against Raging Bolt, letting it phaze Calm Mind variants with Roar. Terastallization allows Moltres to ease its weakness to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, letting it not fear huge chip damage from them. 12 Speed EVs allow Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit.</p> <p>Moltres is a great fit on offensive teams and more bulky teams. Its great typing and its ability to spread burn help its teammates against prominent physical attackers. Partners like Clefable and Kingambit appreciate it being able to check threats like Great Tusk and opposing Kingambit, while Clefable and Kingambit are able to switch into threats to Moltres, such as Weavile. Offensive partners like Ogerpon-W and Zamazenta appreciate Moltres's pivoting, forcing in Pokemon like Garganacl and Heatran, which have bad matchups against the aforementioned teammates. Zamazenta is also able to check Ogerpon-W with its ability's initial Defense boost. Darkrai and Weavile are also potent offensive partners, being able to amend Moltres's bad matchups such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking by threatening huge damage on both targets. Threats to Moltres are potent attackers such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W. A partner like Galarian Slowking works well with Moltres, as it enjoys burns allowing it to switch into physical attackers, such as a burned Zamazenta, as well as being able to switch into attacks from Primarina. Offensive threats like Ogerpon and Dragapult can check Ogerpon-W, either helping in taking attacks, revenge killing, or crippling it with status. Defensive partners such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Corviknight can switch into Knock Off for Moltres, with Gliscor itself being able to use Knock Off and set Spikes, which pairs well with Roar variants of Moltres. Great Tusk and Corviknight offer entry hazard removal. Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are able to cover Moltres's bad matchups against Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Zapdos, as well as providing hazards, which make Moltres's phazing more of a threat.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot, Galarian Moltres is a solid late-game setup sweeper and wallbreaker. Hurricane is the strongest Flying-type STAB option and can blow away Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta without requiring Galarian Moltres to Terastallize. If you would rather have something more consistent, Tera Blast Fairy can be useful as coverage against them while also hitting Dark-types like Ting-Lu harder than Hurricane, which, in combination with Fiery Wrath, allows Galarian Moltres to hit most of the tier at least neutrally. Taunt potentially turns it into a stallbreaker, as it blocks status moves like Whirlwind from Ting-Lu, Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire, and Calm Mind and Soft-Boiled from Blissey, giving Galarian Moltres more opportunities to set up and sweep against bulkier teams, whereas with an Agility boost, Galarian Moltres matches up better against offensive teams, as it can outspeed threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Enamorus, only remaining threatened by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and other priority moves. Sitrus Berry is a must-have, allowing Galarian Moltres to potentially secure an extra boost from Berserk and its setup moves. Tera Ghost gives Galarian Moltres an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Zamazenta's Body Press, and Blissey's Seismic Toss, as well as allowing it to double as a Rapid Spin blocker. Defensively, Tera Fairy is a solid typing that allows it to keep the resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch while making it immune to Dragpult's powerful Draco Meteor and Dragon Darts. Galarian Moltres can run a bulkier spread to give itself more chances to set up; this specific EV spread allows Galarian Moltres to outspeed uninvested Gliscor while surviving two Ivy Cudgels from Ogerpon-W after Sitrus Berry and two Ice Beams from Darkrai. Alternatively, it can run maximum Special Attack and Speed to increase its sweeping potential; this set is better suited to running Agility for setting up, whereas the bulkier set can more safely run Taunt.</p> <p>Galarian Moltres fits best on hyper offensive teams. It pairs best with other offensive sweepers and wallbreakers similar to itself, such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Gholdengo, that can keep up pressure throughout a battle. Iron Valiant takes on foes like Darkrai and Raging Bolt, while Galarian Moltres handles Gholdengo and Pecharunt, forming a dangerous offensive core. Gholdengo can block any attempts to wear down Galarian Moltres with status and force damage on Ting-Lu and break through Fairy-types that Galarian Moltres struggles with. Iron Moth can help wallbreak and allow Galarian Moltres to sweep late in the game. Galarian Moltres can also fit well into Dark-type spam archetypes alongside teammates like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, breaking through bulkier foes like Kingambit and Tinkaton. Galarian Moltres, in return, can pressure Dark-resistant Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk. Galarian Moltres is particularly helped by entry hazards, the damage from which can chip down enemies that Galarian Moltres can then break through. Great Tusk and Iron Treads can set Stealth Rock to assist in this, use Rapid Spin to protect Galarian Moltres from entry hazard damage and let it setup on spinblockers, and check some of Galarian Moltres's tougher matchups like Raging Bolt and Iron Moth. Deoxys-S can also provide excellent support with entry hazards, while Hatterene can prevent opponents from setting their own hazards and can act as an additional setup sweeper for the team with Calm Mind. Sticky Web is also particularly helpful for Galarian Moltres. It allows it to sweep more of the tier by letting it outspeeding faster threats like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant without needing an additional boost from Agility, so Galarian Moltres can safely run Taunt instead; Araquanid and Ribombee are great teammates for this reason. Alolan Ninetales can facilitate another type of hyper offensive team; its Aurora Veil turns allow Galarian Moltres additional setup opportunities, especially when attempting to get a boost from both Nasty Plot and Agility back-to-back. Galarian Moltres is particularly susceptible to fast, powerful sweepers that can take it out before it has the chance to set up, including Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, and priority users like Raging Bolt and Dragonite that ignore its Agility boost. Pecharunt is an excellent teammate to take these hits and threaten back with Nasty Plot-boosted Malignant Chains; this can help overwhelm foes like Ting-Lu with poison, as well as Fairy-types that threaten Galarian Moltres like Iron Valiant and Clefable. Bulkier Pokemon that can spread Toxic like Gliscor and Clodsire can cut off Galarian Moltres's sweeping potential should it opt to forego Taunt; Kyurem is a strong teammate that can break through these checks. Other offensive teammates that form solid pairings with Galarian Moltres are Dragonite, which Galarian Moltres can help sweep by taking out Gholdengo, Zamazenta to deal with Kingambit while Galarian Moltres deals with Ghost-types in return, and Ogerpon-W, which can break through bulkier teams if Galarian Moltres is running Agility.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, Darkrai, and Ogerpon-W. It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Weavile's Ice Shard, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta. Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Terastallized Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt. An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres, a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile, and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Dragonite fits on a wide array of offensive teams, ranging from fast-paced hyper offense teams that employ multiple setup sweepers to bulkier offense teams that can wear foes down over time and facilitate Dragonite's sweep while taking advantage of its excellent defensive profile. Iron Defense Zamazenta is one of Dragonite's best teammates to help against threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit that can all give Dragonite issues: Zamazenta boasts an immense Speed tier and can set up against physical attackers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Kingambit that Dragonite cannot reliably set up against. Kingambit is a spectacular teammate, as its resistances to Ice and Rock pair extremely well with Dragonite's resistances to Fire and Fighting and immunity to Ground. The duo can overwhelm both slower teams vulnerable to Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted Kowtow Cleave and faster teams with both Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Kingambit's Sucker Punch is threatening enough that Dragonite can also more easily forego Extreme Speed in favor of Roost. Gholdengo is a particularly excellent teammate that can greatly pressure walls like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Garganacl. Entry hazard support is crucial in allowing Dragonite to OHKO faster threats like Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu form an incredibly powerful core that resists or is immune to every type: Ting-Lu can reliably set hazards, Gholdengo blocks most means of hazard removal, and Dragonite uses the chip damage from those hazards to clean up late-game. Hisuian Samurott can support Dragonite's sweep beyond setting Spikes with Ceaseless Edge; Encore creates more opportunities for Dragonite to get a free Dragon Dance, Flip Turn provides Dragonite with momentum and gives it safe entry and easier opportunities to set up, and Knock Off cripples Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant threats like Moltres, Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Dondozo. Hisuian Samurott can even run Swords Dance to wallbreak and facilitate a late-game Dragonite sweep. On hyper offense teams, Glimmora is an excellent lead thanks to its solid Speed tier, ease of setting up Stealth Rock, and good matchups against Moltres and some Iron Moth variants. Powerful special attackers, like Darkrai and Iron Moth, can muscle past physically bulky threats like Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Garganacl that Dragonite struggles immensely against and pave the way for its late-game sweep. In addition to offering more speed control, Iron Valiant can both break past physical walls like Dondozo and disrupt the opposing team with options like Knock Off, Encore, and Destiny Bond to facilitate Dragonite's late-game sweep. Great Tusk's Ice Spinner can hit threats like Zapdos, opposing Dragonite, and Gliscor, which allows Dragonite to forego Ice Spinner in favor of Roost.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dragonite can fully lean into its defensive profile even more and complement it further with its strong STAB Dragon Tail and Extreme Speed to become a remarkable anti-offense tool. It uses its typing, bulk, and reliable recovery in Roost to switch into and threaten back foes like Ogerpon-W, Iron Moth, and Keldeo more consistently; furthermore, with Multiscale intact, it can even emergency check an even wider range of threats by taking on boosted or super effective hits in a pinch, including those from the likes of Darkrai, Raging Bolt, and opposing Dragonite. This hit-taking ability allows it to phaze them with Dragon Tail more reliably, which is also helpful against other setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Gliscor, and Air Balloon Gholdengo that can otherwise set up on and overwhelm Dragonite after enough boosts. Moreover, potentially forcing offensive staples like Zamazenta, Iron Moth, and Raging Bolt into the field when they're not ready to sweep yet essentially wastes their Dauntless Shield and Booster Energy. Once they're chipped enough, the offensive threats are picked off easily by Extreme Speed, especially frail ones like Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus; Extreme Speed is also helpful to deal with priority moves from foes like Raging Bolt, Hisuian Samurott, and non-Tera Ghost variants of Weavile and Kingambit. On top of accumulating entry hazard damage to the opposition, Dragon Tail has the added benefit of forcing out walls and switch-ins like Skarmory, Dondozo, and Alomomola that it can't easily threaten, especially preventing the latter from passing Wish to the desired teammate. Earthquake rounds out its coverage to hit Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Tinkaton. Tera Normal boosts the power of its Extreme Speed, letting it reach crucial benchmarks such as 2HKOing Iron Valiant, Darkrai, and Hisuian Samurott. Additionally, it sheds all of Dragonite's weaknesses and grants it a solidly neutral typing, notably improving its matchup against threats like Enamorus, Weavile, and Dragapult. 16 Speed EVs are enough to let Dragonite outspeed Adamant Kingambit.</p> <p>Dragonite is used on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive utility and decent pressure, especially against offensive teams. It pairs well with all manner of walls found on these archetypes; Steel-types like Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Tinkaton can cover most of its shortcomings by handling foes like Kyurem, Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, with Tinkaton and Gholdengo in particular being great as a stopgap to other Fairy-type setup sweepers like Clefable and Hatterene that not only threaten Dragonite out but cannot be phazed by its Dragon Tail. In return, Dragonite can switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Landorus-T aimed at Gholdengo and Tinkaton. The aforementioned Corviknight and other Pokemon like Clefable and Gliscor are great Knock Off absorbers against Pokemon like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor and Clefable, letting Dragonite keep its valuable Heavy-Duty Boots. However, Pokemon that Dragonite is supposed to switch into, like Ogerpon-W and Hisuian Samurott, will inevitably hit it with a Knock Off; Great Tusk, Galarian Weezing, and the aforementioned Corviknight are great as entry hazard removers to make sure Stealth Rock still won't be an issue. Additionally, Gliscor, Clefable, and other Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Skarmory are valuable as hazard setters themselves, letting the team rack up chip damage when paired with Dragonite's Dragon Tail, and notably put offensive threats like Enamorus and Iron Moth closer into Extreme Speed range, with Ting-Lu's Ruination forcing immediate progress in that regard for Dragonite to clean late-game more easily. Ting-Lu and Clefable are also great at switching into Dragapult, which otherwise cannot be revenge killed by and forces out Dragonite. In return, Dragonite covers threats such as Ogerpon-W and Iron Moth for all of them, with its ability to emergency check other offensive threats in general giving them more breathing room. Gliscor, Clefable, and more offensive Pokemon like Darkrai and Weavile are also great Knock Off users, removing Heavy-Duty Boots to synergize well with the team's entry hazards and Dragonite's Dragon Tail, softening up the opposition more effectively for Dragonite to clean late-game. The aforementioned Darkrai and Weavile alongside other offensive Pokemon like Zamazenta also match up well against offensive teams so Dragonite isn't overwhelmed defensively when facing against highly aggressive teams. On more bulky offensive teams, Dragonite can even employ an even wider range of offensive teammates, including Ogerpon-W, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-W in particular matches up well against the bulky teams that Dragonite struggles with, while Iron Valiant and its Encore can limit Fairy-type and Tera Fairy setup sweepers like Clefable and Raging Bolt that Dragonite cannot phaze. Moreover, Dragonite's propensity to force offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Darkrai, and Weavile to Terastallize into a Ghost-type to avoid its Extreme Speed allows Kingambit, Darkrai, and Weavile to deal with them more easily. While offensive, these threats also provide defensive utility for Dragonite; for instance, Kingambit checks Dragapult and Kyurem, Zamazenta handles Kingambit, and both of them deal with Weavile.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Iron Moth while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable. Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T, common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Hydrapple, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran, but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Weavile's Triple Axel.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene. Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta. Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent defensive pivot thanks to good Special Defense, Regenerator, and a solid defensive typing. Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire and allows it to support its wallbreaking teammates further. Psychic Noise can be used to shut down the recovery from walls like Corviknight, Gliscor, and Garganacl while giving Galarian Slowking an immediate way to pressure foes like Zamazenta and Iron Moth, even going through the latter's Substitute. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, while Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt and Zapdos. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake. Tera Grass similarly gives it a Water resistance against Walking Wake without being weak to Garganacl's Salt Cure and Raging Bolt; the Ground resistance can also be handy against foes like Great Tusk and Gliscor. Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult while flipping its Dark weakness. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice for a pivot on balance teams, as frail offensive teammates like Iron Valiant appreciate being brought in safely as well as the pressure applied by Future Sight. Due to its average Defense, Galarian Slowking benefits from physically defensive partners like Skarmory to form a solid defensive core. Galarian Slowking struggles against special walls like Ting-Lu and Skeledirge if not running Toxic, so physically offensive teammates like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott that can take care of them make good partners. Additionally, Galarian Slowking is walled by Steel-types like Corviknight and Heatran, so teammates like Raging Bolt and Great Tusk that can remove them are necessary. Ground-immune teammates like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are also good partners for Galarian Slowking due to its weakness to common threats like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can blanket check hard-hitting special attackers like Walking Wake and Enamorus, with Regenerator allowing it to maintain longevity throughout the course of a game. Moreover, the added bulk from Assault Vest means Galarian Slowking can afford to invest into its Special Attack, improving its offensive prowess significantly by making use of its colorful coverage options to be a respectable special attacker as well. Psyshock punches holes through special walls like opposing Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire much more effectively than its other Psychic-type STAB options and also immediately threatens Iron Moth, which can snowball past Galarian Slowking if given enough turns. It also allows Galarian Slowking to handle threatening Calm Mind users like Raging Bolt and Iron Valiant that can otherwise break past it with enough boosts. Psychic Noise allows it to annoy walls like Garganacl and Gliscor while similarly threatening Iron Moth immediately, even doing so through its Substitute. Sludge Bomb's poison can prove devastating against bulkier foes like Alomomola and Ting-Lu that can otherwise switch into Galarian Slowking. Flamethrower is useful coverage to hit Steel-types like Kingambit and Gholdengo, which would otherwise have ample switch-in opportunities. Ice Beam allows Galarian Slowking to hit Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk while denting foes like Dragapult and Dragonite. 16 Defense EVs let Galarian Slowking survive a Knock Off from non-Choice Band Meowscarada and 96 Special Defense EVs allow it to take two Choice Specs Kyurem's Earth Power. The rest of its EVs are pooled into Special Attack, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Speed-boosting Iron Moth with Psyshock; 2HKOing Darkrai and OHKOing Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb; and 2HKOing Iron Crown and bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with Flamethrower. Tera Water gives Galarian Slowking a resistance to Water and Fire, allowing it to check Pokemon like Walking Wake, Primarina, and Iron Moth better, and drops its weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type moves, which allows it to act as an emergency check to Pokemon like Darkrai and Dragapult, and Great Tusk. Tera Grass similarly provides a Water resistance against Walking Wake with the added benefit of not being vulnerable to Garganacl's Salt Cure and Raging Bolt. The Ground resistance can also be helpful against foes like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is a recommended pick for balance and bulky offense teams due to it being able to check multiple top metagame threats like special attacking Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake while also having respectable offensive presence and respectable longevity. It has a lot of trouble dealing with Ground-type Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, so Flying-types like Corviknight and Skarmory pair extremely well with it. Corviknight and Skarmory are also able to sponge physical attacks from other Pokemon Galarian Slowking struggles with like Weavile, Dragonite, and Kingambit. Offensive partners like Rillaboom and Primarina can hit Ground-types instead of just simply walling them. Great Tusk itself is a great teammate for Galarian Slowking on the balance teams they fit on, serving as a Kingambit check and as entry hazard removal, especially versus hazard stacking teams. In return, Galarian Slowking is able to beat Pokemon like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and special attacking Iron Valiant sets for Great Tusk. Dragapult pairs neatly with Galarian Slowking, since it's also a frequent balance pick, serves as useful speed control, and appreciates Galarian Slowking being able to spread poison thanks to Sludge Bomb, allowing it to fire off Hex more frequently late-game without fearing Fairy-types stopping its sweeps. Gliscor fits on balance builds with Galarian Slowking, serving as a blanket check to physical attackers, a hazard setter, and a Knock Off absorber, along with having great longevity. Galarian Slowking is able to take advantage of the hazards Gliscor sets up by forcing switches with its vast array of coverage options, since many offensive threats prone to taking hazard damage like Primarina, Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Raging Bolt don't want to stay in and take repeated hits from it. Landorus-T is the Ground / Flying teammate of choice on bulky offense teams because of its better offensive presence and pivoting capabilities. Hisuian Samurott is another hazard setter that pairs well with Galarian Slowking, since it's able to soft check Pokemon that threaten Galarian Slowking like Weavile, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, whereas Galarian Slowking can take on Iron Valiant and Serperior for it while still retaining a threatening offensive presence thanks to its great coverage and solid offensive stats. Zamazenta is a great partner on bulky offense teams due to its favorable Kingambit matchup and ability to soft check many other physical attackers that threaten Galarian Slowking like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile. IronPress sets can set up and sweep after Galarian Slowking has removed their checks and chipped the opposing team into KO range. Various other offensive Pokemon such as Primarina, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W also greatly appreciate Galarian Slowking functioning as a defensive Pokemon with a notable offensive presence, allowing for more flexibility when teambuilding. Other bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Alomomola and Hydrapple can form Regenerator cores with Galarian Slowking, outlasting many offensive builds while covering each other's weaknesses. Alomomola can wall Fire- and Ground-types like Cinderace, Heatran, and Great Tusk, while Hydrapple is able to beat Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Dondozo.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Scizor is a strong anti-metagame revenge killer and offensive pivot. Brandishing its ever-infamous Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, it is able to check and OHKO relevant Fairy-type foes in Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as well as Kyurem after entry hazard damage, along with scaring off some speedier foes, such as Deoxys-S, Darkrai, and Dragapult. Scizor has, additionally, a superb matchup against the hyper offense leads Alolan Ninetales and Ribombee, disallowing the opponent from safely setting up Aurora Veil and Sticky Web. U-turn threatens other enemies such as Ting-Lu and Ogerpon-W but most importantly gives Scizor the ability to pivot out from and chip away at a predicted switch-in like Iron Moth or Raging Bolt, while granting momentum to the whole team. Knock Off neuters item-reliant foes such as Corviknight and Moltres, along with checking Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Galarian Slowking. Last but not least, Close Combat is Scizor's greatest tool against Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Tera Normal Gliscor, while Dual Wingbeat allows it to stay in against Zamazenta and Great Tusk. 136 EVs in Speed allow Scizor to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit, and, after maximizing its Attack, the rest of its EVs are dumped into HP, allowing it to survive strong hits such as Great Tusk’s Headlong Rush and Zamazenta’s Close Combat. Tera Steel pushes Bullet Punch’s wallbreaking power to the point where it threatens to OHKO defensive staples like Hatterene and Primarina, as well as ensuring an OHKO on Darkrai after Stealth Rock along with a 2HKO on Tera Dark or Tera Ghost Kingambit. Tera Flying is mandatory when running Dual Wingbeat, providing Scizor with Ground and Spikes immunities while guaranteeing the OHKO on Great Tusk and Walking Wake, as well as 2HKOing key stall foes in Alomomola and Gliscor.</p> <p>Scizor is a great fit on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a great speed control and wallbreaking Pokemon. With its amazing complimentary dual typing and solid physical bulk, Choice Band Scizor fills roles such as acting as a Toxic absorber and answering Grass-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type threats such as Rillaboom, Kyurem, and Iron Valiant. It forms a great core with Primarina, with Scizor covering for Primarina's Grass and Poison weaknesses and Primarina tanking Fire-type hits from foes like Cinderace. Scizor is a fitting partner to Kingambit, as Scizor can cover its poor matchup against Iron Valiant and bring it safely into the field with U-turn. Scizor also synergizes with Ogerpon-W, as they form a strong pivoting and Knock Off core, with Ogerpon-W covering tough matchups for Scizor like Moltres and Alomomola, while Scizor in return handles Kyurem and Grass-type foes like Meowscarada and Rillaboom. Scizor greatly struggles against physically defensive walls such as Corviknight and Skarmory, which can easily shrug off Bullet Punch and keep themselves healthy with reliable recovery. Strong special attackers in Raging Bolt and Iron Moth can cover these matchups with super effective hits. Raging Bolt also covers Scizor's general ineffectiveness against Water-type foes like Dondozo and Alomomola. Zamazenta makes for a fitting teammate with amazing defenses that is able to switch into and withstand most attacks thrown at Scizor, and its Fighting-type STAB move alleviates Scizor's four-moveslot syndrome by allowing it to run Dual Wingbeat. On the other hand, non-Dual Wingbeat variants of Scizor can be easily stopped by opposing Zamazenta, so Deoxys-S and Hatterene as well as Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Pecharunt, which can ignore Body Press from Zamazenta and additionally spinblock for Scizor’s team, can be countermeasures. Dragonite is a surprisingly reliable check to Scizor, as Scizor lacks any tools to significantly damage it, so strong Ice-type moves from Kyurem and Darkrai should be considered for inclusion in Scizor's team. Majorly threatening to Scizor are Zapdos and especially Moltres, which can neuter it with Static and Flame Body, as all of Scizor's moves make contact; moreover, Moltres can remove it easily with Flamethrower. Garganacl makes for a great defensive check to both, and the aforementioned Kyurem and Raging Bolt are similarly fit to handle Zapdos and Moltres, respectively. More generally, Scizor is in dire need of entry hazard-setting partners, which synergize with Knock Off by setting up Stealth Rock to neutralize its counters such as Moltres and get foes in range of an OHKO from Bullet Punch. Scizor also appreciates hazard-removing partners, which can ensure the battlefield is clear for it to enter safely, as Choice Band Scizor without any form of recovery can be overwhelmed and chipped down easily over the course of a game. Great Tusk comprises both roles in one Pokemon, but alternatives such as Landorus-T and the aforementioned Garganacl as hazard setters and Cinderace as a hazard remover are also viable. Great Tusk and Landorus-T additionally cover Scizor's poor matchup against Raging Bolt and Iron Moth, which target Scizor's weaker Special Defense and resist Bullet Punch, by threatening them with Ground-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Scizor fills a unique role on fast-paced offensive teams with its combination of solid defensive typing, strong priority, Knock Off, and Swords Dance. STAB- and Technician-boosted Bullet Punch offers some of the most consistent revenge killing in the tier, especially against physically frail or Steel-weak sweepers like Iron Valiant and Kyurem. Swords Dance enables Scizor's other two main functions, allowing it to wallbreak early in the battle or clean a weakened team later on, with +2 Bullet Punch OHKOing many offensive Pokemon like Dragapult and Meowscarada. Close Combat is Scizor's strongest option against neutral targets, most notably Skarmory and Corviknight, which are always 2HKOed by +2 Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Unboosted Close Combat also OHKOes Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, which resist both of Scizor's other attacking moves. Knock Off primarily allows Scizor to threaten Gholdengo, OHKOing offensive variants before a Swords Dance and OHKOing all Gholdengo lacking Colbur Berry at +2. The combination of Knock Off and Swords Dance also makes Scizor efficient at removing items from bulky defensive Pokemon like Dondozo and Alomomola because many of the tier's Knock Off absorbers like Clefable and Gliscor cannot sustain taking boosted attacks. The EVs aim to maximize Scizor's damage output while outspeeding Adamant Kingambit, Ursaluna, and most defensive variants of Heatran. Tera Steel aids in revenge killing and cleaning, allowing Life Orb Scizor's Bullet Punch to OHKO Pokemon like Kyurem unboosted and most Iron Moth at +2 after Stealth Rock. Tera Fire inverts Scizor's one weakness and providing Scizor with a burn immunity, flipping the matchup against Pokemon like Moltres, Cinderace, Dragapult, and Darkrai. Tera Fighting gives Scizor much higher immediate damage, notably OHKOing Ogerpon-W unboosted and having a chance to OHKO Alomomola at +2 with Close Combat.</p> <p>Scizor fits best on hyper offense structures. It both benefits greatly from entry hazards and improves their efficacy with its powerful Knock Off, so it should generally be on teams with a hazard-setting lead like Glimmora, Landorus-T, Deoxys-S, or even Ribombee for Sticky Web's speed control. It makes a good offensive pairing with anything that forces in Fairy-types like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, as Scizor can then use the Fairy-type as a setup opportunity. Kingambit is one of Scizor's best partners for a myriad of reasons; the dual-priority combination of Bullet Punch and Sucker Punch greatly threatens opposing offense, while Scizor's boosted Knock Off and Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted attacks can overwhelm defensive teams. Scizor is a deterrent to Encore Iron Valiant, a common roadblock for Kingambit, while Kingambit can force in and chip Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Scizor to clean up late-game. Kingambit's ability to force in Zamazenta early also makes Zamazenta waste Dauntless Shield. Scizor struggles most against bulky Pokemon that can take Bullet Punches and deal heavy damage in return. Some common examples are Iron Moth and Raging Bolt, which can also outspeed Scizor. The best teammates to help against these Pokemon are choices like Dragonite and Great Tusk that can immediately threaten Scizor's answers and potentially switch in on a good prediction or come in after Scizor is sacrificed to keep up the offensive pressure. Alomomola and Dondozo are very hard for Scizor to wear down without heavy entry hazard support, so Ogerpon-W is a great teammate, as it can come in on and threaten both while benefitting from the Knock Off support that Scizor provides. Zamazenta is similarly hard to wear down for Scizor and can use it as a setup opportunity, so choices like Encore Iron Valiant and Gholdengo can help to alleviate that issue.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Skarmory is commonly used as an anti-setup Pokemon, having great bulk and a strong defensive typing that lets it check common offensive physical threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Skarmory's immense physical bulk allows it to tank hits from the aforementioned Pokemon and punish them with Rocky Helmet chip damage, making it a great sponge on balanced structures. Skarmory is able to set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, increasing its Defense exponentially and massively boosting the power of Body Press while denying any setup opportunities. With enough Defense boosts, Skarmory can turn into a deadly late-game win condition with IronPress, only stopped by Ghost-types like Pecharunt and Dragapult. However, it can run Brave Bird and Whirlwind instead; Brave Bird gives it an immediate way to hit Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant, while Whirlwind allows it to still deal with setup sweepers like Kingambit and non-Roar Zamazenta that can otherwise take advantage of Skarmory lacking IronPress. Rocky Helmet makes it impossible for even fully Attack-boosted Pokemon to match its Defense boosts, as Skarmory's access to Roost grants it longevity, letting it outlive almost every physical setup Pokemon in the long term. It also allows Skarmory to punish stray U-turn and Knock Off from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Meowscarada. Skarmory also has access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it more proactive against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu that may use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Tera Dragon gives Skarmory a great resistance to Fire, which lets it check Pokemon such as Cinderace; it also eases the matchup against Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting should only be used on IronPress variants; on top of boosting Skarmory's Body Press, it also gives Skarmory extra insurance against Kingambit thanks to its Kowtow Cleave resistance and is especially useful for teams that are potentially weak to Jolly Kingambit late-game. Skarmory is EVed to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna if running IronPress, but a fully defensive spread alongside Impish should be used if going for Brave Bird and Whirlwind.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory is outstanding on balance teams that struggle against setup Pokemon that take advantage of the team's passivity, synergizing with Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, as they can set up entry hazards to pressure foes as well as remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. It also pairs well with Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, which can sponge special moves that Skarmory is unable to take, and they also check dangerous threats such as Iron Moth and Cinderace. These Pokemon are often fodder for opposing Swords Dance Kingambit or Bulk Up Great Tusk; however, Skarmory handles them with ease. Skarmory is also great against Pokemon such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Rillaboom thanks to its solid typing and immense bulk. Chip damage from Rocky Helmet disincentivizes the aforementioned Pokemon from using physical moves, and Skarmory outlives them eventually thanks to its longevity and recovery capabilities with Roost. Despite Skarmory's great physical bulk, it is vulnerable to special attackers and Ghost-types that may take advantage of it, such as Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking are great for tanking special attackers' hits, the former being a great Ghost-type check. Heavy-Duty Boots Kingambit is also a good choice alongside Skarmory, as it can find opportunities to set up against Ghost-types while being a reliable sponge, as well as having strong priority moves against the special attackers that Skarmory would otherwise struggle against. In return, Skarmory can set Spikes for Kingambit and act as a reliable wall to some of Kingambit's checks, particularly Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Due to its lack of pivoting capabilities unlike Corviknight, Skarmory also appreciates Pokemon that can tank hits and pivot around, such as Rotom-W, U-turn Gliscor, and Meowscarada.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its staggering special bulk, Blissey is the greatest wall to most special attackers in the tier. Seismic Toss is Blissey's go-to damaging move, compensating for its lack of offensive stats and preventing it from being entirely passive. Calm Mind gives Blissey a way to check dangerous setup sweepers like Darkrai and Raging Bolt more reliably, able to match their Special Attack boosts with its own Special Defense boosts, as well as boosting its coverage moves in case it runs them. Alternatively, Protect allows Blissey to safely absorb Future Sight, scout Choice-locked attackers, stall out weather turns, and burn the PP of powerful moves like Draco Meteor and Make It Rain. Stealth Rock gives Blissey another way to wear down the opposing team, as its high Special bulk allows Blissey to set rocks multiple times over the course of a game. Alternatively, if another Stealth Rock setter is present on the team, Blissey can also choose Flamethrower to hit Gholdengo hard and can threaten a burn on the foe, especially  phsyical attackers attempting to switch in and threaten Blissey out. Another option is Shadow Ball, which allows Blissey to hit both Gholdengo and Dragapult, as well as any Tera Ghost users like Primarina and Raging Bolt looking to set up on Blissey. Heal Bell is also an option, allowing Blissey to take a cleric role for the team. With such high HP, Blissey chooses to invest EVs in Defense and Special Defense instead, still bolstering its absurd special bulk while lessening the damage from physical moves that would otherwise chip it down. Tera Dark gives Blissey a crucial Psychic immunity, allowing it to ignore Psyshock, Stored Power, Psychic Noise, and Future Sight from the likes of Hatterene, Latias, Primarina, and Gholdengo. Tera Water offers Blissey a resistance to Water, Fire, and Steel, useful for checking threats like Walking Wake and Heatran. Last but not least, Tera Fairy turns Blissey's Fighting weakness into a resistance, as well as an immunity to Dragon and a resistance to Dark, helping Blissey's matchup against Dragon Darts Dragapult.</p> <p>Blissey’s titanic bulk makes it mandatory on stall teams, which can tolerate its passive nature. Dondozo pairs exceptionally well with Blissey, forming an excellent stalwart defensive core that can wall the vast majority of threats in the metagame. Blissey also enjoys teammates like Alomomola, Gliscor, and Clefable, which can switch into physical threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Blissey cannot wall, as well as absorb Knock Off that would otherwise cripple Blissey, while Blissey can handle special attackers like Raging Bolt and Iron Moth that would threaten Blissey's teammates. Another excellent partner is Clodsire, which can check boosted special threats like Serperior and Gholdengo that Blissey struggles to keep up with, while Blissey can wall Pokemon like Walking Wake and Primarina that can hit Clodsire with powerful super effective moves, as well as absorbing status that might otherwise cripple Clodsire. Furthermore, either Blissey or Clodsire can run Stealth Rock, freeing up the other to run moves like Heal Bell or Flamethrower for Blissey, or Amnesia for Clodsire. Corviknight also works well with Blissey, serving as a Knock Off absorber, entry hazard remover, and a check against dangerous physical threats like Kingambit and Zamazenta.</p>"

Its perfectly-accurate STAB Hurricane threatens Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W— which are generally huge threats to rain teams—while dealing great neutral damage to Water-resistant targets like Hisuian Samurott and Dragapult. Surf threatens a number of common Stealth Rock setters such as Gliscor and Landorus-T with OHKOs in rain, while Knock Off cripples foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola, making them easier for Pelipper's teammates to break through. A Speed-reducing nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs gives Pelipper its slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to safely bring in teammates to make use of its rain. It also lets Pelipper underspeed uninvested Tyranitar and the niche Hippowdon, allowing its rain to override their sand in the lead matchup. A physically defensive EV spread lets Pelipper easily handle physical threats like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, running enough Special Defense EVs to guarantee take on Enamorus's Moonblast after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread can be used to take less damage from special attackers that would otherwise take advantage of Pelipper's poor Special Defense, such as Gholdengo and Enamorus, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor, while running enough Defense EVs to survive two Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full. Though Pelipper is rarely Terastallized, Tera Ground can be used to remove its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves from Raging Bolt and Zapdos and safely pivot out of them. Tera Grass similarly provides a way to stomach Raging Bolt's Electric-type attacks but with the additional benefit of taking on Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, which are otherwise huge threats to rain teams.</p> <p>Pelipper should be used exclusively on rain teams where it is commonly partnered with powerful wallbreakers like Barraskewda, which is greatly enabled by Swift Swim activation, and Raging Bolt, which benefits from Water-type Weather Ball to break through Ground-types. Due to Pelipper's weakness to Stealth Rock and that it can't afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, it benefits greatly from Rapid Spin support from Iron Treads to allow it to repeatedly set rain. Because Damp Rock is needed to maximize the number of rain turns, Pelipper appreciates having a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, such as Kingambit, especially if its Air Balloon has been popped. Due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pelipper enjoys Ground-type teammates like Iron Treads that can easily switch into the likes of Raging Bolt. Pokemon like Air Balloon Kingambit that can help against Kyurem are also appreciated, as Pelipper is unable to defensively check it and rain teams tend to struggle against it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Drought and a number of utility options, Torkoal is OU's best option for a sun setter. Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock grant Torkoal excellent role compression as both an entry hazard remover and setter that can threaten other common leads like Skarmory, Ribombee, and Iron Treads with Lava Plume while also being naturally slower than both Tyranitar and Pelipper, ensuring that sun is the weather that stays up in the lead matchup. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers like Great Tusk and Dragonite looking to scare Torkoal out and use it as setup fodder without fully relying on Lava Plume's burn chance. A physically defensive EV spread with 12 Special Defense EVs lets Torkoal easily take hits from common threats like Zamazenta and Hawlucha while still living defensive Gholdengo's +2 Shadow Ball and two of Choice Specs Kyurem's Ice Beam. A specially defensive EV spread can instead help bolster Torkoal's middling Special Defense against the likes of Dragapult and Gholdengo, with 36 Defense EVs letting it survive +2 Weavile's Knock Off after Stealth Rock. Though Torkoal is rarely the choice to be Terastallized, Tera Flying can be used to remove its Ground-type weakness versus Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, while Tera Grass is an all-around solid defensive typing that greatly improves its matchups against rain teams and Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Hisuian Samurott while still maintaining a decent matchup against the aforementioned Ground-types.</p> <p>Torkoal should only be used on sun teams, where wallbreakers like Walking Wake take great advantage of the sun to activate Protosynthesis and power up their Fire-type moves and Hydro Steam. Raging Bolt is also an appreciated addition to sun teams to threaten Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Dondozo. Hisuian Lilligant is also a strong late-game cleaner on sun teams, helping check Ground-types while significantly improving the often difficult matchup against Iron Boulder thanks to outspeeding it with Chlorophyll active, and Venusaur can also serve as a slower if slightly bulkier Chlorophyll sweeper. Because Torkoal's primary role is to set sun, it appreciates teammates like Kingambit and Eject Button Hatterene that can switch into Knock Off and allow it to keep its Heat Rock. Despite also serving as an entry hazard remover, Torkoal is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks any form of reliable recovery, so it benefits from secondary removal support from teammates like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Hatterene is a great teammate that can serve as a tertiary form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, help keep its own threats healthy with Healing Wish, and check common Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk with Calm Mind sets.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its considerable bulk and more than reasonable attacking capabilities, Latias is a devastating setup threat that, in the right conditions, can easily snowball out of control, making it a solid Stored Power sweeper in this metagame. Latias has to pick its coverage option between Aura Sphere, which is its most immediate way to deal with Dark- and Steel-type foes, most notably Kingambit but also Iron Treads and Heatran, or Draining Kiss, which provides some recovery and threatens Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Meowscarada, and Darkrai equally. 24 EVs in Speed along with a Timid nature allow it to outrun Choice Scarf Darkrai after an Agility boost. Tera Poison is the way to go to avoid Toxic damage, turn opposing Gliscor into setup fodder, and only have a weakness to Psychic, which is a fairly uncommon attacking type. Tera Steel similarly allows Latias to bypass Toxic while adding some valuable immunities and resistances, negating efforts from Galarian Slowking and Primarina to stop it. Tera Fairy can be used along with Draining Kiss to boost its damage and subsequent healing and obtain a valuable Dragon immunity in the face of foes like Dragapult and Kyurem. Weakness Policy grants it an immediate way to boost its Stored Power in a single turn, taking advantage of common attacks like U-turn and Knock Off to let it snowball more easily, especially with dual screens support to soften the blow of most super effective hits. Leftovers is a fine alternative that gives it longevity and thus more opportunities to set up, especially if it forgoes Draining Kiss. Mental Herb is a niche option that allows Latias to bypass Taunt and Encore from Landorus-T, Iron Valiant, and Tinkaton.</p> <p>Latias finds itself a niche pick in hyper offense teams; in particular, it can support teams by dealing with Unaware foes like Dondozo and Clodsire as a way to open through and act as a win condition. Latias's base typing makes it vulnerable to several metagame threats such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. Gholdengo can overwhelm it by either outdamaging it with a Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball or crippling it with paralysis, sustaining its not very effective hits with Recover, and attacking back with Hex, while Dragapult outspeeds it before an Agility boost and threatens it with STAB moves or status. Kingambit makes for a great partner overall, checking Dragapult and Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Dark-type foes that Latias may be stopped by. Opposing Kingambit poses an existential threat to Latias, as without Aura Sphere, it fails to do much in return, and without spending your Tera on Latias, it leaves itself exposed to Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave and even Iron Head if it goes Tera Fairy. Iron Valiant can prove decisive in this matchup, as well as mixing well with the fast-paced plan a Latias team should have. Furthermore, breaking through Ting-Lu can prove to be challenging, so a strong wallbreaking partner such as Ogerpon-W or other special attackers like Raging Bolt could overwhelm it. Hazard support is really appreciated overall to help Latias clean in the endgame against a worn-down team, so Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott make for excellent partners. Latias also is a perfect match for teams championed by dual screens Deoxys-S or Alolan Ninetales, allowing it to set up multiple times with minimal damage taken.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Soul Dew equipped, Latios is a powerful offensive threat with a unique defensive profile that gives it a notable niche in the metagame, being one of the only offensive Pokemon with a complete immunity to Spikes. Psychic Noise allows Latios to shut down recovery attempts from defensive Pokemon, particularly Blissey and Corviknight; alternatively, Luster Purge is a much more powerful move, potentially allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo that would otherwise check it. Calm Mind gives Latios enough power to easily pressure defensive walls, notably OHKOing specially defensive Gliscor with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock; however, Aura Sphere can be considered as an alternative option that can hit Steel- and Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu that would otherwise force it out. Shadow Ball, while less common, can be used to smack the likes of Gholdengo and Iron Crown. Recover gives Latios more opportunities to fire off powerful attacks over the course of a game, combining with its Spikes immunity to shrug off most forms of passive damage. Tera Steel is invaluable as a defensive Tera type, granting Latios a total immunity to Toxic and also allowing it to set up against the likes of Galarian Slowking, Dragonite, and Enamorus, as well as alleviating pressure against Pokemon such as Weavile and Kingambit.</p> <p>Latios finds its niche on balance and bulky offense teams that enjoy its wallbreaking capabilities. Zamazenta is a phenomenal partner for Latios, capable of switching into and forcing out Dark-types such as Kingambit, Darkrai, and Weavile, and it appreciates Latios for being able to smash through physical walls like Gliscor and Alomomola. Kingambit is another Pokemon that enjoys Latios smashing holes through defensive teams carrying defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Moltres, and in turn, it can offensively check the likes of Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Hatterene; conversely, Tinkaton is a good alternative to Kingambit as a Steel-type, instead providing Latios with entry hazard support and being able to leverage its superior defensive profile to more reliably check threats like Iron Valiant, Darkrai, and Weavile. Knock Off support from the likes of Ogerpon, Weavile, and Meowscarada is also greatly appreciated and enables Latios to put even more pressure on defensive teams, allowing for the aforementioned faster teammates to clean up late-game; all of these Pokemon also appreciate Latios for being able to lure in and remove Kingambit with Aura Sphere. Hisuian Samurott is another excellent partner, as it provides both Knock Off support and hazard pressure in Ceaseless Edge, and acts as an offensive check to Kingambit and Gholdengo which Latios greatly enjoys, while Latios can easily come in on and threaten massive damage on Pokemon like Alomomola and Zapdos that can check Hisuian Samurott. Similarly, Ting-Lu is also appreciated as a teammate, providing Latios with a sturdy check to Dragapult, Darkrai, and Iron Crown while also being able to set hazards. Cinderace can offensively pressure many of the tier's Steel-types and can bring Latios in with U-turn against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Garganacl that Cinderace struggles to break past; Moltres is another great teammate for Latios, as it can act as a stopgap to threats like Kingambit, Kyurem, and Iron Valiant while also bringing Latios onto the field safely with its slow U-turn. Lastly, Great Tusk is another Pokemon that can remove items for Latios with Knock Off and provides Latios with a resilient offensive check to Kingambit; on the other hand, Great Tusk enjoys having Latios rip through its checks, particularly Alomomola, Zapdos, and Moltres.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its superb stats and solid movepool, Latios proves to be an amazing speed control option with Choice Scarf, outspeeding fast foes like Walking Wake, Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Enamorus, Zamazenta, and +1 Speed Great Tusk as well as Speed tying Iron Moth. Aura Sphere is a great coverage option that allows Latios to destroy Kingambit and Iron Treads. Psychic Noise helps Latios break past fat teams in a better fashion by denying recovery like Gliscor's Poison Heal and Garganacl's Leftovers and Recover and hits foes like Iron Moth and Zamazenta behind a Substitute. However, Luster Purge's power can be preferred to revenge kill Enamorus and Zamazenta more reliably and, with the drops, potentially wallbreak bulky foes like Galarian Slowking at the cost of having very low PP. Trick cripples its would-be checks like Ting-Lu and Iron Crown while also shutting down Calm Mind users like Clefable, Hatterene, and Sinistcha. Tera Steel flips all of its Ice and Fairy weakness from foes like Weavile, Kyurem, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant and provides a resistance to Dragonite's Extreme Speed; it works well with Levitate to ignore even the aforementioned Kyurem, Enamorus, and Dragonite's Ground-type coverage move.</p> <p>Latios works best on bulky offense and balance teams. It really appreciates entry hazard support to maximize its pressure against the opposing team. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Hisuian Samurott and Gliscor are great teammates, as is Ting-Lu, which can also choose to run Stealth Rock. Garganacl is a great option for Stealth Rock support, and it racks up damage on the opposing team by spamming Salt Cure, opening up win paths for Latios and its teammates. These Pokemon also help Latios deal with its own threats like Gholdengo and Iron Crown. Zamazenta pairs excellently with Latios, taking care of specially bulky foes that Latios struggles against such as Ting-Lu and Blissey as well as answering checks like Kingambit and Darkrai. In addition, both of them do a great job in pressuring shared checks like Gholdengo and Primarina. Other physical wallbreakers such as Kingambit and Ogerpon-W also have great synergy with Latios. Kingambit handles Gholdengo for Latios, and together, they form a great late-game duo. In a similar vein, Ogerpon-W can deal with Pokemon like Ting-Lu and pressure opposing teams enough in the early- and mid-game for Latios to pick off chipped foes late-game. Other special attackers such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown also pair well with Latios because they can pressure shared checks like Dark-types, most notably Ting-Lu. Finally, Great Tusk is a stellar teammate that can help Latios deal with Gholdengo, Tinkaton, Dark-types, and special walls while also providing valuable Stealth Rock and hazard removal support.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its monstrous Speed, decent attacking stats, and amazing coverage, Deoxys-S can function as a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in OU and outspeeds plenty of boosted Pokemon as well, such as +1 Great Tusk and +1 Dragonite. Fighting-type coverage is required to hit Dark- and Steel-types that switch into Psycho Boost, like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Superpower can be run to hit special walls like Blissey, but Focus Blast doesn't have any stat drops and also benefits from boosts from Nasty Plot. Knock Off removes items, helping it break down walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Shadow Ball can be used instead if it's running Nasty Plot and to avoid being walled by Hatterene. In its last move slot, it can run Ice Beam for even greater coverage, letting it destroy Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. However, Psycho Boost hits the latter two hard anyway, so Nasty Plot can be ran instead to drastically increase its killing power if it’s running only special moves. For example, +2 Psycho Boost can OHKO Primarina without Assault Vest, +2 Focus Blast can OHKO specially defensive Heatran, and +2 Shadow Ball can OHKO Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. Finally, Taunt can be used as utility, denying hazards, setup, and keeping Deoxys-S free from status like Gliscor's Toxic and Clefable's Thunder Wave, and also stopping Galarian Slowking from gaining momentum with Chilly Reception. Other moves Deoxys-S can run include Expanding Force over Psycho Boost if it's used with Psychic Terrain and Stealth Rock or Spikes in its last slot to take advantage of switches. A Timid nature should be ran if using Nasty Plot, but a Naive nature should be used if running a mixed set. A Hasty nature is an alternative to better take special moves like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, but it makes Deoxys-S weaker into common priority like Extreme Speed and Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting is its premier Tera type, giving it STAB on its Fighting-type coverage, letting it hit Psycho Boost switch-ins harder. It guarantees that Superpower will 2HKO Heatran and Iron Treads and lets +2 Focus Blast OHKO Ting-Lu. It also has defensive utility, like giving it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost can be useful on Shadow Ball sets to break past its Psychic-type switch-ins, letting it get a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Latias. It also gives Deoxys-S an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Finally, Tera Psychic further boosts its Psycho Boosts, which lets it guarantee an OHKO into Walking Wake and Ogerpon-W. Life Orb boosts its damage output, but Expert Belt can be used instead to avoid recoil damage. However, missing out on Life Orb can cost Deoxys-S some KOs like missing a 2HKO on Clefable with Psycho Boost and losing the ability to do substantial damage to Corviknight.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Offensive teammates such as Dragonite and Darkrai like the holes Deoxys-S pokes into opposing teams. It can damage walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking for these teammates or check other offensive Pokemon that outspeed them like Zamazenta and Dragapult. Its Fighting-type coverage takes care of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, removing checks for other teammates like its own Kingambit and Dragapult. Similarly, its Ghost- or Dark-type coverage lets it take out Hatterene and Gholdengo, opening up opportunities for teammates like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder to clean up late-game. Thanks to its perfect coverage, it is able to deal decent damage to any opponent, further opening holes for its teammates. This includes Pokemon like Alomomola, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Offensive teammates also appreciate its fast Knock Off removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from teammates like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora help with breaking as well. Similarly, if it runs Taunt, teammates such as Iron Moth like its fast Taunt denying hazards, stopping setup from opponents, and limiting recovery. While Deoxys-S has great coverage, its base 95 attacking stats are relatively low, and Psycho Boost lowering its Special Attack is less than ideal. As such, it can struggle to break past certain walls it can't hit super effectively like Corviknight and Assault Vest Primarina. Raging Bolt can freely switch into Corviknight and set up free Calm Minds as it switches out. Despite its massive natural Speed stat, Deoxys-S is still outsped by a lot of prominent boosted Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Choice Scarf Darkrai. These can be covered by carrying offensive checks to these mons like Gholdengo and Dragonite. Deoxys-S is also horribly weak to priority. It doesn't have many ways to work around Sucker Punch, and other priority like Grassy Glide and Extreme Speed hit it hard. A way around this is having teammates that can easily take common priority like Kingambit, Great Tusk, or Dragonite. Additionally, dual screen setters, like Alolan Ninetales, can help against priority and assist Deoxys-S in setting up Nasty Plots. Psychic Terrain from Indeedee is another option due to it blocking priority, and it also boosts Deoxys-S’s Psychic-type STAB moves.</p>"

      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This Deoxys-S set uses Heavy-Duty Boots for more longevity, which makes it a great anti-offense tool. Knock Off allows Deoxys-S to punish pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight and threatens defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Moltres by removing their items. Superpower lets it threaten dangerous Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Weavile, and Darkrai as well as other Pokemon such as Blissey. Ice Beam makes quick work of both Gliscor and Landorus-T, preventing them from setting entry hazards or pivoting out. The EV spread allows Deoxys-S to outspeed Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk. Tera Fighting allows Deoxys-S to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit and dispatch it on the spot with Superpower, and getting a chance to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Superpower can also come in handy.</p> <p>This set fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, as it provides the necessary speed control for teams, forcing out strong yet frail sweepers with its coverage as well as helping soften more defensive teams via Knock Off. This set struggles with Deoxys-S's lack of firepower combined with its frailty, making it hard to win games on its own. For these reasons, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor are great partners because they make Deoxys-S's ability to remove items much more dangerous against Pokemon with Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres. Wallbreakers like Gholdengo, Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Kingambit appreciate Deoxys-S's efforts to soften up and cripple Pokemon with Knock Off, allowing them to break through defensive teams more easily. Slow bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight can tank hits and bring Deoxys-S safely onto the field. Corviknight also helps defensively by checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, giving Deoxys-S another layer of security. Alomomola provides momentum via Flip Turn and Wish support to keep Deoxys-S healthy. In return, Deoxys-S threatens Alomomola's greatest counter, Ogerpon-W, with STAB Psycho Boost. Skeledirge makes for an interesting partner, as it switches into common priority like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which it can then use as an opportunity to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp or start a snowball effect with Torch Song. Zamazenta is another great check to the aforementioned Dark-types, protecting Deoxys-S and using early-game chip damage to brute force its way to victory with Body Press. Deoxys-S and Zamazenta can work in tandem to pressure Galarian Slowking with the combination of Knock Off and Crunch, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Deoxys-S is the second-fastest Stealth Rock user in OU, only being outpaced by Speed Booster Energy Iron Treads, and possesses a wide utility movepool that allows it to function as an excellent lead on hyper offense teams. Psychic Noise denies recovery against Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Corviknight, and it also deals heavy damage to Great Tusk and Glimmora. Knock Off further cripples defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking. Superpower is a 2HKO against Hisuian Samurott and Darkrai, two common leads that threaten Deoxys-S, and deals solid damage to Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Taunt provides utility by denying entry hazards and status from bulky leads such as Clefable and Gliscor, as well as preventing sweepers such as Dragonite from setting up. 104 Speed EVs let Deoxys-S outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while the rest of its EVs are invested into physical bulk to survive hits such as Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge. Tera Ghost blocks Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, while Tera Dark turns Deoxys-S's Dark and Ghost weaknesses into resistances, which is useful against the aforementioned Hisuian Samurott. Colbur Berry allows Deoxys-S to survive Dark-type attacks that would normally result in a KO and hit back with Superpower, helping against Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott. Red Card is an alternative option that can force out the opposing lead into something less ideal, potentially granting a free turn.</p> <p>This set fits best on hyper offense teams with powerful wallbreakers that appreciate Deoxys-S's ability to wear down defensive Pokemon. Physical sweepers such as Great Tusk and Zamazenta have a much easier time dealing with Corviknight after its Rocky Helmet has been removed, while Iron Moth and Raging Bolt become much more threatening once Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking lose their items. Great Tusk also provides hazard removal for sets that forgo running Taunt. Hisuian Samurott may be run as a secondary hazard setter that can also pivot into Gholdengo. Deoxys-S struggles to set Stealth Rock against Hatterene due to Magic Bounce, so it appreciates Steel-type attackers such as Gholdengo and Iron Crown that can force it out; the former has additional utility in denying hazard removal attempts. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds Deoxys-S and threatens an OHKO on sets without Colbur Berry, making Great Tusk and Iron Valiant solid teammates able to take advantage of it locking into Dark Pulse. Finally, Deoxys-S sets without Taunt are at risk of being exploited by setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Kyurem, which survive a Superpower and outspeed Deoxys-S after one boost, making IronPress Zamazenta a solid partner.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its unparalleled Speed tier and access to an array of solid utility options, Deoxys-S is one of the best dual screens setters in OU. Taunt is key in preventing Pokemon like Glimmora, Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T from laying entry hazards, setup threats such as Swords Dance Ogerpon-W from boosting, and Cinderace from using Court Change. Psycho Boost lets Deoxys-S have some sort of offensive presence; it can obliterate lead Glimmora while overwhelming neutral targets like Dondozo and physically defensive Skeledirge. Deoxys-S generally should not Terastallize, as being unable to Terastallize a wallbreaker later in the match could be game ending. However, in a pinch, Tera Steel can let it more easily set dual screens against priority users like Weavile, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is a fixture on dual screens hyper offense teams thanks to its absolutely blazing Speed that surpasses every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, letting it ensure at least one of Reflect or Light Screen go up. Setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Kingambit are amazing at making use of Deoxys-S's screens support, taking a hit from Deoxys-S's potential revenge killers such as Kingambit and Lokix with it and being able to strike back strong. Due to Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be denied by Deoxys-S, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Hisuian Samurott such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus are good teammates. Entry hazard control options like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Hatterene also make for good partners in the event that Deoxys-S is unable to prevent hazards being set. Great Tusk and Hatterene in particular can double as potent bulky setup sweepers with Bulk Up and Calm Mind, respectively. Other bulky setup Pokemon like Latias and Iron Crown benefit similarly from screens.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Garchomp works as a good defensive piece thanks to its access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, good defensive typing backed up by solid defensive stats, and phazing to deal with foes attempting to set up on it. Dragon Tail allows Garchomp to deny foes such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Swords Dance Ogerpon-W the opportunity to set up on it. In addition, it can switch out non-Heavy-Duty Boots users such as the aforementioned Ogerpon-W as well as Ting-Lu and force them to take large amounts of entry hazard damage when attempting to switch back in. Another benefit of its phazing is that it can nullify Booster Energy, making foes like Terastallized Raging Bolt and Iron Moth waste their Booster Energy against Garchomp. Rough Skin, when paired with Rocky Helmet, makes Garchomp a nightmare for the common Rapid Spin users in Great Tusk and Iron Treads while punishing reckless U-turn uses from foes such as Landorus-T and Cinderace. Tera Ghost allows Garchomp to both stop the aforementioned Rapid Spin users from removing hazards while shedding its Ice and Fairy weaknesses. It also gives Garchomp a Fighting immunity to check Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant and completely stop Iron Defense + Body Press Zamazenta. On the other hand, Tera Steel allows Garchomp to turn the tables on Fairy-types like Hatterene and beat them one-on-one while affording a handy Ice resistance to phaze foes like Kyurem and Ice Beam Darkrai. The given EV spread allows Garchomp to outspeed Raging Bolt.</p> <p>This Garchomp set fits well on balance teams that appreciate its ability to force damage through entry hazards and punishing contact moves, especially Rapid Spin, while being able to phaze out dangerous setup sweepers and act as a general anti-offense tool. Garchomp despises Ice-type moves from the likes of Kyurem, Darkrai, and Dragon Dance Dragonite with Ice Spinner as well as Fairy-types like Clefable, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Gliscor, so checks like Gholdengo, Zamazenta, and Galarian Slowking are great partners. Air Balloon Gholdengo in particular is a great partner, as it blocks any attempts to remove the hazards set by Garchomp by foes like Great Tusk and Corviknight that otherwise wall Garchomp while being able to scare them away. Pecharunt fills a lot of the same roles as Gholdengo while also providing pivoting in the form of Parting Shot and absorbing Toxic Spikes, making it another viable option. Moltres is another good partner, as it both helps phaze foes with Roar as well as add on even more chip damage and punish Rapid Spin attempts through Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body burns, respectively, while checking threatening Fairy-types like Enamorus and foes like SubTect Kyurem. Galarian Slowking checks Fairy-types like Enamorus and Hatterene well while setting up Future Sight to force out foes Garchomp is walled by, such as Zamazenta, Pecharunt, and defensive Great Tusk, allowing Garchomp to set more hazards up. Wallbreakers that appreciate Garchomp's hazard setting capabilities such as all-out attacking Zamazenta, Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem, Darkrai, and Kingambit are also good picks alongside it.</p>"

Weavile also provides excellent speed control for teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame besides Darkrai, Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S while being able to slot in Ice Shard to pick off faster threats like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Triple Axel's sheer power can be forgone for Icicle Crash's non-contact nature, preventing Weavile from being punished by Moltres's Flame Body and Zapdos's Static. Swords Dance allows Weavile to OHKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Triple Axel and OHKO Enamorus and Dragapult after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard. Low Kick can be slotted over Swords Dance to OHKO opposing Weavile and Kingambit as well as hitting Hisuian Samurott super effectively, but dropping Swords Dance limits Weavile's power and leaves it always walled by Skarmory and Clefable. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard to increase its wallbreaking and revenge killing potential, with +2 Tera Ice Triple Axel OHKOing Clefable and most Skarmory variants after Stealth Rock damage and +2 Tera Ice Ice Shard OHKOing Dragonite. Tera Ghost provides an immunity from the revenge killing attempts of Zamazenta and Extreme Speed Dragonite.</p> <p>Weavile's excellent wallbreaking capabilities and capability to fit on offense, balance, and semi-stall teams give it great synergy with a wide variety of Pokemon. Spikers are the best Pokemon to pair with Weavile because Weavile is excellent at using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. On slower teams, Spikers that benefit from Weavile include Gliscor, Skarmory and Ting-Lu, while on faster teams, Weavile supports Hisuian Samurott and Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock is less effective against most Weavile answers other than Skarmory and Corviknight, but they still synergize with Weavile's Knock Off. Stealth Rock setters on offensive teams include Glimmora and Landorus-T, while bulkier teams can make use of Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Clefable. Weavile also benefits other physical attackers that appreciate Weavile using Knock Off on Pokemon like Skarmory, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Alomomola. Kingambit is the biggest beneficiary of Weavile's Knock Off, but other physical attackers like Hisuian Samurott and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can also take advantage of its Knock Off to break through Pokemon like Dondozo and prevent chip damage from Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Special attackers like Raging Bolt and Dragapult can draw in special walls like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire for Weavile to come in on for opportunities to use Knock Off; Dragapult in particular can use U-turn to pivot to Weavile. Weavile struggles with faster Pokemon that can't be threatened with Ice Shard, which includes boosted Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and boosted Iron Boulder. On slower teams, Pokemon that can wall these faster foes are appreciated like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking for Iron Valiant, while Dondozo and Skarmory are best for Iron Boulder and Zamazenta. On faster teams, Gholdengo and priority users like Raging Bolt can check them. Galarian Slowking in particular is excellent, as Weavile appreciates support from Chilly Reception giving it entry on Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ting-Lu, while Future Sight prevents switch-ins like Zamazenta, Dondozo and Skarmory from coming in. Dondozo, Zamazenta and Skarmory can counter Weavile, but Dragapult and Gholdengo can swap into their attacks and force progress; Dragapult threatens heavy damage or burn, while Gholdengo can use these Pokemon to boost with Nasty Plot.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Dragonite. Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Zapdos and Enamorus. Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Swords Dance Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, and hits Dragonite hard while still targeting Rillaboom. Gliscor greatly appreciates Tera Normal's immunity to Ghost-type attacks, most notably Hex from Dragapult and Gholdengo looking to turn Gliscor's Poison Heal into a liability. Its neutral typing against most threats is also helpful to handle foes like Kyurem better. Tera Normal should always be run alongside Facade to muscle past physically bulky threats like Moltres, Zapdos, and Alomomola after a Swords Dance. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively while letting it take on Fire-type Pokemon like Iron Moth and Cinderace more comfortably as well; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. A specically defensive spread allows Gliscor to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, Raging Bolt, and Iron Moth, with the 36 Defense EVs letting it comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health. However, a physically defensive spread gives Gliscor the ability to better handle foes like Landorus-T, Cinderace, and Great Tusk, with 16 Special Defense EVs to survive both Enamorus's +1 Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full health. Maximum Speed investment with an EV spread of 244 HP / 12 Atk / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature is also an option, as it allows Gliscor to Speed tie Kyurem and get the jump on Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Cinderace and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder.</p>"

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor is a premier Spikes user in the metagame. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including a boosted Iron Moth's Fiery Dance, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace and Moltres. Earthquake gives it a reliable STAB move to immediately threaten foes like Raging Bolt, Kingambit, and Iron Moth. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Toxic also works well with Earthquake, as it can be used to pressure Toxic-immune foes like Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user. Knock Off also complements its Earthquake, as it can be used to pop Air Balloon from Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Tinkaton that can otherwise wall Gliscor. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Walking Wake and Kyurem. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene, which otherwise has an extremely favorable matchup against the team. A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature checks Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be run instead to let Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, and Zamazenta, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus's Moonblast and +1 Raging Bolt's Dragon Pulse from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna, which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in, as well as Body Press from Zamazenta. However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time.</p> <p>Gliscor functions best on entry hazard-stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor’s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Walking Wake, Serperior, and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo, Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and the niche Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Rotom-W is a defensive pivot that takes advantage of its good defensive stats, typing, and ability. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to pivot out, letting its frailer offensive teammates in without fear of taking a substantial amount of damage. Hydro Pump synergizes well with Volt Switch, punishing Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Pain Split serves as a semi-reliable recovery option that lets it more consistently check threats like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Darkrai throughout the course of a game. It also uses defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Blissey as an opportunity to get back to full health due to the large differences in health. Will-O-Wisp is preferred with the physically defensive set in order to cripple physical threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Dragonite, and Thunder Wave is used with the specially defensive spread to cripple fast special attackers like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Walking Wake. Leftovers is run to give Rotom-W additional passive recovery, but Rocky Helmet can also be used on physically defensive sets in order to punish contact attackers like Landorus-T, Cinderace, and Zamazenta. Both spreads run 44 Speed EVs to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Tera Steel is used to gain a Toxic immunity, letting it completely wall Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, and Clodsire, and makes use of Levitate to wall foes like Kyurem, Dragonite, and Enamorus.</p> <p>Rotom-W best fits on balance and bulky offense teams utilizing pivoting cores like Landorus-T on bulky offense and Galarian Slowking on balance to make progress. Rotom-W is able to threaten Gliscor and Corviknight for Landorus-T, and Landorus-T is able to alleviate the Raging Bolt matchup, as well as checking Zamazenta. Rotom-W helps Galarian Slowking by switching into Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk that Galarian Slowking hates facing, and Galarian Slowking is able to check threats such as Kyurem's special attacking variants, Ogerpon, and Serperior for it. Gliscor is able to set Spikes, which stacks up chip alongside Rotom-W's frequent pivoting, and Swords Dance variants greatly appreciate Rotom-W being able to take on Corviknight and Skarmory for it. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Sinistcha are excellent partners because they are able to take on Ogerpon-W, which can switch in on Hydro Pump and threaten Rotom-W with Power Whip or Encore. Rotom-W is able to return the favor by checking Weavile and Fire-types like Heatran and Moltres for them. Garganacl is another good partner for Rotom-W, as Rotom-W can threaten Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that Garganacl struggles against, while Garganacl can stack chip damage through Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, as well as checking threats like Dragapult and Kyurem. Ting-Lu fits with physically defensive Rotom-W on balance teams to check Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult, since Dragapult resists both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and can threaten it back with Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor or Shadow Ball, while Gholdengo has enough natural special bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Hydro Pump and is immune to Rotom-W's status moves. Dragapult and Gholdengo themselves work well with Rotom-W because it can spread status effectively for both Pokemon to fire off boosted Hex later, which is especially good since Rotom-W also cripples Dark-types like Kingambit and Darkrai. Tinkaton can also work well with Rotom-W as a hazard setter that can punish setup sweepers and check Kyurem without needing to use Terastallization on Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Heatran is a fearsome wallbreaker capable of easily shutting down defensive teams, leveraging its defensive profile to find multiple opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Magma Storm is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that can trap Pokemon like Blissey and Toxapex. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit Fire-types that would otherwise resist Magma Storm such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and opposing Leftovers Heatran. Taunt completely shuts down recovery from defensive Pokemon that would otherwise withstand its offensive assault such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey, and it allows Heatran to beat each of these Pokemon 1-on-1 in tandem with Magma Storm. Stealth Rock can be considered in the last slot, as Heatran's consistency in forcing switches can give it a free turn to set up Stealth Rock; however, Will-O-Wisp can be used to hinder switch-ins such as Dragonite and Ting-Lu that would otherwise freely switch in against Heatran. A Timid nature lets Heatran outspeed and threaten Choice Band Rillaboom, in addition to quickly burning Adamant Dragonite with Will-O-Wisp, though a Modest nature could be considered to guarantee an OHKO on bulky Kingambit variants. Tera Grass flips Heatran's matchup against Water- and Ground-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T and synergizes very well with Flash Fire; Tera Ghost grants Heatran a crucial Fighting immunity that can help against Zamazenta, in addition to blocking Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Leftovers provides Heatran with passive recovery and allows it to stick around over the course of the match; Air Balloon could also be used to provide Heatran with a temporary Ground immunity, letting it safely switch into Landorus-T and opposing Heatran.</p> <p>Heatran fits primarily on offense and bulky offense teams where it excels in ripping apart defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. Special sweepers such as Primarina and Raging Bolt greatly enjoy Heatran trapping and removing their checks, particularly Blissey. In return, Primarina discourages Ground-type switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, while Raging Bolt can force out Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Rillaboom is another fantastic teammate for Heatran that not only provides it with extra passive recovery and more resistance against Earthquake but can form a formidable offensive core with it, with Rillaboom capable of handling Ground- and Water-types such as Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W and Heatran taking advantage of Rillaboom's switch-ins like Corviknight and Skeledirge, alongside setting Stealth Rock to spread chip damage for both itself and Rillaboom. Additionally, some of Rillaboom's teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene appreciate Heatran removing their checks via Magma Storm, allowing them to more easily sweep late-game, while both Pokemon can force out Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Lastly, Heatran enjoys Rapid Spin support from Great Tusk removing entry hazards that cut into its longevity, and it also enjoys having a check to Dragonite. In exchange, Heatran can easily switch in on and threaten Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Weavile, and Calm Mind Iron Valiant that Great Tusk struggles against.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is a useful glue Pokemon that can stallbreak, set entry hazards, spread status, and check notable special attackers like Gholdengo, Hatterene, and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power is a much-needed coverage move to hit Pokemon like opposing Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge super effectively. Taunt is used to shut down recovery attempts from walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Skeledirge that are trapped by Magma Storm, prevent Galarian Slowking from using Chilly Reception to escape Magma Storm's trapping, and prevent setup from both slower hazard setters like Clefable and Ting-Lu and slower setup sweepers like Terastallized Kingambit and Primarina. Stealth Rock is an extremely good fit since Heatran has excellent special bulk and threatens forms of hazard removal like Defog Corviknight and prevents Rapid Spin Great Tusk from switching in with a hard-hitting Magma Storm, keeping entry hazards up in the process. It is also able to punish Hatterene from switching in to deflect Stealth Rock back with Magic Bounce since it is unable to hit Heatran back for any notable damage. Will-O-Wisp can be used as a way to better check physical threats that enjoy switching in like Dragonite and Hisuian Samurott; repeatedly chip down walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Dondozo; and neutralize Kingambit safely by bypassing its Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp also pairs with Magma Storm quite nicely since the chip damage stacks up over time. 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP investment guarantees Heatran will live an Earthquake from Clodsire. 40 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Adamant Kingambit so it can secure a Magma Storm or Will-O-Wisp on it before it can retaliate with Kowtow Cleave or Low Kick. Leftovers gives Heatran a form of recovery, which can prove useful in a match where it's tasked with checking numerous special threats throughout the course of a game. However, Air Balloon is also a good choice, as it allows Heatran to come in on Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor and Clodsire, and turn them into an opportunity to either trap them or get Stealth Rock up. Air Balloon also makes Heatran immune to Spikes, allowing it to come in much more safely against hazard stacking teams, and is a great item in general to emergency check Dragonite and Bulk Up Great Tusk with Will-O-Wisp. Flash Fire is generally the preferred ability of choice since it gives Heatran a Fire-type immunity to better check Iron Moth; however, Flame Body is also quite viable because it threatens burns against contact attackers such as Weavile, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom. Tera Grass allows Heatran to remove its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type attacks so it can wall Water-types like Dondozo and Ogerpon-W and Ground-types like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor. Tera Grass also works well with Flash Fire to mitigate its newfound Fire weakness. Tera Ghost is used to remove its weakness to Fighting-type attacks so it can wall Zamazenta. Tera Ghost also gives it a Normal immunity, preventing Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin on it to remove its Stealth Rock and, if paired with Air Balloon, outright walling Dragonite if its only attacks are Extreme Speed and Earthquake or Fire Punch. Tera Fairy is also worth mentioning as a niche option to check physical attackers like Zamazenta without the Dark weakness from foes like Meowscarada and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Heatran is best used on Grassy Terrain bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Fire-types while also being a great progress maker itself. Rillaboom is by far its best teammate, as they both have near-perfect synergy with each other; Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain not only provides additional recovery for it on top of Leftovers, it also weakens Earthquake from common Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T. Rillaboom itself also threatens the Water- and Ground-types that constantly give Heatran trouble, like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Ogerpon-W, and brings in Heatran safely on its checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with U-turn. In return, Heatran is able to check Fire-types Rillaboom doesn't want to face, like Skeledirge and opposing Heatran. Great Tusk is another stellar teammate since Heatran is extremely weak to entry hazards, so its hazard removal support is much appreciated. Hatterene is a teammate that can prevent hazards from being set up altogether thanks to Magic Bounce and wall Gliscor in Grassy Terrain, which is super useful since Heatran often struggles to check numerous threats consistently when Spikes are on the field. Grassy Terrain sweepers like Hawlucha, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt love Heatran's ability to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Skeledirge, Galarian Slowking, Dondozo, and Ting-Lu so they can clean up late-game. On bulkier teams, Alomomola is a fitting teammate for it since its Wish support allows Heatran to stay alive for a prolonged period of time, and its typing checks common physical Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Spikers like Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu all work well with Heatran since they have good synergy typing-wise and their Spikes increases the potency of Magma Storm + Will-O-Wisp pressure. They can also form a hazard stacking core together with Stealth Rock Heatran.</p>"

Moonlight lets Cresselia leverage its excellent bulk to set Trick Room more reliably. Ice Beam is used in order to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, while Moonblast allows Cresselia to pressure Dark-type switch-ins such as Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott. Mental Herb allows Cresselia to bypass Taunt from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Deoxys-S. Tera Poison gives Cresselia a solid defensive typing, removing its weakness to U-turn and giving it an immunity to poison, greatly improving its longevity while also pairing well with Levitate, while Tera Fairy removes Cresselia's Dark weakness and powers up its Moonblast, allowing it to flip common matchups against threats such as the aforementioned Darkrai, which it can now 2HKO.</p> <p>Cresselia's ability to set Trick Room is greatly appreciated by slow, bulky wallbreakers such as Ursaluna, Iron Hands, and Kingambit, all of which find opportunities to break under Trick Room easily with their low Speed. Iron Hands is able to break down common defensive pieces such as Alomomola and Gliscor, which would otherwise stall out Trick Room turns, with its STAB combination and Ice Punch. Iron Hands also provides Cresselia with a switch-in against common Dark-type threats such as Kingambit, Darkrai, and Hisuian Samurott. Kingambit also handles Darkrai as well as handling Gholdengo. Other excellent partners under Trick Room include Raging Bolt and Enamorus-T, due to their low Speed, high bulk, and ability to break through defensive Pokemon, with the former dealing with certain Steel-types such as Corviknight and Skarmory and the latter threatening Dark-types such as Ting-Lu. Cresselia also appreciates other Trick Room setters to set it multiple times in a game; Hatterene is its best partner, due to its ability to deny entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. In return, Cresselia can use Lunar Dance in order to keep Hatterene alive so it can continue to deny hazards and set Trick Room again. Lunar Dance is also able to heal teammates such as Iron Hands and Kingambit after a burn and allow Ursaluna to stay alive and break for longer. Cresselia also finds itself vulnerable to Ghost-types such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Pecharunt, meaning checks such as Hoopa-U, Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu are appreciated. Ting-Lu also sets Stealth Rock, chipping down defensive pieces for some of the aforementioned Trick Room sweepers to make the most of the turns Cresselia can give. Faster partners include Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-Wellspring, with the former two threatening Dark-types for Cresselia, while in return, Cresselia is able to keep them healthy using Lunar Dance.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Darkrai is an excellent wallbreaker and cleaner, gaining many opportunities to use Nasty Plot due to its amazing base Speed and a diverse coverage movepool backed up with a good Special Attack stat and enough bulk to set up against passive Pokemon. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Ground-type Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Dragonite, Gliscor, and Great Tusk that can take its Dark Pulse. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Clefable, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus as well as Pokemon that commonly use Tera Fairy like Gholdengo and Garganacl. Focus Blast tears through bulky Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit as well as Blissey. Psyshock can be used to hit Blissey and Clodsire hard. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Darkrai to come in and wallbreak repeatedly without getting chipped down by entry hazards. Leftovers give it general longevity and fits better on teams with hazard removal. Expert Belt makes use of Darkrai's ability to hit most of the metagame for super effective damage with its coverage moves, letting it pressure checks like Ting-Lu and Clefable more easily. Tera Poison boosts Darkrai's Sludge Bomb and allows it to avoid revenge killing attempts from Iron Valiant and Zamazenta thanks to the Fairy- and Fighting-type resistances it gains. Tera Ghost gives a full immunity to Zamazenta's Fighting-type moves and is helpful to prevent Dragonite from revenge killing Darkrai with Extreme Speed. Tera Fighting can be used to power up Focus Blast to extreme levels of power to become Darkrai's strongest viable move, notably being able to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Darkrai's wallbreaking capabilities are useful on offensively oriented teams, having strong synergies with other Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Kingambit and other special attackers like Raging Bolt and Dragapult. Hisuian Samurott and Kingambit pair with Darkrai to overwhelm or lure shared checks like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant while gaining opportunities to wallbreak by switching into each other's counters. Darkrai's Bad Dreams punishes Dondozo's Rest, further enhancing its synergy with Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott as well as other physical attackers like Zamazenta, as switching into Darkrai as Dondozo comes in to wall them will result in Bad Dreams chip without burning a sleep turn. Raging Bolt and Dragapult appreciate Darkrai's ability to break through balance teams, tearing through walls like Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking, while mixed Dragapult and Raging Bolt, especially with Taunt, can help break through Clodsire. Dragapult provides a stop to Zamazenta and punishes Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp if Darkrai isn't running Focus Blast. Darkrai appreciates support from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as their hazards, especially Spikes, make Darkrai much more threatening, wearing down switch-ins like Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Darkrai heavily pressures hazard removers like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Cinderace. Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T in particular have deeper synergy with Darkrai; Hisuian Samurott wears down Primarina, switches into Darkrai checks like Blissey and Clodsire to set up Spikes on forced switches, and can use Flip Turn to safely bring in Darkrai on physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and Alomomola to gain free turns. Landorus-T is an excellent physical blanket check and can switch into threatening Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Booster Energy Great Tusk that can threaten Darkrai, and it can use U-turn to bring in Darkrai safely on Pokemon like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T. Gholdengo is an excellent teammate due to it providing a check to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Enamorus while being able to counter most Zamazenta variants if running a physically defensive set. Rillaboom can threaten answers to Darkrai like Primarina, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire while being able to pivot Darkrai in on Pokemon like defensive Gholdengo, Skarmory, and Corviknight to keep up momentum. Assault Vest Primarina is an excellent partner that blanket checks many special attackers including Iron Valiant and Deoxys-S, pivots Darkrai in on its checks like Galarian Slowking, and pressures shared walls such as Blissey and Terastallized Clodsire for Darkrai to break through.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Darkrai, owing to its already impressive Speed stat, is among one of the tier's most consistent revenge killers and an outstanding piece of speed control. Outspeeding the entirety of OU's metagame, Choice Scarf Darkrai reliably threatens Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and Enamorus. It can also threaten other, more specially bulky Pokemon with prior chip damage. Sludge Bomb is mandatory to threaten Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Ice Beam effectively forces out many common Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which otherwise could easily set up entry hazards against it. Trick allows Darkrai to incapacitate a sweeper, like Dragonite and Hatterene, or a wall, like Clodsire, long-term and grants it the flexibility of being able to switch moves when the extra Speed isn't needed, such as against bulkier teams. Focus Blast is an option to smash Steel-types and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Iron Treads as well as hitting Ting-Lu harder than Ice Beam. Tera Poison is used to strengthen Sludge Bomb's damage output, allowing it to threaten the bulkier Clefable while also coming with the added benefit of resisting the many Fairy-types' Moonblast, Zamazenta's STAB moves, and letting survive Rillaboom's Grassy Glide in a pinch. Alternatively, Tera Dark is a solid offensive option, turning many 3HKOs like against Walking Wake into 2HKOs. Additionally, late-game, a boosted Dark Pulse can easily clean up a weakened team. Tera Fighting can also be used with Focus Blast, giving the move incredible power that allows Darkrai to 2HKO the mighty Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Darkrai fits best on offensive teams that necessitate its revenge killing talents. It’s important to note that Darkrai actually has issues revenge killing as a result of Terastallization, with many usually clean revenge kills being complicated by this mechanic. This issue is only compounded by the fact that all of Darkrai’s moves all have common switch-ins, so it’s very important to have other answers to the Pokemon Darkrai aims to revenge kill. As a result, Primarina is a solid partner, with its typing and firepower being able to check switch-ins to Dark Pulse like Iron Valiant, Enamrous, and Heatran, safely scout for potential Terastallizations against them, and provide momentum with Flip Turn. Landorus-T is similarly a good partner, with its ability to check physical attackers that Darkrai can't safely revenge kill in the event of Terastallization, such as Dragonite and Great Tusk; it also provides momentum with U-turn and helps put Darkrai's victims into range of its attacks with Stealth Rock. Additionally, it can disrupt many of Darkrai switch-ins with Taunt, like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Blissey. On the topic of entry hazards, Great Tusk and Cinderace are also good partners, as they provide hazard control that is seriously appreciated by Darkrai, which otherwise will get chipped down as it switches in and out of the field to apply pressure. Great Tusk checks many priority users that would otherwise deny Darkrai its ability to revenge kill, such as Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. It also can pressure Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, denying their hazards and threatening them with significant damage that prevents them from switching into Darkrai. Cinderace is effective as a result of its ability to remove entry hazards Court Change and spread burns to Pokemon that could otherwise outpace Darkrai, such as Rillaboom and Dragonite, while its U-turn dents Hisuian Samurott. Dragapult is also a great partner due to its anti-offensive nature, with its speedy Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allowing it to be Darkrai's fallback line in the event of an unexpected Tera. It handles many switch-ins like Rillaboom, the Ogerpon formes, and Zamazenta by debilitating them with status and providing pivoting with U-turn. Dragapult can also deconstruct stall, which Darkrai matches up poorly into. Kingambit also loves Darkrai's ability to outpace Iron Valiant, as Darkrai opens up Kingambit late-game by KOing or at least forcing chip damage on key targets, putting them in range of Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Darkrai can also cripple physical walls like Dondozo and Skarmory with Trick, while Darkrai enjoys Kingambit's Sucker Punch putting targets in range of its attacks and Iron Head eliminating Clefable and Primarina. Raging Bolt is an effective partner, as Darkrai's ability to use Trick and shut down special walls like Blissey, Skeledirge, and Clodsire is great for opening it up against bulkier teams. Darkrai's coverage in Focus Blast can help simplify Raging Bolt's endgame, as it pressures Ting-Lu and Kingambit, notably simplifying the mindgames between it and Kingambit, while Ice Beam can also help eliminate Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for it to use Thunderclap late-game.</p>"

      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Darkrai's combination of an excellent Speed tier, high Special Attack alongside a strong Dark-type STAB move and excellent coverage options, and access to Will-O-Wisp—an uncommon option for such an offensively oriented threat—allow it to function quite effectively as a potent special attacker throughout a game. Ice Beam complements Dark Pulse well with its excellent super effective coverage, greatly threatening the likes of Great Tusk, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite while hitting Ting-Lu harder than Darkrai's other options. Sludge Bomb rounds out Darkrai's coverage by hitting Fairy-types like Primarina, Alolan Ninetales, Iron Valiant, and Tera Fairy Raging Bolt and Kingambit super effectively. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like most Kingambit variants, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W, making them reliable setup fodder for Darkrai's teammates and allowing Darkrai itself to punish overly aggressive attempted switches. Knock Off allows Darkrai to remove items like Assault Vest from Alomomola, Leftovers from Garganacl, and Heavy-Duty Boots from a wide array of entry hazard-weak threats and support both itself and its teammates. Knock Off is particularly useful against bulkier teams or on hazard-stacking teams, as the chip damage from hazards can more than make up for Darkrai's reduced coverage and damage output. Nasty Plot is also an option to turn it into a solid wallbreaker and potentially clean late-game more easily, especially in longer games when the foes are weakened enough from repeated chip damage. Tera Poison turns all of Darkrai's weaknesses into resistances, flipping otherwise poor matchups against Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Assault Vest Primarina in its favor. Tera Poison additionally allows Darkrai to absorb Toxic Spikes in a pinch and greatly boosts Sludge Bomb's damage output, allowing it to reliably 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina and always OHKO Enamorus while turning it into Darkrai's strongest neutral attacking option.</p> <p>Darkrai fits well on offensive teams that appreciate its good Speed, great coverage, and ability to cripple physical attackers throughout a game. Landorus-T is a great teammate that greatly appreciates Darkrai's ability to eliminate Ground-types like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T and reliably pivots Darkrai in with U-turn, sets up Stealth Rock to support Darkrai and its teammates, and handles attacks like Zamazenta's Body Press that Darkrai often finds itself targeted by. Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu are effective Spikes setters that pair well with Darkrai in spite of their shared Dark typings; Hisuian Samurott can further support Darkrai with Knock Off, Encore, and Flip Turn, while Ting-Lu can use Whirlwind to phaze faster threats like Iron Moth and Dragapult. Darkrai benefits immensely from the chip damage forced by hazards, as it becomes a terrific revenge killer and late-game cleaner once slower opponents are worn down into KO range. Zamazenta is a fantastic teammate that greatly appreciates Darkrai's ability to handle threats like Zapdos, Gholdengo, and Sinistcha that can prevent it from setting up an Iron Defense and sweeping. In return, Zamazenta handles Kingambit, which gives Darkrai trouble if it opts to run Lum Berry and/or Tera Fire to handle Will-O-Wisp. Gholdengo, too, is an excellent teammate; it reliably handles Tinkaton and most Zamazenta and Iron Valiant variants and can utilize the combination of Nasty Plot, Good as Gold, and its excellent typing to greatly threaten the defensive teams that Darkrai struggles against, while Darkrai can use its great Speed to pressure faster threats like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Ogerpon-W that Gholdengo may struggle against. They can also collectively overwhelm Ting-Lu, with either Gholdengo or Darkrai weakening Ting-Lu enough for the other to break past it and put massive offensive pressure on the opponent's team. Other Ghost-types like Dragapult and Pecharunt can also check Zamazenta for Darkrai, and they can reliably pivot it in with U-turn and Parting Shot, respectively. Ogerpon-W is a great teammate that can punch holes in bulkier teams featuring specially bulky threats like Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire that can wall Darkrai, provides Knock Off support to further assist Darkrai against bulkier teams, and hits Tinkaton extremely hard with Ivy Cudgel, while Darkrai can handle Dragonite, Pecharunt, and Sinistcha that can give Ogerpon-W trouble. Other powerful wallbreakers, like Ogerpon-C, Choice Specs Kyurem, maximum Attack Booster Energy Great Tusk, and mixed Iron Valiant, can break down defensive cores and open up Darkrai to clean up late-game. Great Tusk can utilize an assortment of other sets to set up Stealth Rock and provide valuable Knock Off support to support Darkrai's ability to outspeed and 2HKO much of the offensive metagame, and it reliably handles Kingambit so that Darkrai doesn't need to rely on Will-O-Wisp against it. Tinkaton is another excellent teammate that, like Great Tusk, provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support, but it can also provide Encore support or paralyze faster threats like Iron Valiant and Dragapult so that Darkrai can outspeed and eliminate them. Moltres can reliably answer physical attackers like Kingambit and Zamazenta, taking pressure off Darkrai to land a Will-O-Wisp against them, and can also pivot Darkrai in safely with U-turn. Lastly, powerful priority attackers like Raging Bolt, Dragonite, and Kingambit make for strong teammates that can answer foes that outspeed and threaten Darkrai, such as +1 Iron Valiant and Dragapult. In return, Darkrai can utilize its great Speed to put immediate pressure on threats like Landorus-T, Air Balloon Gholdengo, Zapdos, and Moltres.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high Speed, impressive power, and access to a wide range of coverage moves, Darkrai is able to thrive in OU as a powerful wallbreaker and disruption tool. Sludge Bomb complements Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse by targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Primarina, and Hatterene while also giving Darkrai powerful coverage into Ogerpon-W. Ice Beam lets Darkrai OHKO Gliscor and Landorus-T while being its strongest option against Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Focus Blast enhances Darkrai's coverage further by targeting bulky Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Darkrai's deep movepool can be explored to further customize its role on a team by trading out some of its coverage for utility. Knock Off can provide fantastic support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey, while Sucker Punch is a niche option that is able to pick off weakened foes like Dragapult and Deoxys-S that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it; when using Sucker Punch, a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature is optimal to minimize damage from common priority moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, though a Hasty nature can be useful to take on Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Life Orb is a fantastic option that bolsters Darkrai's power even further, giving it a clean 2HKO on Corviknight after Stealth Rock along with OHKOs on max HP Great Tusk with Ice Beam and Ogerpon-W with Sludge Bomb after any entry hazard chip; with Life Orb, 29 HP IVs can be used to minimize recoil. Alternatively, Expert Belt takes advantage of Darkrai's excellent coverage without sacrificing its longevity, maintaining OHKOs on offensive Gholdengo and Enamorus. Tera Poison is a fantastic option both offensively and defensively on Darkrai. With Life Orb or Expert Belt, Tera Poison Sludge Bomb is able to OHKO Clefable, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales and 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina, and even without a boosting item, it can OHKO both Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom. In turn, Tera Poison flips Darkrai's Fighting- and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to take hits from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Enamorus if necessary, as well as granting it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Tera Ghost gives an outright immunity to Zamazenta's Fighting-type moves and blocks Extreme Speed Dragonite from picking Darkrai off. Tera Fighting can instead be considered to increase the power of Darkrai's Focus Blast to monstrous levels at the expense of not granting much defensive value; Tera-boosted Focus Blast allows Expert Belt Darkrai to 2HKO even Ting-Lu, and grants Life Orb Darkrai a roll in its favor to 2HKO Blissey.</p> <p>Darkrai provides a huge amount of value to offense teams that appreciate its high Speed along with its ability to threaten Galarian Slowking, though even slower, more balanced teams can still find value in its ability to threaten a significant proportion of the tier and force switches to take advantage of entry hazards. Landorus-T is a strong partner that can not only set Stealth Rock but is also able to switch in on threats to Darkrai like Zamazenta and help to offset Darkrai's relative frailty by bringing it in safely with U-turn. Similarly, Gliscor makes a good pairing on bulkier structures with its ability to come in on both Zamazenta and Clodsire. As Darkrai typically makes its home on more offensive builds, partners that can handle Darkrai's checks without being momentum sinks are much appreciated; Assault Vest Primarina forms a great core with Darkrai, able to switch in on Iron Valiant and Enamorus and force them out. Primarina also appreciates Darkrai threatening Galarian Slowking. Offensively, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Raging Bolt that can help to overload shared checks like Clodsire and Blissey make great partners. Darkrai doesn't only work with special overload, though; Dark-type spam teams benefit greatly from Darkrai pressuring and being able to deal heavy damage to threats like Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Primarina, allowing for threats like Hisuian Samurott to later break through. In return, Hisuian Samurott and other Dark-type attackers like Kingambit are able to weaken Zamazenta for Darkrai while also being able to take advantage of Darkrai's more passive switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey; Ogerpon-W is another powerful partner that can force damage onto Zamazenta and turn passive walls into setup fodder. Hisuian Samurott is another partner that benefits from this support in overloading shared checks while also setting up Spikes, which Darkrai appreciates greatly. Particularly when opting not to run Heavy-Duty Boots, Darkrai appreciates hazard removal to give it more turns on the field; Great Tusk is a natural pick that is also able to pressure Zamazenta and can invite in Iron Valiant to burn its Booster Energy. Another partner that can help Darkrai both defensively and offensively is Gholdengo, as Gholdengo can switch in on Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Clefable while Gholdengo in turn appreciates Darkrai's ability to weaken or eliminate opposing Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott. Bulkier teams can opt to pair Galarian Slowking with Darkrai with its ability to pivot around Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and the Future Sight support it provides turns Darkrai into a devastating threat that Clodsire cannot switch into and Zamazenta cannot safely force out.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "sets": {
      "Contrary Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Serperior fills the role of a late-game sweeper for offensive teams that snowballs quickly while attacking thanks to Contrary Leaf Storm. Tera Blast gives Serperior the strong coverage that it sorely lacks, as without Terastallizing, Serperior is very prone to being walled. Tera Blast Ground is the most ideal choice, as it deals heavy damage to Pokemon like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo that do not fear Leaf Storm. Tera Blast Fire trades a strong hit on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and the Dragon-types for a way to immediately threaten Corviknight and Skarmory as well as common Air Balloon users like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Glare is used to punish the switches Serperior often forces, allowing it to cripple common answers like Heatran and Skeledirge without having to commit to using Tera. Dragon Pulse gives a non-Tera reliant way to deal with common Dragon-types like Raging Bolt, Dragonite, and Kyurem. Substitute allows Serperior to scout switches and fish for full paralysis turns while also blocking status such as Toxic from Gliscor, resulting in easier setup. Additionally, having a Substitute up forces many faster potential revenge killers like Zamazenta and Darkrai to risk a strong hit or paralysis to break it. Leftovers helps to keep Serperior healthy throughout the match, most notably allowing it to make more Substitutes. The Tera types chosen are primarily to aid in coverage, but they also have a few defensive applications of note. Tera Ground can enable Serperior to safely use Substitute against Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking in a pinch, potentially allowing for a free turn of setup. It also prevents Thunder Wave Infiltrator Dragapult from paralyzing Serperior though a Substitute. Tera Fire allows Serperior to resist Triple Axel from Meowscarada and Weavile, a move that otherwise threatens to OHKO Serperior even through a Substitute, as well as U-turn from both Cinderace and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Serperior only fits on heavily offensive teams, primarily Sticky Web offense. Ribombee is a great teammate, as it is the premier Sticky Web setter. Sticky Web allows Serperior to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like non-Clear Body Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. In turn, threat of a Contrary Evasion boost from Defog or a Contrary Speed boost from its own Sticky Web due to Court Change helps to ensure that entry hazards stay up. For the same reason, Serperior helps to shore up an offensive team's matchup against opposing Sticky Web teams because of the threat of a Speed boost. Serperior is very Tera reliant, so it wants teammates that can help it to make the most of the Tera investment and do not need Tera themselves like Gholdengo and Zamazenta. It is best used alongside Pokemon that appreciate paralysis support and provide heavy offensive pressure, like Kingambit and Raging Bolt. Other entry hazard leads like Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora also support Serperior well, as many of Serperior's checks are grounded such as Raging Bolt and Galarian Slowking, making them vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Landorus-T is another good teammate for Serperior, as it provides Stealth Rock, uses U-turn to get Serperior in safely against common Pokemon like Gliscor, and threatens Serperior's checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking with Earthquake. Arguably the biggest threat to Serperior is Gholdengo, as it can repeatedly switch into Leaf Storm and is immune to Glare. Galarian Slowking similarly cares very little about Leaf Storm and does not mind the Speed drop from paralysis. Kingambit is a good partner, as it can switch in against both of these Pokemon and threaten them with heavy damage. Kingambit also appreciates paralysis on Pokemon like Corviknight and Kyurem, which Kingambit can beat one-on-one thanks to the Speed drop. Kyurem dislikes risking paralysis but takes little damage from Serperior and heavily threatens it and many of Serperior's frail offensive teammates. Teammates like Air Balloon Gholdengo can help to sponge Kyurem's hits while adding more offensive pressure. Gholdengo can use Nasty Plot-boosted attacks like Shadow Ball and Psyshock to help break Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire for Serperior while blocking hazard removal. Iron Valiant can help to wear down shared checks like the previously mentioned Poison-types, especially with Knock Off or Calm Mind sets, while Raging Bolt can similarly can be used to chip down special walls with Calm Mind-boosted attacks. Lastly, Rillaboom can provide Knock Off and U-turn on top of setting Grassy Terrain that can boost Leaf Storm and help Serperior to make more Substitutes.</p>"

  "Samurott-Hisui": {
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott establishes itself as a top-tier dedicated lead thanks to its signature move Ceaseless Edge, letting it threaten the opposition while reliably setting up layers of Spikes that bypass common entry hazard preventions such as Hatterene's Magic Bounce and Taunt from Deoxys-S and Landorus-T. It does so while still maintaining a decent offensive presence courtesy of its strong Sharpness-boosted STAB combination and a bevy of disruptive utility options. Though weaker, Aqua Cutter is a perfectly-accurate alternative over Razor Shell that notably ignores common contact effects like Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static at the cost of potentially missing out on the 2HKO against Ting-Lu. Aqua Jet reliably picks off opposing Focus Sash leads like Deoxys-S, Glimmora, and Ribombee as well as targeting other faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Hisuian Samurott hit faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Choice Specs Dragapult, the latter of which can be problematic in the offense mirror. Aside from being handy against bulky foes like Skarmory and Pelipper, Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots works extremely well with Spikes, making the likes of Alomomola, Dondozo, and Unaware Clefable susceptible to them, which is especially helpful because the latter two can trouble the hyper offense teams that Hisuian Samurott supports. Either Taunt or Encore prevents Hisuian Samurott from being used as setup fodder by the likes of Raging Bolt and Kingambit, and it messes with defensive foes like Clefable. More specifically, Taunt stops Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory from setting hazards and prevents slower offensive threats like Dragonite from setting up. Alternatively, Encore is better at punishing naturally faster setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Nasty Plot Darkrai looking for that one free turn of setup, and it can subsequently provide valuable switch-in and setup opportunities for an incoming teammate. Sacred Sword hits opposing Hisuian Samurott; cleanly OHKOes Weavile, Darkrai, and bulky Kingambit; and breaks IronPress Zamazenta's Substitute. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes can be set even against faster foes like Enamorus, as well as opposing leads like Ribombee. Tera Ghost is predominantly used to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. An EV spread of 232 Atk / 24 Def / 252 Spe is another option, running enough Defense EVs to survive Choice Band Dragapult's Dragon Darts from full, which has a chance to OHKO Hisuian Samurott through Focus Sash otherwise.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott's ability to set the pace for its team early-game makes it a perfect fit on hyper offense teams. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Dragonite, and Ogerpon-W enjoy its Spikes putting foes into their KO range, especially against their checks like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Ogerpon-W and other Knock Off users like Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo to make them vulnerable to Spikes. If not going for Knock Off, Great Tusk can also provide entry hazard removal for the team with Rapid Spin, since Hisuian Samurott will trigger lead Glimmora's Toxic Debris twice; pairing Hisuian Samurott with a grounded offensive Poison-type like Iron Moth can also mitigate this issue. In addition to enjoying Spikes, the aforementioned Iron Valiant and other Pokemon like Choice Scarf Enamorus are potent late-game cleaners that can notably pressure Great Tusk, preventing it from ever entering the field to use Rapid Spin. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult are valuable teammates to naturally spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; moreover, Gholdengo is adept at preventing other hazard removal attempts such as Corviknight's Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Dragapult can deal with or revenge kill Zamazenta behind a Substitute, which uses Knock Off Hisuian Samurott as setup fodder. In return, they appreciate Spikes chipping down the likes of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl.</p>"
      },
      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With Sharpness powering up its STAB moves, Hisuian Samurott is a powerful attacker in addition to providing strong support for offensive teams with the Spikes it sets with Ceaseless Edge; it also has the ability to pivot safely thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots. Razor Shell and Aqua Cutter are comparably strong STAB options, the difference being Razor Shell trades a slight dip of accuracy for the ability to chip down walls with Defense drops, and Aqua Cutter is slightly weaker but is fully accurate and has a chance for damage to spike upwards with the higher critical hit rate while also avoiding contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Moltres' Flame Body. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Hisuian Samurott's foes and thus leaves them susceptible to the Spikes produced by Ceaseless Edge, as well as removing Rocky Helmet, which opens it up to keep attacking with its contact moves. As a support option, Encore is useful to lock Pokemon like Alomomola and Dondozo into setup moves, while Flip Turn can keep up momentum, help Hisuian Samurott escape from unfavorable matchups against slower foes like Primarina, and keep pressure on the opponent by pivoting between teammates smoothly. Heavy-Duty Boots provides Hisuian Samurott the immunity to entry hazards, which lets it be far more active throughout the course of a game. Tera Poison or Tera Fire flips Hisuian Samurott's weakness against otherwise problematic U-turn users and Grass- and Fairy-types like Landorus-T, Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Rillaboom, especially with Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness from Tera Fire. Moreover, Tera Poison grants a Fighting resistance against Zamazenta and the aforementioned Iron Valiant, while Tera Fire gives Hisuian Samurott an immunity to burn from foes like Dragapult and Moltres.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits well on offense teams and specifically is very useful on entry hazard stack structures. Stealth Rock users such as Landorus-T and Tinkaton make good partners for Hisuian Samurott, which also spreads entry hazards with Ceaseless Edge, creating hazard stacking cores to put pressure on foes. Hisuian Samurott's ability to pivot with Flip Turn synergizes well with other offensive pivots like Cinderace and Dragapult, allowing the team to pressure opposing Pokemon as well as pivot to any potential counters. Hisuian Samurott struggles to make progress on its own against bulkier Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Zamazenta. Zamazenta can easily dispatch Hisuian Samurott with a Fighting-type STAB move with no way for it to damage Zamazenta back. A strong Fairy-type like Enamorus or Iron Valiant can help deal with Zamazenta while also forming an offensive core with Hisuian Samurott, which can deal with threats to them like Galarian Slowking, easily switching in on Psychic-type moves like Future Sight. These Fairy-types also pose a threat to Hisuian Samurott, outspeeding and threatening it with Moonblast; teammates like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, Tinkaton, and Kingambit can cover these Pokemon, the former two adding to the offensive pressure of the whole team with more special attacks to complement Hisuian Samurott's physical attacks. Gholdengo especially synergizes with Hisuian Samurott, as it's able to efficiently block entry hazard removal and keep up the Spikes set by Ceaseless Edge. Kingambit, on the other hand, is similar to Hisuian Samurott, as it's a physical attacker and can help break down their shared checks like Dondozo and Skarmory over the course of a game. Together, along with other Dark-types like Darkrai, Hisuian Samurott can become a powerful part of Dark-type spam archetypes that can overwhelm shared counters such as Zamazenta and Clefable. Galarian Slowking is another teammate that can deal with Fairy-types, shrugging off Moonblast as well as Fighting-type moves from Hisuian Samurott's counters like Zamazenta, which it can also force out with Future Sight. Hisuian Samurott also struggles against offensive Pokemon that outspeed it and can take advantage of that to pivot, such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Ogerpon. Having some speed control such as Ribombee's Sticky Web can assist with this while synergizing with the rest of Hisuian Samurott's hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is a great speed control option due to its ability to compress a number of roles in one slot. It can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Cinderace and Dragapult while simultaneously setting up Spikes with Ceaseless Edge or pivoting into other teammates with Flip Turn. Razor Shell can make Hisuian Samurott more difficult to respond to due to its high chance to lower the enemy's Defense. However, Aqua Cutter can be used instead, as it is more accurate and does not make contact; this is useful against targets such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Moltres. Knock Off complements Ceaseless Edge by removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, making it more rewarding for Hisuian Samurott to use Ceaseless Edge later. Flip Turn allows Hisuian Samurott to pivot out of bad matchups against Clefable and Primarina while also dealing chip damage and generating momentum. However, Sacred Sword can be used to revenge kill various threats such as Kingambit and other Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a mediocre Terastallization user, as its base typing is important to check threats such as Gholdengo and non-Low Kick Kingambit, and its partners will usually benefit from Terastallization more. Nonetheless, Hisuian Samurott can benefit from the damage increase that either Tera Water or Tera Dark provide to revenge kill a wider pool of Pokemon. Tera Water is useful to revenge kill offensive Great Tusk and Landorus-T more reliably, while Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO defensive Galarian Slowking and Latias with Ceaseless Edge after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ghost is another worthwhile consideration, as it allows Hisuian Samurott to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott best fits on bulky offense teams, as it provides a great deal of utility between its defensive profile, ability to set up Spikes, Knock Off, and pivoting capabilities. Landorus-T is the perfect partner; it can form a potent pivoting core with Hisuian Samurott and provide Stealth Rock support while simultaneously benefiting from Hisuian Samurott's Spikes due to its ability to force switches with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet. Hisuian Samurott has a difficult time maintaining Spikes against entry hazard removers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk, as well as struggling against Fighting-types such as Zamazenta. Dragapult is thus a fantastic teammate; it matches up well against common switch-ins to Hisuian Samurott such as Corviknight and Skarmory and can block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo is also an excellent partner, as it can prevent Defog from Corviknight, safely prevent Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and check Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. In turn, Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge support makes Dragapult and Gholdengo more difficult to switch into due to wearing down their switch-ins such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Kingambit appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to lay down Spikes, as it makes it easier for them to clean late-game and break through checks such as Hatterene and Great Tusk. Future Sight support from Galarian Slowking is beneficial, as it makes it more difficult for Pokemon like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to switch into Ceaseless Edge. Hisuian Samurott itself is quite vulnerable to being worn down by hazards, so anti-entry hazard support from Hatterene or Great Tusk is appreciated. While Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is relatively fast, it is still prone to being outsped by various setup sweepers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. Priority support from Dragonite is therefore recommended to have additional insurance against these threats.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a Pokemon that, unlike other entry hazard setters, can offensively threaten teams while getting hazards up thanks to Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge, allowing for more aggressive play and more opportunities to lay Spikes. Ceaseless Edge also lets it get Spikes up against Pokemon such as Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. With Assault Vest, Hisuian Samurott is able to utilize its increased special bulk to check Pokemon like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Additionally, its decent defensive typing is useful for checking other threats like Weavile and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Razor Shell is generally the preferred Water-type STAB move due to its chance to lower Defense, but Aqua Cutter is a viable alternative due to it being non-contact and thus preventing chip damage from Rocky Helmet, which helps against Pokemon like Skarmory and Great Tusk. Aqua Jet gives Hisuian Samurott a priority move to pick off faster, weakened threats like Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Iron Boulder. Sucker Punch is another option for priority; it is not as reliable as Aqua Jet, but it is stronger and better at revenge killing Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off punishes defensive Pokemon that can impede progress, removing items from foes such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Primarina. Alternatively, Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum and safely bring in threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. 84 Speed EVs let Hisuian Samurott outspeed uninvested Gliscor; the leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its overall bulk. Tera Poison is used to remove its weaknesses to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass so it can take attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Serperior.</p> <p>Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott fits best on entry hazard-stacking bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence and ability to take special attacks. Gholdengo is an especially good teammate for Hisuian Samurott, since it blocks all hazard removal bar Court Change from Cinderace and has good matchups against Fairy- and Fighting-types that annoy Hisuian Samurott like Clefable and Zamazenta. In return, Hisuian Samurott soft checks Heatran and Iron Moth. Due to Hisuian Samurott's lack of reliable recovery, pairing it with Pokemon that have titanic special bulk or high longevity like Ting-Lu or Galarian Slowking is encouraged to cover special threats throughout the course of a game. Ting-Lu also has access to Stealth Rock, which, when paired with Spikes and Hisuian Samurott's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, can rack up serious chip damage on the opposing team. Alternative Knock Off users such as Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Clefable are good for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that never come in against Hisuian Samurott like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and opposing Great Tusk. On top of being a premier pick for bulky offense teams, Great Tusk has the added perk of having access to Rapid Spin, removing hazards the opponent tries to set up so Hisuian Samurott can win the hazard war. Additionally, Rillaboom is able to provide Hisuian Samurott passive recovery thanks to Grassy Terrain. Other offensive teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to set Spikes include, but are not limited to, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

        "description": "<p>While Hisuian Samurott's Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge makes it a formidable entry hazard setter regardless of its moveset and item, Swords Dance alongside a boosting item and an offensive Tera type dials Hisuian Samurott's damage output up to eleven to make it a vicious offensive threat that can support its wallbreaking and sweeping endeavors with its own entry hazards, distinguishing it from the tier's many other offensive Dark-types. Both Razor Shell and Aqua Cutter provide great neutral coverage alongside its Dark-type STAB move, and neither option is strictly better than the other. Razor Shell's slightly higher Base Power and high chance to drop the target's Defense stat come at the cost of some accuracy and a vulnerability to contact punishment like Rocky Helmet, Static, and Flame Body. Aqua Cutter's lack of contact and perfect accuracy come at the cost of its slightly lower base power and an increased critical hit ratio that, while useful, is much less consistent than Razor Shell's powerful secondary effect. Sucker Punch circumvents Hisuian Samurott's middling Speed, allowing it to handle offensive threats like Dragapult, Ogerpon-W, and Kyurem, among others. Black Glasses and Tera Dark boost Hisuian Samurott's damage output to staggering levels, giving its +2 Sucker Punch the ability to outright OHKO Raging Bolt after Stealth Rock and its +2 Ceaseless Edge the ability to OHKO Zapdos. An Adamant nature is generally preferred to maximize Hisuian Samurott's damage output, ensuring that a +2 Tera Dark Ceaseless Edge OHKOes Zapdos outright and OHKOes Tera Water Garganacl after Stealth Rock damage. However, a Jolly nature is a viable alternative that ensures that Hisuian Samurott outspeeds Timid Gholdengo and, at worst, ties with opposing Jolly Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>This set provides a great deal of role compression for many offensive teams by functioning as an entry hazard setter, wallbreaker, and setup sweeper all at once. Stealth Rock users like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T boast solid defensive synergy with Hisuian Samurott, absorbing Electric-type attacks from Zapdos and Raging Bolt that would greatly threaten Hisuian Samurott, and can support Hisuian Samurott in a bevy of ways. Great Tusk and Iron Treads can use Rapid Spin to remove opposing entry hazards in order to preserve Hisuian Samurott's HP and Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from threats like Zapdos and Dondozo to render them considerably more vulnerable to the pair's entry hazards. Landorus-T, on the other hand, can combine Intimidate and U-turn to give Hisuian Samurott frequent, safer entry points to set up a Swords Dance and start throwing out powerful boosted attacks more freely. Other Stealth Rock users, such as Ting-Lu and Glimmora, can also work quite effectively alongside Hisuian Samurott. Ting-Lu can stomach repeated attacks from Raging Bolt far better than most other Ground-types and reliably set Stealth Rock throughout a game, while Glimmora trades longevity and a Ground typing for Toxic Debris and a Rock-type STAB move to deter Moltres, Zapdos, and Cinderace early-game. This set pairs extremely well with Kingambit, since the duo can greatly wear down shared answers like Moltres, Dondozo, and Zamazenta thanks to Hisuian Samurott gradually forcing them into range of Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Fast offensive Dark-types like Darkrai are also excellent teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to wallbreak early-game set entry hazards, both of which help them sweep late-game. Gholdengo and Pecharunt are great options to fortify Hisuian Samurott against Zamazenta and Fairy-types like Iron Valiant while disrupting defensive teams featuring the likes of Dondozo that can stomach boosted Ceaseless Edges. Hisuian Samurott's mediocre Speed can be problematic against Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Kyurem, which don't fear a boosted Sucker Punch or can play around it with Substitute. Fast offensive threats like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth can handle these faster threats reasonably well and greatly appreciate Hisuian Samurott's early-game wallbreaking and hazard stacking capabilities to facilitate their late-game sweeps. This Hisuian Samurott set is also quite excellent on Sticky Web teams helmed by either Araquanid or Ribombee, as Sticky Web circumvents Hisuian Samurott's Speed issues and makes it quite devastating into opposing offensive teams now that it no longer needs to rely on Sucker Punch to pick off faster threats. Many of the aforementioned teammates are also fantastic with Sticky Web support, with all of Great Tusk, Kingambit, Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Nasty Plot Pecharunt commonly featuring on Sticky Web teams and supporting Hisuian Samurott all the same.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Sand Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Excadrill serves as the main sweeper on sand teams, as well as being the main entry hazard remover these teams need. Swords Dance lets it reach thresholds like 2HKOing Alomomola with a +2 Earthquake and Gliscor with +2 Iron Head, with its typing allowing to set up on Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. Iron Head gives it a strong neutral attack against foes like Landorus-T while netting the OHKO against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Rock Slide is an alternative to complement Earthquake by hitting foes like Zapdos and Moltres super effectively while granting a neutral coverage against Ogerpon-W. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill remove hazards and outspeed threats like Darkrai outside of sand. Air Balloon is the preferred item to have a temporary immunity to Spikes and Ground-type moves coming from the likes of Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Gliscor. Leftovers can be useful to regain some health over the course of the battle. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option to ignore hazards entirely, especially useful for clearing Sticky Web. Tera Fire's main appeal is that it gives Excadrill an advantage over Moltres and other common users of Will-O-Wisp like Dragapult and Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Excadrill to guarantee OHKOing targets such as Iron Treads and Raging Bolt unboosted. Tera Ghost provides a crucial immunity to Fighting-type moves like Close Combat and Body Press from Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Tera Flying is another option that still allows Excadrill to resist Fighting while having the benefit of flipping the matchup versus Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Tyranitar is Excadrill's best friend, setting the sand that Excadrill needs to thrive while also packing Stealth Rock and Knock Off, which can soften the enemy team to the point where Excadrill can sweep. Tyranitar helps beat Zapdos and, most importantly, Moltres, which Excadrill struggles to break through. The greatest problem sand teams face is Roar Zamazenta, which can shuffle them around while threatening a powerful Body Press. Similarly, Corviknight and Skarmory can boost with Iron Defense in the face of Excadrill while punishing contact moves with Rocky Helmet. Therefore, partners like Primarina, Gholdengo, and Sinistcha are great teammates; in return, Excadrill threatens their counters like Darkrai and Iron Moth. Another highly troublesome matchup for these teams is Ogerpon-W, which resists both of Excadrill's STAB moves. For this reason, checks like Corviknight and Skarmory are recommended. Corviknight can provide momentum with U-turn and can use Defog to ease Excadrill's stress. Meanwhile, Skarmory has Spikes, which can force even more passive damage alongside sand. Hydrapple and Sinistcha can check Rillaboom, Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W, with Hydrapple providing extra breaking power with its ability to boost with Nasty Plot and Sinistcha providing a reliable defensive backbone with Strength Sap and Matcha Gotcha. Ironically enough, Ogerpon-W is a great partner for Excadrill due to its ability to brute force its way through troublesome matchups like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Moltres; it also has utility moves like U-turn for momentum and Encore to lock foes into moves Excadrill can use as an entry point, like Protect on Gliscor and Calm Mind on Raging Bolt. Ogerpon-W is also able to absorb Water-type moves, protecting both Excadrill and Tyranitar in the process. Finally, Ogerpon-W is able to bait in Pokemon that are scared of Excadrill, like Raging Bolt. Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent partner for Excadrill, as it excels at defeating both Zapdos and Moltres thanks to its better resilience and status immunity. Dragapult is a good addition to these teams thanks to its immediate power, the ability to cripple various counters like the aforementioned Zamazenta and Ogerpon-W with Will-O-Wisp, and capacity to bring momentum with U-turn. Moltres also brings status and momentum-generating to the table, but it trades greater Speed and power for greater longevity with both Roost and better defenses. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can help relieve some pressure from Tyranitar, Excadrill's best teammate, thanks to its hit-taking abilities, which is especially relevant against Primarina and Walking Wake.</p>"

      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Reuniclus is a unique stallbreaker in OU thanks to its combination of Psychic Noise, Magic Guard, and Knock Off that punishes passive play. Psychic Noise denies recovery from bulky Pokemon like Gliscor, Garganacl, and Dondozo as well as bypassing Substitute against attackers like Kyurem and Iron Moth. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dragapult, Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Moltres in order to make them susceptible to entry hazard chip damage and Leftovers from Dark-types unaffected by Psychic Noise like Ting-Lu and Darkrai. Focus Blast is coverage to hit Dark-types that can otherwise switch into Reuniclus easily like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Darkrai. Life Orb gives it a power boost, enabling it to secure OHKOs on threats like Iron Moth and Pecharunt with none of the downside thanks to Magic Guard. Magic Guard also enables Reuniclus to absorb status from bulky Pokemon like Gliscor, Moltres, and Toxapex. 44 Speed EVs are used to outpace uninvested base 35s like Garganacl, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Tera Fighting powers up Focus Blast to guarantee a 2HKO on Ting-Lu and gives it a resistance to Dark-type attacks, allowing it to check Pokemon like Kingambit and Darkrai. Tera Water is an alternative that allows Reuniclus to check threats like Walking Wake and Cinderace.</p> <p>Reuniclus fits best on offense teams that can take advantage of its ability to disrupt bulkier teams. Spikes setters like Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott are excellent teammates for it, checking Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo as well as checking Iron Crown while setting entry hazards to chip them down repeatedly. Reuniclus helps them out by using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from threats like Kyurem, Darkrai, and Enamorus to make them susceptible to chip damage from their entry hazards. Kingambit pairs extremely well with Reuniclus as well due to their fantastic defensive synergy; it fares well against almost all of Reuniclus's checks, namely Dragapult, Gholdengo, Darkrai, and Iron Crown. In return, Reuniclus is able to face off against some of Kingambit's worst matchups like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, Substitute Iron Moth, and Dondozo. Zamazenta fits well with Reuniclus due to its ability to switch into Kingambit, one of Reuniclus's biggest checks, and check other Dark-types like Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott, with Reuniclus being good into some of Zamazenta's checks like Galarian Slowking and Moltres. Reuniclus is also able to utilize its combination of Knock Off and Magic Guard to remove Rocky Helmet from physically bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Corviknight without any drawback and absorb burn from Moltres's Flame Body, letting Zamazenta break through them without worrying about any potential chip damage or crippling status conditions. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Primarina appreciate Reuniclus having favorable matchups into bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, allowing them to sweep after they've either been severely weakened or outright defeated, and Reuniclus loves their resistances to Dark- and Bug-type moves that let them come in on Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott and U-turn users. Moltres is a good pairing with Reuniclus, since it checks shakier matchups like Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Weavile and can use U-turn to bring it in safely. Wallbreakers like Kyurem and Raging Bolt love Reuniclus's ability to cripple bulky walls like Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, Garganacl, and Clodsire, wearing them down by either removing their items to make them susceptible to entry hazard damage or denying them their recovery. Reuniclus is also unaffected by Salt Cure chip thanks to Magic Guard. In return, they're able to decimate Pokemon that threaten Reuniclus like Ting-Lu, Ogerpon-W, and Hisuian Samurott. Pecharunt is able to pivot into Reuniclus with Parting Shot to land Knock Off and Psychic Noise into weakened threats and force switches.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Making use of its good bulk, great defensive typing, and longevity from Regenerator, Amoonguss is a sturdy defensive piece tasked with checking imposing breakers like Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant. Foul Play KOes Swords Dance Ogerpon-W at +2 after slight chip and threatens other setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor, and it has the added benefit of popping Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Toxic puts opposing walls like Moltres and Zapdos and switch-ins like Kyurem on a swift timer and lets Amoonguss strongly pressure special sweepers like Raging Bolt and Primarina. Synthesis helps Amoonguss maintain its health, especially if it's forced to take entry hazard damage after losing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Clear Smog is Amoonguss's best option to reduce its passivity against setup sweepers it can't otherwise threaten like Iron Defense + Rest Zamazenta and Curse Garganacl and stops it from being overwhelmed by Iron Valiant and Calm Mind Clefable. Alternatively, Giga Drain provides Amoonguss with additional healing and threatens Water- and Ground-types like Alomomola, Hisuian Samurott, and Great Tusk. Lastly, Sludge Bomb immediately threatens Fairy- and Grass-types like Iron Valiant, Clefable, and Ogerpon-W while punishing Taunt users like Raging Bolt with a chance to poison. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to survive a +1 Protosynthesis Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt, with the rest of the EVs poured into physical bulk to ensure Amoonguss checks Ogerpon-W as well as possible. Tera Steel is a broadly useful defensive type that flips Amoonguss's weaknesses and lets it check Pokemon it otherwise couldn't like Kyurem and Dragapult while giving it a stronger matchup against Meowscarada's Triple Axel. Alternatively, Tera Ghost lets Amoonguss spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads while granting an immunity to Gliscor's Facade, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Zamazenta's Body Press.</p> <p>Amoonguss fits best on stall teams as their strongest check to Ogerpon-W while also serving as a useful Regenerator pivot that can absorb Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss has a suspect matchup into many of the metagame's strongest wallbreakers like Kyurem and Darkrai and struggles to make progress against poison-immune Pokemon, especially Gholdengo, Pecharunt, and Kingambit. Furthermore, Foul Play makes it susceptible to contact effects from Zapdos's Static and Moltres's Flame Body, which can impair its ability to answer Ogerpon-W. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Alomomola love Amoonguss for its ability to check strong Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W. In return, they handle physical threats like Cinderace and Kingambit that threaten Amoonguss. Another strong teammate is Blissey, which blanket checks strong special attackers like Darkrai, Kyurem, and Iron Moth that scare Amoonguss out, holds off Zapdos and Moltres, and is a strong response to Gholdengo, which easily walls and sets up on Amoonguss. Blissey appreciates Amoonguss's ability to badly poison sweepers like Raging Bolt and Primarina, while Amoonguss acts as a vent against certain mixed threats like Iron Valiant and Keldeo and can help pivot around Walking Wake in sun. Gliscor and Ting-Lu are crewmates that shield against Pokemon like Iron Moth and Iron Crown that easily switch into Amoonguss. Gliscor additionally answers Zapdos and Moltres and strongly threatens them with Knock Off and Toxic, Ting-Lu responds to Pecharunt and absorbs Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, and both set entry hazards that help further pressure Ogerpon-W.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "WishFish (Pivot)": {
        "description": "<p>Alomomola's gargantuan HP stat, good defensive typing, and access to Regenerator make it one of the best defensive pivots available. The combination of Wish, Regenerator, and Flip Turn makes it the premier Wish passer in OU, able to heal defensive teammates without reliable recovery like Dondozo and Ting-Lu. Scald bolsters Alomomola's defensive presence, with its burn chance permanently threatening physical attackers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Dragonite while cutting down the longevity of switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and opposing Alomomola. Flip Turn separates Alomomola from other bulky Water-types as a slow pivot, letting it bring in other Pokemon safely while creating momentum on the slower-paced teams it often finds itself on. On top of reliably gaining recovery from Wish, Protect has many more applications for Alomomola; it allows Alomomola to scout Choice item users like Walking Wake and Gholdengo, scout for potential double switches by the opponent, gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, and stall out an additional turn of burn damage from Scald. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Alomomola is as slow as possible for pivoting effectively. Tera Ghost gives it an immunity to Fighting-type moves from Zamazenta and can additionally be used to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Tera Flying turns Alomomola's weakness to Grass into a resistance, letting it better take on Rillaboom. It also allows Alomomola to avoid Spikes damage if it loses its item to Knock Off, letting it act as a good Knock Off absorber. Tera Dark and Tera Steel are viable alternatives; the former lets Alomomola more capably check Hex Dragapult and the latter giving Alomomola a generally solid defensive typing to aid against Meowscarada and Fairy-types like Enamorus. These also let Alomomola act as a solid absorber of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking. Maximum HP and maximum Defense strengthens Alomomola's monstrous physical bulk, becoming better suited to face the likes of Weavile, Iron Boulder, and Barraskewda. Meanwhile, thanks to Alomomola's astounding HP stat, an EV spread with maximum Defense and Special Defense is also solid, letting Alomomola capably take hits from special attackers such as Hex Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus while still possessing solid physical bulk, letting it pivot into a more variety of attackers in general. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to function as a pivot effectively without getting worn down by entry hazards, but Rocky Helmet enhances Alomomola's role as a physical wall by punishing foes like Zamazenta, Kingambit, and Great Tusk. Red Card is an alternative that allows Alomomola to act as a one-time phazer against setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, Dragonite, and Iron Moth.</p> <p>Alomomola performs best on balance and stall teams due to the sheer value of Wish for teammates that lack reliable recovery. Potent defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Great Tusk heavily appreciate Alomomola's gargantuan Wish to heal them reliably, as these walls often struggle to recover themselves after chip damage. Similarly, on stall, the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire appreciate Alomomola's Wish help them better deal with chip damage while also letting them preserve Rest and Recover PP, respectively. Additionally, they appreciate Alomomola's effectiveness as a pivot, as it can let them switch in without taking any damage thanks to its relatively low Speed. Special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Skeledirge can cover Alomomola's weaker Special Defense, handling the likes of Iron Valiant and Heatran. Other Pokemon with Regenerator such as Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T can form potent Regenerator cores, making them difficult to wear down in the face of entry hazards. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Alomomola's capability to take Knock Off rather well. Alomomola is deathly afraid of Ogerpon-W because of Water Absorb. It can easily set up on and decimate Alomomola even after it Terastallizes. Thus, checks to Ogerpon-W such as Rillaboom and Zamazenta make for excellent partners. The former two also appreciate Alomomola's Wish supporting their otherwise shaky longevity. Amoonguss's access to Toxic lets Alomomola have an easier time chipping down and stalling out foes with Flip Turn and Wish, respectively. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Landorus-T appreciate Alomomola's slow pivoting and ability to pass large Wishes to assist with their longevity.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Alomomola can use Assault Vest to improve its poor Special Defense, becoming a mixed defensive pivot at the expense of Wish. Alomomola can soak up both special and physical moves from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Iron Moth and pivot out with Flip Turn, with Regenerator recovering most of the damage taken. Scald is Alomomola's best move if it wants to stay in, fishing for burns that help pressure defensive switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire and cripple opposing physical attackers like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Play Rough hits Pokemon that would switch in easily to Scald such as Raging Bolt, Hydrapple, and Walking Wake while chipping down Ogerpon-W decently. Play Rough also helps pressure Calm Mind Iron Valiant, which can otherwise punish Alomomola's Mirror Coat with Encore or repeated use of Calm Mind, and threatens Dark-type special attackers like Darkrai and Greninja that do not fear Mirror Coat at all. A Sassy nature completes the build to be as slow as possible, as it notably Speed ties opposing Alomomola as well as underspeed Hydrapple, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, allowing for Alomomola's teammates to enter safely. Tera Fairy is the primary option to help against rampaging Dragon- and Dark-types like Dragapult and Hisuian Samurott  while additionally boosting the damage from Play Rough to the point of securing a 2HKO against Hisuian Samurott and Iron Valiant. Tera Steel is a secondary option that improves matchups against Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon and lets it resist Stealth Rock. Either Tera type can also help against Raging Bolt and Hydrapple, two special attackers that can boost past the threat of Mirror Coat and thus pose a major threat to Alomomola. The additional 20 HP EVs allow Alomomola to survive Tera Ice Choice Specs Kyurem's Freeze-Dry after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Assault Vest Alomomola fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to tank hits and pivot but do not require the sustained healing from Wish. Strong and fast attackers like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S appreciate Alomomola's ability to provide them with a safe entrance after a slow Flip Turn while at the same time being able to switch in on potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Weavile, and Dragonite. Offensive pivots like Landorus-T, Lokix, Raging Bolt, and Cinderace can form a VoltTurn core with Alomomola and appreciate it tanking hits and pivoting on Darkrai and Walking Wake. Physical walls like Zamazenta and Skarmory can benefit from Alomomola handling special attackers like Iron Moth and Dragapult, allowing them to wall or set up on remaining physical threats that can threaten Alomomola such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, the latter of which can even prevent Alomomola from pivoting around freely. Ground-type teammates like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Iron Treads are a must to handle foes like Raging Bolt and Zapdos; besides the threat of setup from Calm Mind Raging Bolt, they can also pivot out with Volt Switch, doing big damage and avoiding the answer of Mirror Coat by pivoting to a Dark-type like Kingambit or Ting-Lu. Alomomola is vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, so Poison-types like Iron Moth and Pecharunt can be a good fit. Similarly, Spikes and Stealth Rock can also wear down Alomomola due to the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, preventing its ability to survive and pivot for longer and ruining the surprise of the Assault Vest. To handle this, teammates like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene can help to remove and prevent hazards. Corviknight can also help as a check to Grass-types like Hydrapple and Rillaboom.</p>"

Hurricane can be used over Bleakwind Storm, trading consistency for more power, letting it OHKO Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to grab momentum against threats such as Raging Bolt and Kyurem, providing switch-ins for its teammates. Knock Off lets Tornadus-T cripple its checks by removing items such as Heavy Duty Boots and Assault Vest from Galarian Slowking and Leftovers from Ting-Lu. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to threaten Steel-type Pokemon that could otherwise switch into its Flying-type STAB attack, such as Skarmory and Kingambit. 168 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow Tornadus-T to outspeed the Ogerpon formes, while 16 Special Attack EVs guarantee the 2HKO against offensive Kingambit with Heat Wave. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Tornadus-T to maximize its longevity and fully make use of Regenerator. However, Assault Vest can be used instead to allow Tornadus-T to tank special hits more effectively from foes such as Deoxys-S, Gholdengo, and Darkrai, allowing it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Ice Beam from Deoxys-S and non-Life Orb Darkrai as well being able to tank a +2 Make It Rain from Gholdengo. Tera Steel allows Tornadus-T to resist Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Ice Beam from Kyurem, Darkrai, and Deoxys-S as well as granting Tornadus-T a resistance to Stealth Rock, which can be helpful on Assault Vest sets. Tera Fairy can be used instead, allowing Tornadus-T to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch and giving it an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake while still keeping its resistance to Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk and Zamazenta.</p> <p>Tornadus-T fits best on balance teams thanks to its ability to function as a pivot and progress maker with moves like Knock Off and U-turn and Regenerator for healing. Entry hazard setters such as Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott pair excellently with Tornadus-T. Great Tusk can break through Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Tinkaton for Tornadus-T in addition to removing entry hazards if Tornadus-T is running Assault Vest, while Hisuian Samurott can check Pokemon such as Weavile and Garganacl. Similarly, Ting-Lu and Garganacl can handle foes that Tornadus-T struggles against such as Raging Bolt and Zapdos. In return, Tornadus-T can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Dragapult and Cinderace with Knock Off as well as handle Grass- and Fighting-types such as Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta that they could otherwise struggle against. Alomomola is a wonderful teammate for Tornadus-T, as they can form a potent Regenerator core with each other, and Alomomola can check physical attackers such as Weavile and Dragonite for Tornadus-T. Offensive threats such as Ogerpon-W, Zamazenta, and Darkrai pair well with Tornadus-T, with the first two appreciating its ability to threaten Pokemon like Rillaboom, Sinistcha, and Landorus-T, while the latter appreciates its ability to pressure special walls like Galarian Slowking, Ting Lu, and Assault Vest Alomomola with Knock Off. These three Pokemon also appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to pivot them in with U-turn. In return, Ogerpon-W and Darkrai can beat Gliscor, while Zamazenta can beat physical attackers such as Kingambit and Weavile for Tornadus-T. Gholdengo synergizes well with Tornados and the hazard stacking cores it finds itself on, since Tornadus-T can switch into Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. In return, Gholdengo can threaten Pokemon that Tornadus-T struggles against, such as Garganacl and Iron Crown. Corviknight makes for a good teammate, as it can remove entry hazards for Assault Vest Tornadus-T while also being able to check Kingambit. In return, Tornadus-T can check problematic Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W for Corviknight. Primarina can check Pokemon such as Gliscor, non-Terastallized Garganacl, and Weavile for Tornadus-T while also appreciating Tornadus-T pivoting it in with U-turn so it can grab setup opportunities with Calm Mind. Moltres can check prominent physical attackers such as Kingambit and Dragonite for Tornadus-T.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T acts as important glue on offense teams thanks to its valuable role compression courtesy of its utility options and defensive profile; it functions as a Stealth Rock setter, defensive pivot, and blanket check to the metagame's prominent physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta while chipping them down with Rocky Helmet in the process. It also possesses a decent Speed tier, outspeeding common threats like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Raging Bolt. Earth Power lets Landorus-T check IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk and has the added benefit of not being weakened by Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Galarian Slowking and Calm Mind Raging Bolt hard and makes use of Landorus-T's huge Attack stat in general. Aside from popping Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran's Air Balloons for Landorus-T to threaten them later, U-turn is incredibly vital to bring its teammates in safely, especially because it works incredibly well with Intimidate to soften the blow for an incoming teammate or gain momentum by forcing out the aforementioned physical attackers, all while chipping down switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Rillaboom. Taunt prevents entry hazards from a number of setters like Skarmory, Gliscor, opposing Landorus-T, and Glimmora, the last of which Landorus-T can anti-lead well with Earth Power to prevent Toxic Debris activation; stops recovery attempts from walls like Clefable, Dondozo, and Terastallized Garganacl; and limits setup attempts from Zamazenta, Air Balloon Kingambit, and Dragonite, with the three capable of using Landorus-T as setup fodder otherwise. Especially for special variants, Taunt can be dropped for a coverage move instead; Psychic lets Landorus-T threaten Hawlucha, 2HKO maximum HP Great Tusk, and hit Zamazenta slightly harder, while Grass Knot is used to 2HKO Dondozo while denting Great Tusk even more. Landorus-T's Tera type is very flexible and mostly depends on what physical threats the team is weak to. Tera Water lets Landorus-T check foes like Barraskewda, Weavile, Cinderace, and Hisuian Samurott more reliably at the cost of making it unable to deal with Raging Bolt and Rillaboom. Tera Dragon also lets it check the aforementioned foes bar Weavile with the additional Grass resistance making it sturdier against Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom. Tera Steel is another option that improves the matchup against Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Weavile but makes it unable to check Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Tera Grass is another option to check Ogerpon-W while still being great against Hisuian Samurott, Barraskewda, and Rillaboom, though it makes Landorus-T weak to Iron Moth, Cinderace, and U-turn from opposing Landorus-T. Tera Ghost can be used on special sets with Earth Power to let Landorus-T more reliably deal with IronPress Zamazenta—especially because it lacks the necessary Defense investment to repeatedly take on Zamazenta's Body Presses—and additionally prevents spinners like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Stealth Rock; however, it can no longer switch into Kingambit afterwards. A Timid nature is optimal for Earth Power variants, whereas a Jolly nature should be used if running Earthquake.</p> <p>Landorus-T is most effective on offense and bulky offense teams. Any offensive Pokemon generally appreciates the utility it brings to the table, with the likes of Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit loving its ability to bring them in safely into the field via U-turn to either set up or wallbreak, especially against Landorus-T's incoming switch-ins; the first two threaten bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo—with Ogerpon-W dealing with opposing Landorus-T and Gliscor as well—while Raging Bolt pressures Skarmory and Defog Corviknight, preventing Landorus-T's Stealth Rock from being removed. Moreover, their ability to force switches works well with Landorus-T's Stealth Rock, which can be further supported by other offensive threats like Iron Valiant and Rillaboom that can use Knock Off against Heavy-Duty Boots users like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Dragonite. Iron Valiant in particular can also be handy in covering for IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk if Landorus-T lacks Earth Power; other Pokemon like Choice Scarf Enamorus and Will-O-Wisp Dragapult are great options in this regard as well. The aforementioned Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom also appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into their offensive checks, namely opposing Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. In return, some of them possess defensive properties that aid Landorus-T; Ogerpon-W and Primarina can switch into foes like Barraskewda and Walking Wake, while Kingambit and Zamazenta can either handle or soft check Meowscarada and Weavile. IronPress Zamazenta especially appreciates Landorus-T checking Kingambit for it to remain healthy and sweep late-game much more easily. Galarian Slowking deserves a special mention as a specially defensive pivot that pairs well with Landorus-T on bulky offense structures; aside from forming a strong VoltTurn core and providing further support for the team in the form of status-spreading and Future Sight, together they form a strong defensive backbone to blanket check all threats in the metagame. Galarian Slowking is adept at switching into and dealing with most special threats, including Iron Valiant and Walking Wake, while Landorus-T handles the likes of Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads for it in return.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Landorus-T uses its massive Attack stat to its fullest, ripping apart opposing teams with ease while playing defensive and supportive roles simultaneously due to its excellent bulk, typing, and support moves. Stealth Rock helps Landorus-T pressure its own checks like Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory and increase the threat level of its teammates; Landorus-T has no issue setting them due to its ability to force switches combined with its great bulk. Earthquake with Soft Sand is very difficult to switch into without an immunity, having a chance to 2HKO offensive variants of Great Tusk and always 2HKOing Hatterene and Primarina. Stone Edge chips opposing Landorus-T while doing massive damage to Moltres, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. U-turn allows Landorus-T to pivot out of switch-ins like Gliscor and assists in positioning other threats on its team, while Taunt allows it to shut down defensive Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl and deny setup sweepers like Kingambit, Dragonite lacking Ice Spinner, and Great Tusk. The given EV spread allows Landorus-T to survive Gholdengo's Make it Rain after Stealth Rock along with an intimidated Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel while maintaining its offensive presence. Tera Ground allows Landorus-T to OHKO Iron Valiant, Darkrai, and Hisuian Samurott while 2HKOing Alomomola after Stealth Rock. Tera Water gives Landorus-T a resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks from Swift Swim sweepers, Darkrai, Weavile, and Great Tusk. Tera Ghost is an option to maintain hazards against Great Tusk and Iron Treads, but it provides little defensive value and leaves Landorus-T very vulnerable to Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Kingambit that it is otherwise tasked to check. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Soft Sand, as while it sacrifices some of Landorus-T's breaking power against Pokemon like Alomomola and Great Tusk, it can get crucial chip damage on Pokemon like Zamazenta and opposing Landorus-T to enable physical teammates.</p> <p>Offensive Landorus-T fits perfectly on offense, providing these teams with a crucial Stealth Rock setter, offensive pivot, and Ground-immune Pokemon rolled into one. Gholdengo can provide excellent defensive utility for offense teams, blocking entry hazard removal attempts while checking Iron Valiant and Deoxys-S, and Landorus-T can in return take advantage of the Ground-types that threaten Gholdengo and ease its defensive burdens by checking Kingambit. Primarina can also be an excellent partner, able to check threats like Walking Wake, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile to further bolster a team's defensive backbone while being able to take advantage of Pokemon like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T to force progress. In return, Landorus-T can switch into Raging Bolt's Electric-type attacks and force it out using the threat of an OHKO with Earthquake. Hisuian Samurott is a fantastic alternative as an offensive Water-type that forms a strong pairing with Landorus-T, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from physical walls and stacking Spikes that synergize with Landorus-T's Stealth Rock to put the opponent on an uncomfortably fast ticking timer. Landorus-T synergizes well with physical sweepers that can provide speed control while exploiting Stealth Rock and the holes made by Landorus-T's wallbreaking; Zamazenta and Kingambit are powerhouses that also provide further defensive support against threats that Landorus-T cannot handle alone such as opposing Kingambit, Darkrai, and Gholdengo, while Weavile can use Knock Off to severely weaken Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant foes such as Moltres and Zapdos so that Landorus-T's Stealth Rock can later wear them down. All three of these Pokemon can also help in weakening or eliminating Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory, a facet that this offensive Landorus-T much appreciates. Special wallbreakers like Kyurem, Iron Crown, Iron Moth, and Raging Bolt appreciate the entry points made by U-turn against Pokemon that can sit on Landorus-T like Alomomola, Corviknight, Gliscor, and Dondozo while appreciating having Landorus-T to fall back on, particularly if they opt to run Choice item sets; alternatively, these also enjoy Landorus-T having the ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt. As a strong offensive pivot with solid defensive qualities due to intimidate, Landorus-T forms a great pairing on bulky offense with other pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown that appreciate a teammate immune to Ground; these Pokemon can bring some special bulk to the table against foes like Iron Valiant and Kyurem without being passive themselves, and their Future Sight can be incredibly hard to switch into when backed up with Landorus-T's Earthquake.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T is an excellent speed control, revenge killer, and offensive pivot that also provides defensive utility thanks to its typing and Intimidate to slow down the tier's physical threats like Kingambit and Cinderace. Tera Blast is an incredibly valuable offensive tool for Landorus-T, expanding its coverage and amplifying its threat; Tera Blast Ice allows it to OHKO Gliscor, Hydrapple, and opposing Landorus-T that would otherwise be able to switch into it, but Tera Flying turns Tera Blast into a brutally powerful STAB option that meaningfully threatens Zamazenta while still slamming Great Tusk, Sinistcha, and Hydrapple, in addition to maintaining its Ground immunity and Fighting resistance. Stone Edge discourages Moltres and Zapdos from safely switching in and grants it additional coverage against Flying-types if another teammate has already Terastallized. U-turn allows Landorus-T to generate momentum for its team while safely bringing in one of its teammates; its boosted Speed makes it an excellent user of the move. Minimal investment in bulk is recommended, as it allows Landorus-T to survive Gholdengo's Make It Rain after Stealth Rock and -1 Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full HP.</p> <p>This set is mostly seen on bulky offense teams that appreciate its role as a pivot and a revenge killer. Galarian Slowking is an excellent partner for it, as it can reliably handle Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Choice Scarf Enamorus that would otherwise outspeed it, and it appreciates Landorus-T for being able to threaten Kingambit. Backup defensive switch-ins like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; they provide Landorus-T with extra insurance against Kingambit and Gliscor, and act as much-needed hazard control for when Landorus-T needs to Terastallize. Kingambit is also a fantastic partner for Landorus-T, and can punish Pokemon like Great Tusk and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Enamorus for attempting to exploit Landorus-T if it's locked into a resisted move. Lastly, Landorus-T struggles to break past physically defensive walls, notably Alomomola and Corviknight; thus, wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-W and powerful special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Kyurem make for incredibly valuable teammates and can enable it to pick off weakened foes late-game. These Pokemon also greatly enjoy having Landorus-T bringing them onto the field with its fast U-turn, in addition to it picking off faster threats like Dragapult and Darkrai. Kingambit is another Pokemon that appreciates having a fast pivot that provides it with a safe entry point and can open up for a late-game sweep. Landorus-T also enjoys Kingambit's powerful Sucker Punch for being able to pick off faster Pokemon like Iron Moth and Walking Wake.</p>"

  "Kyurem": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>When using Choice Specs, Kyurem becomes a devastating wallbreaker thanks to its great offensive typing alongside its naturally sky-high Special Attack. Freeze-Dry helps Kyurem in dealing with bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Dondozo, and common Tera Water users such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power finds itself in the last slot, allowing Kyurem to hit Galarian Slowking hard as well as Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, examples being Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo. Blizzard is an option over Draco Meteor that should only be run alongside Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking; it deals immense amount of damage to neutral and even resisted targets, letting it overwhelm Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo that tries to pivot around its Ice Beam more easily. Tera Ice provides the most amount of damage possible to its Ice-type STAB moves, which can potentially OHKO naturally high specially defensive behemoths like Clodsire and Toxapex with Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry, respectively, as well as 2HKO offensive Gholdengo and Kingambit with Ice Beam. Meanwhile, Tera Ground can be used to boost up Earth Power, having a chance to OHKO bulky variants of Kingambit and Gholdengo, as well as provide a Rock resistance, which lets it take on Stealth Rock and the dangerous Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave more easily. Finally, Tera Fairy provides Kyurem with an immunity to Dragon-type attacks such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and opposing Kyurem's Draco Meteor, coupled with a newfound Fighting resistance against moves like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta's Close Combat and Corviknight and Skarmory's Body Press. A Timid nature is preferred for its ability to outspeed key threats like Tinkaton, Landorus-T, and Gouging Fire as well as Speed tie opposing Kyurem, but a Modest nature can be used for more firepower, letting Kyurem overwhelm its checks like Galarian Slowking much more easily.</p> <p>Kyurem often finds itself in bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to destroy common walls. While Kyurem's typing is amazing offensively, defensively it makes Kyurem hard to switch in due to its numerous weaknesses combined with its average Speed tier. To solve this, pair Kyurem with pivot users; Kyurem's best friend is Galarian Slowking, which brings Kyurem in safely and provides snow with Chilly Reception as well as switch into Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Kyurem needs entry hazard removal to not get worn down quickly by hazard-stacking teams; therefore, Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Excadrill are great partners. Corviknight can take Fairy- and Dragon-type moves, clear out hazards with Defog, and provides a slow U-turn to get Kyurem in safely. Additionally, Cinderace can use Court Change to use the hazards against the opposing team and can also lure in and pivot out of checks such as Toxapex and Gliscor with U-turn for Kyurem. Hatterene is also a good partner for Kyurem, which can deflect hazards with Magic Bounce, slow down faster threats with Nuzzle, and give Kyurem a second chance at wallbreaking with Healing Wish. Physical attackers like Meowscarada can be used to scare away common special walls thanks to its crippling STAB Knock Off to make Kyurem's attacks more impactful. Another strong physical attacker is Kingambit, which threaten some of Kyurem's checks like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and specially defensive Clefable. In return, Kyurem can break past their defensive checks such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Gholdengo makes for an amazing partner, as it can switch into super effective moves aimed at Kyurem and threaten Galarian Slowking and Fairy-types with its STAB moves; in return, Kyurem beats Unaware Clodsire for it. Kyurem can take advantage of hazard-stacking teams to be even harder to wall, so common hazard setters like Skarmory, Ting Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor can be helpful, with the latter two having Knock Off on their arsenal as well to cripple Kyurem's defensive checks.</p>"
      },
      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with very few switch-ins, leveraging its hefty natural bulk and monstrous offensive stats to threaten a large portion of the tier with its perfect coverage. Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative to Draco Meteor that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense. Scale Shot variants should run an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe alongside a Naive or Hasty nature; a Naive nature is preferred in order to take on Kingambit's Sucker Punch easily and survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP, but a Hasty nature lets Kyurem avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder. A Timid nature is used to outspeed important foes like Tinkaton, Gouging Fire, and Landorus-T; alternatively, the power boost from a Modest nature can be considered, notably letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Dragonite and 2HKOing Clodsire with Ice Beam.</p> <p>Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts with Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is an effective setup sweeper with great bulk and two strong physical STAB moves in Loaded Dice-boosted Icicle Spear and Scale Shot, capable of outspeeding would-be revenge killers such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Great Tusk after a single boost. Either Tera Blast Fire or Tera Blast Ground allows Kyurem to hit Steel-types like Kingambit and Gholdengo super effectively, with Tera Blast Fire also covering for Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit, while Tera Blast Ground gives Kyurem the coveted near-unresisted Ice + Ground STAB combination to hit Heatran and other Ice-resistant targets like Iron Moth and Skeledirge hard. Additionally, Tera Fire grants Kyurem a Steel and Fire resistance, letting it set up on Gholdengo and Cinderace and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor easily, while stopping foes like Moltres and the aforementioned Cinderace from crippling it with a burn. On the other hand, Tera Ground provides an immunity to paralysis from foes like Hatterene, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is best used on offensive teams that appreciate a strong physical setup sweeper that can muscle past the bulky Ground- and Dragon-types of the tier. It is one of the few setup sweepers that immediately threatens Gliscor and provides a way for hyper offense to resist the priority from Raging Bolt and KO it. Kyurem wants a teammate to provide some form of entry hazard control like Great Tusk, as Kyurem is weak to Stealth Rock and needs Loaded Dice to output consistent damage. It appreciates the support of Spikes from setters like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott, as most of its checks are bulky grounded Pokemon. For example, one layer of Spikes allows Kyurem to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk and offensive Zamazenta without a Dauntless Shield boost at +1 and +2, respectively. Kyurem greatly enjoys snow from Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning, as the Defense boost helps greatly in positioning Kyurem to get the free turns that it needs. Alolan Ninetales can also set up Aurora Veil to further ease Kyurem's setup. Bulky Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo all give Kyurem trouble unless it is Tera Ground and willing to commit the Tera, so teammates like Gouging Fire and Knock Off Iron Valiant help to pressure these foes. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Primarina can also consistently beat Kyurem one-on-one, so offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada can be used to threaten them out. These also provide tools like Grassy Terrain to keep Kyurem healthy as it sets up and Knock Off to remove defensive items from Pokemon like Corviknight and Zamazenta. Other strong physical attackers like Gouging Fire can help to force in and wear down the Water-types that Kyurem struggles with. Very fast offensive Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant can outspeed even a +1 Kyurem and threaten huge damage with their super effective STAB moves. Because of this, Kyurem appreciates Pokemon like Gholdengo that can take hits from those fast threats and continue to apply offensive pressure.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>The mixed set brings out the best out of both sides of Kyurem's attacking capabilities, being able to break through would-be checks and thus turn itself into a monstrous wincon. What this set sacrifices in initial power is made up for in its versatility. Physical walls like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory looking to handle its Icicle Spear get 2HKOed by Freeze-Dry, while special walls like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Fezandipiti trying to tank Freeze-Dry take heavy damage from a Dragon Dance-boosted Icicle Spear. Freeze-Dry is preferred over Ice Beam, as it allows Kyurem to significantly damage Water-type foes like Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Primarina, and Earth Power targets key foes such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown that could otherwise take Kyurem on. 88 EVs in Special Attack guarantee the 2HKO on physically defensive Gholdengo with Earth Power. A Hasty nature allows Kyurem to live a Moonblast from Iron Valiant, while a Naive nature makes it take less damage from Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Never-Melt Ice enhances Kyurem's Ice-type attacks' damage output without locking it into one option and guarantees the OHKO with a three-hit Icicle Spear on Dragapult along with an OHKO on Hisuian Samurott with Freeze-Dry. Heavy-Duty Boots alternatively helps Kyurem bypass its Stealth Rock weakness; this alleviates the pressure in the teambuilder to pair Kyurem with strong support in the form of entry hazard removal. Tera Ice further pushes the power of its STAB moves to obscene levels; defensive staples such as Dondozo and Primarina fall in the range of being OHKOed, while Clodsire can’t stand more than two hits from Icicle Spear. Tera Ground instead gives Kyurem a nice boost to Earth Power that ensures the 2HKO on Garganacl, Gouging Fire, and even Assault Vest Iron Crown along with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Hatterene's Nuzzle. Tera Ground also gives Kyurem a neutrality to Fighting- and Steel-type moves, which can be decisive against Zamazenta, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown.</p> <p>Mixed Dragon Dance Kyurem fits on offensive teams as a wallbreaker capable of breaking past bulkier foes such as Galarian Slowking and Unaware walls such as Dondozo. Kyurem's main roadblock is Zamazenta, which outspeeds Kyurem and only takes neutral damage from Kyurem's attacks while being able to respond with a strong Body Press. Dragapult creates synergy, being able to switch in on Zamazenta's Fighting-type attacks, outspeed it, and force it to switch out. Dragapult can also spread status and overload shared checks like Kingambit to make it easier for Kyurem to sweep. Deoxys-S also makes for a great partner, as it also outspeeds and threatens Zamazenta while providing entry hazard support for Kyurem, which helps to chip down enemies such as bulkier variants of Primarina, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk that could otherwise take a hit. Alternative hazard setters include Great Tusk in more balanced teams and Glimmora or Hisuian Samurott in more offensively lenient teams. Bulky Steel-types that can handle Ground-type attacks like Corviknight, Air Balloon Tinkaton, and Scizor pose a significant problem to Kyurem, and Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Cinderace can neutralize them at a relatively low cost for themselves, in turn allowing Kyurem to sweep with minimal opposition. When it's opting to run Never-Melt Ice, Kyurem leaves itself exposed to hazards, which minimizes the amount of times it is able to come in a match. Hazard removal in the form of Great Tusk, Cinderace or even Corviknight can then be helpful to ensure Kyurem has a safe entry to wreak havoc.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Protect": {
        "description": "<p>By focusing on its natural bulk and typing to utilize the combination of Pressure, Substitute, and Protect, Kyurem's offensive prowess takes on another dimension by slowly suffocating the opposition with PP depletion while still being difficult to switch into due to its attacking options and solid Speed tier. Attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Raging Bolt's Draco Meteor, and Tinkaton's Gigaton Hammer are at Kyurem's mercy, while higher PP moves like Clefable's Moonblast and Corviknight's Brave Bird aren't safe either. Substitute also help punish status attempts from foes like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo and importantly take advantage of the switches Kyurem forces, especially against passive foes like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Clodsire that might not break the Substitute immediately. Moreover, Kyurem's ability to keep a Substitute up consistently against common walls grants it protection against would-be revenge killers like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, even preventing the latter and other Choice item users like Darkrai and Meowscarada from crippling it with Trick. On top of accruing more Leftovers recovery, Protect notably wastes PP of Encore from Tinkaton, Iron Valiant, and Ogerpon-W and scouts for faster offensive threats like Dragapult and Iron Crown, which is especially important because all of these can still threaten Kyurem behind a Substitute. Another reason it can afford to run Substitute and Protect is that Freeze-Dry and Earth Power provide sufficient and unresisted coverage. Freeze-Dry is the preferred Ice-type STAB move due to it denting bulky Water-types and Tera Water users like Alomomola, Primarina, Gliscor, and Garganacl and having a lot of PP, letting it fish for freeze in longer games, which Kyurem excels in, more regularly. With its Freeze-Dry handling Ground-type answers like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Hydrapple, the move is perfectly complemented by Earth Power to pressure Galarian Slowking and Ice-resistant foes such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, Tinkaton, Cinderace, and Iron Moth. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, granting it enough power to potentially 2HKO Galarian Slowking and OHKO offensive Kingambit and Gholdengo. Defensively, it provides Kyurem with a newfound Stealth Rock resistance and lets it keep a Substitute up against Garganacl's Salt Cure and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. The HP EVs allow Kyurem to make 101 HP Substitutes, preventing them from being immediately broken by Blissey's Seismic Toss.</p> <p>Kyurem is its most effective on bulkier teams, such as semi-stall and balance, that can afford to play longer games while being able to position it carefully, but it can also find a place on even faster-paced offensive teams. Its extreme vulnerability to entry hazards—specifically Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes—in longer games makes hazard removal very necessary, with common faces like Great Tusk, Corviknight, Galarian Weezing, and Cinderace being important teammates; even running a combination of them at once is recommended on bulky teams where Kyurem is the primary offensive threat. Moreover, Corviknight and Cinderace provide pivoting support by bringing it in safely on Pokemon like Gholdengo, Alomomola, and Gliscor—even popping the former's Air Balloon in the process—while Galarian Weezing can spread poison via Toxic Spikes to further take advantage of Kyurem's knack for stalling out turns while absorbing opposing Toxic Spikes. Cinderace has the added benefit of threatening bulky Steel-types like Tinkaton, Iron Crown, and Scizor that can annoy Kyurem as well as crippling foes like Hisuian Samurott, Ogerpon-W, and Assault Vest Alomomola with a burn, preventing them from breaking Kyurem's Substitute in one hit. The aforementioned Corviknight and Galarian Weezing as well as the tier's other walls like Alomomola, Dondozo, Zapdos, Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu provide Kyurem with a defensive backbone to fall back on, especially as they can switch into Pokemon like Zamazenta, Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult that can threaten Kyurem out if it's not behind a Substitute. Alomomola, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking similarly provide pivoting duties, with the former providing Wish support, while the latter sets up snow, whose Defense boost lets it survive Close Combat from Zamazenta and physical Iron Valiant from full HP, and absorbs Toxic Spikes as well. Ting-Lu and Gliscor also provide entry hazards of their own, which is crucial in taking advantage of Kyurem's forced switches, especially against foes trying to pivot around its attacks instead of staying in to not waste PP. On the other hand, offensive teammates like Deoxys-S, Zamazenta, and Darkrai are great late-game cleaners tha love Kyurem's ability to suffocate passive walls early-game. They also have a better matchup against faster offensive teams that can otherwise overrun Kyurem before it gets going. On more offensive teams, hazard setters like Landorus-T, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott are great options—especially Glimmora with its potential Toxic Spikes—while offensive threats like Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Iron Moth can keep up the pressure against the opposition alongside Kyurem and have a greater chance at sweeping once it has done its job. Additionally, Hatterene and the aforementioned Glimmora and Great Tusk valuably provide hazard control, with Iron Moth also capable of absorbing Toxic Spikes for these structures.</p>"

Surf can be used as an alternative to Hydro Pump, trading power for more consistency. Water Shuriken provides good priority for Greninja to revenge kill weakened yet faster threats such as Darkrai and Deoxys-S, as well as letting Greninja bypass revenge killing attempts from Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Ice Beam allows Greninja to hit Dragon-type Pokemon such as Hydrapple and Dragonite and hit Grass-type Pokemon such as Serperior and Rillaboom much harder. Sludge Wave can be used over Ice Beam as an alternative coverage move that can notably 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina after Stealth Rock damage while also having a stronger move to hit Ogerpon-W. Tera Water enhances its Water-type STAB moves and thus improves its cleaning potential. Tera Ghost can be used an alternative Tera type that allows Greninja to bypass Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Zamazenta's Body Press.</p> <p>Greninja fits best on hyper offense and rain teams as an excellent sweeper and cleaner. On hyper offense teams, leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can get up entry hazards to help Greninja grab KOs more easily. Dragonite is an excellent teammate for Greninja, as it can deal with Grass-types such as Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom, while Greninja can eliminate physically defensive Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Garganacl for it. Gholdengo is also a good teammate, as it can help check Zamazenta, which is otherwise a dangerous threat that Greninja can let in; in return, Greninja can help check Fire- and Ground-types such as Cinderace and Landorus-T. On rain teams, Pelipper is a prime teammate, as it sets up the rain and helps Greninja get safe switch-ins with U-turn. Barraskewda is an excellent partner that helps Greninja by keeping momentum with Flip Turn and overwhelming shared checks like Primarina and Kyurem. Raging Bolt is a fantastic teammate for Greninja, as it can break bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Primarina and specially defensive Alomomola, and in return, Greninja can eliminate Ground-type Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads for Raging Bolt. Iron Treads is a great teammate, since it can reliably clear hazards to keep Greninja healthy as well as check Raging Bolt for Greninja. Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W are also excellent partners for Greninja, threatening special walls such as Primarina and Blissey.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hawlucha acts as a threatening sweeper and late-game cleaner on Terrain teams. Thanks to Grassy Seed activating Unburden, Hawlucha becomes faster than the majority of the metagame, outpacing Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users like Darkrai and Iron Valiant and providing plenty of coverage with its Fighting / Flying STAB combination. Its serviceable bulk, along with a boost to its Defense due to Grassy Seed, allows Hawlucha to use Swords Dance in front of many common foes, such as Kingambit and Great Tusk. Encore can force switches and thwart recovery attempts by locking the foe into a resisted attack or a recovery move. Alternatively, Substitute can also give Hawlucha the breathing room it might need to set up against incoming status moves from Gliscor and deny Sucker Punch and Thunderclap from Kingambit and Raging Bolt, respectively. Psychic Seed is an alternative to enable Hawlucha on Psychic Terrain teams, granting it a valuable Special Defense boost that can help it set up in the face of special attackers like Iron Valiant. 124 EVs in Speed are enough to outspeed Sand Rush Excadrill after Unburden activates, and the bulk investment allows it to survive a Make It Rain from Gholdengo from full HP. Tera Flying is a great way to enhance Acrobatics's damage output; after a Swords Dance, Hawlucha can OHKO Zamazenta through Dauntless Shield with Tera Flying. Alternatively, Tera Electric can be used to withstand Zapdos, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, disallowing paralysis attempts and resisting their main attacks. Compared to Tera Electric, Tera Ground is an even better option to prevent Raging Bolt's revenge killing attempts at the cost of being vulnerable to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Weavile's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Whenever Hawlucha opts to run Grassy Seed, Rillaboom is always nearby. Rillaboom's terrain-setting ability and slow U-turn is pivotal in unleashing Hawlucha's onslaught. It can additionally spread Knock Off to rid Skarmory and Corviknight of their Rocky Helmet, for instance. Strong partners on Grassy Terrain teams include Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Heatran that can help to pressure some of Hawlucha's checks prior to its sweep such as the aforementioned Skarmory and Corviknight. Entry hazard support in the form of Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, or Ting-Lu is also much appreciated. Hawlucha faces two big roadblocks in Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Gholdengo in particular can easily shrug off Acrobatics and Close Combat, and it can take out Hawlucha while keeping itself healthy with Recover. Kingambit or the aforementioned Heatran have positive matchups against Gholdengo, while Pokemon like Hatterene can force Gholdengo in and weaken it while also providing a faster-paced Terrain team with entry hazard control. Raging Bolt, on the other hand, threatens non-Tera Electric Hawlucha with Thunderbolt and Thunderclap. It is therefore important to pair it with partners that can neutralize Raging Bolt such as Iron Valiant and Primarina. While the archetype is more niche, Indeedee is used instead of Rillaboom on Psychic Terrain teams. Rain teams can also handle Hawlucha, as Barraskewda still outspeeds it in the rain. Raging Bolt is a great check to rain teams that synergizes well with Grassy Terrain and can deal with rain's threats prior to Hawlucha cleaning up late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hisuian Goodra carves out a niche as a special tank with its gargantuan Special Defense augmented by Assault Vest, letting it beat foes like Darkrai, Raging Bolt, and Iron Moth one-on-one. Dragon Tail allows it to phaze the aforementioned threats if they get out of hand and other miscellaneous threats like Kingambit and Swords Dance Gliscor if it lacks the appropriate coverage while forcing entry hazard damage against the opposition, while Draco Meteor's nuke can be used to punish the likes of Ogerpon-W, Alomomola, and Cinderace harder and immediately OHKOes foes like Kyurem and Walking Wake. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Goodra to dissuade Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Kingambit from switching in whereas Ice Beam lets it deal heavy damage to Flying-types like Zapdos and Enamorus while also doing well against Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and particularly specially defensive Gliscor, which would otherwise wall it. However, Knock Off can be used over one of these coverage moves, as it allows Hisuian Goodra to force progress against foes like Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Garganacl, making them vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards by removing either their Heavy-Duty Boots or their passive recovery in Leftovers. It's also worth noting that potential Knock Off absorbers like Gliscor and Clefable struggle to take any of Hisuian Goodra's attacks. Sap Sipper is the preferred ability, as it makes Hisuian Goodra immune to Grass-type attacks from Ogerpon-W, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom, allowing it to serve as a more solid check to these foes before and after Terastallizing. On the other hand, Gooey punishes contact moves like Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Weavile's Knock Off by lowering the attacker's speed, giving Hisuian Goodra more chances at dealing damage back and opening up teammates to potentially revenge kill these foes. Tera Fairy gives a key resistance to Fighting-type attacks and an immunity to Dragon-type moves, which lets it beat Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult.</p> <p>Hisuian Goodra primarily fits on balance teams where its defensive and offensive shortcomings are alleviated. Teammates like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Alomomola can safety pivot Hisuian Goodra so it can force out opponents like Darkrai and Gholdengo. Additionally, Alomomola is an amazing partner thanks to the Wish support it can provide; in exchange, Hisuian Goodra deals with Ogerpon-W. Landorus-T complements Hisuian Goodra's Knock Off with Stealth Rock, while Zapdos provides Thunder Wave, with both of them checking physical foes like Zamazenta and Kingambit. Hisuian Goodra often has problems with longevity, as entry hazards can slowly chip it down to low enough health to be taken out. For this reason, Great Tusk and Cinderace are great teammates, since they offer hazard control through Rapid Spin and Court Change, respectively. On top of that, the former appreciates Hisuian Goodra taking hits from spinblockers like Gholdengo and Dragapult, while the latter can pivot Hisuian Goodra in with U-turn or use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical threats like Great Tusk and Dragonite for it. Ting-Lu and Gliscor can support Hisuian Goodra through setting hazards, letting it use Knock Off or Dragon Tail more effectively. In return, both appreciate the defensive fallback Hisuian Goodra provides against Ogerpon-W, Hatterene, and Darkrai. Physical attackers like Zamazenta and Dragonite enjoy Hisuian Goodra taking care of key foes such as Fairy-types like Enamorus and Clefable for the former and Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the latter.</p>"

Simultaneously, the Assault Vest and physical bulk investment slightly improve its matchup against offensive teams, capable of trading hits decently well; in particular, Assault Vest magnifies Hoopa-U's natural special bulk to soft check common threats like Gholdengo, Darkrai, Kyurem, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off can remove valuable items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from foes like Ting-Lu and Alomomola, while Psychic Noise can shut down the recovery of Gliscor and Clefable, with an even wider range of Pokemon falling victim to both moves, including common defensive staples like Garganacl, Moltres, Clodsire, and Dondozo. Psychic Noise has the added benefit of stopping Hatterene and Primarina's Draining Kiss, letting Hoopa-U potentially win the one-on-one. Aside from providing Hoopa-U with decent longevity, Drain Punch reliably hits Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Darkrai, and Kingambit as well as common Tera Dark users like Clodsire, which can attempt to heal in the face of Hoopa-U's Psychic Noise. Thunderbolt immediately nails physically defensive Water- and Flying-types like Alomomola, Dondozo, Moltres, and Corviknight. On top of working well with Tera Poison, Gunk Shot is another option to threaten common Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users like Primarina, Hatterene, Clefable, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo while netting the OHKO against Ogerpon-W; the poison chance is also handy against foes like Ting-Lu. The Special Attack EVs allow Hoopa-U to OHKO Keldeo with Psychic Noise, with the remaining Defense EVs letting it reach benchmarks such as surviving Ogerpon-W's Power Whip after Stealth Rock, +1 Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock, and +1 Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Tera Fairy provides a generally valuable defensive typing against the metagame's Dragon- and Dark-types like Dragapult, Raging Bolt, Kyurem, and Weavile, while Tera Poison flips its Fairy weakness from foes like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Primarina. Both Tera types provide a crucial U-turn resistance against pivots like Landorus-T, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Rillaboom as well as letting it stomach otherwise fearsome Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta and physical Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Hoopa-U works well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression as a strong stallbreaker and special tank. Defensive pivots like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, Corviknight, Zapdos, and Moltres are necessary teammates; aside from bringing Hoopa-U into the field safely, they can deal with and switch into troublesome offensive threats that can overrun Hoopa-U, such as Enamorus, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile. Moreover, Moltres, Zapdos, and Corviknight can punish otherwise no-drawback U-turns aimed at Hoopa-U from foes like Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Ogerpon-W with Flame Body, Static, and Rocky Helmet, while Alomomola provides crucial Wish support for Hoopa-U. The aforementioned Corviknight as well as other entry hazard control options like Great Tusk and Cinderace also keep Hoopa-U healthy by removing troublesome hazards. The team's own entry hazards from setters like Garganacl, Gliscor, and Clefable are similarly important, as they take advantage of the switches that Hoopa-U forces and further exacerbates its ability to suffocate defensive teams, especially because it makes Heavy-Duty Boots users like Alomomola and Moltres vulnerable to them with Knock Off. Landorus-T is a phenomenal partner on bulky offense teams that similarly covers all of the aforementioned traits; it brings Hoopa-U in safely via U-turn, sets Stealth Rock, and switches into physical attackers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and opposing Landorus-T. Other wallbreakers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt can further pressure the opposition together with Hoopa-U, with Gholdengo also capable of defensively covering for its weaknesses against Iron Valiant. Hoopa-U works well with late-game cleaners like Zamazenta that appreciate its positive matchup against bulky teams that they tend to struggle with; in particular, Hoopa-U's ability to either threaten or overwhelm the likes of Dondozo, Moltres, and Clefable makes it take over games more easily. Furthermore, it also complements Hoopa-U by excelling against offensive teams that Hoopa-U has a harder time keeping up with, either offensively threatening or defensively handling foes like Kingambit and Weavile. Other offensive threats like Dragapult are great teammates too, with it in particular capable of bringing Hoopa-U on the field safely via U-turn and crippling foes like Kingambit with status to improve Hoopa-U's matchup against them.</p>"

Its typing also allows it to function as an offensive Water-type able to threaten Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon. Steam Eruption lets Volcanion pressure Pokemon switching in by threatening a burn. Earth Power allows Volcanion to hit Galarian Slowking, Raging Bolt, Water Absorb Clodsire, and opposing Volcanion super effectively. Tera Blast Fairy rounds out its coverage and allows Volcanion to hit Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable super effectively as well as OHKO Ogerpon-W. Taunt can be used instead on Heavy-Duty Boots variants to allow Volcanion to deny recovery attempts from defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Blissey, and Dondozo. Fire Spin + Taunt is an option to trap passive foes, particularly walls like Blissey and Alomomola, and rack up significant amounts of passive damage. Tera Ghost can be used alongside both Fire Spin and Taunt to give Volcanion an immunity to Seismic Toss and Body Press from Blissey and Zamazenta, respectively, allowing Volcanion to trap and beat them. Choice Specs lets Volcanion maximize its offensive prowess, most notably letting it guarantee a 2HKO Galarian Slowking and Dragapult with Steam Eruption and Earth Power, respectively. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used over Choice Specs to grant Volcanion an immunity to entry hazards. Tera Ground grants Volcanion an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt in addition to maximizing the power of Earth Power, allowing it to break through Galarian Slowking more easily.</p> <p>Volcanion fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to it providing teams a powerful wallbreaker. If running Choice Specs, Volcanion can have a tough time trying to get into battle due to it being weak to entry hazards, so pivots such as Zapdos, Galarian Slowking, and Corviknight can all provide safe switch-in opportunities for Volcanion to bypass this. Corviknight can also provide Defog support, allowing it to clear entry hazards for Volcanion to grab opportunities to switch in and wallbreak. In return, Volcanion can threaten Fire-types such as Cinderace, Heatran, and Moltres for Corviknight. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can help Volcanion overwhelm bulkier Pokemon such as Kyurem, Galarian Slowking, and Primarina. Volcanion also appreciates their ability to deal with Electric-types such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt in addition to Landorus-T's ability to pivot Volcanion in with U-turn. In return, Volcanion can handle Water-types such as Alomomola, Primarina, and Ogerpon-W for them while being able to switch in on Fire-types like Moltres and Heatran. Physical wallbreakers such as Weavile, Dragonite, and Kingambit are great partners, as they can handle special walls such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking. Weavile, Dragonite, and Kingambit can all bring strong priority to the table, allowing them to revenge kill faster threats such as Roaring Moon and Darkrai, In return, Volcanion can deal with physical walls such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and non-Terastallized Garganacl for them. Volcanion can get worn down quickly if it's not running Heavy-Duty Boots due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, so entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Cinderace, Great Tusk, and Hatterene can help alleviate this issue. Cinderace can also provide safe switch-in opportunites for Volcanion thanks to U-turn, while Great Tusk can also provide entry hazards for Volcanion; both Cinderace and Great Tusk benefit from Volcanion handling Water-types. Hatterene can also provide Healing Wish support, allowing Volcanion to have a second assault if it gets low on health, while also being able to provide paralysis support against faster Pokemon such as Darkrai and Iron Valiant. In return, Volcanion can check Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo for Hatterene.</p>"

Assault Vest allows Primarina to tank strong super effective hits like Serperior's Leaf Storm and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, along with the ability to check threats like Walking Wake, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant. Surf and Moonblast hit the majority of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, where Surf hits the Steel- and Fire-types such as Gholdengo and Cinderace that resist Moonblast, and Moonblast hits Dragon-types such as Dragapult that resist Surf. Flip Turn allows Primarina to slow pivot a teammate in after a foe has attacked, and it can also be used on predicted switches to gain momentum. Psychic Noise blocks healing from special walls like Blissey, Clodsire, and Clefable, allowing Primarina to chip them down for itself and its partners. 176 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna, while the remaining HP EVs allow Primarina to reach feats such as surviving Protosynthesis Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, +1 Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, +2 Gliscor's Earthquake, and two Heavy Slams from Zamazenta. Tera Steel turns two of Primarina's major weaknesses, Poison and Grass, into an immunity and a resistance, respectively. This can be useful against moves like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave. Tera Steel also provides a resistance to Stealth Rock, letting it pivot around more freely. However, Tera Steel negatively affects its matchup into Fire- and Fighting-types like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Tera Grass aids Primarina's matchup into Ogerpon-W and can help it against Raging Bolt in a pinch too; however, do note that Tera Grass still leaves it vulnerable to Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Assault Vest Primarina is best used on bulky offense teams that appreciate a Pokemon that has both offensive and defensive prowess, generally teams that are particularly weak to special attackers. Landorus-T provides Intimidate and checks the physical attackers that Primarina struggles with like Kingambit and Great Tusk. Great Tusk is another great teammate, as it provides entry hazard removal and checks Galarian Slowking, which tends to threaten Primarina. In return, Primarina can handle threats like Darkrai and Walking Wake. Kingambit and Weavile appreciate support from Primarina that can switch in on and threaten Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon help check Galarian Slowking for Primarina, along with resisting Grass-type attacks. Gholdengo appreciates Primarina's ability to check Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran, as well as Walking Wake. Primarina struggles with Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom, so it's essential to have checks to these such as Rillaboom, Cinderace, and Kingambit. Cinderace, aside from resisting Grass-type attacks, can also help with hazard removal with Court Change, allowing Primarina to switch in more often. Dragapult and Cinderace can form a great pivoting core with Primarina, and they can also spread burn in order to help improve Primarina's matchup against physical attackers like Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Primarina is a fierce sweeper that can use its STAB moves, combined with Calm Mind, to muscle through most enemies. Primarina can choose between Surf for perfect accuracy or Hydro Pump for greater power that lets it 2HKO Galarian Slowking at +1. Substitute lets Primarina grab more Calm Mind boosts while slower Pokemon try to cripple Primarina with a status effect, like Toxic from Clodsire, Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking, or Salt Cure from Garganacl, as well as easing prediction. It can use Psychic Noise to block healing from defensive Pokemon, including Slack Off from Galarian Slowking, Recover from Clodsire, and Wish from Alomomola, thus making them easier to beat. Encore is a niche option that lets Primarina lock opposing Pokemon into moves they don't care for, which can be especially effective in shutting down Kingambit and walls like Clefable and Sinistcha, forcing switches that can give it more opportunities to boost or attack. As for items, Primarina has good choices as well; its item can be Leftovers to grab more healing, pairing well with Substitute, while Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to avoid taking damage from entry hazards. Custap Berry allows Primarina to get one last attack before fainting, which can be useful in luring in and surprising Pokemon that want to use Primarina as momentum. 176 Speed EVs allow Primarina to outspeed Adamant Kingambit. Tera Steel lets Primarina stay in and tank attacks from Grass-, Poison-, and Steel-types and hit them back hard; examples of these moves include Wood Hammer from Rillaboom, Sludge Wave from Iron Moth, and Make It Rain from Gholdengo. Its biggest claim to fame is being able to resist Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, turning one of its worst matchups into a setup opportunity. Tera Ghost gives it an immunity to Blissey's Seismic Toss, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Zamazenta's Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>This Primarina set excels in hyper offensive structures as an early-game monster thanks to its good damage output and Calm Mind, which allow Primarina to destroy Kingambit, Heatran, Zamazenta, Clodsire, and many others. Kingambit loves the fact that Primarina can beat some of its counters like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Kingambit, in return, can beat Galarian Slowking and Blissey. The same applies to Iron Valiant, which appreciates Primarina's ability to counter Pokemon like Gholdengo and Skeledirge that can otherwise give it trouble. Thanks to Primarina's good matchup against defensive Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, Pokemon like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt appreciate the help sweeping late-game. Primarina struggles against Pokemon that can either shut it down fast with super effective moves, like Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom, strong physical offense from the likes of offensive Great Tusk, or sturdy special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Primarina loves the support from Landorus-T, which can scare away special walls with Earthquake, absorb Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, support Primarina with Intimidate, allowing Primarina to take on strong physical offense, gain momentum from U-turn, which Landorus-T can easily obtain from common switch-ins like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Skarmory, and set up entry hazards to nab some good damage thresholds, like greatly improving the chance for Primarina to 2HKO bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with unboosted Surf. Iron Treads is another Ground-type that Primarina appreciates for its ability to check Galarian Slowking; it also provides Stealth Rock support, as well as Rapid Spin to clear the field of hazards. Another great partner is Rillaboom, since it also scares away the aforementioned Galarian Slowking and Blissey, as well as Great Tusk, and provides Primarina with extra healing from Grassy Surge. Dragapult is also a good teammate for Primarina because of its ability to check Ogerpon-W, spread status that can help Primarina either tank or outspeed opposing Pokemon more easily, and use U-turn to bring Primarina safely into the battle. Darkrai makes a good pairing due to its ability to beat Galarian Slowking and really appreciates Primarina's ability to beat both Clodsire and Iron Valiant. Offensive hazard setters like Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S bring hazard pressure that can help Primarina break through walls more easily. Galarian Slowking provides pivoting with Chilly Reception and offensive pressure with Future Sight.</p>"

      "Bulky Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to a great typing and solid overall bulk, Primarina is one of the most dangerous set up sweepers in OU, capable of checking and setting up on offensive Pokemon like Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Calm Mind makes Primarina able to threaten the opposing team while also making itself harder to KO for potential revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Psychic Noise can be used in combination with Liquid Voice to cripple defensive switch-ins that would be able to beat it one-on-one, such as Dondozo, Unaware Clefable, and Clodsire. Surf is also an option to put more pressure on offensive teams due to it's higher Base Power while being run with Torrent, which can power it up in a pinch. It notably is useful against Gholdengo as well as threatening the 2HKO on bulky Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute prevents Primarina from being affected by status moves such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Toxic from Clodsire. It also punishes switches that Primarina forces and allows it to scout opposing Pokemon. Substitute is also useful to avoid being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Meowscarada while blocking Trick from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gholdengo. It is also a safe way to bring Primarina to Torrent range. The 8 Special Defense EVs allow Primarina to avoid the 2HKO from Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake's Hydro Steam under sun. Both Tera Poison and Steel flip the matchup against Grass-types like Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom while also turning the tables on Galarian Slowking. With Tera Steel, Primarina resists Gholdengo's Make it Rain and can beat it one-on-one. It can also absorb Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and set up on Hatterene and Clefable.</p> <p>Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the natural defensive utility that Primarina brings to the table while also being a threatening sweeper itself. Primarina can support teammates such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk by switching in on Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Rillaboom is particulary good, as Primarina covers threats to it like Cinderace, Dragonite, and Skeledirge while appreciating the extra healing of Grassy Terrain. Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Weavile can threaten Pokemon that would otherwise be annoying for Primarina, such as Galarian Slowking, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior, respectively. Due to Primarina's lack of reliable recovery, it struggles against entry hazards, especially hazard stacking teams. The aforementioned Great Tusk helps it by removing them with Rapid Spin while also being a switch-in to Kingambit that can threaten a weakened Primarina out. Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Serperior can safely switch into Primarina and threaten it with powerful attacks, forcing it to Terastallize or switch out; Pokemon that can switch in on these threats like Kingambit, Rillaboom, Skarmory, and Corviknight make for great teammates. Kingambit is also a huge help, as it beats one of the most common checks to Primarina in Galarian Slowking while appreciating Primarina's ability to safely switch in and beat Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Skarmory.</p>"

  "Ribombee": {
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<p>Ribombee carves a niche for itself as a consistent suicide lead and the tier's most reliable Sticky Web setter due to its excellent Speed tier and strong STAB Moonblast to punish Great Tusk. Sticky Web cripples opposing hyper offense, as the archetype tends to rely heavily on various sweepers' Speed stats to function effectively. Sticky Web is also extremely disruptive against fast Paradox Pokemon aiming to get a Speed boost from their ability like Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Moth as well as Walking Wake on sun teams. Stun Spore, though inaccurate, can cripple faster threats like Darkrai and Ribombee to set up Sticky Web the next turn. Psychic Noise threatens Glimmora while having the added utility of neutralizing recovery attempts from walls like Clodsire and Blissey, which are generally unafraid of Sticky Web. More importantly, however, Psychic Noise threatens Substitute Iron Moth, which otherwise has an extremely lopsided matchup against Sticky Web teams featuring Ribombee by virtue of being able to set up a Substitute for free against it and fish for two Fiery Dance boosts against it thereafter, possibly winning the game on the spot. Skill Swap, alternatively, allows Ribombee to steal Hatterene's Magic Bounce and set up Sticky Web against it, and it can also remove Gliscor's Poison Heal and force it to switch out. Shield Dust is a wonderful ability that blocks secondary effects from moves like Galarian Slowking and Darkrai's Sludge Bomb and Moltres's Flamethrower, consistently giving Ribombee a minimum of two turns to both set Sticky Web and either attack or Paralyze a threat with Stun Spore to force more long-term progress before fainting. Tera Ghost is preferred to allow Ribombee to block Rapid Spin from threats like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Excadrill, ensuring that Sticky Web remains active; however, Tera Steel is a perfectly fine alternative that allows Ribombee to block Glimmora's Mortal Spin while occasionally giving it some added longevity against threats like Iron Crown and Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Ribombee is the cornerstone of Sticky Web offense, and as such its best teammates tend to be powerful offensive threats that can best capitalize on the entry hazard's Speed control. Gholdengo is a nearly mandatory teammate, since its typing and Good as Gold collectively neutralize all of Rapid Spin, Mortal Spin, and Defog and ensure that Sticky Web remains active throughout the game. Gholdengo's high damage output and access to Nasty Plot let it threaten defensive teams that do not care as much about Sticky Web, while its middling Speed tier is circumvented by Sticky Web to the point that it can now reliably outspeed Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W, making it a prime beneficiary of the entry hazard. Iron Moth is an excellent teammate; with Sticky Web support it can opt to forego its standard speed Booster Energy spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe in favor of a harder-hitting EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe amplified further by a Special Attack boost from Booster Energy and a Modest nature. A set like this not only lets Iron Moth greatly threaten Cinderace with its powerful Sludge Wave but also effectively utilizes Tera Ghost to spinblock in a pinch, which is an especially useful trait given that it naturally absorbs Toxic Spikes. Swords Dance Ogerpon-W is another excellent abuser of Sticky Web; it naturally boasts an excellent matchup against bulkier teams and greatly appreciates Sticky Web support to circumvent its less-consistent matchups against fast threats like Darkrai and fast Booster Energy users like Iron Moth and Iron Valiant and get the jump on opposing Ogerpon-W that would otherwise Speed tie with it. Raging Bolt is also a useful teammate, as it naturally has great bulk and a massive damage output; its Speed is decent enough to take great advantage of Sticky Web, but it can still function effectively should Ribombee's Sticky Web be removed thanks to Thunderclap's ability to threaten fast threats like Zamazenta, Darkrai, Iron Valiant, and Deoxys-S. Meteor Beam Glimmora is a premiere abuser of Sticky Web, as it can forego Rock Polish in favor of Dazzling Gleam's coverage or Power Gem's consistency, and it hits incredibly hard after a Meteor Beam boost, obliterating Cinderace seeking to use Court Change and punishing any of its attempts to attack Glimmora directly thanks to Toxic Debris. Low Kick Kingambit and Roar Zamazenta are excellent teammates that appreciate Sticky Web support, in part because the hazard can provide them with crucial Speed advantages in mirror matches. Bulk Up Great Tusk can fulfill many roles for Sticky Web teams, both by providing Rapid Spin support and by being a setup sweeper that can snowball late-game that still provides valuable defensive utility by virtue of resisting Kingambit's Sucker Punch, being immune to Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, and being naturally bulky enough to withstand Dragonite's Extreme Speed if needed. Hisuian Samurott is a solid teammate; its Ceaseless Edge allows it to set Spikes, which are otherwise incredibly difficult to fit on Sticky Web teams, and its Knock Off is very threatening against offensive Heavy-Duty Boots users like Weavile, Ogerpon, and various Darkrai and Great Tusk sets that otherwise match up favorably against Sticky Web teams. Lastly, Serperior and Choice Specs Enamorus are good Sticky Web sweepers that can quickly snowball out of control. Both appreciate being faster than the likes of Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant and greatly punish Defog with Contrary; Serperior takes advantage of opposing Sticky Web with Contrary, while Enamorus can also outspeed Ogerpon-W after Sticky Web and can either wear down the team with its powerful Moonblast or snowball out of control with Tera Stellar+Tera Blast late-game.</p>"

      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<p>Araquanid is the tier's premier Sticky Web user due to its good defensive typing, serviceable bulk, and amazing offensive matchups against notable threats to Sticky Web teams such as Iron Moth, Cinderace, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk thanks to its Water Bubble ability. Surf is not only a very consistent STAB move for reliable damage, but it also prevents Glimmora from setting up Toxic Spikes with its ability and allows Araquanid to deal with Taunt Landorus-T sets that might try to prevent Araquanid from setting Sticky Web. On physical sets, Liquidation has its merits by doing more damage to Assault Vest Pokemon or Pokemon that are more physically frail, such as Iron Crown and Dragapult; however, this does come at the cost of not being able to grab important KOs on entry hazard-removing leads such as Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. With Endeavor, Araquanid can chip the notable Water-type checks of the tier like Ogerpon-W and Primarina, and using it with Custap Berry allows Araquanid to deal sudden damage to threatening sweepers such as  Kyurem before being KOed. Leech Life on physical sets does more damage to threatening anti-leads like Ogerpon-W and opposing leads like Hisuian Samurott. Endure can be used to activate Custap Berry more consistently in the face of counter leads such as Raging Bolt and powerful Choice Band users such as Zamazenta, while Mirror Coat can be opted for to deal massive damage to special attackers such as Zapdos. 40 Defense EVs and maximum HP investment guarantees Araquanid will take two Ceaseless Edges from Hisuian Samurott, and a Modest nature with the rest of its remaining EVs in Special Attack will enable Araquanid to 2HKO physically defensive Hatterene with Surf even after Leftovers recovery. If Araquanid is running physical moves, then an Adamant nature and 216 Attack EVs should be run instead. Araquanid can also take full advantage of its high Special Defense by running an EV spread of 252 HP / 116 SpA / 112 SpD / 28 Spe. This specially defensive spread allows it to survive a Thunderbolt from Modest Raging Bolt even after a Special Attack boost from Protosynthesis; however, these sets need to opt for Hydro Pump over Surf to guarantee the OHKO against maximum HP Landorus-T. Araquanid can also invest 28 EVs into Speed to outpace Ting-Lu. Although Terastallizing Araquanid should generally be avoided in order to preserve Terastallization for its teammates, which generally need it more, Tera Ghost allows Araquanid to spinblock Iron Treads and Great Tusk in emergencies where Araquanid is near fainting and also allows Araquanid to get a guaranteed Endeavor off against Extreme Speed Dragonite if it is in Custap Berry activation range.</p> <p>Araquanid has found its home as a reliable entry hazard setter on Sticky Web hyper offense teams, and as such, setup sweepers with middling Speed tiers greatly appreciate its presence. Gholdengo is an almost-required teammate on such structures and allows Sticky Web teams to block hazard removal from Rapid Spin, Glimmora's Mortal Spin, and Defog thanks to its ability. Gholdengo is also invaluable in dismantling the bulkier team structures that hyper offense teams in general struggle against greatly. Other setup sweepers with middling Speed tiers such as Attack Booster Energy Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Meteor Beam Glimmora also pair excellently with Araquanid. Great Tusk’s hazard removal can allow Araquanid to come in multiple times per match, and its typing allows for it to check anti-leads to Araquanid, namely Raging Bolt. Iron Treads can also be considered on Sticky Web teams heavily weak to Raging Bolt. Meteor Beam Glimmora can assist Sticky Web structures by absorbing Toxic Spikes and setting Stealth Rock for its teammates while also still maintaining heavy offensive pressure. Iron Moth is another potent sweeper that Sticky Web teams can employ, as Sticky Web being set up lets Iron Moth run maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature, granting it a Special Attack boost from its Booster Energy and allowing it to do more consistent damage even without boosts from Fiery Dance. Kingambit can also take great advantage of Sticky Web, as it allows for Kingambit to get the jump on opposing Jolly Kingambit and, if Kingambit itself opts to run a Jolly nature, maximum Speed Great Tusk without Heavy-Duty Boots. Ogerpon-W is excellent on Sticky Web teams, as with Swords Dance and an Adamant nature, which it can now run thanks to Araquanid relieving it from the pressure of Speed ties with opposing Ogerpon-W, it forms a strong core with Gholdengo that can throttle the bulkier team structures that hyper offense teams tend to struggle with.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its combination of power, strong priority, solid bulk, and excellent support through Grassy Terrain, Rillaboom is a premier wallbreaker and revenge killer in OU. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda while also denying lead Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott from getting two turns to set entry hazards. Wood Hammer is an excellent tool for breaking through even resistant Pokemon, being able to 2HKO Raging Bolt and Kingambit after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Hatterene. U-turn makes Rillaboom a pivot while also being the strongest option against Lokix and Hydrapple. Knock Off removes items from Rillaboom's checks, including Dragonite, Skarmory, and Moltres, while also being the best option to hit Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking. Drain Punch is an alternative that OHKOes Kingambit and hits Heatran switching in while increasing Rillaboom's longevity. An Adamant nature is preferred for its power boost; however, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Adamant Rillaboom and Gholdengo without Choice Scarf at the cost of being unable to always OHKO Pokemon like Dondozo and Galarian Slowking with Wood Hammer and Knock Off. An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used alongside an Adamant nature to outspeed Gliscor while allowing Rillaboom to survive hits such as Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost, Ogerpon-W's +2 Power Whip, and Tornadus-T's Bleakwind Storm; however, it notably worsens Rillaboom's matchup against opposing Rillaboom and Raging Bolt due to being outsped. Tera Grass powers up Rillaboom's Grass-type moves, allowing Grassy Glide to OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock and Wood Hammer to OHKO Clefable, Toxapex, and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk can take advantage of Grassy Terrain's recovery while removing entry hazards for Rillaboom with Rapid Spin, as Rillaboom is prone to hazard damage. Hawlucha is another one of Rillaboom's biggest beneficiaries, using Grassy Seed and Unburden to become an excellent sweeper with nearly unmatched Speed. In return, Rillaboom breaks open bulky teams for Hawlucha and Great Tusk and removes Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Terastallized Dondozo. Bulky Ground-weak Pokemon, including Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Heatran, appreciate Grassy Terrain nullifying their weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu while providing extra passive recovery. Kingambit can form a dual priority core with Rillaboom, notably revenge killing Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo while any attempts to stall out its Sucker Punch give an extra turn of recovery from Grassy Terrain. Raging Bolt is another excellent priority user and wallbreaker that additionally enjoys Rillaboom's U-turn bringing it on checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Moltres. Iron Moth and Heatran can also come in on Rillaboom's checks like Cinderace, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Iron Defense Zamazenta is an excellent teammate, as Rillaboom breaks and overwhelms walls like Dondozo and Skarmory that would get in the way of its sweep, and the extra longevity from Grassy Terrain is amazing to keep Zamazenta healthy, as it lacks any reliable ways to heal outside of Leftovers. Hatterene and Comfey can become potent sweepers when used with Rillaboom, both being able to run Grassy Seed while the extra longevity allows Hatterene to keep hazards off more consistenly with Magic Bounce. Grassy Seed allows Hatterene and Comfey to set up on physical attackers that can no longer 2HKO them like Heavy Slam Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Great Tusk while giving an appreciated boost to their Stored Power. Ursaluna and Rillaboom form a terrifying offensive core, with Rillaboom supporting Ursaluna with Knock Off and Grassy Terrain to nullify Flame Orb's chip damage. Both Tail Glow and Take Heart Manaphy can be used alongside Rillaboom, as the Terrain powers up its Energy Ball and gives extra longevity to set up, become unbreakable, and fire off devastating Stored Powers, respectively. Rillaboom can bypass checks like Dragonite, Zapdos, and Moltres with support from Stealth Rock setters like Heatran, Great Tusk, and Glimmora in addition to its Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Rillaboom is an excellent Terrain setter, revenge killer, wallbreaker, and offensive pivot all at once thanks to its good Attack stat, Grassy Surge, and access to a phenomenal movepool. Knock Off hits Grass-resistant foes such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking super effectively while also removing items from common switch-ins such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Moltres, Rocky Helmet from Skarmory, and Leftovers from Zamazenta, reducing their effectiveness. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot out of bad matchups such as against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Raging Bolt and generate momentum for its team; it also enables Rillaboom to bring its setup sweeper teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene in. Low Kick hits foes like Kingambit and Heatran for super effective damage. Alternatively, Wood Hammer can be used as a stronger STAB move, OHKOing offensive Great Tusk and 2HKOing defensive variants, 2HKOing Hatterene, and having a roll to OHKO Ting-Lu. 52 Speed EVs allow Rillaboom to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Alternatively, a spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be run for Rillaboom to outspeed Gliscor. With Tera Grass, Rillaboom 2HKOes Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide and Gliscor with Wood Hammer after Poison Heal. Otherwise, Tera Fighting can be used to make Rillaboom resistant to Dark-type moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Terrain Extender helps teammates like Hawlucha to find more opportunities to come in; however, Assault Vest can be used instead to allow Rillaboom to better check special attackers such as Primarina and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rillaboom shines on offense teams and is a staple on Grassy Terrain-based teams. Terrain Extender should usually be used on hyper offense teams and provides wonderful support to its setup sweeper partners. Assault Vest has overall better defensive utility and thus should generally be used on bulky offense teams; it is exceptional at supporting bulkier threats such as Zamazenta, helping them deal with foes like Primarina and Gholdengo. Although generally the best fits, these recommendations are not set in stone, and either item can be used on either archetype, with Assault Vest potentially providing hyper offense with a one-time check to a special threat and Terrain Extender supporting bulky offense. Hawlucha proves itself to be an exceptional partner for Rillaboom; In Grassy Terrain, it can utilize Grassy Seed to transform into a terrifying cleaner with Swords Dance and Unburden. Hatterene also functions as a remarkable Calm Mind cleaner with Grassy Seed and longevity from Grassy Terrain. Similarly, Primarina appreciates the longevity Grassy Terrain provides to turn itself into a dangerous threat with Calm Mind; moreover, it synergizes well with Rillaboom by helping it against Fire-types such as Moltres. Setup sweepers such that benefit from the Grassy Terrain include Pokemon weak to Earthquake from foes like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Raging Bolt. Rillaboom is vulnerable to Fire-types like Moltres, Cinderace, and Iron Moth so teammates such as Heatran and Great Tusk are appreciated. Rillaboom also likes entry hazards to chip its foes; thus, the aforementioned Heatran and Glimmora make perfect partners. Rillaboom is forced out by threats like Dragonite, Skarmory, and Corviknight because it's unable to significantly damage them, so partners such as Dragapult and the previously mentioned Raging Bolt should be acknowledged. Dragon-types like Dragapult and Raging Bolt can also give Rillaboom a hard time due to them being resistant to its Grassy Glide, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit make great partners. As a Terrain setter, Rillaboom and its teammates can face difficulty in facing Ice Spinner users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; as such, it is important to position setup sweepers as soon as possible while also packing checks such as the aforementioned Hatterene for Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Iron Treads. Hatterene is also very useful at keeping entry hazards off the field, which is appreciated by Rillaboom and its teammates. Additional hazard removers such as the previously mentioned Great Tusk also make great partners. Zamazenta is also a wonderful partner that proves itself to be a threatening IronPress user with Grassy Terrain solving its problem with longevity. Comfey can also take advantage of Grassy Seed's Defense boost and Grassy Terrain's passive recovery to set up with Calm Mind and dismantle unprepared teams. Serperior is also an excellent teammate and greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain boosting its Leaf Storm, notably allowing it to KO offensive Gholdengo over two turns.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>In a metagame dominated by entry hazards, Cinderace thrives as a pivot thanks to its unique utility options in Court Change and Will-O-Wisp, and Libero granting it a plethora of high-power STAB options such as Gunk Shot and Pyro Ball. Its excellent base 119 Speed allows it to outpace opposing offensive threats like Ogerpon-W, Iron Crown, and Great Tusk. U-turn both brings in teammates and chips down foes that come in on Cinderace, like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Raging Bolt, while dealing super effective damage to the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu. Court Change allows Cinderace to remove hazards, even against Gholdengo, as well as steal opposing Aurora Veil. Will-O-Wisp is used to weaken and burn opposing threats such as the aforementioned Great Tusk as well as Pokemon like Kingambit, Dragonite, and Zamazenta. Libero-boosted Sucker Punch can be opted to give Cinderace a useful priority option, allowing it to pick off offensive threats such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo after chip damage. Libero-boosted Gunk Shot gives Cinderace a powerful coverage tool, able to OHKO the likes of Enamorus and Primarina, as well as Hatterene after Spikes while also slamming other foes wanting to come in on Cinderace such as Raging Bolt. Low Kick is an additional option that might be worth considering to 2HKO Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, Garganacl, and Kyurem, as well as OHKO Kingambit, which Pyro Ball does not offer. While Cinderace often doesn't have to use Terastallization thanks to its good natural typing and Libero letting it change its own typing naturally, Tera Fire is able to give Pyro Ball a massive power boost, letting it 2HKO even the likes of Zamazenta without its Dauntless Shield and specially defensive Gliscor, whereas Tera Flying lets it turn the tables on Ground- and Fighting-types, letting it get a Will-O-Wisp off on Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta, or safely use Court Change on them. Blaze is often used in conjunction with Cinderace sets that opt for Will-O-Wisp, being able to force itself into Blaze range and fire off a boosted Pyro Ball, while Libero is typically chosen when wanting to utilise Cinderace's strong coverage options. 224 HP with 32 Attack EVs allows Cinderace to OHKO Tinkaton, Weavile, and uninvested Gholdengo, with a chance to also OHKO Rillaboom, while giving it the ability to live +2 Shadow Ball from Iron Valiant, Ting-Lu's Earthquake, and two of Bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo's unboosted Shadow Balls. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs can be run to maximize Cinderace's offensive potential, letting it ensure a 2HKO on uninvested Kyurem and Galarian Slowking, as well as an OHKO on Iron Crown with Pyro Ball and Kingambit after Spikes damage.</p> <p>Cinderace fits excellently on bulky offense and balance teams that love the support it can offer while maintaining an offensive presence and keeping momentum. Other defensive pivots capable of generating momentum such as Galarian Slowking, Corviknight, and Landorus-T work excellently with it. Galarian Slowking is able to check Primarina and Raging Bolt, and Corviknight can handle Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. Landorus-T is able to deal with a large amount of physical threats thanks to the combination of Intimidate and Rocky Helmet, as well as offensively break through the likes of Raging Bolt and Iron Moth, which would otherwise feel safe coming in on Cinderace while setting up Stealth Rock and creating a solid pivoting core. In return, Cinderace is able to threaten Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown, and it can swap the entry hazards on each side of the field, which can help further check Zamazenta and Choice Specs Kyurem. Offensive teammates that appreciate hazard removal, the chance to set their own hazards, as well as safe entry through Cinderace's U-turn, such as Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and non-Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem, synergise well with it, being given the chance to come in on the likes of Alomomola, Primarina, Landorus-T, and Moltres and force them out. Other wallbreakers that appreciate the Water- and Dragon-types Cinderace lures in, such as Rillaboom, Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Primarina, are great partners, with Cinderace being able to handle the Grass- and Steel-types that they may otherwise struggle with. Great Tusk works amazingly with Cinderace's Court Change, being able to trade hazards and later remove the ones remaining on its side of the field with Rapid Spin, on top of providing Knock Off support and helping check the aforementioned Garganacl, Gliscor, and Galarian Slowking. Ting-Lu is another great partner, providing even greater hazard support thanks to its access to Spikes while being able to check Raging Bolt and Iron Moth, two of Cinderace's biggest checks. Dragapult is an amazing offensive partner for Cinderace, benefitting from the status it spreads with Will-O-Wisp to maximize Hex damage while forming a powerful pivoting core.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Corviknight is a solid defensive and utility Pokemon in the OU metagame. Its great typing, access to Roost, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to stave off a number of key threats such as Meowscarada, Kingambit, and Landorus-T while granting its teammates safe switch-ins with its slow U-turn. Brave Bird lets Corviknight deal high damage to Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Rillaboom and make progress against Ghost-type Pokemon like Dragapult, but Body Press makes use of Corviknight's high Defense to deal with Pokemon such as Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott more easily. Defog allows Corviknight to clear entry hazards against non-Gholdengo teams; it makes for a solid Defogger due to its positive matchup against hazard setters like Landorus-T and Glimmora. Moreover, thanks to Pressure, Corviknight can PP stall certain entry hazard setters such as Gliscor and Clefable, with it effectively having higher Defog PP than Stealth Rock or Spikes and making it effective at removing entry hazards against bulkier teams. U-turn allows Corviknight to pivot out of stalemates and bad matchups. It is particularly useful against Gliscor and Gholdengo, as Gliscor will be unable to cripple Corviknight's partner with Knock Off or Toxic, while Gholdengo will be unable to exploit Corviknight and its Air Balloon will be popped, allowing Corviknight's teammates such as Great Tusk to more easily make progress against it. However, either utility moves can be dropped for Iron Defense, which powers up Body Press and allows Corviknight to more reliably check Pokemon such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Iron Defense Zamazenta lacking Roar. Leftovers allows Corviknight to continuously stay healthy and recover from potential Stealth Rock chip damage, which will wear it down over time. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Corviknight punish key physical attackers such as Meowscarada, Weavile, Kingambit, and Zamazenta. 120 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and either set up Iron Defense or attack it with Body Press. However, Corviknight loses a considerable amount of bulk and its slow U-turn, which can be detrimental when pivoting to one of its teammates. Corviknight is a poor Terastallization candidate due to it losing its near-complete immunity to entry hazards. Nonetheless, it can use Tera to secure an endgame sweep with Iron Defense and Body Press or emergency check certain threats. Tera Dragon allows it to check foes like Cinderace and Ogerpon-W while retaining its Grass resistance against foes like Rillaboom. Tera Water similarly improves Corviknight's matchup against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Heatran with the added benefit of being sturdier against Weavile. Tera Fighting lets Corviknight check Kingambit better and powers up its Body Press. Tera Grass or Tera Dragon can also be used to improve Corviknight's matchup against Ogerpon-W.</p> <p>Corviknight best fits on balance and stall teams looking for a defensive pivot and Knock Off absorber. Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Weavile all pair well with Corviknight, as it can safely bring them in with its slow U-turn. All of the aforementioned partners are notably able to make progress against Gliscor, which Corviknight itself has trouble doing. Meowscarada and Weavile in particular are great partners, as they can also remove Rocky Helmet from opposing Corviknight, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, which can otherwise wear down Corviknight as it goes for one of its attacking moves. Special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott. In turn, they can handle the many special attackers that can threaten Corviknight such as Gholdengo and Walking Wake. Corviknight can struggle with being worn down over time by Stealth Rock chip damage, losing its Leftovers to Knock Off, and Taunt preventing it from using Roost. Corviknight also struggles to make progress against certain threats that can switch in on it freely, such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Gholdengo is a particularly annoying matchup for Corviknight, as it also prevents it from using Defog due to Good as Gold. Alomomola can keep Corviknight healthy with Wish and pivot into Fire-type attacks. Tera Water Garganacl and Ting-Lu are good checks to Gholdengo and Dragapult, and they appreciate Corviknight's ability to keep entry hazards off the field. Kingambit is also a good partner, as it does an adequate job at checking Gholdengo and Dragapult while also punishing opposing Tera Ghost Kingambit, which could otherwise set up on Corviknight. Heatran is another difficult matchup for Corviknight, as it can safely set up Stealth Rock against Corviknight while threatening it with Magma Storm. Partners that can deal with Heatran, such as Gliscor or the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Alomomola, are thus recommended.</p>"

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging high Attack and Swift Swim to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame—and most of the boosted metagame—Barraskewda is one of OU's most terrifying wallbreakers under rain. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to quickly switch out against threatening Pokemon like Dragapult and bring in teammates that can better handle them or get valuable chip damage on foes it can't OHKO, while Aqua Jet gives it the opportunity to act as a revenge killer even without rain to boost its Speed or potentially beat Kingambit with faster priority. Close Combat threatens to OHKO a number of Water-resistant foes, like Kyurem and Hisuian Samurott, and hits Ogerpon-W decently hard. Poison Jab is a decent coverage option to hit other Water-resistant targets like Primarina, Hydrapple, and Ogerpon-W super effectively. Tera Water is often used to further augment Barraskewda's already strong offensive presence, it and rain letting Choice Band Barraskewda OHKO foes like Hatterene and Dragapult with Liquidation and Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and offensive Gholdengo with Flip Turn. However, a defensive Tera Type in Ghost is also an option; it prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from Dragonite, which can be a tough matchup for rain teams. While Choice Band's immediate power is preferred, Mystic Water is an alternative item that boosts its most spammable attacks without being Choice-locked, which is crucial to prevent foes like Ogerpon-W from taking advantage of Barraskewda.</p> <p>Because Barraskewda should only be used on rain teams, it must be paired with Pelipper, where it takes advantage of both the rain Pelipper sets and Pelipper's ability to safely pivot it in with U-turn. Due to its below-average defensive stats, Barraskewda is susceptible to being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, so defensive teammates like Iron Treads are needed to switch into these Pokemon. Barraskewda also struggles against bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Ogerpon-W, and Tera Water Garganacl, as well as being completely walled by Water Absorb Clodsire; it partners well with Raging Bolt, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W, which can remove them, though Barraskewda does beat Clodsire if it's running an Unaware set. Barraskewda appreciates entry hazard removal and setting from Iron Treads, the former allowing it to not get worn down through repeated pivots, as it lacks recovery, as well as helping keep Pelipper healthy for sustained rain setting, and the latter allowing it to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight and Skarmory with Tera Water Liquidation in rain after Stealth Rock damage. Kingambit pairs well with Barraskewda, since it can easily revenge kill Pokemon that Barraskewda has already significantly weakened.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With entry hazard control provided by Magic Bounce, solid defensive stats that combine with powerful offenses to grant it great matchups against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, and the potential for it to set up and snowball out of control with Calm Mind while keeping itself healthy with Draining Kiss, Hatterene makes a great addition to offensive teams looking for a special sweeper and hazard control in one. Psychic Noise is a strong option to punish walls like Gliscor, Garganacl, and Clefable looking to recover in the face of Hatterene. Pyshock targets specially defensive walls on their weaker side, allowing for it to break through Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire while dealing with opposing setup sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Alternatively, Stored Power lacks the immediate power of Psyshock but can scale heavily with multiple Calm Minds to allow Hatterene to muscle past even Unaware targets like Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Dondozo, along with also helping to win the one-on-one against other special setup sweepers in a similar manner to Psyshock. Unfortunately, its STAB combination leaves Hatterene walled by common Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Iron Treads, while the low base power of Draining Kiss allows for Kingambit to easily stomach a boosted hit. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option that targets Steel-types, in particular helping to weaken Gholdengo's attacks, although this leaves Hatterene unable to hit Heatran; Nuzzle can alternatively be used to spread paralysis onto common switch-ins like Kingambit, Gholdengo, Heatran, and Skeledirge. While Magic Bounce's primary utility comes from its ability to deny entry hazards, it also blocks disruptive moves like Encore from Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W and Taunt from Landorus-T and Heatran, along with status moves like Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire; this makes it far more potent as a setup sweeper. Leftovers is Hatterene's best option to greatly improve its staying power along with allowing it to switch in multiple times over the course of a game to block hazards; on Grassy Terrain teams and particularly with Stored Power, Grassy Seed can be considered to give Hatterene a better chance at immediately sweeping at the expense of being worse at coming in repeatedly, though Leftovers is still a viable option on these builds. The given spread runs enough Speed EVs to outspeed Toxapex, allowing for Hatterene to use a boosted attack before Toxapex can remove its boosts with Haze, with the remaining EVs invested to maximize physical defense. This allows for Hatterene to dodge the 2HKO from Cinderace's Pyro Ball. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be considered on Nuzzle variants of Hatterene, as the Speed is less necessary when it is able to paralyze foes and so more physical bulk can be invested; however, this notably makes Hatterene slower than offensive Kingambit even after paralysis. Tera Water is a great neutral defensive typing that grants Hatterene a resistance to Steel-type attacks from Kingambit and Gholdengo, along with allowing it to stay in on Water- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that now struggle to eliminate it like Dondozo and Iron Moth. Tera Fire also gives Hatterene a better matchup into Kingambit and Gholdengo while also giving it resistances to attacks from Rillaboom and powering up its coverage option on Mystical Fire sets. However, this comes at the expense of a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Gliscor, along with making Hatterene much easier to revenge kill with strong Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Calm Mind Hatterene is a great pick on offense teams that appreciate the support against entry hazards, particularly for bulkier offense builds without a dedicated hazard setting lead. One particular form of bulky offense that Hatterene thrives on is Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom, with the additional passive recovery from the Terrain being much appreciated to help boost Hatterene's longevity further. In return, Hatterene can keep hazards clear from the field, allowing for teammates like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom itself to opt not to run Heavy-Duty Boots without fearing hazard damage racking up over time. Hatterene fits on far more than Terrain offense though, finding a home on even hyper offense teams alongside hazard setters like Glimmora, and some of its best partners on both bulky offense and hyper offense are offensive hazard-weak Pokemon that would sooner run a boosting item than Heavy-Duty Boots; prime examples of this are Raging Bolt and Ogerpon-W. Though Hatterene has ways of dealing with some of its more problematic matchups, Kingambit and Gholdengo are always an issue for their ability to shrug off its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own; bulky, offensive switch-ins to the former like Great Tusk and Zamazenta can alleviate this issue without dropping offensive pressure, while Kingambit itself can make a strong partner for its ability to come in on Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Poison-type moves from foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, the latter of which being one of Hatterene's most prevalent checks with its high Special Defense and resistance to Draining Kiss. In return for Kingambit's positive matchups against these targets, Hatterene resists Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Iron Valiant that would typically be directed towards Kingambit. One Pokemon that Hatterene struggles to break through is Heatran, as it takes negligible damage from even a boosted Draining Kiss and can negate Hatterene's Leftovers recovery with Magma Storm's passive damage; If Hatterene has Tera available and has already boosted with multiple Calm Minds as Heatran enters the field, the matchup swings in Hatterene's favour, but Hatterene is notably unable to come in directly on Heatran to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Offensive partners like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta can be used as switch-ins to Magma Storm, able to threaten the opposing Heatran out and with the latter appreciating Hatterene's ability to bait Heatran in and pop a potential Air Balloon. Although Hatterene is usually sufficient in keeping hazards off of its side of the field, on top of the aforementioned Stealth Rock Heatran matchup, opposing Hisuian Samurott are able to put hazards up with Ceaseless Edge despite losing to Hatterene itself. This makes alternative forms of hazard removal such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads good partners to Hatterene, as they can provide key relief in these matchups for hazard-weak teams that would otherwise be overly reliant on Hatterene.</p>"

      "Healing Wish": {
        "description": "<p>Through a coveted combination of Healing Wish, an elite ability in Magic Bounce, reasonably strong STAB moves, a typing that naturally checks Fighting-types, and a choice of Nuzzle to effortlessly spread paralysis or Mystical Fire to check special attackers and punish Steel-types, Hatterene can support its teammates in a way that cannot be fully replicated by anything else. Healing Wish is crucial, as it allows Hatterene to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate's HP and cure any status effects; because Hatterene is often paired with sweepers and Terrain or weather setters that enable them, this is often a perfectly acceptable trade to pivot them in safely. Psychic Noise and Dazzling Gleam boast decent coverage together and greatly threaten Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta thanks to Hatterene's high base Special Attack; Psychic Noise leaves its mark against Poison-types like Glimmora and Toxapex, while Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Dragonite, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult and Dark-types like Darkrai. Psychic Noise notably lets Hatterene significantly chip bulky foes like Gliscor, Garganacl, and Clefable, preventing them from recovering their health. Nuzzle ensures that Hatterene remains far from passive by paralyzing anything bar Ground-types and Electric-types; even Gholdengo and opposing Hatterene, which are safe from paralysis from Thunder Wave, are crippled if hit by Nuzzle. Mystical Fire, however, complements Hatterene's STAB moves well by hitting Steel-types super effectively; it also always lowers the opponent's Special Attack, giving it some added utility against threats that can boost their Special Attack like Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Eject Button complements Magic Bounce perfectly; Hatterene's mere presence on a team will deter opponents from setting entry hazards and using status moves, and with significant investment, Hatterene's bulk is sufficient enough to switch directly into a strong neutral hit, survive, and activate Eject Button to safely pivot a teammate in. Eject Button also has the added benefit of turning the tables on U-turn and Volt Switch users, getting a free switch while denying their own switch. 132 Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outpace Ting-Lu, ensuring that it can at least get some chip damage against it before being attacked in return and expanding the number of slower threats it can use Healing Wish against before being KOed. The rest of its EVs serve to maximize its physical bulk, allowing Hatterene to better pivot in against most physical attackers such as unboosted Kingambit, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel allows Hatterene to handle Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant and Enamorus more easily so it can punish them with Nuzzle and turns Hatterene's Poison weakness into an immunity, allowing it to spinblock against Mortal Spin Glimmora. Steel's powerful defensive profile also expands the number of threats Hatterene can safely use Healing Wish against in a pinch, such as Iron Head Kingambit and Galarian Slowking; though very situational, other Tera types like Dark and Flying can accomplish similar goals against different threats like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the former and Great Tusk and Heavy Slam Zamazenta for the latter.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene's ability to enable multiple free switches for its teammates makes it a strong choice for offensive teams—particularly teams vulnerable to entry hazards—that need to maximize a limited number of turns. Healing Wish Hatterene is almost mandatory on sun teams, which are often so vulnerable to hazards that its Magic Bounce serves as a strong secondary or even tertiary countermeasure against them; Fire-types such as Torkoal and Ninetales are especially weak to entry hazards, but even powerful attackers like Choice Specs Walking Wake, Black Glasses and Air Balloon Kingambit, and Life Orb Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant can be worn down very quickly with hazard chip. Many of these are also answers to traditional Hatterene checks; powerful offensive threats like Choice Specs Walking Wake and offensive Great Tusk can collectively overwhelm Hatterene checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, which gives Hatterene plenty of opportunities to switch in on a neutral attack and either pivot out with Eject Button or use Healing Wish. Sun teams also greatly appreciate Hatterene's ability to give Torkoal an extra chance to support its team with Drought through Healing Wish, further enable these aforementioned offensive threats with Healing Wish, or spread paralysis with Nuzzle. Hatterene is also useful on rain teams for similar reasons; Pelipper greatly appreciates extra opportunities to set Drizzle up through Eject Button or Healing Wish, and teammates like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt appreciate both Hatterene's ability to deny hazards to keep them healthy and the many safe switches it can enable. Hatterene is also a staple on Psychic Terrain teams, which appreciate its ability to give Indeedee an extra chance to set up Psychic Terrain or to safely pivot in sweepers like Shell Smash Polteageist, offensive Deoxys-S, and Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Crown while wasting as few precious Psychic Terrain turns as possible.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its solid bulk, good offensive presence and an amazing ability in Magic Bounce, Assault Vest Hatterene makes for a valuable addition to offense teams, preventing entry hazards from going up while simultaneously checking dangerous offensive threats such as Raging Bolt, Iron Valiant and Kyurem. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic thanks to it being able to OHKO Iron Moth, doing significantly more damage to the common Galarian Slowking, forcing Blissey out, and dealing more damage to Calm Mind sweepers that might attempt to set up on Hatterene, such as Primarina and Sinistcha. Draining Kiss provides immense utility for Hatterene, giving it valuable recovery and allowing it to be able to trade hits with and potentially beat threats such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Dragonite one-on-one. Mystical Fire allows Hatterene to punish Steel-types that may attempt to switch into it, such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit, notably 2HKOing all of them, while the guaranteed Special Attack drops can help it deal with strong special attackers like opposing Hatterene that it may otherwise struggle with. Nuzzle allows Hatterene to bring massive utility to its team by being able to consistently paralyze foes, notably also affecting opposing Hatterene and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Future Sight allows for a better matchup against defensive teams, putting pressure on bulky targets that might not be able to effectively tank a Future Sight in combination with attacks from Hatterene's teammates. Another option is Psychic Noise, as it is consistently strong with the added benefit of cutting recovery from the targets, potentially preventing foes such as Garganacl and Dondozo from walling Hatterene. The given EV spread maximizes Hatterene's offensive prowess while also allowing it to check threats such as Iron Moth in a pinch, with Hatterene being able to take one +1 Sludge Wave and OHKO it back as well as survive two Protosynthesis-boosted Raging Bolt Thunderbolts and two Ice Beams from Choice Specs Kyurem; the Speed EVs make it so Hatterene outspeeds Adamant Kingambit after paralyzing it with Nuzzle, thus sets without Nuzzle can forgo the Speed EVs and dump it to Special Attack instead. Tera Water and Tera Steel are simply good defensive typings that help Hatterene check threats that might carry Steel- or Poison-type coverage; Tera Water is great for foes such as Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Cinderace, while Tera Steel brings an immunity to Toxic Spikes and helps Hatterene deal with threats such as Iron Crown, Galarian Slowking, and Glimmora better.</p> <p>Hatterene fits best on offense teams that are looking for a way to keep entry hazards off their side of the field without needing to rely on removal like Rapid Spin or Defog, and it can provide the team with a way of paralyzing threats or pressuring foes with Future Sight. Ogerpon-W, which is unable to equip Heavy-Duty Boots, appreciates Hatterene's ability to keep hazards off the field while at the same time helping deal with threats such as Moltres and Galarian Slowking that might give Hatterene trouble. Raging Bolt also benefits from hazards being kept off and Hatterene's ability to handle Ting-Lu and Kyurem in a pinch. Zamazenta makes for an incredible partner due to it being capable of handling Kingambit, which can otherwise beat Hatterene with ease, and appreciating hazards being kept away by Hatterene. This allows it to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots in favor of items such as Leftovers and, if running Rest, Chesto Berry, all while providing much-needed speed control due to Hatterene being very slow. Great Tusk benefits from Hatterene being capable of handling threats such as Kyurem and Iron Valiant while itself providing the team with an extra safety measure against hazards thanks to its access to Rapid Spin. This may help massively against teams with Hisuian Samurott, Iron Treads, and Mold Breaker Tinkaton as their hazard setters, as Great Tusk is simultaneously capable of checking them and other threats such as Kingambit. Alternatively, Cinderace is a good option for hazard control, being noticeably faster than Great Tusk, threatening foes like Gholdengo, Tinkaton, and Iron Crown with Pyro Ball, and returning hazards that might have slipped through Hatterene's Magic Bounce with Court Change. Kingambit is also a great partner, being able to deal with Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking for Hatterene and help check opposing Kingambit if running Low Kick. In addition, Kingambit massively appreciates Hatterene's Nuzzle potentially paralyzing threats Kingambit struggles against such as Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W while Hatterene itself can check foes like Zamazenta. Dragon Dance Kyurem is another excellent teammate, as it often has to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots in order to run other items and thus is very weak to hazards which can be kept away by Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Dragapult is worth considering as well thanks to its very high Speed, allowing it to provide speed control, and ability to pressure Gholdengo. Furthermore, Dragapult can cripple threatening physical attackers like Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Heavy Slam Zamazenta, which can muscle through Hatterene if not careful, with Will-O-Wisp while also being able to bring Hatterene into the field with U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Trick Room Hatterene's primary goal is to set up Trick Room to enable its slow, powerful teammates while keeping them healthy and pivoting via Healing Wish. Its main attribute is access to Magic Bounce, which is useful against entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu as well as ways to stop Trick Room like Taunt from Landorus-T and Ogerpon-W. Psychic Noise is preferred thanks to being able to heal block defensive walls like Gliscor and Clefable. Both Tera Water and Tera Steel share the benefit of saving Hatterene from Steel-type moves like Kingambit's Iron Head, Gholdengo's Make it Rain, and most importantly Iron Crown's Tachyon Cutter, which can bypass its Focus Sash. Tera Water has the added benefit of maintaining its neutrality against strong attacks like Great Tusk's Headlong Rush and Landorus-T's Earthquakewhile resisting Cinderace's Pyro Ball. Tera Steel, on the other hand, can save Hatterene against Pokemon like Iron Moth and Galarian Slowking if Focus Sash is no longer intact, as well as the common lead Glimmora. Focus Sash ensures that Hatterene always lives a hit, allowing it to set Trick Room reliably.</p> <p>This Hatterene set is an essential member of Trick Room teams, since it compresses hazard denial while also extending the life of its members with Healing Wish. There's no greater partner for Hatterene than Ursaluna, which uses its slow speed and Guts boosted attacks to decimate the opposition including would-be offensive checks like Zamazenta as well as foes like Ting-Lu and Iron Crown that Hatterene has a harder time against. Ursaluna's decaying health from Flame Orb also benefits greatly from a second life via Healing Wish. Cresselia is a secondary Trick Room setter and can also support the team with Lunar Dance. Trick Room teams struggle with priority, as it bypasses Hatterene's Trick Room. Trick Room teams can use the aforementioned Ursaluna and Iron Hands to tank common priority moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed or Kingambit's Sucker Punch; as a bonus, Ursaluna is immune to Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, while Iron Hands is resistant to it. Enamorus-T is scared of Thunderclap, but it can still take on Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch with no trouble. Offensive teams can make use of Landorus-T, which punishes contact moves with Rocky Helmet while also having the ability to set up hazards and bring Hatterene and its allies in with U-turn. The biggest annoyance for Hatterene is not a Pokemon, but a move, Protect, because it can stall out the limited Trick Room turns, making its efforts useless. Gliscor, Alomomola, and Kyurem are all common users of the move, and the three of them take advantage of healing abilities, items, and moves to run out Trick Room's timer. Steel-types like Iron Crown, Kingambit, and Gholdengo also completely wall Hatterene and OHKO it with STAB moves. On full Trick Room teams, the slow, deadly Iron Hands can threaten Alomomola, Kyurem, and Kingambit, while Gliscor has to be very careful around Ice Punch. Enamorus-T is also a great choice, since it's a massive wallbreaker that can break Steel-types with Earth Power while threatening Gliscor, Alomomola, and Kyurem with powerful Fairy-type STAB moves. Kingambit is grateful for having Hatterene's support, since Healing Wish can let Kingambit purify burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Dragapult and Cinderace and fully concentrate on breaking. Sucker Punch also means Kingambit can be threatening in and out of Trick Room. This set is not exclusive to full Trick Room teams though, as hyper offense teams often find use of having Hatterene alongside another Trick Room partner to mess with other hyper offense teams trying to outpace each other. Great Tusk can threaten Gliscor while forming a hazard removal duo, easing the stress of Hatterene in denying hazards. This is especially important against Hisuian Samurott, which has the unique distinction of having Ceaseless Edge, putting Spikes without caring for Magic Bounce and potentially messing with its Focus Sash and setting up of Trick Room. Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant are good partners for Hatterene on hyper offense; Ogerpon-W likes Healing Wish, since its mandatory mask means it's vulnerable to hazards and status, while threatening Alomomola and Gliscor with STAB moves and Kyurem with Play Rough, while Iron Valiant is another great option due to its access to Encore, locking these Pokemon into Protect, allowing it to grab a turn to set up, and it is also quadruple resistant to Dark-types meaning it can potentially get in and punish Hisuian Samurott for using Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

      "Boots Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong and reliable STAB option that notably pressures special walls like Blissey and Clodsire while denting Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Dragonite with Multiscale intact. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave cripples burn-immune targets like Clefable and Cinderace and slows down special attackers like Darkrai, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus. The Attack EVs allow Dragapult to 2HKO Hisuian Samurott with Dragon Darts from full health.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult is a fantastic pick on balance teams, synergizing well with durable hazard setters such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu that can assist in chipping down the switch-ins that it forces. In return, Dragapult helps to patch up bulkier teams' lack of speed control while not minding the hazards that they often allow on both sides of the field. Knock Off users such as Weavile and Meowscarada are solid pairings with Dragapult on these balance structures, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon to make the switches that Dragapult forces more meaningful while giving Dragapult opportunities to come in for free on their own checks, allowing these teams to better pressure opposing Skarmory and Corviknight. Bulkier offense teams also benefit from the presence of Dragapult as a form of speed control that wears down defensive cores with both damage and status effects; Kingambit in particular is a terrifying late-game sweeper that appreciates Dragapult's ability to weaken a team for it to clean through, with Will-O-Wisp Dragapult able to neuter its physical checks like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Skarmory, while Thunder Wave variants can slow down threats that would otherwise outspeed Kingambit such as Cinderace and Heatran. In turn, Dragapult often invites in opposing Kingambit, which resists its STAB options and is only threatened by its status moves, so solid switch-ins for this like Skarmory and Great Tusk are usually appreciated to prevent it from getting too many free turns. Raging Bolt in particular is a strong partner to pivot Dragapult on bulky offense teams that enjoy its support to help break through Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult also struggles to muscle past bulkier checks like Toxapex and Clefable alone, so partners that can take advantage of them for setup opportunities such as Kingambit and Gholdengo are great picks. As Dragapult's Speed tier is almost unmatched in the OU metagame, Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder along with the even faster Deoxys-S are frequently forced in to revenge kill it, so more defensive teammates that can handle these threats are valued; Galarian Slowking is a good bulky pivot that takes on Iron Valiant and can use Chilly Reception to bring in Dragapult for free after taking a hit, while Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory are solid Iron Boulder checks that can either beat it or force it to switch out and lose its Speed boost, allowing Dragapult to outspeed it later. Corviknight doubles as an answer to Deoxys-S, able to take on any of its attacks and safely pivot out with U-turn.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult is an amazing source of immediate power due to its near unresisted STAB combination, solid Special Attack, and excellent Speed tier, which outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame. Equipping Choice Specs allows Dragapult to break through Pokemon such as Gliscor and Zamazenta with its STAB moves. Flamethrower threatens Kingambit and Tinkaton. U-turn allows Dragapult to keep the momentum for its team while chipping down checks like Ting-Lu. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to be a great check to dual screens teams and Substitute sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Tera Ghost powers up its most spammable STAB attack in Shadow Ball, allowing Dragapult to further dent Galarian Slowking and secure the OHKO on Iron Valiant and Skeledirge. This also improves its matchup into Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as it takes much less damage from Moonblast, allowing it to survive a hit and KO them back. Tera Dragon raises Draco Meteor to nuclear levels, OHKOing Gliscor, Dondozo, and defensive Landorus-T, and it also improves Dragapult's matchup into Darkrai and Gholdengo, as it removes it weakness to Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball, respectively. A Modest nature can be run instead of Timid to forego outspeeding Zamazenta, Weavile, and Darkrai for higher damage output, such as OHKOing Gliscor and Serperior with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Dragapult fits well on offensive teams due to its excellent ability to break down walls such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Therefore, Dragapult is able to benefit sweepers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt that appreciate walls being worn down. Dark- and Fairy-types like Kingambit and Clefable are threats to Dragapult, as they are able to switch in and force it out. Therefore, checks to these such as Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta make for good partners. The latter two help with Kingambit, which is Dragapult's biggest check due to resisting both of its STAB moves. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards on the opposing side of the field. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Gliscor are good partners for it. Knock Off support from the likes of Weavile, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada are able to be brought in by Dragapult's U-turn, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive switch-ins to force progress. Ogerpon-W in particular is a great partner, since it’s able to bring Dragapult in with its own U-turn, allowing Dragapult to better pressure its checks. Dragapult is not very good at switching into attacks, as it is relatively frail, so slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola are amazing teammates. Entry hazards wear down Dragapult over time, limiting the number of times it can switch onto the field; therefore, hazard control from Great Tusk and Cinderace can help Dragapult. Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Pokemon with a Speed Boost such as Iron Valiant are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Dragapult, so speed control like Dragonite, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit make for good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult acts as a great offensive pivot for bulky offense and balance teams that rely on maintaining momentum and immediate power for their progress making. Its amazing Speed tier, the second fastest relevant Pokemon behind only Deoxys-S, makes it one of the best users of Choice Band, hitting foes for great neutral damage thanks to its hard-to-resist STAB moves. Tera Blast Ghost lets it make use of a reliable and powerful physical Ghost-type move, 2HKOing otherwise problematic Steel- and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Corviknight after Stealth Rock Damage, and to create win-win scenarios thanks to the pivoting effect of its strong U-turn forcing progress even against bulkier cores and punishing Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu with heavy chip damage, especially if Spikes are up. Tera Dragon over Tera Ghost with Phantom Force over Tera Blast is a notable option to rely less on Terastallization in exchange for a worse Ghost-type move, OHKOing the likes of Galarian Slowking, Darkrai, Hisuian Samurott, and Glimmora through its Focus Sash and 2HKOing neutral targets like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Alomomola with little prior chip damage with Tera Dragon Dragon Darts while also shedding its Dark weakness. Phantom Force gives it a solid STAB move without relying too much on Terastallization, while Sucker Punch lets it revenge kill offensive threats like Deoxys-S and opposing Dragapult while being handy to pick off weakened boosted foes like Kyurem and Dragonite. Clear Body is preferred, as it allows Dragapult to ignore Landorus-T's Intimidate and Sticky Web, though Infiltrator is still a valid alternative to ignore dual screens and threaten Substitute Iron Moth, Primarina, and Enamorus.</p> <p>Dragapult has great synergy with bulky VoltTurn cores, which allow Dragapult to easily get on and off the field and repeatedly scare out offensive threats such as Iron Moth, Iron Crown, Gholdengo, and Darkrai. Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott are pivots that pair well with Dragapult, with the former switching well into Kingambit, Cinderace, and Zamazenta trying to revenge kill Dragapult while denying hazards from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Glimmora, Garganacl, and opposing Landorus-T with Taunt, and the latter's Knock Off variants removing Heavy-Duty Boots off of physical walls Dragapult might struggle with like Alomomola and Dondozo. They, alongside the likes of Garganacl, Clefable, and Gliscor, also provide entry hazards, putting foes like Ogerpon, Darkrai, opposing Hisuian Samurott, and Iron Valiant in range of an OHKO and Skarmory, Corviknight, offensive Great Tusk, and Alomomola in range of a 2HKO; Garganacl in particular is noteworthy for its ability to deal effectively with opposing Dragapult, as well as absorbing status that would otherwise severely limit Dragapult's effectiveness like burn from Alomomola, paralysis from Clefable, and Toxic from Gliscor. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Great Tusk, which also deals with Kingambit, or Magic Bounce support from Hatterene, which has a great matchup into Ting-Lu and Zamazenta variants lacking Heavy Slam and can absorb status, also benefits Dragapult. Corviknight is another good pivot, providing a Kingambit check for bulkier structures and reliably removing hazards against teams without Gholdengo with Defog. Finally, Future Sight from Iron Crown, Galarian Slowking, or the previously mentioned Hatterene helps overwhelm defensive cores that rely on different Pokemon to take on physical and special attacks like Galarian Slowking + Alomomola or Corviknight, Blissey + Dondozo, and Iron Crown + Landorus-T. Iron Crown brings to the table fast pivoting and a strong offensive profile to better deal with Clefable while not letting Kingambit or Heatran switch in for free. In contrast, Galarian Slowking has slow pivoting and great longevity thanks to Regenerator. Similarly, offensive overlap with threats like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Hisuian Samurott can be very effective at muscling past shared checks like Skarmory, Clefable, Zamazenta, Dondozo, and Alomomola with repeated pressure.</p>"

  "Zamazenta": {
    "sets": {
      "IronPress": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Defense Zamazenta is a fast sweeper for offense that also happens to blanket check most of the physical metagame with great matchups into key threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Weavile. It acts as a strong form of role compression that can make use of its great bulk, a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, and its high Speed stat to find opportunities to use Iron Defense to not only bolster its survivability but also strengthen the power of its Body Press. Crunch is a necessity to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that aren't threatened by Body Press, while its last moveslot is more flexible; Roar can be used to force out Pokemon that aim to beat it with Defense-boosting moves like Skarmory, Corviknight, and opposing Zamazenta as well as also turning Zamazenta into a panic check able to force out setup sweepers and Booster Energy users like Tera Ghost Kingambit and Great Tusk. Rest alongside Chesto Berry gives it much needed longevity and preventing it from being permanently shut down by status from foes like Moltres and Dragapult. Stone Edge gives Zamazenta a non-contact option to hit Zapdos and Moltres while still giving it coverage to hit Enamorus. Heavy Slam gives Zamazenta super effective coverage into Fairy-types that otherwise would wall it such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, while Substitute is an alternative that allows Zamazenta to dodge status moves from the likes of Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex along with helping to block revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. 168 EVs in Speed allow Zamazenta to outrun Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance while also outrunning key threats like Weavile and Darkrai. Zamazenta can then choose to invest EVs into HP for better overall bulk or into Attack for stronger coverage moves; notably, maximum HP investment ensures that Zamazenta will survive Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast from full while also avoiding a 2HKO from Clefable. Choosing to maximize Attack gives Zamazenta a clean 2HKO on offensive Gholdengo with Crunch and on both Clefable and Hatterene with Heavy Slam. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to improve Zamazenta's bulk and give it a stronger Body Press. Tera Fire serves to grant Zamazenta a key Fairy resistance without making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Iron Valiant, but the primary draw of this Tera type is an immunity to burn, a particularly important quality against Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Moltres, with the former and the latter able to burn even Substitute variants of Zamazenta with Infiltrator and Flame Body. Tera Dark boosts the power of Crunch to let it overwhelm Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Pecharunt more easily; additionally, it grants a Psychic immunity from foes like Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking. Tera Steel defensively flips the matchup into Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from foes like Enamorus, Hatterene, Galarian Slowking, Deoxys-S, and Tera Blast Flying Dragonite while also powering up Heavy Slam to OHKO both Enamorus and Iron Valiant even without Attack investment. Tera Steel also gives Zamazenta a crucial immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Toxapex. Tera Fairy is another solid defensive typing for Zamazenta, granting it a great defensive profile that includes a resistance to Fighting-type attacks that helps out immensely in the Iron Defense mirror matchup against both Zamazenta and Skarmory, as well as an immunity to Dragapult's Draco Meteor and a retained resistance to Dark-type attacks that allows you to still check Weavile and Hisuian Samurott; Tera Ghost is an option that leans even heavier into beating opposing Iron Defense users at the expense of granting little defensive value.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit on both bulky offense and hyper offense teams that need a fast offensive piece with good matchups into the tier's physical threats, in particular providing a crucial Kingambit check to a team. However, to be able to fully leverage its defensive value, it appreciates entry hazard removal to allow it to switch in without taking chip damage on entry and potentially being neutered entirely by Toxic Spikes. Hatterene is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it not only blocks entry hazards but can also be used to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, and Great Tusk can clear hazards from the field along with helping to wear down Gliscor and force in and chip down Gholdengo attempting to block Rapid Spin. Rillaboom also serves as a great pairing that helps to bolster Zamazenta's longevity, with the additional healing from Grassy Terrain making Zamazenta much more difficult to remove from the field. Zamazenta's ability to check the tier's offensive Dark-types is also a valuable quality for hyper offense teams that opt to run a hazard lead like Glimmora or Deoxys-S, as these builds often use Gholdengo to block hazard removal; this will often give threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott free attacks that necessitate an offensive switch-in that Zamazenta provides. Zamazenta is then able to take advantage of these Pokemon by using them as setup fodder. Gholdengo itself is a strong partner to Zamazenta, able to switch into Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also taking advantage of Zamazenta's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking and Clefable being unable to touch it. Zamazenta's relatively low wallbreaking power unfortunately leaves it struggling to muscle through Unaware walls like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, while its inability to boost the strength of its coverage moves makes bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Body Press like defensive Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking hard to break through; Zamazenta matches up best into opposing offense teams, and so balance breakers and stallbreakers are appreciated to support it in its other matchups. Kingambit is another excellent teammate for Zamazenta, loading well into bulkier teams and heavily pressuring Dondozo while also being able to switch into Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hatterene that may come in to force Zamazenta out. A great partner to Zamazenta on hyper offensive teams is Booster Energy Iron Valiant, able to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge for Zamazenta to later break through. Iron Valiant also provides hyper offensive teams with a temporary form of speed control that can outrun Dragapult and Deoxys-S, both of which outspeed and can threaten Zamazenta with strong special attacks, or, in Dragapult's case, debilitating status with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With an outstanding Speed tier, fantastic natural bulk and the raw power to match, all-out attacking Zamazenta is one of the tier's best natural forms of speed control and a great one-time check to some of the tier's most dominant physical threats like Kingambit and Ogerpon-W, especially with Dauntless Shield. A powerful Close Combat is backed up by Crunch to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge lets Zamazenta importantly deal massive damage to Moltres and Zapdos while ignoring their Flame Body and Static, along with securing a 2HKO on specially defensive Skeledirge. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types like Hatterene, Clefable, and Iron Valiant, while Ice Fang is its strongest move against Gliscor and Landorus-T, coming with the additional benefit of comfortably 2HKOing Dragonite. Roar allows Zamazenta to phaze setup sweepers like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Terastallized Kingambit looking to use it as setup fodder and works well with the entry hazards that the balance teams it fits love to set. Psychic Fangs is a niche option that allows for Zamazenta to hit both Clodsire and Toxapex while improving its matchup against dual screens hyper offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots allows for Zamazenta to switch in safely regardless of entry hazards and fully leverage its bulk, allowing for it to come in multiple times over the course of a game. Choice Band can instead be used to greatly enhance its wallbreaking power, granting it key 2HKOs on Skarmory, Corviknight, and offensive Great Tusk, but this comes at the expense of Zamazenta losing out on longevity and the ability to hit subsequent switch-ins with its coverage options. An alternative spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe, again with a Jolly nature, allows for Zamazenta to still outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite, Weavile, and Darkrai while improving its bulk. This HP investment notably allows for Zamazenta to live Enamorus's Moonblast, but the lack of Speed is detrimental for the matchup against opposing Zamazenta. Tera Dark boosts the power of Crunch, which allows Zamazenta to overwhelm would-be checks like Gholdengo and Pecharunt more easily. The Psychic immunity is also handy against revenge killers like Deoxys-S. Tera Steel is selected to flip Zamazenta's matchup against Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Tera Blast Flying Dragonite while also turning Heavy Slam into a powerful STAB option that cleanly OHKOes both Iron Valiant and Enamorus and providing Zamazenta with an immunity to Toxic from Galarian Slowking. Tera Stellar can instead be considered as an option that gives a one-time boost to all of its moves; this boost is strong enough to allow for Zamazenta to OHKO offensive Cinderace and a slightly chipped Ogerpon-W with Close Combat, while also giving it 2HKOs on both Raging Bolt and Pelipper with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively. This also gives Zamazenta a one-time nuke to break through weakened checks like Skarmory and Corviknight. However, this comes at the expense of Tera Stellar having no defensive value. Tera Fighting is a more niche option without any defensive merit that Zamazenta can opt to run, only boosting its Close Combat but crucially letting it 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit for both balance and offense teams lacking speed control while giving these builds a check to Dark-types like Kingambit, Weavile, Meowscarada, and Darkrai. It appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of the switches it forces, pairing well with hazard setters such as Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor on balance and Landorus-T and Glimmora on offense. Zamazenta's ability to check both Weavile and Meowscarada pairs particularly well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T; Zamazenta's lack of recovery means that it struggles to switch in consistently on these Pokemon though. This makes bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola much appreciated to allow it safe entry onto the field, the former also providing a much-needed switch-in to Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking in particular forms a potent combination with Zamazenta, as Zamazenta's Close Combat dissuades Dark- and Steel-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit from switching into Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, while common switch-ins to Zamazenta such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Skarmory cannot safely come in and take both hits. Although Zamazenta's Speed tier is impressive by OU standards, it is still outsped by Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Gholdengo, which are able to threaten it with heavy damage; priority attackers that can revenge kill these faster threats are therefore much appreciated. Kingambit in particular is a strong partner that can switch into Dragapult and Gholdengo and threaten both of these targets along with Deoxys-S with Sucker Punch, while Weavile cannot freely switch into these threats but is able to provide an alternative form of speed control that can also threaten Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus with Ice Shard. With Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is also able to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta with Moonblast; Gholdengo makes for a solid check to Iron Valiant, also being able to come in on Galarian Slowking and Clefable that would live a hit and threaten Zamazenta back. In turn, Gholdengo appreciates Zamazenta's ability to threaten many of its common checks like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Rillaboom also makes for a great partner to pick off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide while weakening shared checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off to allow for Zamazenta to freely attack them without taking Rocky Helmet damage. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain is particularly useful for providing Zamazenta with recovery to help maintain its longevity; Alomomola can similarly help to alleviate this issue by providing Wish support while also appreciating Zamazenta's ability to check Ogerpon-W. Zamazenta is walled by Gliscor and Clodsire without the appropriate coverage, and so switch-ins to these Pokemon such as Gliscor itself and Clefable on balance and Hatterene on offense make valuable partners, along with powerful attackers like Weavile and Meowscarada to directly threaten them out. Zamazenta pressures some of the tier's common physical walls like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Skarmory; teammates like Kingambit and Weavile appreciate its ability to weaken these targets.</p>"

  "Ursaluna": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ursaluna's nigh-unparalleled offensive prowess makes it one of the most brutal wallbreakers in the tier. The combination of Guts and STAB Facade off of Ursaluna's gargantuan Attack stat is alarming for many bulky teams, with even the most physically bulky Pokemon such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu getting 2HKOed unboosted. Ursaluna's offensive presence is further pushed by its good offensive typing, having unresisted coverage and making the likes of Garganacl and Heatran fearful of Ursaluna. Swords Dance further bolsters this offensive profile, letting Ursaluna take better advantage of the switches it often forces. The power boost lets Ursaluna land OHKOs on common Pokemon such as Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T. Fire Punch targets Steel-types immune to Ground like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Skarmory that would otherwise check Ursaluna. Ice Punch is an option to hit Heatproof Sinistcha, an otherwise great answer to Ursaluna on bulky teams, while netting the OHKO against even physically defensive Gliscor and Landorus-T through Intimidate. Flame Orb triggers Guts and makes Ursaluna an adept status absorber thanks to its solid natural bulk and ability to threaten status spreaders like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Zapdos. Tera Normal boosts Ursaluna's Facade to ungodly levels; it can overwhelm even the most bulky of physical walls like Dondozo and can OHKO the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Gliscor after minor chip damage. Tera Ghost gives Ursaluna immunity to Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Ursaluna's natural bulk also opens it up to being versatile at taking advantage of Terastallization, as it can often afford to take neutral hits from powerful threats such as Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake after Terastallizing into types like Fairy or Grass and launch a counterattack in return. While an Adamant nature with maximum Speed investment is generally preferred for outspeeding the likes of Kingambit and Corviknight, a Brave nature, combined with maximum investment in HP and Attack, turns Ursaluna into a monstrous threat on Trick Room teams. Even outside of Trick Room teams, this variant can function as a powerful and bulky wallbreaker, taking advantage of Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Zapdos to switch in and wreak havoc.</p> <p>Ursaluna fits on many bulky offense teams as a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Glimmora and Gliscor provides chip damage to help Ursaluna further overwhelm defensive Pokemon. Landorus-T, in addition to being an entry hazard setter, is an amazing pivot thanks to Intimidate giving Ursaluna more ease coming into battle. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Weavile, and Dragapult appreciate Ursaluna knocking out defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor, Dondozo, and Clefable, respectively. In return, they can help clean late-game against faster-paced offensive teams. Ursaluna tends to struggle against common offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kyurem that can outspeed and threaten Ursaluna. Offensive Pokemon that can handle these threats, namely Gholdengo, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, make for strong teammates. These Pokemon heavily appreciate Ursaluna threatening defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Priority users such as Dragonite and Scizor appreciate Ursaluna's strong wallbreaking abilities that let them have an easier time cleaning late-game while also providing utility against faster offensive Pokemon. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Alomomola do wonders in terms of letting Ursaluna switch in on offensive Pokemon thanks to their low Speed and Chilly Reception and Flip Turn, respectively, ensuring Ursaluna enters the field with as minimal damage taken as possible. The former is a great check to Pokemon that can beat Ursaluna, while the latter can help Ursaluna's longevity with Wish. On more aggressive teams, Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support, boosting Ursaluna's already solid bulk and letting it more easily set up Swords Dance against bulkier foes. Ursaluna, with minimum Speed investment, is a hugely important aspect of Trick Room teams, often acting as the premier offensive threat on said teams. Hatterene is a natural choice for a Trick Room setter thanks to Magic Bounce letting it block Taunt, as well as entry hazards that would otherwise further compromise Ursaluna's bulk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus can be a sweeper, a form of speed control that allows it to function as an effective revenge killer, and a support Pokemon that gives a teammate a second chance at sweeping via Healing Wish. It can outspeed and revenge kill faster common threats such as Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Darkrai. Earth Power is mandatory coverage for hitting Fairy resistant foes: Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Iron Treads, Fire-types like Heatran and Skeledirge, and Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire. Mystical Fire lets Enamorus hit Steel-types immune to Earth Power, such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Alternatively, Tera Blast Stellar gives Enamorus a way to boost its Special Attack thanks to Contrary while simultaneously sniping opposing Terastallized Pokemon like Kingambit. Tera Stellar hits everything in the tier neutrally, so it's able to snowball and clean weakened teams effectively at the cost of being very Tera-reliant. Healing Wish sacrifices Enamorus in order to fully heal a chipped sweeper like Kingambit or Raging Bolt so it can continue a sweep it couldn't finish previously, and should be used when Enamorus's speed is no longer needed to win the game. Tera Ground can be used instead of Tera Stellar to power up Earth Power and to flip Enamorus's poor matchups against Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. Tera Fairy can also be used to further boost Moonblast's power, guaranteeing 2HKOs against Ting-Lu and neutral targets like specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <p>Enamorus is best used as speed control on offensive teams that appreciate it giving teammates a potential second chance to sweep. Hazard removers like Court Change Cinderace and Great Tusk are excellent teammates, since Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Enamorus can come in and revenge kill. Cinderace can give hazards to the foe if they aren't on both sides of the field, its access to U-turn helps get Enamorus in safely, and its Pyro Balls force Gholdengo off the field so Enamorus can use Moonblast more freely. Great Tusk is a great teammate, because it threatens common Enamorus switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Toxapex, and checks Kingambit, which can take a hit from Enamorus and retaliate back. Galarian Slowking is a pivot that greatly appreciates Enamorus's presence since it can deal with the Dark- and Ground-types that annoy it such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Darkrai. Enamorus appreciates Galarian Slowking's presence too, as its access to Future Sight is extremely useful for muscling through Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Galarian Slowking and for bulky neutral targets like Gliscor. Galarian Slowking's access to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to incapacitate Pokemon that may give Enamorus a hard time like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Boulder. Chilly Reception is used to bring Enamorus onto the field safely, but also has the added benefit of changing the weather, giving rain Pokemon like Barraskewda, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads a harder time. Another pivot Enamorus loves pairing with is Landorus-T, since it can bring Enamorus in safely with U-turn, threaten all the Poison- and Steel- types Enamorus struggles with, and can set Stealth Rock. Bulky physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk work well with Enamorus since they're able to deal with special walls that can prevent it from making progress, mainly Galarian Slowking, and change the tide of a battle if they're able to get a second chance at sweeping thanks to Healing Wish. Physical Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott are more Pokemon that enjoy Enamorus's presence, since it can take on one of their best checks in Zamazenta, and Healing Wish can allow them to achieve a late-game sweep in case they had to come in earlier and sustain lots of damage. They're also able to blow past common Enamorus checks such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott can help chip foes into range for Enamorus to break through their team, and Gholdengo is appreciated to block removal attempts and keep the hazards up for the duration of the game.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {},
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Enamorus is a powerful Calm Mind sweeper and wallbreaker that is powerful enough to break through many foes. Earth Power gives Enamorus the ability to damage Galarian Slowking significantly, as well as targeting Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Heatran and OHKOing offensive Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute is a great utility move, allowing Enamorus to block revenge killing attempts as well as avoid status moves, preventing Pokemon like Gliscor and Clodsire from affecting it with Toxic. Taunt is an alternative option that, as well as also blocking Toxic, can block walls like Corviknight and Clodsire from being able to recover and prevent opposing sweepers like Primarina from setting up and trying to beat it one-on-one. Leftovers provides Enamorus with a consistent recovery option, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots removes its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Ground can be used to increase the strength of Earth Power as well as flip Enamorus's weakness to Poison-type moves like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb to a resistance. It's also useful to immediately remove Enamorus's weakness to Electric, allowing it to block Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and defeat it with Moonblast. Tera Steel turns many of Enamorus's key move weaknesses into resistances, including Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, Weavile and Meowscarada's Triple Axel, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which allows it to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind and punish the aforementioned Pokemon. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Enamorus's Fairy-type STAB moves, allowing it to secure an OHKO on Zamazenta.</p> <p>Enamorus benefits from more offensive team structures where it can be used to support its teammates with its ability to boost up and sweep through teams. Enamorus's typing makes it extremely dangerous to Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types like Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Ting-Lu while also turning Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T into setup fodder. This opens up teammates such as Gholdengo, Heatran, and Cinderace to play more freely with Enamorus able to threaten out their shared checks. In return, Cinderace is able to support Enamorus by providing entry hazard control in the form of Court Change. Enamorus is not particularly bulky, so it's vulnerable to Pokemon that it can't KO easily and can KO it back in turn. One of the most prominent Pokemon that fits this description is Galarian Slowking, which can take all of Enamorus's attacks and threaten it in return with Sludge Bomb. Kingambit is a great teammate to have as a switch-in to Sludge Bomb and Future Sight that can also force out Galarian Slowking. Kingambit also checks Gholdengo, which is another Pokemon that's difficult for Enamorus to deal with, as well as helping with priority from Sucker Punch, threatening faster foes like Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder. Bulkier Pokemon such as Blissey that can handle Enamorus's attacks present a problem that Enamorus can't get around on its own; having teammates like Zamazenta and Ogerpon-W can therefore help in breaking through them. Great Tusk can also support Enamorus with Rapid Spin as a way of getting rid of Stealth Rock if Enamorus isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots. Offensive teammates like Serperior and Gholdengo appreciate Enamorus's ability to weaken checks like Clodsire; in return, Gholdengo can help deal with Galarian Slowking and Corviknight.</p>"

  "Meowscarada": {
    "sets": {
      "Boots Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Meowscarada is one of the tier's premier offensive pivots thanks to its stupendous Speed, a critical benchmark that lets it outspeed scary threats like Cinderace, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Serperior. Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-S, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Hatterene and Corviknight. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn keeps up momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off, while Tera Fire is an option that grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves.</p> <p>Meowscarada fits best on balance teams that need a way to force hazard chip along with Knock Off spam to whittle down or outright threaten Pokemon that otherwise don't mind Knock Off such as Gliscor. Meowscarada's frailty courtesy of its pitiful bulk is sometimes hard to work around and limits its switch in opportunities, especially with common weaknesses courtesy of its exploitable defensive typing and a nasty 4x weakness to U-turn. Furthermore, Meowscarada, while being quite fast, is still outsped by monsters such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Weavile, and Zamazenta, the latter of which happens to be one of Meowscarada's best checks. Weavile's offensive tenacity combined with deadly Speed makes it a potent threat, which is why Rocky Helmet Skarmory is one of Meowscarada's best partner options on balance teams, as it punishes Triple Axel spam and shrugs off Weavile's hits comparatively easily. Meowscarada's role as an offensive pivot helps chip away at opposing cores while also bringing some of their key defensive threats into OHKO range for some frail teammates like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, and Gholdengo. Dragapult is another great partner for Meowscarada; it can blank Fighting-type attacks and follow up with a fast Will-O-Wisp to neuter Zamazenta as well. Meowscarada's defensive woes can be covered by bulky teammates that don't mind taking coverage moves from faster threats. On the physical side, Great Tusk's role as a physically bulky offensive spinner with synergistic typing opens up multiple opportunities to clear hazards. On the special side, Clodsire and Galarian Slowking are both impressive partners thanks to their longevity and fantastic defensive profiles, with the former being able to blank setup sweepers like Darkrai and the latter being able to continue Meowscarada's momentum chain by using a slow Chilly Reception to take a hit or scout a switch, allowing Meowscarada to come in safely. Additionally, Galarian Slowking also threatens Pokemon that would commonly switch into Meowscarada like Iron Defense Zamazenta with Future Sight.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Item Meowscarada distinguishes itself as an amazing wallbreaker and offensive pivot of the tier thanks to its great Attack and Speed stats and fantastic coverage options alongside Protean, capable of dismantling common defensive picks such as Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Ting-Lu. Choice Scarf makes it a great revenge killer capable of outspeeding foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and +1 Roaring Moon, whereas Choice Band boosts its wallbreaking prowess to nuclear levels. U-turn allows Meowscarada to gain momentum against common switch-ins like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Corviknight. Triple Axel functions as an incredible coverage move, hitting foes like Gliscor, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Enamorus super effectively. Trick can be used in the last option to cripple checks like Skarmory, Zapdos, and Moltres and bulky setup sweepers like Hatterene, hampering their effectiveness and giving Meowscarada more flexibility with moves. Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to reach new heights of power, enabling Choice Scarf variants to secure an OHKO on bulky Calm Mind Primarina and Choice Band variants to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk. Tera Dark boosts the power of its Knock Off, notably allowing Choice Scarf Meowscarada to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Choice Band Meowscarada to OHKO offensive Cinderace. Tera Fire can be used to make Meowscarada resistant to Ice, Fairy, and Fire, helping it against foes like Darkrai, Enamorus, and Moltres while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Dragapult and Moltres's Flame Body. In addition, Choice Scarf Meowscarada no longer OHKOes Gliscor, Roaring Moon, and Rillaboom, while Choice Band variants lose the OHKO on Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Choice Item Meowscarada fits well on bulky offense structures that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove items from opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones, with Knock Off. Teammates such as Gholdengo appreciate Meowscarada pivoting against switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight, giving them opportunities to set up and clean. Other setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to revenge kill foes like Gholdengo and non-Choice Scarf Enamorus for them to set up and sweep with minimum hindrance. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Gliscor also appreciate Meowscarada using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes foes like Moltres and Zapdos take hazard damage. Special wallbreakers like Enamorus and Raging Bolt also appreciate Meowscarada threatening special walls like Primarina and Galarian Slowking. Meowscarada struggles against Steel-types like Skarmory and Kingambit. Thus, teammates that threaten them, such as Dragapult and the aforementioned Gholdengo for Skarmory, and Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit, are appreciated. Zamazenta itself is also a threat to Meowscarada, so teammates that check it such as the aforementioned Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Enamorus should be acknowledged. Galarian Slowking also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Future Sight has excellent synergy with Meowscarada and helps it deal with Zamazenta as well as other Fighting-types like Iron Valiant by making Meowscarada's moves, especially Knock Off, harder to switch into with these Pokemon. In addition, it also forms a strong pivoting core with Meowscarada. Due to the risk of being Choice-locked into the wrong move, Meowscarada is also quite prediction reliant when facing structures with Pokemon like Gliscor and Dondozo. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure such cores, like Raging Bolt and Dragapult, are excellent partners. Meowscarada also doesn't like taking chip damage from hazards, as it repeatedly wants to pivot in and out of the field. Thus, it appreciates hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its great natural bulk, unique defensive typing, and access to Unaware, Skeledirge manages to be a fantastic defensive presence that is able to stave off the likes of Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta. Torch Song is a phenomenal Fire-type STAB move that allows Skeledirge to exert offensive pressure while still providing a defensive backbone. Slack Off lets Skeledirge stay healthy throughout the game, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in on powerful offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Zamazenta. Will-O-Wisp quickly neutralizes physical attackers like Dragonite and Zamazenta in addition to powering up Skeledirge's Hex. Maximizing its HP and Special Defense enables Skeledirge to more reliably check special attackers, notably Iron Moth and Enamorus; conversely, maximizing its HP and Defense turns Skeledirge into an immensely sturdy physical wall, forgoing its reliance on spreading burn by leveraging its raw physical bulk to check potent setup sweepers, particularly Dragonite and Zamazenta. Tera Fairy provides Skeledirge with a much-appreciated resistance to Dark, allowing it to safely check Pokemon such as Weavile and Hisuian Samurott; conversely, Tera Water allows Skeledirge to sit in front of powerful wallbreakers, notably Calm Mind Primarina and Hisuian Samurott, and its neutral defensive profile allows it to safely check Pokemon like Kingambit.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to force progress while staving off opposing threats. It dislikes taking Knock Off due to its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, so it appreciates teammates such as Clefable and Skarmory that can safely switch into Knock Off from Weavile and Iron Valiant. Skeledirge also enjoys having Clefable in particular absorb Salt Cure from Garganacl; Clefable also appreciates Skeledirge's reliability in forcing out Galarian Slowking and Iron Moth. Rillaboom and Galarian Slowking are much-appreciated teammates for Skeledirge, as Rillaboom provides Skeledirge with Grassy Terrain to bolster its longevity in addition to forcing out Ogerpon-W that would otherwise threaten it, whereas Galarian Slowking can pivot into and around powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Walking Wake. It also enjoys entry hazard support from Gliscor and Skarmory wearing down Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem that would otherwise threaten Skeledirge and its team. Skarmory also assists Skeledirge in answering Choice Band Rillaboom, which otherwise threatens it with Knock Off, reliably checks Kingambit for it and appreciates having a consistent check to Iron Moth. Gliscor can spread status with Toxic to power up Skeledirge's Hex and relishes in having a sturdy switch-in to Serperior. Skeledirge also benefits from pairing with fast wallbreakers such as Weavile, Dragapult, and Ogerpon-W, providing them with a sturdy defensive backbone and appreciating having them weaken the opposing team's defenses, as they open up Skeledirge to sweep late-game with Torch Song; it also greatly enjoys pairing with Dragapult in particular, as Dragapult is capable of spreading status effects to a multitude of Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T for Skeledirge to take advantage of with its Hex.</p>"

First Impression enables Lokix to move faster than most of the metagame while dealing massive damage to them, including Bug-resistant foes such as Zamazenta and Cinderace. It also allows Lokix to revenge kill offensive threats like Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kyurem. U-turn allows Lokix to pivot out of bad matchups like Zamazenta and Corviknight and give some momentum to the rest of its team. Knock Off helps it limit the longevity of threats that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots like Dondozo, Zapdos, and Zamazenta while also hitting foes like Pecharunt. Leech Life provides it with longevity even if it's taking residual damage from Rocky Helmet and entry hazards. Tera Bug provides an extra boost of power, which can allow Lokix to take down foes like Dragapult and a chipped Dragonite with First Impression.</p> <p>Lokix fits best on bulky offense and balance teams. Teaming up with Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Hisuian Samurott can create entry hazard-stacking cores, making it easier for Lokix to clean up with First Impression. Lokix can also spam Knock Off easily, getting rid of Heavy-Duty Boots from foes and making them vulnerable to its teammates' hazards. Lokix's typing and lack of Heavy-Duty Boots make it extremely susceptible to entry hazards, thus, Great Tusk can help thanks to its bulk and access to Rapid Spin. Hatterene and Iron Treads are also great hazard control options. Other specially offensive teammates like Kyurem, Enamorus, and Raging Bolt can help consistently apply pressure, especially against more physically defensive opponents that Lokix struggles against, such as Gliscor, Zamazenta, and Skarmory. Zamazenta and Gliscor make solid teammates for Lokix, being brought in by Lokix's U-turn and sweeping with their Iron Defense and Swords Dance sets, respectively. Lokix's priority can also help support slower teammates like Iron Crown and Galarian Slowking by picking off fast threats that they struggle with, like Weavile and Darkrai. On more balanced teams, Lokix can be supported by other pivots to continue carrying momentum. Defensive options such as Alomomola, Landorus-T, and Corviknight can provide additional bulk for the team and resist threats to Lokix like Enamorus, while Lokix deals with foes like Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Gholdengo. Iron Crown is an offensive pivoting option that forms a solid VoltTurn core with Lokix, taking care of each other's threats; Lokix handles Darkrai and Iron Crown handles Clefable and Tera Fairy users like Raging Bolt. Dragapult is a fast pivot option, taking care of Zamazenta and Dragonite, while Lokix helps it keep Ting-Lu in check.</p>"

Earthquake lets Garganacl hit threats such as Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Galarian Slowking, with its high-Base Power giving Garganacl offensive presence so it doesn't have to rely solely on Salt Cure for damage, which is especially useful since Raging Bolt commonly runs Leftovers and Galarian Slowking's Regenerator can mitigate Salt Cure damage as well. 52 Defense EVs lets Garganacl survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip without the need for Curse boosts or Terastallization. Tera Water turns Garganacl's Water weakness into a resistance, letting it better handle Water-types such as Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. It also lets Garganacl check offensive Steel-types such as Gholdengo, with Purifying Salt letting it resist Shadow Ball. On the other hand, Tera Fairy gives Garganacl an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult as well as Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt. It also grants Garganacl a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Great Tusk and removes its Grass weakness, improving its matchup against Meowscarada. Both options remove Garganacl's weakness to Ground-type moves, letting it better handle foes that rely on Earthquake for coverage such as Dragonite.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense or balance teams. Due to not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Garganacl appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight; Great Tusk in particular appreciates Garganacl checking spinblockers such as Dragapult and, with Tera Water, Gholdengo. Rillaboom makes for a great partner thanks to Garganacl appreciating the recovery from Grassy Terrain, which alleviates entry hazard chip damage, as well as the reduction in Earthquake's damage, letting it check Pokemon like Dragonite better. It should be noted that Garganacl's own Earthquake will deal less damage as a result of Grassy Terrain and Salt Cure's chip damage will be mitigated by Grassy Terrain's healing when combined with Leftovers, however. As Substitute blocks Salt Cure, Pokemon that can punish the use of the move, such as Encore Dragonite, Infiltrator Dragapult, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu, are appreciated teammates. Ogerpon-W makes for a great partner with Garganacl thanks to Water Absorb and its ability to force Ground-types like Gliscor out with Ivy Cudgel. It can also punish Substitute with Encore and remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, accentuating the chip damage done by Salt Cure. In exchange, it appreciates Garganacl deterring defensive Pokemon like Skarmory with Salt Cure, as well as its ability to handle Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult. Unaware Clefable forms a good defensive core with Garganacl, denying other setup sweepers the opportunity to set up on Garganacl while also appreciating its ability to absorb status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult and Skeledirge. Garganacl also benefits from Clefable's ability to check Ting-Lu. Opposing Clefable can check Garganacl with both of its abilities, so Pokemon that can dispatch it, like Gholdengo and Heatran, make for good partners. Garganacl also enjoys Knock Off and hazard support, as the removal of items like Heavy-Duty Boots and the additional chip from hazards makes it harder to play around due to the chip damage from Salt Cure having more of an impact on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Ting-Lu. Gliscor has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off while also resisting Ground-type moves; in exchange, Garganacl checks Hex Dragapult, one of Gliscor's best checks. Finally, specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire appreciate Garganacl's physical walling capabilities while making up for its inability to consistently handle special attackers like Primarina and Enamorus.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Garganacl is an exceptional Stealth Rock setter and wall thanks to its great bulk, amazing ability in Purifying Salt, and access to Salt Cure. As a setter, Garganacl is very good at outlasting and pressuring common removal options like non-Leftovers Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads with Salt Cure. Protect also stalls turns, which works well in conjunction with Salt Cure and allows Garganacl to chip its foes as much as possible; it's also useful at scouting moves from foes such as Choice Band Dragapult, Lokix, and Meowscarada and maximizing passive recovery from Leftovers. However, Ice Punch is an option to immediately nail Hydrapple and Gliscor, as they can be huge threats in the balance mirrors in general and shrug off Salt Cure's passive damage with Regenerator and Poison Heal. Additionally, the move also lets Garganacl chunk foes like Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Latios immediately. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams with little to no hazard removal at the cost of crucial Leftovers recovery. 52 Defense EVs allow Garganacl to survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip, and the rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to maximize its special bulk to help it take on threats such as Dragapult in a better fashion. Tera Fairy enables it to handle threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Dragapult better; in addition, the Grass neutrality helps it against foes like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada. Tera Water helps it against foes like Gholdengo and Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Both of these Tera types are useful at handling non-Swords Dance Gliscor as well, as Garganacl also acts as a Toxic absorber.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that need a bulky entry hazard setter; Salt Cure is great at making progress for its teammates to capitalize on. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo appreciate Garganacl's ability to chip and force damage on the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, especially against threats such as Skarmory and Primarina. In return, they offensively pressure Garganacl's switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Rillaboom, and Clefable, as it's reliant on Salt Cure for damage and is thus very passive. Gholdengo also deserves a special mention because of its ability to block hazard removal attempts from foes like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Garganacl also forms amazing cores with Spikes setters such as Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Skarmory, further helping its offensive teammates by dominating the hazard game. Moreover, Gliscor and Skarmory also help it in checking Ground- and Fighting-types like Landorus-T and Zamazenta. Knock Off users such as Clefable and the aforementioned Weavile are also good teammates due to removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Galarian Slowking and Dondozo; removing Leftovers from foes like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu is also useful so that they take maximum damage from Salt Cure and Stealth Rock. In addition, Clefable and the aforementioned Gliscor also support Garganacl by acting as Knock Off absorbers, as Garganacl likes to keep its Leftovers intact—Protect and Leftovers form a strong combination that makes Garganacl very tough to break down. Galarian Slowking also makes a great partner that supports Garganacl with Future Sight, punishing Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, as well as providing pivoting support with Chilly Reception. Garganacl also appreciates hazard removal support, as its foes such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Ting-Lu may use it as fodder for setting up hazards, especially Spikes; as such, Pokemon like Great Tusk make nice teammates. Due to its relatively poor base typing, Garganacl is weak to a variety of threats including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W; thus, partners such as Ogerpon-W, Skeledirge, Zamazenta, and Dragapult, respectively, are appreciated. Rillaboom also synergizes well with Garganacl, as its Grassy Terrain can weaken Earthquake from foes like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor for Garganacl as well as helping it deal with Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda; in return, Garganacl supports Rillaboom with hazard and deals with foes like Iron Moth for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Swords Dance, Weak Armor, and an excellent STAB combination, Ceruledge is an explosive setup sweeper and late-game cleaner. Swords Dance allows Ceruledge to reach various damage thresholds such as OHKOing Ogerpon-W with Bitter Blade and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Bitter Blade is a reliable STAB option with no drawback that has the additional benefit of allowing Ceruledge to recover HP, which lets it survive revenge kill attempts and gives it even more setup opportunities. Shadow Sneak allows Ceruledge to finish off faster and weakened foes like Ogerpon-W and Dragapult if Weak Armor hasn't been activated yet. Poltergeist gives Ceruledge a powerful STAB move that allows it to OHKO Galarian Slowking and offensive Gholdengo without needing to set up; additionally, at +2, Poltergeist is very likely to OHKO most Kyurem and Pecharunt sets. Close Combat is a strong coverage option that, in combination with Bitter Blade and Shadow Sneak, provides Ceruledge with perfect coverage for the tier, allowing it to hit Hisuian Samurott, Roaring Moon, and Garganacl, which would otherwise wall it. On sun teams, Ceruledge should run Solar Blade with Tera Grass to devastate its typical checks such as Alomomola and Dondozo. If Ceruledge opts to run a Jolly nature, it can outspeed Gholdengo as well as, after a Weak Armor boost, +1 Speed Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon, but it causes Ceruledge to miss out on KOs Adamant would otherwise net such as guaranteed OHKOing Garganacl with a +2 Close Combat. Tera Ghost enhances the strength of Poltergeist and Shadow Sneak while also allowing Ceruledge to remove its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type attacks from common foes such as Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Glimmora. When running Close Combat, Tera Fighting is recommended to enhance its power, which lets Ceruledge secure an OHKO on Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. Tera Fighting also grants Ceruledge Rock and Dark resistances, allowing it to turn the tables on Dark-type foes like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott while decreasing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Ceruledge's offensive tools means it best fits on hyper offense teams where it finds its home as a sweeper that appreciates entry hazards and the presence of other sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Gholdengo, and Darkrai. Great Tusk and Iron Treads are excellent partners; both offer reliable hazard control to keep Ceruledge's Focus Sash intact, while Ceruledge can eliminate their common checks. Ceruledge also pairs well with hazard setters such as Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott, which can allow Ceruledge to secure KOs it would fall short of, especially when utilizing a Jolly nature, such as OHKOing Ting-Lu and Garganacl with a +2 non-Tera Fighting Close Combat. Additionally, Ceruledge can deny Rapid Spin from opposing Iron Treads and Great Tusk while threatening Corviknight. Ceruledge generally appreciates special sweepers such as Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Raging Bolt, threatening its checks and counters such as Garganacl and Dragonite. In return, Ceruledge can handle Blissey and Galarian Slowking, which would otherwise deny a sweep from these special sweepers. Ceruledge is also a consideration on sun teams alongside a setter in Ninetales or Torkoal, since Ceruledge becomes extremely threatening with sun-boosted Bitter Blade paired with Solar Blade, the latter of which rips apart its usual checks in Great Tusk and Alomomola. Walking Wake and Ceruledge form a nearly unwallable duo, as Walking Wake can deal heavy damage to Pokemon that would otherwise wall Ceruledge like Dragonite and Zamazenta. Other sun partners such as Slither Wing and Hatterene provide pivoting and other utility that can support a Ceruledge sweep. Another hyper offense archetype Ceruledge can fit on is Sticky Web teams with setters like Ribombee and Araquanid. On these teams, Ceruledge acts as a spinblocker and sweeper that pairs excellently with its previously mentioned teammates.</p>"

Early in the game, Tinkaton makes for a good anti-lead, matching up well into other entry hazard setters like Clefable, Deoxys-S, and Ribombee and disrupting them with Encore while setting its own entry hazards. Encore also works well with Gigaton Hammer, allowing Tinkaton to punish foes that would take advantage of the passivity after the latter move is used to set up or recover HP. Thunder Wave can be run to punish Pokemon like Iron Moth and Ogerpon-W switching into Tinkaton, while Knock Off can be used instead to cripple foes like Moltres, Galarian Slowking, and Alomomola by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Ice Hammer is an option to pressure Gliscor, especially since it's unbothered by most of Tinkaton's moves. Air Balloon bypasses its Ground weakness against foes like Gliscor and Landorus-T, and it allows Tinkaton to check threats like Kyurem, Dragonite, and Enamorus that rely on their Ground coverage to deal with Steel-types. Pickpocket also allows Tinkaton to disrupt foes by stealing their item once its Air Balloon is popped, notably against U-turn users like Landorus-T and Dragapult that can pop Tinkaton's Air Balloon and lose their own item in the same turn. Mold Breaker can be used instead to let Tinkaton paralyze Gholdengo and Garganacl with Thunder Wave, set Stealth Rock against Hatterene, and even use Encore on all three of them. Tinkaton can utilize Tera Water to get rid of its Fire weakness, standing up to the likes of Cinderace and Iron Moth, and provide a Water resistance against Walking Wake. Tera Ghost can instead block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads and emergency check Zamazenta. 232 Speed EVs allow Tinkaton to outspeed Landorus-T.</p> <p>Tinkaton fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to disrupt opposing Pokemon and set entry hazards, as well as its ability to switch into moves from Pokemon like Darkrai and Dragapult. It can form a hazard stacking core with Spikes setters like Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott while also benefitting from their ability to handle Ground-types and use Knock Off. Tinkaton struggles to do damage in spite of Gigaton Hammer's Base Power due to its middling Attack stat, so it needs offensive partners like Dragonite and Kyurem, which, in return, appreciate Tinkaton being able to check Weavile and Deoxys-S. Tinkaton also won't keep its Air Balloon forever, so it needs Ground-immune teammates like Moltres and Zapdos that can handle the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Great Tusk is also an excellent teammate for Tinkaton, providing entry hazard removal, since Tinkaton lacks recovery unless it steals another Pokemon's Leftovers, and taking care Fire-types like Cinderace and certain Ground-types like Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is notably annoying for Tinkaton, as it resists Gigaton Hammer and is immune to both Thunder Wave and Encore if Tinkaton is not running Mold Breaker, so teammates like Darkrai and Kingambit that can remove it are a big help.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Glimmora is one of the tier's premier leads thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and deny opposing entry hazards with Mortal Spin, all while scaring foes from activating Toxic Debris in the process. Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU outside of Iron Moth able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to survive any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Red Card can be used instead, allowing Glimmora to make use of its natural bulk and typing to take a hit and thus phaze setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth—which is notable in the hyper offense mirror—preventing its team from getting overrun by boosted offensive threats. Red Card is also useful to disrupt the opposing team, potentially forcing a foe out to take Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes damage. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> <p>Glimmora finds its home on hyper offense teams that enjoy it starting the match strong by setting up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from the beginning. Kingambit greatly appreciates this, as even Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch like Darkrai and Enamorus can potentially get KOed by +2 Sucker Punch after a round or two of Stealth Rock, while physically defensive walls trying to switch in like Skarmory and Corviknight have to contend with not only Kingambit's attacks but also with the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Iron Valiant similarly enjoys Glimmora's entry hazards chipping at the foes for it and the rest of the team to win late-game, while it also provides Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Clodsire, making them susceptible to its hazards. Gholdengo may be used alongside Glimmora, as its Ghost typing and Good as Gold ability let it block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts, thus making sure Glimmora's entry hazards stay up. Glimmora may also play a defensive role on occasion, as its good matchup against Skeledirge lets it assist teammates like Iron Moth and Zamazenta that can struggle against it.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Glimmora's unique typing, high Special Attack, and good coverage make it a great wallbreaker and potentially late-game cleaner. In addition to Glimmora's offensive prowess, Toxic Debris can deter foes with Toxic Spikes, which can be difficult for opposing teams to handle, especially offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-type Pokemon; this is another valuable trait that Glimmora has. Meteor Beam helps Glimmora power through the likes of Corviknight, Garganacl, and Galarian Slowking. Meteor Beam can also surprise a common switch-in, Air Balloon Gholdengo, as it cannot take a Meteor Beam on switch-in followed by a boosted Earth Power. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Primarina and most neutral targets other than Blissey. Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran can take Glimmora's STAB moves, so Earth Power provides excellent coverage for them as well as opposing Glimmora, Raging Bolt, and Skeledirge after its Power Herb has been consumed. Gholdengo, even with Air Balloon, cannot reliably switch into a Meteor Beam into Earth Power. In the last slot, Glimmora can run Dazzling Gleam to reliably hit the Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Dragonite once Glimmora's Power Herb has been consumed. Optionally, Glimmora can also run Tera Fairy to power up Dazzling Gleam and gain a better defensive typing to deal with faster attackers like Dragapult and Darkrai, as well as gaining a neutrality to Ground to take Dragonite's Earthquake in a pinch. Rock Polish is another option that makes up for Glimmora's lackluster Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed notable threats such as Iron Valiant and Zamazenta after one use. Finally, Power Gem gives Glimmora a reliable Rock-type STAB move after Power Herb has been consumed. Aside from gaining a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, both Tera Grass and Tera Flying give it an immunity and a resistance to Ground, respectively, with Tera Flying having the drawback of being weak to priority Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Tera Grass also provides Glimmora with better Ogerpon-W and Great Tusk matchups.</p> <p>This set primarily fits on hyper offense teams, especially Sticky Web teams where Glimmora's lackluster Speed is made up for. As such, Sticky Web setters like Ribombee are fantastic partners. Glimmora excels against opposing offense, as many opposing offense teams struggle with Toxic Spikes, meaning the opponent must be careful with how they attack Glimmora. This careful play can be punished by breaking through common bulkier threats that fit well on offense, such as Zamazenta and Gholdengo. Glimmora struggles against bulkier teams that make use of Heavy-Duty Boots; as such, Glimmora appreciates the presence of powerful wallbreakers and Knock Off users, such as Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant. Sturdy special walls such as Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire also give Glimmora trouble, so it appreciates other entry hazards to wear them down over time, which foes like Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott can provide. Hisuian Samurott can also provide Knock Off support to get rid of their Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo is also a great partner, as it can block hazard removal to keep Glimmora's Toxic Spikes up; it also provides good defensive utility by checking Galarian Slowking. Kingambit is a great offensive partner that can take advantage of the Toxic Spikes that Glimmora sets up and clean up late-game after Glimmora has broken through the opposing team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With massive physical bulk and Unaware, Dondozo is a robust physical wall that is capable of checking some of the tier's most prevalent threats, such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Waterfall is Dondozo's STAB move of choice, with high PP and lack of a drawback, and does decent damage to potential switch-ins like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant looking to scare Dondozo out, while Body Press can instead more effectively handle the likes of Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott and let Dondozo hit Ogerpon-W. Curse can make Dondozo a potent threat, increasing both its offensive potential and defensive capabilities, including letting it better check potent threats like Tera Dark Kingambit. Avalanche can be run instead to threaten Dragonite and punish Grass-types like Rillaboom and Serperior that might otherwise fearlessly switch into Dondozo. RestTalk helps Dondozo stay healthy and avoid status while potentially continuing to make progress or set up, depending on the Sleep Talk rolls. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Dondozo switch safely into powerful attackers repeatedly without taking entry hazard damage, while Leftovers can be used instead to provide more reliable recovery than Rest. Tera Fighting powers up Dondozo's Body Press, allowing it to get more mileage out of its naturally high Defense and Curse boosts, and lets it more effectively check Kingambit thanks to the Dark resistance it provides; Tera Dark can help Dondozo check special attackers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Stored Power Latias in a pinch as well as non-Low Kick Kingambit variants; and Tera Grass can be used to flip its weaknesses, letting it resist normally dangerous attacks from Rillaboom and Serperior and effectively check Ogerpon-W, which can give bulkier teams trouble.</p> <p>Dondozo is generally found on bulkier teams, especially stall, that appreciate its ability to easily check a number of threatening setup sweepers and other fearsome physical attackers like Kingambit. Despite its enormous physical bulk, Dondozo's special bulk leaves much to be desired, so it pairs well with specially defensive walls like Blissey and Clodsire that can handle Pokemon like Raging Bolt. Dondozo is a passive Pokemon that is checked by other bulky Pokemon like Alomomola, which can also use it as fodder to pass Wishes to Pokemon like Ursaluna, and Clefable, and so it benefits from teammates like Gliscor and Clefable that have more offensive presence and can make progress against them or act as Knock Off absorbers for it. On balance teams, offensive partners like Great Tusk and Weavile help threaten Dondozo's checks like Rillaboom and Raging Bolt while in turn benefitting from its ability to check Kingambit. Ogerpon-W is particularly annoying for Dondozo thanks to Water Absorb and is difficult to check without using Tera, so teammates like Amoonguss and Hydrapple that can handle it while also helping against threats like Rillaboom are appreciated, though the latter loses to Play Rough variants. If Dondozo runs Leftovers, entry hazard removers like Talonflame, which can threaten Defog against Gholdengo, and Corviknight are necessary partners to keep Dondozo healthy through repeated switches while also doubling as checks to Rillaboom and Meowscarada. Alomomola is a great partner for passing Wish to Dondozo, helping it be less reliant on Rest for recovery as well as potentially burning physical threats like Kingambit and Weavile to help it take as little damage as possible from stronger physical attackers.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With high special bulk, a useful typing, and an excellent ability in Unaware, Clodsire is one of the best special walls in OU, checking special setup sweepers like non-Draco Meteor Raging Bolt, Darkrai, and Iron Moth. Toxic puts the aforementioned threats as well as otherwise safe switch-ins and foes that can threaten it out, like Deoxys-S, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk, on a timer. Amnesia bolsters Clodsire's Special Defense to staggering heights, ensuring powerful special attackers like Raging Bolt and Gholdengo or Stored Power users like Iron Crown and Hatterene cannot break through. If the team lacks another Stealth Rock setter, then Stealth Rock can be run instead, especially because entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Cinderace hate getting crippled by Toxic and thus lose to it long-term. Similarly, Spikes is also another option if another Stealth Rock setter is present on the team. Although Earthquake is its preferred STAB move, Bulldoze can be used instead to trade power for greater PP, allowing Clodsire to continually chip away at Pokemon like Gholdengo and Clefable during longer games. Similarly, Poison Jab trades the reliable status of Toxic for greater PP and actual damage, as well as offering a way for Clodsire to spread status while Taunted and against Pokemon with Magic Bounce, valuable against threats like Enamorus, Hatterene, and Raging Bolt. A niche alternative is Poison Sting, which trades Poison Jab's power for even higher PP while still capable of spreading poison; the lack of contact is also useful against Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Moltres. For Tera types, Clodsire can choose between Tera Steel and Dark. Tera Steel allows Clodsire to keep its valuable Toxic immunity while still giving it valuable resistances that allow it to check foes like Psyshock Gholdengo, Primarina, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Dark gives Clodsire a Psychic immunity, crucial for checking Stored Power, Psychic Noise, Future Sight, and Psyshock users like Iron Crown, Galarian Slowking, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Due to Clodsire's passive nature, it slots best onto stall and bulkier balance teams, which appreciate the defensive capabilities it brings. Teammates like Dondozo and Alomomola appreciate Clodsire's ability to check threatening sweepers like Raging Bolt, while Clodsire can rely on them to check physical attackers like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Another teammate that Clodsire pairs especially well with is Blissey, as together they form an extremely potent defensive core that can wall almost any special attacker. Clodsire covers threats like Serperior and Gholdengo that can boost past Blissey's sheer bulk, while Blissey beats special attackers like Primarina, Iron Crown, and Walking Wake that can hit Clodsire for super effective damage. Gliscor and Clefable can serve as Knock Off absorbers, as well as setting entry hazards, allowing Clodsire to run Amnesia. On bulkier balance teams, Clodsire pairs well with Skarmory as the defensive backbone of the team, setting hazards and forcing switches to chip down offensive threats like Great Tusk, Darkrai, and especially Gliscor, which Clodsire is completely helpless against. Corviknight also excels as a partner, absorbing Knock Off that can cripple Clodsire, as well as beating Gliscor, Skarmory, and opposing Corviknight, all of which Clodsire struggles against. Garganacl can soak up status from threats like Hex Dragapult and Cinderace while providing physical bulk that Clodsire appreciates. Offensive partners like Dragapult and Zamazenta threaten Pokemon that Clodsire can't handle such as Walking Wake, while Clodsire walls threats like Iron Valiant and Enamorus that its partners would otherwise struggle against. Another good teammate is Kingambit, which can absorb Future Sight and other Psychic-type attacks that would threaten Clodsire, while Clodsire beats Pokemon that Kingambit struggles against, like Raging Bolt, Moltres, and Iron Moth.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With the combination of Swords Dance, Supreme Overlord, and STAB Sucker Punch in its arsenal alongside an incredible defensive profile further exacerbated by Terastallization, Kingambit is undoubtedly the metagame's deadliest and most polarizing offensive threat and late-game sweeper. Sucker Punch gives Kingambit a way to circumvent its one issue—its low Speed—to beat the tier's faster offensive threats, forcing Pokemon like some variants of Iron Moth, Kyurem, and Ogerpon-W to be in pristine condition to take it on. Moreover, its incredible typing and natural bulk not only give it multiple entry and setup opportunities, but they allow Kingambit to check common metagame staples like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Darkrai. Kingambit's sheer presence even mandates all of the aforementioned threats to adapt and run sets to beat it. Its ability to immediately dent Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users such as Clefable, Gholdengo, Moltres, and opposing Kingambit with Iron Head can be forgone for Tera Blast Fairy, which hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, Tera Dark Pecharunt, and Tera Fighting Dondozo super effectively while still netting great neutral coverage against the whole metagame, including the aforementioned Fairy-types and other foes like Kingambit, when paired with its Dark-type STAB moves. Either one of Kowtow Cleave or Iron Head can also be replaced with Low Kick, which gives Kingambit a non-Tera-reliant move to hit Hisuian Samurott and opposing Kingambit super effectively while netting crucial benchmarks such as potentially OHKOing Ting-Lu at +2, especially because common Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Pecharunt want nothing to do with Kingambit. However, the lack of Kowtow Cleave makes Kingambit struggle to beat walls like Corviknight, and, without committing to Tera Blast Fairy, Alomomola and Zapdos, and only having Dark + Fighting coverage makes Kingambit struggle against the aforementioned Fairy-types even more. Low Kick should only be used on maximum Speed variants to try and hit opposing Kingambit first. Leftovers takes further advantage of its defensive profile and works well with Sucker Punch, as foes attempting to play around it will just grant Kingambit more health. Leftovers is especially more effective on variants running the bulky EV spread. Lum Berry prevents Kingambit from being shut down by a burn from the likes of Dragapult, Darkrai, Alomomola, and Moltres but can also help against Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Hatterene's Nuzzle. Black Glasses + Tera Dark should exclusively be used together with Kowtow Cleave, as these propel Kingambit's offensive pressure further; with five Supreme Overlord boosts under its belt, Kingambit can reach feats such as 2HKOing even Dondozo with Kowtow Cleave and OHKOing Dragonite through Multiscale with Sucker Punch at +2. Air Balloon allows Kingambit to set up on would-be checks in Landorus-T and most Great Tusk; become a sturdy switch-in to offensive threats like Kyurem and Dragonite that mostly rely on their Ground-type coverage to hit it; and gain an immunity to Spikes, which is one of the ways to limit Kingambit's health before it gets going. The latter reasoning thus makes Heavy-Duty Boots an appealing alternative option to combat entry hazards in general, especially on hazard-stacking teams that lack reliable hazard removers while aiming to play a longer game. Tera Ghost flips its Fighting weakness, letting it go toe-to-toe against otherwise solid checks in IronPress users like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zamazenta more reliably, especially because it naturally puts fear in the likes of Dragapult and Gholdengo from trying to exploit its newfound Ghost weakness. Defensively, Tera Fairy also gives it an overall good defensive typing, notably letting it take on all-out attacking Zamazenta better while maintaining its Dark resistance against other foes like non-Iron Head Kingambit and Weavile. Tera Fire provides a burn immunity from foes like Dragapult, Darkrai, and Moltres, even flipping its Fire weakness against the latter and other threats like Cinderace and Iron Moth. An Adamant nature is preferred, but a Jolly nature can be used with maximum Speed investment to outspeed most variants of Skarmory, Primarina, and Sinistcha and, at worst, Speed tie opposing Kingambit. A bulkier EV spread further takes advantage of Kingambit's hit-taking abilities, remarkably reaching feats such as surviving +2 Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel and two Iron Valiant Moonblasts while running just enough Speed for Blissey.</p> <p>Kingambit's late-game potential and defensive utility make it a near staple on any offensive archetype, ranging from bulky to hyper offense, while still being capable of fitting on balance teams. Physically offensive teammates like Ogerpon-W, Zamazenta, Dragonite, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant are helpful to overwhelm shared checks like Zamazenta, Landorus-T, Moltres, and Dondozo. Simultaneously, special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Moth, Kyurem, and Raging Bolt are similarly helpful to handle and pressure these checks, preventing them from getting free turns to set up or recover health. Additionally, their synergy doesn't stop there, as Zamazenta and some Iron Valiant variants appreciate Kingambit's ability to switch into and threaten Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking; Dragonite can take on Iron Moth and provide a Ground immunity against Landorus-T; Gholdengo can switch into and check Zamazenta for Kingambit; Dragapult can check Zamazenta and bring Kingambit safely via U-turn; and Kyurem and Raging Bolt can threaten and force damage, respectively, onto Kingambit's Ground-type checks in Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. Dark-type offensive threats in Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott, in particular, are notable in forming a Dark-type spam core together with Kingambit, which is capable of overwhelming Dark-resistant Pokemon like Zamazenta and Tera Fairy users like Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Moltres together. Moreover, the aforementioned Hisuian Samurott helps chip foes into Kingambit's KO range with its entry hazards, whether it's softening walls like Ting-Lu or potential revenge killers like Ogerpon-W and Iron Moth into Sucker Punch range; thus, other hazard setters like Landorus-T, Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Ting-Lu are similarly valuable. Defensive pivots like Landorus-T, Zapdos, Pecharunt, and Galarian Slowking are common faces on bulky offense teams that help switch into threats like Cinderace, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta for Kingambit and are great at bringing it in safely onto the field, especially with Intimidate and Parting Shot to ease its setup; in return, Kingambit helps check Darkrai, Gholdengo, and Dragapult for Galarian Slowking and Pecharunt. Other and more specific offensive playstyles like Sticky Web, dual screens, and the fringe Trick Room can also mesh well with Kingambit. Sticky Web from Ribombee and Araquanid compensates for Kingambit's low Speed against faster threats like Raging Bolt, Hisuian Samurott, and Great Tusk if Kingambit runs a Jolly nature, even making it less reliant on Sucker Punch mind games. Dual screens from Alolan Ninetales give Kingambit an easier time setting up and let it stomach even super effective hits from Iron Moth and Darkrai. Similar to Sticky Web, Trick Room set by teammates like Hatterene can compensate for Kingambit's poor Speed tier, especially against fast foes like Iron Valiant and Encore Ogerpon-W. On balance teams, a sturdier defensive backbone with the likes of Skarmory, Corviknight, Clefable, Gliscor, and Alomomola is similarly appreciated, as on top of switching into Kingambit's aforementioned checks and revenge killers, they can also set entry hazards and bring it in safely via slow pivots; Alomomola can also provide Kingambit with Wish support, while Gliscor and Clefable can further weaken walls with Knock Off. Outside of its utility set, Swords Dance Gliscor, in particular, is also a strong setup sweeper that complements Kingambit well.</p>"

  "Great Tusk": {
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk stands out as a great offensive threat and the tier's premier entry hazard remover thanks to its excellent Attack stat, movepool, defensive typing, and access to Rapid Spin. Ice Spinner allows it to destroy foes resistant to its STAB moves, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Rapid Spin, in addition to clearing hazards, enables Great Tusk to outpace Pokemon like Kyurem and Darkrai. Great Tusk can further compress roles as the team's entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, but the move can be dropped if a different setter is present on the team. Knock Off hinders opposing teams and is quite spammable because of Great Tusk's ability to threaten the metagame's premier Knock Off absorber, Gliscor, with Ice Spinner. It is especially useful for hazard-stacking teams that Great Tusk fits on, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Moltres and Zapdos. Knock Off also hampers foes like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Primarina, and opposing Great Tusk. Alternatively, Close Combat can be used over Knock Off to hit certain Pokemon harder, such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, Kyurem, and Tera Normal Gliscor. Rocky Helmet lets Great Tusk punish physical attackers such as Zamazenta and Dragonite. Heavy-Duty Boots maximizes its hazard removal prowess, allowing it to use Rapid Spin freely without worrying about taking damage from hazards on the field. Alternatively, Booster Energy bolsters its wallbreaking ability, allowing it to reach thresholds like OHKOing Gliscor with Ice Spinner. Tera Steel aids Great Tusk defensively, allowing it to resist Grass-type moves from foes like Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom as well as Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Kyurem and Darkrai; it also helps Great Tusk against Hisuian Samurott and Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ground improves its wallbreaking potential, allowing non-Booster Energy Great Tusk to 2HKO +1 All-Out Attacker Zamazenta with Headlong Rush and its Booster Energy variants to 2HKO Alomomola; getting rid of its Fighting-type also helps it against foes like Iron Valiant and Clefable while maintaining its immunity to Thunderclap. Tera Fire enables Great Tusk to circumvent being burnt by Pokemon like Dragapult and Moltres while giving it an Ice resistance, helping it against Kyurem and Darkrai; it also allows Great Tusk to handle Fire-types better, like Iron Moth and Cinderace.</p> <p>Great Tusk fits on offense and balance teams, offering excellent role compression. Attackers weak to entry hazards, such as Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and non-Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem, appreciate Great Tusk providing hazard removal support, which allows them to wallbreak or clean effectively. These teammates also help it in dealing with threats like Moltres, opposing Ogerpon-W, and Zapdos. Being a special sponge, Galarian Slowking is a wonderful defensive partner for Great Tusk, taking hits from various special attackers that annoy Great Tusk such as Walking Wake, Iron Valiant, Moltres, and Zapdos. In return, Great Tusk handles Pokemon that Galarian Slowking is weak to, such as Kingambit and Gliscor. Hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl also pair brilliantly with Great Tusk, taking full advantage of its hazard removal support to set up hazards fearlessly; this synergy becomes even stronger if Great Tusk opts to run Knock Off, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dragapult and Moltres, ensuring they take hazard damage. Garganacl, in particular, heavily appreciates Rapid Spin support, enabling it to freely run Leftovers and spam Salt Cure; in return, it helps Great Tusk against foes like Moltres, Zapdos, and Dragapult. Great Tusk is vulnerable to spinblocking to an extent, being obstructed by Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Sinistcha, Dragapult, and Tera Ghost users like Raging Bolt and Kingambit. Thus, Dark-type and faster Ghost-type attackers such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Kingambit, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu make excellent teammates. Special attackers like Raging Bolt, Iron Moth, the aforementioned Dragapult and Darkrai capitalize on Great Tusk's offensive pressure and hazard removal ability, working remarkably well with it to dismantle the opposing team's defensive backbone. Notably, Great Tusk can deal with Ting-Lu, a threat these teammates absolutely despise; these special attackers, in return, destroy Great Tusk checks such as Ogerpon-W, Zapdos, and Iron Valiant. Bulky Flying-type pivots, namely Zapdos and Moltres, respect Rapid Spin support from Great Tusk, allowing them to avoid Stealth Rock damage even after their Heavy-Duty Boots has been removed via Knock Off. Strong physical cleaners, namely Zamazenta and the previously mentioned Kingambit, are also commonly seen with Great Tusk. They appreciate its ability to wear down the opposing team, especially with Knock Off, allowing them to do their job with relative ease. A notable interaction is Great Tusk removing Moltres's item, making it take Stealth Rock damage; this makes Moltres quite ineffective against Kingambit and Zamazenta, enabling them to heavily pressure the opposing team. Dragonite is also a great teammate in that regard; it acts as a check to multiple Pokemon that Great Tusk is weak to such as Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Araquanid, and it can utilize Dragon Dance + Extreme Speed to pick off the foes that Great Tusk weakens. Additionally, Great Tusk providing Rapid Spin support also opens up the option for Dragonite to run Choice Band instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Swords Dance Gliscor is another good teammate; it appreciates Great Tusk handling foes like Dragonite that Gliscor may have trouble against. Moreover, Great Tusk supports Gliscor's Terastallization by providing hazard removal, compensating for the loss of its Spikes immunity after Terastallizing. Bulky pivots without solid recovery such as Assault Vest Iron Crown and most Primarina sets also heavily appreciate Rapid Spin support, improving their longevity and enabling them to pivot freely.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Great Tusk focuses on its great defensive typing and natural physical bulk to act as an amazing defensive check to Pokemon such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and physical Iron Treads while providing excellent utility for its teammates. Headlong Rush is used over Earthquake to secure an OHKO on uninvested Gholdengo and bulky Cinderace, as well as giving it the chance to OHKO Raging Bolt. Ice Spinner gives Great Tusk the ability to 2HKO the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and the aforementioned Dragonite. It also gives Great Tusk a means of hitting other Flying- and Grass-types that would otherwise feel safe switching in such as Enamorus and Rillaboom, with the latter's Grassy Terrain being removed. Ice Spinner is also able to slam Pokemon that opt for Tera Flying, namely Raging Bolt and Kingambit. Rapid Spin is an amazing tool for Great Tusk thanks to how well it is able to match up against other Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora. Rapid Spin's Speed boost also lets Great Tusk keep up with Dragon Dance Dragonite while letting it outspeed targets such as Dragapult, Iron Crown, Cinderace, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. The final moveslot comes down to either Knock Off or Stealth Rock. Knock Off is a great way to force further progress on the hazard-stacking teams Great Tusk finds itself on by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from common switch-ins such as Moltres, Zapdos, Sinistcha, Alomomola, and Air Balloon Gholdengo; however, it has to be wary of Flame Body and Static from the former two. Stealth Rock, on the other hand, is able to compress hazard setting and hazard removal to help free up Great Tusk's teammates of the responsibility while taking advantage of the switches that it can force, especially after a Rapid Spin, from opponents like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Glimmora, as well as Galarian Slowking and Dragonite. Rocky Helmet can be used to further punish the Pokemon Great Tusk aims to check like Kingambit, Gliscor, and Scizor while forcing chip damage on other physical attackers such as Lokix and Hisuian Samurott by punishing the use of Knock Off. Rocky Helmet also forces Dragonite to break its own Multiscale upon contact, giving Great Tusk an immediate OHKO on it. Leftovers are a solid option to increase Great Tusk's own longevity, giving it more opportunities to Rapid Spin away hazards or set them up if it opts for Stealth Rock, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots can be run on teams that are more reliant on Great Tusk to remove hazards. Max Speed is run on Great Tusk to ensure it is able to outspeed Glimmora, as well as other targets such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Great Tusk fits perfectly on bulky offense and balance teams wanting to make use of its defensive capabilities and strong utility options. It functions as the tier's most versatile form of hazard removal while maintaining an offensive presence with its high-power STAB moves and strong coverage. Powerful offensive partners that appreciate its ability to remove hazards, remove items, or set hazards such as Ogerpon-W, non-Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem, and Raging Bolt do an excellent job at punching roles through the opposing team. These partners are also able to effectively handle opposing Pokemon that Great Tusk might struggle with, such as Moltres, Zapdos, and Alomomola. Other teammates that share similar checks to Great Tusk, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta, appreciate the ability to remove items and chip down the previously mentioned threats into range, like removing Moltres's and Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots or chipping Zamazenta into range of their attacks, forcing it to use Rest. Dragonite and Garganacl love Great Tusk's ability to remove hazards, allowing them to drop their Heavy-Duty Boots. This is in favor of Choice Band on the former to act as a powerful and immediate wallbreaker, whereas Garganacl is able to run Leftovers to further boost its longevity, meaning it isn't forced to use Recover as often and can therefore focus on using Salt Cure to chip down the opposing team. Defensive partners such as Galarian Slowking and Moltres help shut down Pokemon such as Enamorus, Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Kyurem, which Great Tusk can not handle. Galarian Slowking also acts as a special wall that appreciates Great Tusk taking on the likes of Kingambit, Gliscor, and Lokix for it, while Moltres can act as a safer check to Tera Fairy Dragonite and Cinderace. Other hazard setters that can relieve Great Tusk, such as Landorus-T and Tinkaton, or ones that complement it with Spikes, such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott, work wonderfully with it; the latter two are also able to handle the Ghost-type Pokemon that may try to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Other Pokemon that are able to deal with Ghost-types such as Dragapult, Darkrai, and Lokix are helpful: the former two being able to act as strong special attacking wallbreakers that can break through Pokemon Great Tusk can't, such as Hatterene, Dondozo, and Corviknight, while Lokix can act as a strong pivot and revenge killer, taking care of Ting-Lu, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom for Great Tusk while it removes hazards for Lokix and chips down checks like opposing Great Tusk and Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Great Tusk with Booster Energy's Speed boost is a potent physical setup sweeper that is capable of providing valuable utility to its team, as its access to Rapid Spin and its natural bulk allows it to check key threats such as Dragonite and Kingambit. Bulk Up leverages Great Tusk's natural bulk to give it setup opportunities against many of the common physical attackers in the tier, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta. Ice Spinner allows Great Tusk to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Serperior, Gliscor, and Enamorus for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall it or force it out. The last moveslot can be Rapid Spin, which lets it remove hazards and provides it with further boosts to its Speed, preventing otherwise faster threats like Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from revenge killing it; Close Combat for a strong Fighting-type STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulky Kingambit, threatening huge damage on Ting-Lu and Kyurem, and punishing switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight with heavy damage; or Knock Off, which deals with Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as crippling its checks like Dondozo. Leftovers can be used instead should Great Tusk be used on sun teams. Tera Poison is the premier defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, allowing it to set up on Gliscor's Toxic and completely wall Rillaboom and Zamazenta alongside avoiding a KO and thus granting it an extra turn against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Conversely, Tera Ice is a strong choice for an offensive Tera type that provides Great Tusk with STAB on Ice Spinner, which can net OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Zapdos after a boost from Bulk Up. Tera Steel can also be considered as an alternative to Tera Poison that also lets Great Tusk wall Choice Band Dragapult and Dragon Dance Kyurem, at the cost of being weaker into Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Low Kick Kingambit. Additionally, both Tera Ice and Steel provides an Ice resistance against foes like Weavile and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Great Tusk is commonly seen on offense, hyper offense, and sun structures, which appreciate its entry hazard control and ability to clean teams in late-game scenarios. Great Tusk particularly struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. On sun teams, strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake can easily force these Pokemon out and can soften up the opposing team for Great Tusk to sweep in the mid- or late-game. In return, Great Tusk provides key hazard control and switches into powerful physical threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, it can easily shatter common checks to both Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, particularly Clodsire and Galarian Slowking. Hatterene on sun teams and Choice Scarf Enamorus on weatherless offense can support Great Tusk with Healing Wish and can threaten some of its checks, notably Gliscor, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta. Hatterene also alleviates the need for Great Tusk to run Rapid Spin, freeing up the last moveslot for more offensively oriented options such as Close Combat and Knock Off. Outside of sun, Rillaboom provides Great Tusk with passive recovery without relying on Leftovers and can force out or KO the likes of Primarina and Dondozo. In return, Great Tusk can act as a mid- or late-game sweeper once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened and can threaten Pokemon such as Dragonite that Rillaboom struggles against. Dragonite appreciates the utility of Great Tusk's Rapid Spin and its ability to consistently threaten Skeledirge. In exchange, Dragonite can handle opposing Ogerpon-W. Lastly, Kingambit enjoys having Great Tusk beating its checks like opposing Great Tusk one-to-one with its own setup, allowing it to more easily sweep late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With an excellent Attack stat, STAB-boosted First Impression, and the momentum-generating U-turn complemented by Close Combat, Slither Wing establishes itself as an excellent choice on sun teams as a pivot and revenge killer. With First Impression, Slither Wing can OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile as well as pick off other chipped threats like Kyurem and Walking Wake. In sun, Close Combat lets Slither Wing 2HKO Great Tusk and Raging Bolt while also OHKOing Kyurem and Garganacl. U-turn allows it to generate momentum from predicted switches against foes that it threatens, such as Ting-Lu, forcing significant chip damage in the process. Slither Wing's low Speed also allows it to take a hit from a faster foe such as Kyurem and offensive Gholdengo, before bringing in a teammate safely. Earthquake is a safe option that hits Ground-weak Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo without Air Balloon, and Iron Treads, without any drawbacks; however, it fails to threaten Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo and loses out on various damage rolls, such as an OHKO on Iron Treads. Flare Blitz in sun enables OHKOs on Corviknight and Gholdengo at the cost of recoil damage that adds up over time, hurting Slither Wing's longevity as a pivot. Assault Vest leverages Slither Wing’s excellent natural special bulk, allowing it to tank hits from faster special attackers such as Darkrai, offensive Gholdengo, and Glimmora, so that teammates can be pivoted in safely. Assault Vest can also help Slither Wing survive OHKOs from moves such as Iron Moth’s sun-boosted Fiery Dance, opposing Walking Wake’s sun-boosted Draco Meteor, and even an unboosted Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus. 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed various bulky attackers, most notably Modest Raging Bolt, Primarina, and Adamant Dragonite. Tera Steel allows Slither Wing to resist various Fairy- and Psychic-type moves that normally threaten it, such as Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus and Psyshock from Iron Crown. Tera Steel also reduces Stealth Rock damage, enhancing Slither Wing's ability to pivot further.</p> <p>Slither Wing is almost exclusively found on sun teams that appreciate its ability to pivot, revenge kill foes that have been chipped, and threaten difficult matchups such as Garganacl and Galarian Slowking. Furthermore, Slither Wing appreciates Pokemon that benefit from sun and can capitalize on the momentum it generates while covering foes Slither Wing cannot threaten, such as Dragonite and Moltres. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock and entry hazard removal, so Slither Wing can pivot more consistently. Alternatively, Ninetales is a faster partner that offers excellent utility in Encore and Healing Wish and appreciates the slower pivoting Slither Wing provides to give it safe entry. Walking Wake loves the pivoting Slither Wing provides and appreciates its ability to take care of Walking Wake’s checks, such as Ogerpon-W and Blissey, via First Impression. In turn, Walking Wake's sheer power obliterates Gliscor, Moltres, and Landorus-T, which Slither Wing would otherwise struggle to dent. Like Torkoal, Great Tusk spins away entry hazards that threaten Slither Wing and provides a solid check to many Dragonite sets after Slither Wing breaks Multiscale with U-turn. On a similar vein, Hatterene denies most hazards, except Spikes from Hisuian Samurott, which is a foe that Slither Wing threatens. Raging Bolt is a good teammate as either a secondary pivot or setup sweeper. Raging Bolt complements Slither Wing by threatening Moltres, which could cripple it with a burn.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Packing solid bulk and a surprisingly adept defensive typing that resists STAB moves from common offensive Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Rillaboom, Hisuian Samurott, and Darkrai, Slither Wing serves as a specific but effective defensive pivot thanks to its ability to check many common threats in one teamslot. First Impression can revenge kill many important targets such as Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Weavile. Alternatively, if Slither Wing's team already has another priority move, Close Combat can be used instead to threaten Kingambit and Iron Treads. U-Turn allows Slither Wing to maintain momentum while forcing out Pokemon that it can switch in on, such as Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Hisuian Samurott. Morning Sun allows Slither Wing to stay healthy throughout a match, allowing it to check the previously mentioned Pokemon long-term. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp and Stun Spore allow Slither Wing to spread crippling status, threatening Pokemon it can't directly threaten with its STAB moves, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, non-Substitute Zamazenta, and Terastallized Kingambit. Will-O-Wisp allows Slither Wing to weaken physical attackers for the benefit of its team, while Stun Spore allows it to cripple Tera fire setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Dragon Dance Kyurem that could use Will-O-Wisp variants as setup fodder. 8 Speed EVs allow Slither Wing to outspeed Adamant Kingambit, while the 28 Attack EVs guarantees the OHKO on Darkrai with First Impression. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 Spe can be used if not running First Impression. Tera Steel is the Tera type of choice, allowing Slither Wing to check important threats it otherwise couldn't such as Latios. Tera Dragon is another solid option, giving a strong neutral defensive type that gives resistances to Ogerpon-W's STAB combination while granting a Fire resistance from foes like Cinderace.</p> <p>Defensive Slither Wing functions best on bulky offense teams, using its good bulk, recovery, and U-turn to provide free switch-ins to its frailer teammates like Darkrai, Iron Valiant, Dragapult and Ogerpon-W. Slither Wing struggles against Moltres and Zapdos, the former punishes U-turn with Flame Body and absorbs Will-O-Wisp, and the latter does the same with Static and Stun Spore. Hard-hitting wallbreakers that can punish these two Pokemon switching in to either set up or wallbreak like Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-C, Kyurem, and Raging Bolt make for good partners. Gholdengo is also another common roadblock for Slither Wing thanks to its typing, which lets it shrug off Slither Wing’s STAB combination, and Good As Gold, which makes it immune to all status moves, so strong Dark-types that can punish a Gholdengo switch like Darkrai, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile are also effective partners. Slither Wing forms strong defensive cores with Pokemon like Moltres and Galarian Slowking that can take on offensive threats it cannot handle such as Iron Valiant, Kyurem, Gholdengo, and Primarina. Slither Wing, in return, provides a solid switch-in to the Dark-Types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Lokix, and Weavile that force out Galarian Slowking as well as being a strong soft check to Ogerpon-W, which greatly threatens these defensive cores. Entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Landorus-T also make for good partners, as their hazards punish switches forced by First Impression.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Treads serves as a major player in the entry hazard metagame and an excellent lead for offense teams due to its Speed, Stealth Rock, and ability to remove hazards from opposing leads like Glimmora and Deoxys-S with Rapid Spin. Its Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and it naturally outspeeds Landorus-T, which can use Taunt to prevent hazards from slower leads. A special set with Earth Power allows Iron Treads to KO Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, while Steel Beam's self-KO allows it to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, Defog from Corviknight, and gives safe entry for an incoming teammate while still threatening Hatterene from switching in to prevent its Stealth Rock. Volt Switch is also an option to bring in its teammate safely without KOing itself in the process. Booster Energy's Speed boost allows Iron Treads to set Stealth Rock against Deoxys-S, grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and allows it to pick off various otherwise faster Pokemon, notably Cinderace, which could otherwise use Court Change before Iron Treads could attack. Eject Button is an option that can be used on teams for additional momentum at the cost of effectiveness in the hazard game. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and opposing Iron Treads to keep its hazards and gives Iron Treads an immunity to Fighting Fighting-type moves that would otherwise KO it, including Close Combat from Zamazenta and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Iron Treads is an excellent teammate on offensive teams, such as sun and rain, that can support various sweepers by denying entry hazards, setting its own hazards, or pivoting. It also checks Raging Bolt lacking Weather Ball. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult provide Rapid Spin immunities, strengthening the team's advantage in the hazard game, while also checking Iron Defense Zamazenta, a dangerous sweeper that can easily find setup opportunities on Iron Treads. Alongside these Ghost-types, Fairy-, Grass-, and Water-type Pokemon that outspeed Great Tusk including Iron Valiant, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can be used to prevent Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin without burning Tera, and they also appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as they can't afford to use Heavy-Duty Boots on most teams. Kingambit is also a good teammate, as it is a hyper offense staple and appreciates Iron Treads enabling the offense of its teammates for Kingambit to clean up late-game. Setup sweepers with Knock Off like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W increase the effectiveness of Stealth Rock by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to assist teammates with breaking through walls such as Dondozo and Garganacl. When using Eject Button, Iron Treads is excellent on rain teams, checking Raging Bolt and Dragapult and ensuring Pelipper and Barraskewda can pivot in and out freely to use the limited turns of rain are used to the fullest extent. It can also serve a similar role on sun teams, checking Raging Bolt and Iron Valiant while being able to regain the momentum that Torkoal loses and providing a second hazard remover.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Hands carves a decent niche as an extremely bulky and hard-hitting wallbreaker as well as a physical tank capable of outdamaging and outlasting most other physical attackers. Drain Punch greatly enhances Iron Hands's longevity, allowing it to heal itself out of 2HKO range against threats like Ogerpon-W, Ting-Lu, and all-out attacking Zamazenta variants while maintaining significant offensive pressure. Close Combat is a solid alternative; while it completely sacrifices the added longevity from Drain Punch, its astonishing damage output—outdamaging a super effective Ice Punch against neutral targets—allows Iron Hands to wallbreak more easily. This gives it a high chance to OHKO Raging Bolt after Stealth Rock damage with Booster Energy active while outright OHKOing the likes of maximum HP Great Tusk and uninvested Zamazenta with Booster Energy and a Swords Dance boost. Thunder Punch is a consistent and reliable option that KOes the likes of Primarina, Skarmory, and Corviknight while also offering a stronger hit against Fairy-types like Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant. Supercell Slam is a significantly stronger alternative, boasting a high chance to OHKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Clefable and bulky Gholdengo variants outright. However, the risk of Iron Hands suffering disastrous recoil damage if it misses or if the opponent switches into a Ground-type can be unappealing. Ice Punch rounds out Iron Hands's coverage with a strong attack against Dragon-types like Dragapult and Dragonite, as well as Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor. If Iron Hands opts to run Drain Punch over Close Combat, Ice Punch is also its strongest attack into Raging Bolt and Great Tusk. The massive one-time Attack boost from Booster Energy cranks up Iron Hands's damage to absurd levels, allowing it to reach crucial OHKO and 2HKO benchmarks against Raging Bolt, Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Clefable with Close Combat and Supercell Slam. Shuca Berry is a great alternative, particularly on Tera Fire variants, to provide Iron Hands with a one-time neutrality to powerful Ground-type attacks like Great Tusk's and Ursaluna's Headlong Rush, Dragonite's Earthquake, or, if Tera Fire, Enamorus's Earth Power, allowing Iron Hands to trade against these threats. Tera Flying allows Iron Hands to turn its exploitable Ground weakness into an immunity, flipping its matchup against Great Tusk in its favor, and allowing it to more easily trade against the aforementioned attackers. Tera Fire is a great alternative, especially when paired with Shuca Berry, to grant Iron Hands a resistance to Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Clefable and an immunity to Flame Body from Moltres and Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult, Moltres, and Cinderace. Grassy Seed can be considered when paired with Rillaboom to provide a one-time Defense boost, dramatically improving Iron Hands's longevity, particularly against defensive Great Tusk, allowing it to more easily set up a Swords Dance and start throwing out powerful boosted attacks. The Speed EVs let Iron Hands outspeed uninvested base 60s like Clefable and Primarina; after maximizing its Attack, the remaining EVs improve Iron Hands's lower special bulk.</p> <p>Iron Hands generally fits best on dual screens and Aurora Veil teams, which can support its setup by rendering it extremely difficult to 2HKO and nearly impossible to OHKO. Alolan Ninetales is far and away the best dual screens setter thanks to Aurora Veil and as such is a fantastic teammate for Iron Hands. On these teams, Iron Hands can help wallbreak against threats like Dondozo, Corviknight, Skarmory, Clodsire, and Blissey to support faster setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Dragonite, and Raging Bolt that struggle against these defensive threats. In return, their higher Speed or powerful priority attacks can patch up Iron Hands's less-than-stellar matchup against faster offensive teams. Great Tusk is a solid teammate that provides Rapid Spin support to preserve Iron Hands's precious HP. It also benefits from Iron Hands's ability to remove the likes of Dondozo, Corviknight, and Skarmory should Great Tusk opt to run a fast Bulk Up set. Iron Hands is a tremendous defensive answer to Kingambit, which requires either Low Kick alongside a Swords Dance boost and multiple fainted allies, or the highly committal Tera Blast Fairy, to even have a chance to KO a healthy Iron Hands. Kingambit is then easily dispatched by a Fighting-type attack if it doesn't Terastallize. Offensive threats that appreciate Kingambit's removal, with Gholdengo and Dragapult being standout options among these, make for great teammates, as they can more easily spam their powerful Ghost-type STAB moves without worrying about Kingambit resisting them. Iron Hands is quite solid on Grassy Terrain teams with Rillaboom, which can support it by letting it run Grassy Seed as an item, granting it much-needed passive recovery, and even cutting Earthquake's damage to make Iron Hands incredibly difficult to eliminate. Rillaboom and its frequent partner Hawlucha enjoy Iron Hands's removal of Corviknight, Skarmory, Moltres, Zapdos, and Dragonite, letting them clean up late-game after Iron Hands tears holes in the opposing team. Iron Hands can also function on more standard offensive teams due to its solid breaking power and hit-taking capabilities. On these teams, Landorus-T can use Intimidate alongside U-turn to pivot Iron Hands in safely, give it opportunities to wallbreak, and can support its wallbreaking capabilities further with Stealth Rock. Pecharunt can support Iron Hands by more safely answering Iron Defense Zamazenta, which can give Iron Hands some issues.</p>"

  "Iron Moth": {
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>With titanic Special Attack and superb Speed, Iron Moth is a powerful cleaner and solid wallbreaker that can run away with games after a single Fiery Dance boost while also providing offense with a way to absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora. Dazzling Gleam lets Iron Moth hit Dragonite, Dragapult, and Zamazenta hard while reducing its reliance on Tera for coverage. Psychic is an even stronger coverage for Zamazenta while hitting Toxapex and Clodsire for super effective damage without Iron Moth needing to Terastallize. Iron Moth's excellent STAB combination is complemented perfectly by Tera Blast Ground, giving Iron Moth its strongest option against Galarian Slowking and Clodsire while preventing it from being walled by Heatran and Skeledirge. Tera Blast Ghost can also be used to similarly hit Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge while also targetting Dragapult. Energy Ball is another strong coverage option that targets Garganacl and bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo; similar to Dazzling Gleam, it gives Iron Moth strong coverage against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Substitute helps Iron Moth avoid Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap while also vastly improving its matchup against Galarian Slowking, whose pivot set is unable to break Iron Moth's Substitute without relying on Future Sight, and Garganacl, which cannot break Iron Moth's Substitute with Salt Cure after it Terastallizes. Iron Moth can instead opt to run a 4 attack set; with Tera Blast Ground and Dazzling Gleam, Iron Moth maximizes its coverage while still hitting Dragon-types like Dragapult and Dragonite for super effective damage. Combining Dazzling Gleam and Energy Ball alleviates Iron Moth's reliance on Tera, although this leaves it completely walled by both Heatran and Skeledirge. With 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe, Iron Moth's Booster Energy gives it a Quark Drive boost to its Speed; the remaining EVs maximize its Special Attack while 124 Defense EVs help patch up its poor Defense, allowing it to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit with 5 Supreme Overlord boosts and a Close Combat from +2 Iron Valiant. A fully offensive spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is also an option to gain a Special Attack boost from Booster Energy, allowing it to overhwhelm checks like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex more easily, and is especially fitting on Sticky Web teams that can compensate for the lack of Speed boost. Defensively, Tera Ground gives Iron Moth an immunity to Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and both Galarian Slowking and Dragapult's Thunder Wave. Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Blissey's Seismic Toss, and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin in a pinch, and pairs well with Substitute to help mitigate its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy powers up Dazzling Gleam into an additional STAB option that OHKOes Dragapult and Hisuian Samurott, along with securing a 2HKO on max HP Zamazenta and Dragonite through Multiscale, while defensively, it provides a resistance to Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Finally, Tera Grass can be used to strengthen Energy Ball, such as nailing the OHKO on both Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott, while defensively granting Iron Moth a resistance to Ground-type attacks such as Gliscor and Garganacl's Earthquake that can allow it to simply attack or set up a Substitute for free, a quality that is also appreciated against Alomomola.</p> <p>Iron Moth is a great pick for offense and hyper offense teams, not only bringing its qualities as a fast cleaner to the table but also providing teams with a valuable Toxic Spikes absorber. In particular, hyper offense using lead Hisuian Samurott often triggers opposing Glimmora's Toxic Debris; this makes Iron Moth a great partner to Hisuian Samurott while also enabling other Pokemon weak to Toxic Spikes such as Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Defense Zamazenta. In return, Iron Moth greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott itself along with Stealth Rock setters like Glimmora and Landorus-T to help weaken Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking that it struggles to deal with. This highlights one of Iron Moth's shortcomings, as its initial power is not strong enough to break through bulkier walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Blissey, while without boosts from Fiery Dance, it cannot clean against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Partners like Raging Bolt and Primarina that can weaken or eliminate bulkier targets for Iron Moth are much appreciated, while Iron Valiant provides an alternative form of speed for hyper offense that can also weaken shared checks like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, a quality particularly useful for Iron Moth lacking Tera Blast Ground. Strong physical attackers such as Dragonite and Ogerpon-W make for great partners due to their ability to take advantage of these special walls, using them as opportunities to accrue boosts. Kingambit can also provide an alternative wincon that enjoys Iron Moth threatening checks like Skarmory and weakening targets like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and even Great Tusk that can be forced in to revenge kill it. Iron Moth is great counterplay to Sticky Web teams using Ribombee, which give it two free Fiery Dances from lead; however, Iron Moth is also a good fit on these teams, with support from Sticky Web allowing it to outrun other Booster Energy Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder. Iron Moth also fits on other forms of offense; Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain support that can let it avoid the OHKO from Gliscor's Earthquake while boosting the power of Energy Ball, and Rillaboom can also bring it in safely with U-turn on passive targets like Skarmory and Corviknight. Meanwhile, Torkoal's sun greatly enhances Iron Moth's wallbreaking power, with sun-boosted Fiery Dances 3HKOing Galarian Slowking. Unfortunately, Iron Moth's frailty is exacerbated by its weakness to entry hazards, and so Great Tusk makes for a strong partner that also appreciates Iron Moth's ability to threaten common switch-ins like Corviknight and Skarmory. Hatterene is another partner that can help keep hazards off the field for Iron Moth, while Hatterene itself is able to help weaken Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for Iron Moth to later break through.</p>"

  "Gholdengo": {
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its ability Good as Gold and excellent defensive typing that lets it set up on Pokemon like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable, Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a premier wallbreaker in SV OU. Make it Rain's sheer power, especially against Garganacl and Kyurem and neutral threats like Hydrapple and Great Tusk, is preferred, but it can be forgone for Dazzling Gleam's ability to hit a huge slew of threats like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Raging Bolt while being a solid STAB move when paired with Tera Fairy. While Recover gives Gholdengo a way to stay in the battle for longer and leverage its defensive utility against the aforementioned threats, it also has a range of coverage moves to give it more options for wallbreaking. Psyshock is useful for breaking through special walls that would otherwise give Gholdengo trouble, like Blissey and Clodsire, and Focus Blast hits the many Dark-types in the tier; it notably targets Kingambit while hitting Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott harder than Dazzling Gleam. Recover is generally used on bulkier teams, whereas Psyshock and Focus Blast are more useful for teams leaning towards offense. The Ground immunity granted by Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to set up in the face of Gliscor and spinblock Great Tusk in a pinch. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option on teams that lack any entry hazard removal. Gholdengo can make great use of a wide variety of Tera types, both for offensive and defensive purposes: Tera Fairy boosts Dazzling Gleam and gives it a sudden resistance to Dark, potentially mitigating the damage from moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Sucker Punch from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, respectively. Tera Steel can give an additional boost to Make It Rain, granting Gholdengo an OHKO on Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk, as well as lessening the damage of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult. Tera Fighting is an option to boost its Focus Blast, notably having good odds to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2, while also providing a Dark resistance similar to Tera Fairy.</p> <p>Thanks to Good as Gold, any team can make great use of Gholdengo’s ability to spinblock and prevent Defog, but an offensive team would make the best use of its wallbreaking power. Offensive hazard-stacking cores featuring Pokemon such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can use Gholdengo’s help to keep the pressure on. Powerful Pokemon that take advantage of the switches that Gholdengo forces, like Weavile and Meowscarada with Spikes, as well as other Nasty Plot wallbreakers like Darkrai provide support for Gholdengo to whittle down defensive cores. In addition, other special attackers that have access to utility tools like Knock Off to cripple their shared walls and Pokemon that would otherwise absorb Knock Off, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant, synergize well with Gholdengo's ability to block all hazard removal. Without using Tera, Gholdengo struggles against the Dark-types that are so common in the tier, such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott. Having teammates resistant to Dark-type attacks, like Zamazenta and Enamorus, give Gholdengo some extra protection and a way to strike back against them. Even if it's using Air Balloon, having another Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gliscor or Tornadus-T, is extremely helpful to mitigate that weakness. Gholdengo’s Speed tier is still slightly lacking when compared to the rest of the OU tier, leaving it vulnerable to fast threats such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Weavile. Having some speed control on the team, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada or priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, to counteract these threats is extremely valuable.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Gholdengo can serve as a bulky spinblocker and powerful setup sweeper in long matches. Its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery give it multiple opportunities to pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable and make it a more reliable check to key offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Zamazenta. It can use its increased bulk to more safely set up a Nasty Plot while sustaining itself with Recover. Gholdengo possesses near perfect coverage with its STAB attacks, making it very difficult to respond to. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Make It Rain, as it deals high damage to Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Kingambit after a Nasty Plot boost. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and Azumarill, as well as uninvested Landorus-T; alternatively, 92 Speed EVs can allow Gholdengo to also outspeed uninvested Gliscor at the cost of losing a noticeable amount of bulk. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid taking Spikes damage and Ground-type attacks from prominent Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, letting it setup on these Pokemon and more safely pivot into Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to more reliably mitigate entry hazard damage and more frequently pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory even after it has taken damage. Rocky Helmet is a solid alternative to these items that can effectively punish physical attackers like Zamazenta, which is forced to commit to using Crunch against Gholdengo, and force it out due to the threat of significant chip damage. Gholdengo is a fantastic Terastallization candidate in most matches, as it greatly benefits from neutralizing all of its weaknesses to gain a crucial free turn to setup a Nasty Plot or heal itself with Recover. Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a better matchup against various Dark-types such as Weavile and Meowscarada and boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam. Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchups against Iron Moth and Cinderace as well as providing a good defensive typing against much of the metagame. Tera Flying is an alternative option that lets it completely dominate Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits quite well on bulky offense and balance teams as a spinblocker. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Skarmory, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Gholdengo's ability to block most forms of hazard removal. Offensive teammates also appreciate Gholdengo's presence due to its strong defensive profile and ability to absorb status moves. Kingambit in particular greatly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to block status moves and check Pokemon it struggles against such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and can capitalize on Gholdengo luring and weakening its other checks such as Great Tusk. Iron Valiant similarly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, and it can lure and weaken key checks to Gholdengo such as Clodsire with Psyshock. Gholdengo often struggles against offensive teams due to its poor matchup against many key threats such as Darkrai, Kingambit, and Iron Moth. Great Tusk and Dondozo can help alleviate pressure by dealing with Kingambit while simultaneously benefiting from Gholdengo's defensive profile against faster special attackers such as Enamorus. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can handle the special attackers that give Gholdengo trouble, such as Dragapult, and accentuate Gholdengo's threat level with entry hazards. While Gholdengo is excellent at keeping entry hazards on the field, it can often struggle against opposing entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire, particularly if it is unable to Terastallize. Therefore, hazard removal support from Great Tusk is beneficial.</p>"
      },
      "Thunder Wave + Hex": {
        "description": "<p>Hex Gholdengo is a powerful support Pokemon and paralysis spreader. Thunder Wave cripples many Pokemon Gholdengo typically struggles with such as Hisuian Samurott, Darkrai, and Cinderace while also being useful against Pokemon Gholdengo is tasked with handling, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. It can then follow up with a powerful Hex on subsequent switch-ins. Make It Rain is the preferred option in the last slot to hit specially frail Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T, and Garganacl for high damage. Dazzling Gleam still hits Great Tusk for good damage while also hitting other Pokemon such as Hisuian Samurott quite hard. Focus Blast is another option that can be used in the last slot, as it is Gholdengo's strongest move against Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Darkrai, OHKOing the latter two after minor chip damage. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and uninvested Landorus-T. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid Ground-type moves, letting it more reliably spinblock Great Tusk, as well as check Dragonite. Leftovers is also an option, as Gholdengo can force a good amount of switches, granting it more residual healing. Rocky Helmet greatly improves Gholdengo's matchup against Zamazenta, which is forced to use Crunch to meaningfully damage Gholdengo and as such takes significant chip damage. Colbur Berry can also be considered, as it allows Gholdengo to more effectively lure in and paralyze Dark-types such as Weavile and Darkrai while also making it a more reliable answer to Swords Dance Iron Valiant. On teams without hazard removal, Heavy Duty-Boots is also an option to avoid entry hazard damage. Gholdengo can be an effective Tera candidate in order to check a wider range of threats with Thunder Wave. Tera Fairy allows Gholdengo to better check utility Dragapult and resist Dark-type moves from Pokemon such as Weavile and Darkrai, allowing it to get off a crucial Thunder Wave against them while also being helpful against Garganacl by lowering Salt Cure damage. Tera Fairy also has the added benefit of boosting Dazzling Gleam's damage, giving it remarkable odds to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchup against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Cinderace.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an effective option on teams looking for a bulky spinblocker and paralysis support. Hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Ribombee all benefit from its ability to block removal from the likes of Corviknight and Great Tusk. Kingambit greatly benefits from Gholdengo's presence due to it checking Zamazenta and spreading paralysis, allowing Kingambit to outspeed and KO targets such as Darkrai, Weavile, and opposing Kingambit. Darkrai similarly appreciates Gholdengo's ability to paralyze Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth, allowing it to more effectively sweep in the late-game. Iron Valiant also enjoys Gholdengo's presence to handle Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta, as well as its ability to spread paralysis to make Iron Valiant less reliant on Booster Energy to revenge kill Pokemon such as Darkrai. Garganacl appreciates Gholdengo's ability to spinblock its Stealth Rock and handle Pokemon it struggles against, such as Galarian Slowking and Encore users such as Ogerpon and Iron Valiant. In turn, Garganacl aids Gholdengo against Fire-types it may struggle against such as Iron Moth, as well as opposing Ghost-types such as Dragapult. As this Gholdengo set is not running a boosting move, it can struggle to make progress against certain Pokemon, particularly bulky Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Raging Bolt. As such, it appreciates partners that can handle these types of Pokemon. Great Tusk is an excellent partner, as it can undo any hazards Ting-Lu or Iron Treads set up, switch into Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, and deal good damage to all three with Headlong Rush. It is also effective against other Pokemon Gholdengo may struggle with such as Kingambit. Darkrai can lure and deal heavy damage to Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire with its Nasty Plot-boosted Ice Beam, making it easier for Gholdengo to break through them later. Ogerpon-W can easily break past Ground-types with Ivy Cudgel and is effective at luring in and KOing Raging Bolt with Play Rough. It also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to handle Zamazenta and paralyze faster targets such as Darkrai. As Gholdengo's bulk is middling, it can be prone to being overwhelmed by faster threats such as Darkrai and Iron Moth. Dragonite and Raging Bolt can revenge kill these Pokemon with their powerful Extreme Speed and Thunderclap, respectively, while also being able to weaken Ground-types that may switch into Gholdengo with Ice Spinner and Draco Meteor, respectively. Similarly, Zamazenta can also use these Pokemon as an entry point to set up and sweep with Iron Defense. Dragonite and Zamazenta appreciate Gholdengo's ability to handle their checks such as Enamorus and Skarmory, while Raging Bolt appreciates Gholdengo's ability to weaken Ground-type such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. As any status will boost Hex's power, Gholdengo appreciates support from other status spreaders. Moltres can help by spreading burns with Flame Body on Pokemon that typically annoy Gholdengo such Great Tusk and Kingambit while also checking Fire-types like Cinderace. Gliscor is similarly effective at spreading Toxic against Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu and Raging Bolt, while also completely walling Clodsire. In turn, Gholdengo helps Gliscor maintain its Spikes on the field.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo is a great speed control option in the tier capable of outrunning and revenge killing premier offensive threats like Dragapult, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Weavile. Shadow Ball allows it to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking, Skarmory, and Dragapult, while Make It Rain, with its high Base Power, not only becomes challenging to switch into but also enables Gholdengo to effectively revenge kill Pokemon like Enamorus. Trick is a good utility move that allows it to Choice-lock Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, hampering their effectiveness. Focus Blast enables Gholdengo to hit Dark-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to turn Gholdengo into a potent late-game cleaner once it has successfully used Trick to get rid of its Choice Scarf. In another vein, Recover can be utilized to keep Gholdengo healthy, especially against bulkier foes, once it has used Trick, allowing it to check them more consistently. Tera Fighting gives Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type moves, most notably Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and it gives Focus Blast a STAB boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying can be used to help Gholdengo against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Gliscor.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, where it functions as a great revenge killer. Teammates that benefit from Gholdengo's presence include Pokemon that appreciate its ability to handle fast and strong offensive threats. For instance, setup sweepers like Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Bulk Up Great Tusk can capitalize on Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill and weaken opposing threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus, creating opportunities for Gholdengo's partners to set up and sweep. Great Tusk's access to Rapid Spin also synergizes well with Gholdengo, which is punished by Spikes, so getting rid of them gives Gholdengo more opportunities to switch in. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu also benefit from Gholdengo's ability to serve as an emergency spinblocker. Due to its vulnerability to Dark-type Pokemon like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, exacerbated by its reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast and the inherent risk of being Choice-locked, Gholdengo greatly benefits from the support of teammates that check the aforementioned foes, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Grassy Terrain weakens the super effective Earthquake, in addition to acting as a check to foes like Ting-Lu. In return, Gholdengo helps Rillaboom by handling threats that would otherwise be problematic for the latter, such as Corviknight and Skarmory.</p>"

  "Ting-Lu": {
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<p>With incredible bulk, Vessel of Ruin, and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Ting-Lu is one of OU's premier hazard setters and also doubles as a special wall. Spikes are used to hit grounded Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo harder, while Stealth Rock can be used instead to damage Spikes-immune Pokemon like Corviknight that repeatedly switch into Ting-Lu, as well as punish Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth and Enamorus. Thanks to its huge bulk, Ting-Lu is able to take super effective hits from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder and phaze them with Whirlwind in return; in addition to this, Whirlwind forces in opposing Pokemon, which will take damage from Ting-Lu's hazards unless they hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Ruination deals meaningful damage to switch-ins like Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Hatterene while forcing walls like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Clefable to waste their recovery moves. Leftovers provides consistent recovery, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Ting-Lu from getting overwhelmed by entry hazards, mainly Spikes from opposing hazard-stacking teams. Alternatively, on offensive teams, Red Card allows Ting-Lu to take a hit from a threatening foe—specifically a setup sweeper—and force it out, taking advantage of its huge overall bulk to even take on physical attackers and super effective special attacks, such as from Kingambit and Hatterene. Moreover, Red Card taking on Whirlwind's phazing duty gives Ting-Lu more freedom to run both hazards simultaneously. Tera Poison is used to help Ting-Lu better check Fairy- and Fighting-types like Enamorus, Zamazenta, and especially Iron Valiant and grant it an immunity to Toxic, while Tera Ghost can be run instead to nullify Ting-Lu's Fighting-type weakness and allow it to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads, though this comes at the cost of being weak to Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult as well as Dark-types like Darkrai that Ting-Lu would otherwise check.</p> <p>Ting-Lu fits well as a support option on nearly any balance, bulky offense, and offense team. Offensive partners like Dragapult and Zamazenta appreciate entry hazard support to make foes easier to KO, while physically defensive partners like Dondozo and Skarmory benefit from Ting-Lu's ability to handle special attackers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Skarmory is particularly notable for forming a strong defensive hazard-stacking core with Ting-Lu, being able to switch into Pokemon like Meowscarada and Weavile that threaten it. Aside from being potent late-game cleaners that appreciate Ting-Lu spreading chip damage early-game, offensive partners like Weavile and Meowscarada pair well, since they're able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon with Knock Off to make Ting-Lu's hazard stacking more effective as well as pressure Gliscor, which Ting-Lu struggles significantly against. Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are both great defensive partners for Ting-Lu to handle Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, with the former able to provide additional pressure with Future Sight and the latter also able to block hazard removal.</p>"
      },
      "Rest": {
        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is a solid defensive tank that can be used to answer threats like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Raging Bolt. Rest allows Ting-Lu to fully utilize its walling potential giving it more longevity than it otherwise would have, which makes it much more consistent against foes such as Will-O-Wisp Dragapult while helping with longevity versus hazards in the face of foes like opposing Ting-Lu. Ruination is used to chunk switch-ins such as Landorus-T and provide consistent damage. Payback, an alternative to Ruination, allows Ting-Lu to deal damage to foes weak to Dark, namely Dragapult. Sleep Talk's reduced passivity makes Ting-Lu harder to set up on, creating fewer free turns for Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite. This also prevents foes like Ogerpon-W from getting free opportunities to come in, as it may call Ruination. At the cost of being a bit more passive, Ting-Lu can forgo Sleep Talk to run Stealth Rock and form entry hazard stacking cores with Pokemon such as Spikes Gliscor and enable teammates such as Dragonite, Ogerpon-W, and Zamazenta. Tera Water allows Ting-Lu to deal with moves from foes such as Kyurem and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Poison enables it to become immune to poison from foes it likes to switch into such as Galarian Slowking while enabling it to come in and out to absorb Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, it allows Ting-Lu to handle Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and Grass-type moves from Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W.</p> <p>Ting-Lu fits on a variety of different balance and stall teams. Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking appreciate Ting-Lu's presence, as it can check faster foes these Pokemon are weak to, such as Dragapult and Darkrai. In return, Gholdengo checks foes that it struggles against like Zamazenta, and Galarian Slowking checks special variants of Iron Valiant and Primarina for Ting-Lu while providing a safe entry point for Ting-Lu through Chilly Reception when baiting in foes like Dragapult. Spikes Gliscor can be used to wear down Ting-Lu checks like Great Tusk. Ting-Lu also struggles with Flying-types such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Gliscor because it has to rely on Ruination or Payback to damage them. Dragonite and Gliscor can also use it as setup fodder, so teammates that threaten these Pokemon, such as Kyurem and Ogerpon-W, are appreciated. Dragonite is also a good partner, as it appreciates a Pokemon that can handle Will-O-Wisp Dragapult in addition to checking foes like Ogerpon-W for Ting-Lu. These Pokemon help with Ting-Lu's passivity with the ability to muscle through foes such as Gliscor and Great Tusk. Dondozo is also a great partner on stall teams, stopping any setup attempts from physical threats like Low Kick Kingambit and Dragonite. Dondozo's walling attempts can get punished by Raging Bolt, so Ting-Lu's ability to answer Raging Bolt is appreciated. Clefable is able to provide utility through Knock Off, which, in conjunction with Ting-Lu's Stealth Rock, helps wear down the opposition; in return, Ting-Lu handles Gholdengo for it.This set is easily worn down by entry hazards, so hazard removal through Defog from partners such as Corviknight and Galarian Weezing is appreciated. Pokemon like Zamazenta appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to take on foes such as Will-O-Wisp Dragapult, being able to sponge status and force it out. This set is also used on pivot balance teams alongside Dragapult, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking, as these Pokemon pivot on Pokemon Ting-Lu can force damage on or set up Stealth Rock against such as opposing Ting-Lu. These teams appreciate Ting-Lu being able to handle foes such as Dragapult, Raging Bolt, and Darkrai.</p>"

      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<p>Digging deep into its bag of tricks, mixed Iron Valiant makes full use of its wide movepool, powerful STAB attacks, and lightning-fast Speed with Booster Energy to be a devastating cleaner and speed control option. The mixed attacking combination of Moonblast and Close Combat flips the script on checks to its other sets like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Dondozo. Knock Off slams those that resist Iron Valiant's STAB moves, with a chance to 2HKO Galarian Slowking and offensive Gholdengo, as well as removing crucial items from Heavy-Duty Boots Moltres and Assault Vest Primarina. Iron Valiant outspeeds the entire unboosted tier as well as some boosted foes like Kyurem and Great Tusk and can use Encore on them, locking walls like Alomomola and Garganacl into recovery moves, threats like Ogerpon-W and Darkrai into setup moves, Pokemon like Gliscor and Corviknight into utility moves, and even priority users Kingambit and Raging Bolt into their priority moves. Alternatively, Destiny Bond can force lose-lose situations for the opponent, where they must sacrifice their own Pokemon in order to take down Iron Valiant. This is especially potent with Encore over Knock Off or Close Combat, as if the opponent tries to avoid Destiny Bond by clicking a non-attacking move, Encore punishes them for it. It is important to be careful on which move to drop, however, as dropping Close Combat means Iron Valiant misses the OHKO on Kyurem and Kingambit, as well as the 2HKO on Garganacl and Ting-Lu. Meanwhile, dropping Knock Off ensures Iron Valiant struggles into its checks like Galarian Slowking and Moltres, as it has no way to force meaningful damage. Tera Steel flips Iron Valiant's poor matchups into threats like Galarian Slowking, Iron Crown, and opposing Iron Valiant while giving it a useful Toxic immunity against Gliscor. Tera Fairy is an alternative pick to boost Iron Valiant's offensive capabilities, ensuring 2HKOs against Pokemon like Clefable, Zapdos, and Hatterene while allowing for OHKOs against threats like Zamazenta and Raging Bolt, as well as improving its matchup into opposing Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant fits best on bulky offense and hyper offense teams, which greatly appreciate its ability to check other threats while being an offensive force in and of itself. It pairs excellently with Ogerpon-W, taking advantage of Ogerpon-W's checks like Zamazenta and Tera Dragon from the likes of Corviknight. In return, Ogerpon-W punishes Iron Valiant's checks like Moltres, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. Dragapult especially appreciates Iron Valiant's ability to threaten Kingambit, as well as Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott, and in return threatens Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Iron Crown and wears down shared checks like Assault Vest Primarina and Clefable. Great Tusk is another strong teammate, able to remove the entry hazards that cripple Iron Valiant, especially Sticky Web, as well as threatening Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking. Iron Valiant also works well with hazard setters like Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott, appreciating the chip damage wearing down potential switch-ins like Assault Vest Primarina and Gholdengo, while Iron Valiant's Knock Off can remove the Heavy-Duty Boots from users like Alomomola to force hazard chip. They also threaten Galarian Slowking, Iron Crown, and Gholdengo; Hisuian Samurott additionally threatens Moltres. Meanwhile, Iron Valiant can beat Kyurem, as well as Zamazenta for Hisuian Samurott. Similarly, Glimmora is a natural partner on hyper offense teams, spewing out hazards that can enable a late-game cleanup by Iron Valiant, with its Toxic Spikes weakening Assault Vest Primarina and potential temporary checks like Hatterene. Iron Moth is another excellent partner for Iron Valiant as well, able to wear down their shared checks in Galarian Slowking and Moltres, especially with Knock Off forcing hazard chip onto both. Dragonite is a solid teammate as well, able to blow holes and weaken the opposing team for Iron Valiant to finish off, wearing down shared checks like Moltres and Clefable while luring in targets like Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Alomomola for Iron Valiant to exploit.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a premier Calm Mind sweeper thanks to its special movepool and a Speed boost from Booster Energy. Moonblast 2HKOes every bulky Dragon-type as well as Ting-Lu +1. Shadow Ball is super effective against Gholdengo, Pecharunt, Hatterene, and Iron Crown, making for an unresisted coverage combination with Moonblast. Psyshock can be used instead to OHKO Iron Moth after a Calm Mind boost. It also deals much more damage to special walls like Blissey and Clodsire. Encore lets Iron Valiant set up by locking foes like Corviknight and Gliscor into Roost and Protect, respectively. Iron Valiant can also use Encore to punish setup sweepers like Swords Dance Kingambit, Swords Dance Ogerpon-W, and Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Thanks to its 4x Dark resistance, Iron Valiant can even use Encore on moves like Kowtow Cleave from Kingambit, Dark Pulse from Darkrai, and Knock Off from Weavile despite its low defensive stats. Thunderbolt allows Iron Valiant to 2HKO Moltres and Corviknight and deals super effective damage to Primarina, 2HKOing Assault Vest variants at +1. Tera Ghost increases Shadow Ball's odds of 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Crown and OHKOing Gholdengo after a boost. It also lets Iron Valiant stay in on Dragonite trying to pick it off with Extreme Speed. Tera Steel flips Iron Valiant's weaknesses to Galarian Slowking's STAB options, helps it survive Moonblast from Pokemon like opposing Iron Valiant and Clefable, and lets it resist moves like Make It Rain from Gholdengo and Extreme Speed from Dragonite. Tera Electric lets Iron Valiant resist Steel- and Electric-type attacks from Gholdengo and Raging Bolt, respectively. As a bonus, Iron Valiant receives an immunity to paralysis, helping it against Galarian Slowking and Clefable.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is most commonly used on hyper offense. Its most defining and desirable trait is its high Speed when boosted, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame and a great amount of the boosted metagame, with common examples being Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth and Dragon Dance Kyurem, which allows it to be a great anti-offense tool. A common answer to Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Galarian Slowking can even tank a +1 Shadow Ball and delete it with Sludge Bomb. Without Shadow Ball, Pokemon like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Hatterene can easily survive Iron Valiant's attacks and take it down. If Iron Valiant lacks Psyshock, Clodsire and Blissey answer it defensively, while Iron Moth can do so offensively. Without Thunderbolt, Moltres can force Iron Valiant out with Roar, causing it to lose its one-time Speed boost. Corviknight and Primarina can easily survive non-Thunderbolt Iron Valiant's attacks and take it out with Brave Bird and Moonblast. Cinderace can take anything barring a +1 Thunderbolt and threaten Iron Valiant with Pyro Ball. Landorus-T can set up entry hazards to help soften up opposing Pokemon. It can additionally bring in Iron Valiant safely with U-turn, potentially positioning it against Pokemon Landorus-T invites in, like Alomomola and Kyurem. Ting-Lu can take a +1 Moonblast and ruin Iron Valiant's sweeping attempt with Whirlwind, so pairing Iron Valiant with physical attackers like Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W can help it out. Other special attackers, like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Raging Bolt, can help to overwhelm other Iron Valiant's checks like Corviknight and Primarina. Galarian Slowking can take on those three aforementioned special attackers individually, but not together. Knock Off users, like Hisuian Samurott, can also soften up the opposing team; item removal is particularly helpful against Moltres. Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge can help Iron Valiant in achieving KOs. Kingambit is an amazing partner to cover Iron Valiant's weaknesses, and Iron Valiant can do the same for it. Great Tusk tanks Kingambit's attacks but drops to Moonblast, while Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are weak to Kowtow Cleave. Both Kingambit and Zamazenta also love Iron Valiant taking Moltres and Zapdos out, freeing them from potential burns and paralysis. Psyshock users like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Hatterene can take care of the stall matchup, and Iron Valiant returns the favor by taking Gholdengo out for them. Ogerpon-W can brute force its way through almost every Iron Valiant check, including Moltres, Corviknight, Primarina, Clodsire and Blissey, with ease. It also has the option of running Encore to free up Iron Valiant. In return, Iron Valiant threatens Ogerpon-W's checks, like Darkrai, Dragonite, and Raging Bolt.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant is an excellent cleaner and wallbreaker, leveraging its high threat level as an expected special attacker to force out many common physical walls such as Great Tusk and Zamazenta in order to set up a Swords Dance. It can then KO or cripple many of its standard checks such as Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres with a boosted Knock Off. Encore allows Iron Valiant to lock many Pokemon such as Garganacl, Kingambit, and Raging Bolt into disadvantageous moves, giving it more setup opportunities, while also ending potential sweeps from Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Kyurem, Swords Dance Kingambit, and Calm Mind Raging Bolt if they use a setup move. Alternatively, Spirit Break can be used, allowing Iron Valiant to OHKO Great Tusk, unboosted Zamazenta, and opposing Iron Valiant after a Swords Dance boost. Iron Valiant is a fantastic user of Terastallization, as it makes use of a potential free turn to more easily set up Swords Dance. Tera Dark allows Iron Valiant to OHKO both Galarian Slowking and Dragapult with Knock Off without setting up Swords Dance. Tera Dark Knock Off also deals significantly higher damage to both Zapdos and Moltres. Meanwhile, Tera Steel allows Iron Valiant to flip all of its weaknesses into resistances, letting it set up on otherwise lethal attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Corviknight's Brave Bird, and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, while also granting Iron Valiant a Toxic immunity, which is valuable against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Toxapex. Iron Valiant's wide coverage and high Speed allow it to run many alternative coverage moves and Tera types depending on your preferences. Tera Water can be used with Liquidation to OHKO key physical walls like Moltres, Gliscor, and Landorus-T after a Swords Dance boost. Tera Electric is another option, granting Iron Valiant a paralysis immunity, which can be helpful in letting it set up against Zapdos. Ice Punch can be used to nail Landorus-T and Gliscor without Terastallizing. Moonblast allows Iron Valiant a chance to directly OHKO offensive Great Tusk without setting up, which can be useful to open up certain partners such as Kingambit. If Iron Valiant is being used with Sticky Web support, it can run an Adamant nature so that Booster Energy raises its Attack instead, making it a more potent wallbreaker. Iron Valiant can also make use of alternative utility options bolstered by its high Speed. Destiny Bond allows Iron Valiant to effectively trade with an enemy Pokemon of its choice, while Taunt allows Iron Valiant to prevent key Pokemon such as Zapdos from recovering, making it easier for a partner to KO.</p> <p>Iron Valiant works best on hyper and bulky offensive teams as an late-game cleaner and speed control. It greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, Glimmora, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads in order to improve its wallbreaking power. In turn, Iron Valiant can make their hazards even more potent by knocking off Heavy-Duty Boots from key targets like Dragonite and Galarian Slowking. Sticky Web setters such as Araquanid and Ribombee are also great partners, as Sticky Web can alleviate potential Speed ties from opposing Iron Valiant while also allowing slowing down Iron Valiant's other offensive checks like Choice Scarf Darkrai and Iron Boulder. Iron Valiant is excellent at luring and weakening many of the checks to its special sets such as Gholdengo, Moltres, and Galarian Slowking. Pokemon that benefit from these threats being weakened or removed, like Zamazenta, Kyurem, and Primarina, are thus excellent partners, as it becomes much easier for these Pokemon to sweep if their typical checks are weakened. Iron Valiant is a solid check to Raging Bolt, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit with Encore, making it a great teammate for partners that may struggle against these Pokemon, like Gholdengo, Darkrai, and Galarian Slowking. While Iron Valiant exerts a great deal of offensive pressure, it can still struggle with key defensive Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dondozo, and thus Pokemon such as Kyurem and Ogerpon-W are useful to immediately pressure and KO these Pokemon. Iron Valiant's defensive profile is rather limited given its poor bulk. Support from bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, Moltres, and Landorus-T is thus appreciated to bring it in safely. In particular, both Zapdos and Moltres can punish powerful priority moves from key foes such as Dragonite and Scizor with their abilities. Gholdengo resists all of Iron Valiant's weaknesses and can spread paralysis to help Iron Valiant outspeed foes such as Darkrai and Zamazenta even after its Booster Energy is consumed. While this Iron Valiant set is great at luring Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, it can still struggle against these Pokemon one-on-one, particularly if they are running Colbur Berry. Partners that can exploit them, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Darkrai, and Ting-Lu, are thus recommended. Iron Valiant can struggle against Toxic Spikes given that it is not running Heavy-Duty Boots, so a Toxic Spikes absorber, such as Galarian Slowking or Iron Moth, is recommended. Iron Valiant can have an awkward time against Iron Moth, which can survive any attack barring Liquidation at +2 and KO back with Sludge Wave. Pokemon that can check Iron Moth, such as Dragonite, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T, are therefore great partners.</p>"

  "Walking Wake": {
    "sets": {
      "Boots Pivot": {},
      "Sun Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker and a staple on sun teams due to its unique offensive typing, amazing Special Attack, high Speed, and signature Hydro Steam, which is a powerful Water-type STAB move that takes full advantage of the sun. Draco Meteor is a brutally powerful STAB move that synergizes wonderfully with Hydro Steam, capable of OHKOing Water-resistant Pokemon including the likes of Ogerpon-W and Raging Bolt, in addition to 2HKOing nearly every Pokemon in the metagame barring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Primarina. Flamethrower guarantees an OHKO on Corviknight and bulky variants of Kingambit, though Flamethrower isn't used very often in practice due to Walking Wake's already fantastic STAB combination; Weather Ball is a stronger alternative to Flamethrower and allows Walking Wake to still take advantage of opposing weathers such as rain or snow. Dragon Pulse can be used in the last slot, which forgoes Draco Meteor's raw power for more consistency; however, Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to generate momentum for its team, taking advantage of switch-ins from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina to safely bring in its teammates. Knock Off is an alternative option that allows it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Galarian Slowking. 244 Special Attack EVs gives Walking Wake a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making it a potent late-game cleaner against offensive teams due to its power coupled with its heightened Speed, letting it outspeed and threaten would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus; alternatively, Walking Wake can sacrifice the Speed boost for even more power by fully investing in Special Attack, allowing it to break through the likes of Primarina through sheer strength. Tera Water boosts its Hydro Steam's power even further, bolstering its cleaning potential against offense while 2HKOing even resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and allows Walking Wake to 2HKO even Blissey should it opt for a Special Attack boost; however, Tera Fairy could be considered as an alternative, granting it an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult and opposing Walking Wake as well as a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Mystic Water is a viable alternative, allowing Walking Wake to switch up moves while still boosting its most spammable attack in Hydro Steam.</p> <p>Walking Wake is a mainstay on sun teams, requiring either Ninetales or Torkoal to set the sun with Drought. Ninetales can further support Walking Wake with Encore to punish passive options and allow Walking Wake relatively safe entry and Healing Wish to provide Walking Wake with a second chance to wallbreak or sweep late-game. Torkoal, by comparison, can also set Stealth Rock, which makes defensively answering Walking Wake even more difficult, as checks such as Primarina would repeatedly have to sustain chip damage. Hatterene and Great Tusk are also great teammates for Walking Wake, alleviating the issue of entry hazards limiting its longevity; Hatterene is also capable of forcing out checks such as Toxapex and Iron Valiant, while Great Tusk can check priority revenge killers such as Dragonite and Kingambit. In return, Walking Wake can consistently KO or force out either Pokemon's checks, notably taking on Skarmory for Great Tusk and Heatran for Hatterene. Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur can threaten Water-types such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W; both also appreciate Walking Wake blowing holes into the opposing team's defenses, giving them ample opportunity to run off with the game after their checks have been weakened. Lastly, Raging Bolt greatly enjoys Walking Wake's efficiency in dismantling its checks, notably Unaware Clodsire, as doing so enables Raging Bolt to sweep more efficiently in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

  "Sinistcha": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Sinistcha leverages its valuable defensive profile and tremendous longevity to set up easily while doubling up as a sturdy physical wall. It notably checks common physical attackers like Zamazenta, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W, as well as Ursaluna—the last two of which are especially problematic against the bulky teams that Sinistcha fits on. Additionally, it importantly spinblocks Great Tusk and Iron Treads. On top of weakening them with Strength Sap, Sinistcha can tip the scales even further by crippling them with Matcha Gotcha's burn while keeping itself exceptionally healthy in the process. The burn also helps in dissuading otherwise dangerous threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada from switching in freely and chips down bulky foes such as Corviknight and Tinkaton. Additionally, its freedom to use Matcha Gotcha and Strength Sap consistently is exacerbated further by its positive matchup against Hatterene and Psychic Noise users like Iron Crown and Primarina. Heatproof lets it set up on the likes of Cinderace and Moltres lacking Roar and Hurricane if necessary. Heavy-Duty Boots improves Sinistcha's matchup against opposing entry hazard stacking teams, but Leftovers or Colbur Berry can considered on teams with strong hazard removal; Leftovers lets Sinistcha set up more easily, while Colbur Berry allows it to comfortably take on the Dark-type coverage from foes it's supposed to check, like Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom, as well as strong Dark-types like Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Poison grants a Toxic immunity from Pokemon like Gliscor and Galarian Slowking, especially since it can still beat most Ground-types like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and defensive Landorus-T one-on-one looking to exploit its newfound weakness. Tera Fairy gives an overall great defensive typing, notably letting it stave off the tier's plethora of Dark- and Dragon-types like Hisuian Samurott and Dragapult as well as Knock Off from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Swords Dance Iron Valiant in a pinch. Both Tera types also maintain its ability to handle Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, with Tera Poison letting it stomach the latter's Moonblast as well. The Speed EVs let Sinistcha outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Sinistcha fits well on entry hazard stacking balance teams. As such, it appreciates bulky hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, Garganacl, and Tinkaton that can reliably set entry hazards, which works extremely well with Sinistcha reliably spinblocking Great Tusk and Iron Treads. These hazard setters are also important for their defensive profiles to cover for Sinistcha's shortcomings. Specifically, Garganacl takes on Dragapult, Iron Moth, and Moltres, Gliscor tackles Iron Moth and Gholdengo, Tinkaton checks Kyurem and Dark-types like Darkrai, Weavile, Meowscarada, and Hoopa-U, and Ting-Lu handles most special attackers, including Raging Bolt, Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Darkrai. Additionally, Garganacl can switch into status from Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and non-Earthquake Gliscor aimed at Sinistcha, with Gliscor doing so similarly against even more targets, including Earthquake Gliscor and Clodsire, as well as absorbing Knock Off from Clefable, Iron Valiant, and opposing Gliscor; this ability to absorb Knock Off is especially useful for Iron Valiant because it can further punish Sinistcha with Encore. In return, these defensive stalwarts appreciate Sinistcha switching into and handling Zamazenta, Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and, more importantly, Ogerpon-W and Ursaluna. Dedicated and sturdy answers to the tier's plethora of strong Dark-types are also important, with Corviknight, Skarmory, and Clefable capable of checking foes like Weavile and Meowscarada, especially because they don't mind losing their items from the aforementioned threats' Knock Off as much. Aside from relieving Sinistcha from the pressure of checking Rillaboom and Great Tusk, Skarmory and Clefable are also helpful as hazard setters, while Corviknight provides Defog support in case Sinistcha's Heavy-Duty Boots are removed by Great Tusk, Gliscor, or Clefable. Skarmory and Corviknight in particular can also handle Kingambit, especially because Tera Ghost variants of Kingambit looking to beat them make it vulnerable to Sinistcha. Offensive threats like Dragapult, Deoxys-S, Darkrai, and Zamazenta found on these structures are similarly useful; aside from working well with the hazards that Sinistcha can easily keep up, they also match up better against offensive teams that can potentially overwhelm Sinistcha, especially if it has not set up. In particular, they can revenge kill or check Pokemon like Swords Dance + Knock Off Ogerpon-W, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth that cause Sinistcha trouble. Moreover, Dragapult can take advantage of Sinistcha spreading burns through Matcha Gotcha with its strong Hex, while Zamazenta can help check Dark-types like Weavile and Kingambit, especially Jolly variants of the latter that can outspeed Sinistcha. In return, Sinistcha can switch into their revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Dragonite.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Sinistcha is able to check key metagame threats such as Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Zamazenta among others thanks to its suitable defensive typing for the metagame in tandem with its signature move Matcha Gotcha, which also works well with its other STAB option in Hex. Strength Sap functions as recovery while preventing notable 2HKOs from threats like Hisuian Samurott, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada. Foul Play is ran to punish physical setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W and Dragonite, using their own attacking power against them. Stun Spore can be ran instead to paralyze faster threats like Iron Valiant and Cinderace, making it easier for its offensive teammates to revenge kill them, and synergizes well with Hex by letting it net 2HKOs against bulkier Pokemon that would otherwise have no problem staying in on it like Galarian Slowking and Moltres. Heavy-Duty Boots is ran to avoid the repeated entry hazard damage it may sustain from switching in constantly, but Rocky Helmet is worth a mention because it lets Sinistcha punish U-turn from Pokemon like Cinderace, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom, as well as Knock Off attempts from the aforementioned Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads. 96 Speed EVs allow Sinistcha to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna. Tera Poison is a great defensive Tera type that lets Sinistcha check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Gliscor and avoid Toxic. Tera Fairy is an alternative option Sinistcha can run to better check Dark-type attackers like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Sinistcha fits best on fat entry hazard stacking balance and stall teams as a spinblocker and on sand teams as a check to Grass- and Water-types. Hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire work well with it; they can set up hazards and Sinistcha prevents Great Tusk from removing them. Great Tusk itself is a good teammate, since it can keep hazards off for Sinistcha, which will inevitably get its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, since most of the Pokemon it checks carry Knock Off; Great Tusk also checks Kingambit for it. Sinistcha is able to support Great Tusk by checking Grass- and Water-type threats like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Primarina. Weavile is a great partner for Sinistcha as well, since it's able to threaten a lot of Sinistcha's checks like Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Clodsire, and in return, Sinistcha is able to threaten bulky Water-types it has trouble breaking through like Alomomola, Primarina, and Dondozo. Galarian Slowking works well with Sinistcha, since it's able to take care of Kyurem and can also spread status, making Sinistcha's Hex more dangerous, while Sinistcha checks the Ground-types that threaten it like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex is worth a mention on more defensive teams as a check to dangerous special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. On sand teams, Sinistcha holds a valuable role as a check to Zamazenta and Grass- and Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Dondozo, and Rillaboom for Tyranitar and Excadrill; these Pokemon often stop Excadrill from sweeping. Tyranitar is able to function as a check to strong special threats that can crack Sinistcha open such as Kyurem, Iron Moth, and Dragapult, and Excadrill threatens offensive threats that can batter through Sinistcha's strong physical bulk like Weavile. Corviknight works well with Sinistcha as extra insurance against Ground-types. Stall teams also appreciate Sinistcha's unique ability to check Ogerpon-W and Ursaluna, since other checks like Corviknight and Dondozo often get overwhelmed. Blissey and Clodsire are amazing teammates for Sinistcha on stall teams because of their unmatched ability to wall special attackers like Raging Bolt, Darkrai, and Dragapult. Alomomola can pass Wish to keep Sinistcha alive more reliably, and Sinistcha can handle Ogerpon-W, which Alomomola greatly appreciates.</p>"

It can also take on other Iron Defense users such as Corviknight and Garganacl. Knock Off removes items from switch-ins such as Zapdos and Moltres, which threaten it immensely, while also hitting Gholdengo for big damage. Ice Punch hits Gliscor and Landorus-T, which could otherwise trade with it. Guard Dog allows Okidogi to ignore Roar from Zamazenta, Whirlwind from Ting-Lu, and Red Card from Glimmora while also giving it an Attack boost from Landorus-T's Intimidate, meaning that it cannot be weakened by Intimidate from frequent switch-ins. 96 Speed EVs let Okidogi outspeed Modest Primarina and Jolly Kingambit, with the rest being put into HP and Special Defense to help Okidogi take on Pokemon such as Darkrai and Iron Valiant a lot more easily. Tera Water allows Okidogi to take hits from Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake effectively, and it removes Okidogi's Ground weakness to allow it to take on Great Tusk and Gliscor while being a generally good Tera type.</p> <p>Okidogi fits best on bulky offense and balance teams where it can help wall a large proportion of the metagame while outputting offensive pressure. Kingambit is a great partner to Okidogi, as Okidogi can take on the Fighting-types that it struggles against, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, while Kingambit takes on the Psychic-types that scare out Okidogi, such as Galarian Slowking and Latios. Together, they can also overwhelm Pokemon that check them, such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Specially defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown can switch into the special attackers that threaten Okidogi, such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt. In return, Okidogi can utilize their pivoting options in order to take on Pokemon that they may struggle with, such as Kingambit and Dragonite. Physical attackers such as Dragonite and Ogerpon-W pair well with Okidogi, as they appreciate it wearing down physical walls with Knock Off while taking on Pokemon like Zamazenta or Corviknight that they may struggle with. Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott pair well with Okidogi, as they can help Okidogi wear down its checks, such as Gholdengo and Great Tusk, with chip damage. They can also check Pokemon such as Gholdengo that Okidogi may struggle more against. In return, Okidogi takes on Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, which they may struggle with, while also taking on Corviknight, which can clear away their Spikes with Defog.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon's high Attack and Speed along with its access to Defiant make it a reliable pivot and potent wallbreaker that can punish common defensive structures. Knock Off gives Ogerpon a complementary coverage option to Ivy Cudgel and can dissuade switch-ins such as Gholdengo; it also allows Ogerpon to support its team by removing the opposing Pokemon's held item, notably crippling Rock-weak Pokemon like Dragonite and Kyurem that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots. U-turn is a fantastic option that can maintain momentum while safely bringing in one of Ogerpon's teammates, in addition to dealing heavy damage to Grass-resistant foes such as Hydrapple and Latios. Encore can be used to shut down defensive walls like Terastallized Alomomola and Dondozo, as well as slow setup sweepers like Kingambit and Raging Bolt. Tera Grass gives Ogerpon a massive boost in power to its Ivy Cudgel, giving it enough firepower to 2HKO Hatterene and Landorus-T without a Defiant boost, and the +1 Speed boost from Embody Aspect allows it to outrun and threaten would-be faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Zamazenta, letting it reliably and safely use Encore on Iron Defense variants of the latter.</p> <p>Ogerpon should feel right at home on bulkier teams in need of a fast pivot. It struggles to make progress against Fire-types such as Moltres and Heatran, often requiring them to be weakened or removed in order to start threatening teams. Thus, Garganacl and Gliscor make great teammates, as they manage to consistently switch into and threaten these Pokemon, set entry hazards for Ogerpon to take advantage of, and easily spread chip damage to wear down the opposing team. Ogerpon's ability to threaten Water-types like Primarina and Ogerpon-W is also greatly appreciated by both Pokemon. Alomomola is another valuable teammate thanks to its high bulk, low Speed, and access to Flip Turn allowing it to safely and consistently bring Ogerpon onto the field, as well as being able to check the likes of Zamazenta and Cinderace. Additionally, Ogerpon with another fast wallbreaker can make for an efficient and potent wallbreaking core; therefore, Pokemon such as Weavile and Deoxys-S that help overwhelm Ogerpon's checks like Corviknight and Moltres make excellent teammates. It also enjoys having these Pokemon as naturally faster teammates as opposed to relying on Terastallization for speed control, and it likewise appreciates them for being able to threaten bulkier Dragon-types like Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Lastly, special tanks such as Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu can safely switch in on powerful special wallbreakers like Dragapult and Iron Moth, and they also appreciate Ogerpon's reliability in punishing switch-ins like Landorus-T.</p>"

  "Ogerpon-Wellspring": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Dragapult, Hydrapple, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, preventing it from being revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess makes it well-suited to hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Kingambit is a good partner, as Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking enables it late-game through weakening foes that deal with it, such as Skarmory and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Similarly, Ogerpon-W appreciates Kingambit's ability to check Dragapult. Ogerpon-W is susceptible to taking a lot of chip damage from hazards as the game goes on; consequently, this makes Great Tusk a good partner, as it can keep them off the field. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a good partner, as it provides Healing Wish support, giving Ogerpon-W a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team. Ogerpon-W appreciates hazard support, as that helps facilitate its wallbreaking; teammates such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S are useful. Ogerpon-W often struggles to find opportunities to come in; pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T are helpful. Galarian Slowking in particular also helps check Zapdos, which is one of the few Pokemon that Ogerpon-W can struggle against, while Landorus-T's ability to provide Stealth Rock is also appreciated. Iron Valiant, Calm Mind variants especially, is a good partner that appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant is able to threaten Raging Bolt and faster threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Meowscarada.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its impressive Attack, good STAB moves, quality coverage options, and useful ability that aids it in cases like blocking Alomomola's Flip Turn and Primarina's Surf, Ogerpon-W cements itself as one of the best wallbreakers of the metagame. Knock Off hits foes like Dragapult, Sinistcha, and Pecharunt; it's pretty spammable in general because Ogerpon-W threatens the tier's premier Knock Off absorber in Gliscor, and it hinders Pokemon such as Zapdos as well as Terastallized Galarian Slowking and Garganacl. Play Rough crushes Dragon-types such as Kyurem, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Trailblaze can be used to turn Ogerpon-W into a fearsome cleaner, allowing it to outspeed foes like Dragapult and Zamazenta after a boost. However, dropping Knock Off for Trailblaze makes it less suited for entry hazard-stacking teams and overall less useful for its teammates, while dropping Play Rough for Trailblaze makes it very weak to Dragon-types. An Adamant nature is used over a Jolly one to maximize its wallbreaking potential, hitting benchmarks like always OHKOing standard Garganacl after Stealth Rock with Power Whip. Tera Water bolsters its power exponentially, allowing it to do things like 2HKOing defensive Zapdos with Ivy Cudgel; it also enables Ogerpon-W to tank special moves from foes like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Darkrai thanks to Embody Aspect's Special Defense boost and the loss of its Grass typing.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W fits on hyper and bulky offense teams as a strong physical wallbreaker and situational Trailblaze cleaner. Kingambit takes full advantage of Ogerpon-W weakening the opposing team's defensive core to sweep late-game with Swords Dance as well as pressuring shared checks like Zamazenta. It also helps in dealing with foes Ogerpon-W may struggle with, such as Dragapult and Kyurem. Zamazenta also helps Ogerpon-W deal with annoying revenge killers like Kingambit and Lokix as well as foes like Kyurem. In return, Ogerpon-W handles foes these Pokemon may struggle against, such as Landorus-T and Moltres. Ogerpon-W is extremely vulnerable to entry hazards. Great Tusk provides reliable hazard control with Rapid Spin while also addressing threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Raging Bolt. Iron Treads is also a good hazard-removing partner, and it is especially helpful against Raging Bolt. Iron Valiant demolishes pesky Dragon-types and threats like Zamazenta while also solving Adamant Ogerpon-W's Speed issues. Teammates like Raging Bolt and Iron Moth capitalize on Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess and ability to deal with Ground-types by overwhelming the opposing team and potentially cleaning mid- or late-game. Hazard setters such as Glimmora, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu are excellent partners for Ogerpon-W, especially if it uses Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from its foes. Because Ogerpon-W appreciates hazards being kept up on the opposing side of the field, Gholdengo naturally makes a great teammate thanks to its ability to block Rapid Spin and Defog; in return, Ogerpon-W deals with threats like Ting-Lu for Gholdengo. Ogerpon-W also benefits from pivots like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking creating opportunities for it to come in against foes like Ting-Lu and blow holes in the opposing team. Moreover, Dragapult hampers threats like Zamazenta and Dragonite while also spinblocking to maintain hazards on the opponent's side of the field; Galarian Slowking, on the other hand, sponges hits from Pokemon like Iron Valiant and non-Dragon Dance Kyurem, which are normally good answers to Ogerpon-W. By and large, strong wallbreakers and sweepers make great teammates for Ogerpon-W; Dragon-types like Dragonite and Kyurem as well as Pokemon like Darkrai, Enamorus, and Swords Dance Gliscor all synergize well with Ogerpon-W, benefiting from its ability to weaken the opposing team with its powerful STAB moves and coverage. These Dragon-types and Gliscor enjoy Ogerpon-W weakening shared checks such as Zamazenta and Ice Spinner Dragonite, respectively. Darkrai and Enamorus, being potent special wallbreakers, work hand in hand with it to completely dismantle the opponent's team, particularly its defensive backbone; Enamorus can also use Healing Wish to bring Ogerpon-W back to full health if it's chipped and further prolong its assault on the opposing team.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is a fantastic pivot thanks to its combination of high Speed, power, and utility. It can outspeed and threaten out many key threats such as Great Tusk, Heatran, and Gliscor with its powerful Ivy Cudgel, which it can capitalize on to gain momentum with U-turn. Horn Leech complements Ivy Cudgel, hitting bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Primarina for super effective damage and recovering HP, which is useful for mitigating entry hazard damage. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of bad matchups against Dragapult and Dragonite while also dealing high damage to Grass-types that may want to switch into it, such as Rillaboom, Serperior, and Hydrapple. Knock Off allows it to cripple checks like Dragonite, Toxapex, and Hydrapple while preventing Dragapult from safely switching into it. Ogerpon-W makes for a good Knock Off user since it threatens one of the tier's most common Knock Off absorbers in Gliscor. Alternatively, Encore can be used to punish setup from various Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Garganacl while disrupting walls such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Tera Grass Dondozo. Spikes can be run over Knock Off or Encore, as Ogerpon-W can find many opportunities to lay Spikes due to the switches it forces and has good match-ups against various hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Spikes synergizes well with U-turn, as their combined chip damage will wear down many of Ogerpon-W's switch-ins such as Tera Dragon Skarmory and Raging Bolt over time. Water Absorb allows Ogerpon-W to more safely switch into opposing Water-types such as Barraskewda, Hisuian Samurott, and Alomomola, notably making it riskier for these Pokemon to gain momentum with Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W is an average Terastallization candidate, as it is filling a supportive role and its Tera type is telegraphed. Nonetheless, the Special Defense boost Ogerpon-W gains when Terastallizing can be useful in a few scenarios, such as surviving Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and Gholdengo's Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock. The lack of a Grass typing also allows it to match up more favorably against Pokemon such as Weavile, Iron Moth, and Heatran. The damage increase provided by Tera Water can also be useful, allowing Ogerpon-W to 2HKO Skarmory and Corviknight with Ivy Cudgel after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W thrives on bulky offense teams. It synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon. Landorus-T appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to handle opposing Water-types such as Primarina while providing Ogerpon-W with Stealth Rock and Intimidate support. Landorus-T can also check Zamazenta and Raging Bolt, which are difficult matchups for Ogerpon-W. Galarian Slowking benefits from Ogerpon-W's presence to deal with Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Gliscor as well as strong Water-types that can otherwise overwhelm it such as Walking Wake. In turn, Galarian Slowking can support Ogerpon-W via Future Sight and status spreading with Thunder Wave or Toxic, which are useful to wear down and cripple checks such as Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Galarian Slowking also checks key threats such as Serperior and Zapdos, which Ogerpon-W appreciates. Since Ogerpon-W is great at luring and breaking down the opponent's physical walls, partners such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Zamazenta can take advantage of the holes Ogerpon-W puts into walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Gliscor to sweep more easily. Entry hazard support helps wear down many of Ogerpon-W's checks such as Raging Bolt and Serperior, so setters such as Great Tusk, Deoxys-S, and Ting-Lu are recommended teammates, which can also free Ogerpon-W from running its own Spikes. As Ogerpon-W cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, it is quite vulnerable to entry hazard damage over time; hazard removal or prevention support from Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Hatterene, or Cinderace is thus appreciated. Ogerpon-W is good at luring several Pokemon such as Serperior, Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, which it can safely pivot out of with U-turn; Dragapult can take advantage of Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Serperior, while Air Balloon Kingambit and Gholdengo do well against Dragonite. Additionally, Dragapult in particular can support Ogerpon-W further by spreading status.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C can use Swords Dance to become one of the most terrifying wallbreakers in the tier, wielding near-unresisted coverage alongside high-power moves. Ogerpon-C finds ample opportunities to set up a boost, as its decent Speed tier, wide pool of potential coverage moves, and potentially helpful ability in Sturdy can often force switches. Ivy Cudgel is Ogerpon-C's main weapon, threatening even defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Skarmory with its perfect accuracy, high power, and higher critical hit chance. For any Pokemon like Zamazenta or Garganacl that can handle Ivy Cudgel, Power Whip offers even higher power at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy. With these two moves, a boosted Ogerpon-C threatens to OHKO or 2HKO almost everything in the tier, including common physical walls such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zamazenta, Alomomola, and Great Tusk. Power Whip also notably 2HKOes Unaware Dondozo, a common problem for other physical wallbreakers. Horn Leech is an option for a more reliable STAB move that gives Ogerpon-C longevity, letting it heal from chip damage to make use of Sturdy more effectively. Low Kick is a valuable coverage on common foes like Kingambit and Tera Normal Dragonite among others. Knock Off hits Gholdengo and Iron Crown while crippling walls like Galarian Weezing and Okidogi on the switch. Maximum Speed with a Jolly Nature is chosen to speed tie other Ogerpon and Iron Moth, as well as outspeeding Walking Wake, Ninetales-Alola, Iron Treads, and Enamorus. Ogerpon-C's Tera type is locked to Rock, which boosts Ivy Cudgel's power to ridiculous levels while also gaining a permanent +1 boost to Defense. For example, +2 Ivy Cudgel after Terastallization has a very high chance to OHKO maximum defense Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage, and it even gains a chance to OHKO defensive Gliscor from full health. While Ogerpon-C does lose access to Sturdy, Terastallization can still be a useful emergency button to boost Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking abilities or to avoid a timely revenge kill from moves such as Weavile or Meowscarada's Triple Axel.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C functions best on offensive teams, which appreciate its ability to break holes in many common defensive structures so that its teammates can clean up later in the game. Common physical cleaners such as Zamazenta, Dragonite, and Kingambit appreciate their primary answers like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Dondozo being weakened and can help finish the job against Pokemon that can escape a one-on-one versus Ogerpon-C with their HP intact, like a defensive Gholdengo or Zamazenta. Ogerpon-C's main problem is its middling Speed tier versus other offensive threats, which can prevent setup opportunities. Opposing attackers such as Weavile and Darkrai threaten an outright OHKO, with Weavile even ignoring Sturdy, so Ogerpon-C appreciates teammates that can tank hits from these attackers such as Primarina and Zamazenta. Offensive utility Pokemon are also a problem, with foes such as Dragapult and Cinderace threatening to cripple Ogerpon-C with status moves like Will-O-Wisp or pivot out with U-turn for high damage. To handle this, Ogerpon-C appreciates teammates that can absorb or punish utility moves like Landorus-T, Corviknight, or Gliscor. Similarly, Gholdengo can OHKO Ogerpon-C with Make it Rain or cripple it with Thunder Wave while also being able to survive all of Ogerpon-C's main moves, so partners like Ting-Lu can be useful to switch in on and pressure Gholdengo. Finally, entry hazards pose an annoyance to Ogerpon-C, negating the benefits of Sturdy and causing unrecoverable damage, so hazard removal from teammates like Cinderace or Great Tusk can be helpful.</p>"

  "Hydrapple": {
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Hydrapple has incredible bulk, access to Nasty Plot, and Regenerator, making it a notable threat against balance and bulky offense playstyles. Nasty Plot allows it to muscle past bulkier walls like Gliscor, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking, and thanks to its typing, it is able to set up on Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Fickle Beam is a consistently strong Dragon-type STAB option that has a chance to double in power and therefore let Hydrapple OHKO threats like Zamazenta, Gliscor, and Moltres while keeping its Nasty Plot boosts, while Draco Meteor can be used to secure these OHKOes much more safely after a Nasty Plot boost, as well as others such as Ogerpon-W, Zapdos, and bulky Rillaboom. Earth Power gives Hydrapple a way to hit Galarian Slowking and Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots is Hydrapple's preferred item to grant it resilience into entry hazards, since Hydrapple is a wallbreaker that is going to be repeatedly switching in throughout the course of a game to tank hits and maximize the value it gets out of Regenerator. However, Hydrapple has a myriad of niche items it can pick from such as Life Orb to amplify Hydrapple’s breaking power, letting it secure 2HKOs against Zapdos, Zamazenta, and Hatterene, as well as OHKOs against mixed Iron Valiant, Calm Mind Primarina, and Kyurem without setup. Rocky Helmet is another option to punish U-turn attempts from Pokemon it checks like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Landorus-T as well Flip Turn from Alomomola. The drawback of running these alternative item options is that they make Hydrapple vulnerable to entry hazard chip damage, which bleeds into Hydrapple's longevity, since its recovery is only limited to Regenerator and Giga Drain, and it needs to be healthy to set up. 12 EVs can be invested in either Speed to let Hydrapple outspeed Ting-Lu or in Special Defense to let it live Iron Valiant's Moonblast, with the rest invested in HP to let it stomach attacks from threats like Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta more easily. Tera Fairy is most commonly run to give Hydrapple an immunity to Dragon-type moves from Dragapult and Raging Bolt, while Tera Steel also gives it the ability to take Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Kyurem, Weavile, and Meowscarada as well as a Toxic immunity. Tera Poison retains the Toxic immunity and Fairy resistance but trades its matchup into Ice-type attacks for a Fighting resistance, allowing it to take on the likes of Zamazenta and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Hydrapple acts as a wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams, being able to punch holes in opposing balance teams due to its ability to punish passivity and its great matchup into common balance picks like Alomomola, Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, Moltres, and Corviknight help enable and defensively reinforce Hydrapple, taking on threats such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Weavile. Galarian Slowking and Alomomola in particular are amazing partners for it, forming double Regenerator cores on balance teams to outlast all of the offensive threats that threaten them while boasting excellent defensive synergy. Moltres answers Great Tusk more reliably, being able to punish its Ice Spinner targeted toward Hydrapple with Flame Body, which would allow Hydrapple to avoid getting 2HKOed by it. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor and Ting-Lu are great partners because their hazards are essential for chipping foes into KO range for Hydrapple like Ogerpon-W and Assault Vest Iron Crown. Gliscor uses its combination of entry hazards and Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from these Pokemon while baiting in Ogerpon-W for Hydrapple to respond to, causing it to take hazard chip every switch-in and putting it on a timer. Ting-Lu uses its gargantuan bulk to check Dragon-types like Dragapult and Raging Bolt for Hydrapple. Hydrapple also pairs nicely with offensive teammates like Kingambit, Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Iron Crown. Kingambit greatly appreciates Hydrapple being able to scare off Great Tusk from staying in and benefits Hydrapple by being extremely good at switching into and annihilating Air Balloon Gholdengo, one of Hydrapple's better switch-ins. Great Tusk itself is a good teammate for it, being able to keep hazards off in case Hydrapple gets its Heavy-Duty Boots removed by common threats like Rillaboom, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor while also being great into its most common check in Galarian Slowking. Cinderace also keeps hazards off with Court Change, baits in Water- and Ground-types for Hydrapple to easily set up on, and reduces the need for Heavy-Duty Boots, giving Hydrapple more room to run a more powerful item to make progress like Life Orb, since its removal can't be blocked. Hydrapple also baits in Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight for Cinderace to quickly dispose of. Assault Vest Iron Crown is able to switch into Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Kyurem, and Hatterene for Hydrapple, while Hydrapple matches up well into Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu, two Pokemon Iron Crown does not like taking on. Tinkaton and Hydrapple can also work in tandem with each other, since Tinkaton is a Pokemon that can set Stealth Rock and check Kyurem and Darkrai for Hydrapple, two special attackers that carry Ice-type moves to quickly dispose of Hydrapple, while Hydrapple is able to check Pokemon that can wall and threaten Tinkaton like Iron Treads, Tera Water Garganacl, and specially defensive Heatran. Rillaboom pairs decently well with Hydrapple on teams that take advantage of Grassy Terrain, powering up Hydrapple's already hard-hitting boosted Giga Drain while providing it with additional passive recovery every turn it is active. Hydrapple also finds a niche on sand teams as an answer to Water- and Grass-types that are able to consistently threaten Excadrill and Tyranitar, which are staples of this archetype. It sets itself apart from its competition for its role as a bulky Grass-type because, unlike Sinistcha and Chesnaught, Hydrapple has a much more notable offensive presence and greater longevity thanks to Regenerator.</p>"

  "Raging Bolt": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Raging Bolt is one of the metagame's top setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Its natural bulk and unique typing not only allows it to check common offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and Cinderace, but also to gain multiple entry points and setup opportunities as well. On top of a potent STAB combination that hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, its signature move Thunderclap prevents Raging Bolt's sweep from being cut short by faster threats and opposing priority users like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and Kingambit and lets it act as a revenge killer, too. Dragon Pulse is preferred for its consistent damage output, but Draco Meteor can be used to propel Raging Bolt's niche as a wallbreaker further, letting it overwhelm checks like Ting-Lu and Clodsire much more easily and netting benchmarks such as OHKOing defensive Landorus-T and Dragonite through Multiscale, all after a Calm Mind. A reliable Electric-type STAB move lets Raging Bolt prevent foes like Primarina, Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Enamorus from setting up freely and makes it less vulnerable to Encore users like Iron Valiant and Hisuian Samurott. Thunderbolt's consistency is preferred in this regard, but other options can be used as well. Discharge allows Raging Bolt to potentially cripple specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking and slow down faster threats like Gholdengo, Darkrai, and Zamazenta, which helps to reduce its reliance on Thunderclap. Exclusively on rain teams, the stronger option in Thunder can also be used instead for similar reasons. Raging Bolt can lean towards the weather further by running Weather Ball instead if used on either a sun or rain team; it allows Raging Bolt to hit Iron Treads super effectively, with rain Weather Ball pressuring Raging Bolt's other Ground-type checks like Gliscor and Landorus-T more reliably, while sun Weather Ball cleanly OHKOes even bulky Kingambit and Gholdengo unboosted, all at the expense of the ability to immediately threaten Calm Mind Primarina. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to let Raging Bolt overwhelm walls like Blissey and Toxic Galarian Slowking. Booster Energy provides Raging Bolt with a damage boost, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderclap after a layer of Spikes and specially defensive Gliscor with +1 Draco Meteor, as well as having significant rolls to 2HKO Clodsire with Draco Meteor. Leftovers gives it more longevity to set up more easily and further take advantage of its defensive profile. Air Balloon is another option to prevent revenge killing attempts from its Ground-type checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Tera Fairy gives Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult and opposing Raging Bolt that don't fear its Thunderclap; it is also generally a good neutral typing against foes like Weavile and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying can be used for an outright immunity to Ground, letting it flip its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T; this can be combined with Taunt to beat bulky Ground-type checks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Tera Bug gives a Ground resistance without being weak to Kyurem and opposing Raging Bolt while also providing a Fighting resistance against Zamazenta. Tera Ghost is also an option with Taunt to beat Blissey one-on-one and give offensive teams an emergency check to IronPress Zamazenta. An EV spread of 64 HP / 28 Def / 252 SpA / 164 Spe is an alternative option; it runs enough Speed to get the jump on Gliscor, with the extra bulk letting Raging Bolt survive Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk's Headlong Rush from full, though this significantly worsens its matchup against opposing Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Raging Bolt fits on a variety of offensive teams, ranging from hyper offense to weather-based archetypes in sun and rain. It pairs well with other strong special attackers like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Darkrai; on top of keeping up the pressure against the opposition, they can work with Raging Bolt to wear down and overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Zamazenta are similarly important, as they can threaten out the aforementioned special walls and force damage against Landorus-T and opposing Great Tusk; some of these physical attackers can even switch into the Ground-types, and Raging Bolt uses their checks like Skarmory, Alomomola, and Dondozo as entry points and setup opportunities. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention; on top of providing Grassy Terrain to increase Raging Bolt's longevity and let it stomach Earthquake from foes like Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, Rillaboom can also bring Raging Bolt in safely via U-turn against switch-ins like Moltres, Corviknight, and Zapdos for setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora are highly appreciated, as hazards help put foes and especially its checks into KO range, with Landorus-T also capable of switching into Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and opposing Landorus-T that threaten Raging Bolt out; in return, Raging Bolt can take advantage of and pressure common hazard removal Pokemon like Corviknight and Cinderace to maintain said hazards. Raging Bolt can benefit from Drought users like Torkoal and Ninetales; the sun allows Raging Bolt to freely forgo Booster Energy and gives it the option to run Weather Ball. Raging Bolt also synergizes well with other sun wallbreakers; Walking Wake can exploit Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Gliscor while assisting Raging Bolt in pressuring Galarian Slowking and Blissey. This is especially strong because going for Tera Water to deal with Walking Wake makes them vulnerable to Raging Bolt. Great Tusk can complement Raging Bolt's breaking power by dealing with its special walls and overwhelming shared checks like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, with Raging Bolt handling the likes of Skarmory, Alomomola, and Tera Water Gliscor in return. Raging Bolt can also be used on rain teams, benefiting from Pelipper's Drizzle to run options like Weather Ball and Thunder. It forms a great core with Barraskewda, as Barraskewda can position Raging Bolt against its bulky Water-type checks like Alomomola and Tera Water Garganacl via Flip Turn; in return, Barraskewda alongside other rain wallbreakers like Overqwil can pressure and overwhelm Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Iron Treads for Raging Bolt. Defensively, Raging Bolt can check Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, which are otherwise problematic for rain teams, while Pelipper is capable of switching into Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads that force Raging Bolt out. Though more niche, Raging Bolt can also fit on other hyper offense structures. Dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl provide Raging Bolt with an easier time setting up against even super effective hits and prevent it from being revenge killed by foes like Weavile, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Sticky Web from Ribombee can slow down would-be revenge killers like Great Tusk, minimizing the risk of Thunderclap mindgames against foes like Encore Iron Valiant and Substitute Iron Moth.</p>"

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Raging Bolt acts as a powerful offensive pivot and revenge killer that can also provide defensive utility thanks to its solid natural bulk and good typing. Thunderclap is one of the strongest options for priority in the metagame, allowing Raging Bolt to overcome its lackluster Speed tier and act as a strong revenge killer against the likes of Ogerpon-W, Enamorus, Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Kingambit. Volt Switch makes Raging Bolt hard to pin down, allowing it to pivot on and wear down specially defensive walls such as Galarian Slowking, Iron Crown, and Blissey as they switch in. Draco Meteor is a viable alternative to Dragon Pulse for more immediate power, hitting some benchmarks like OHKOing opposing Raging Bolt and having a chance to OHKO bulky Great Tusk in exchange for a severe Special Attack drop. Taunt allows Raging Bolt to more effectively deal with special walls by stopping recovery attempts from the likes of Blissey and Clodsire and blocking utility moves from Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking. Other options include Thunderbolt for a consistent Electric-type STAB move, 2HKOing neutral targets such as Clefable after little prior chip damage, defensive Zapdos, and Gholdengo while not forcing Raging Bolt to switch out, and Weather Ball on weather teams or alongside Galarian Slowking for alternative Ice-type coverage. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Raging Bolt to hit the field multiple times without worrying about entry hazards, which is especially good on teams that rely on ignoring hazards altogether, but Choice Specs is a viable alternative on teams with reliable hazard control options, hitting important damage benchmarks including 2HKOing Garganacl with Thunderbolt, OHKOing specially defensive Gliscor, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W with Draco Meteor, and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Galarian Slowking with Draco Meteor, though it makes Raging Bolt unable to run Taunt. Tera Fairy allows Raging Bolt to turn the tables on matchups like Iron Defense Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, Kyurem, Walking Wake, and Great Tusk as well as giving it the option to run Tera Blast in order to hit Ting-Lu and Great Tusk super effectively. Another option is Tera Flying, granting an even better matchup against the likes of Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu, though it gives Raging Bolt some problematic weaknesses against opposing Raging Bolt, Zapdos, Weavile, and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Raging Bolt fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to pivot in and out of the field while dealing heavy damage and threatening boosted sweepers with its priority move. Raging Bolt can form great offensive cores when it's paired with other offensive pivots like Ogerpon, which can apply pressure with U-turn in a similar fashion to Raging Bolt's Volt Switch, punish Ground-types with its strong Grass-type STAB moves, remove items with Knock Off to accumulate entry hazard damage, and punish setup moves with Encore. Embody Aspect's Speed boost also helps Ogerpon cover for Raging Bolt's poor Speed against the likes of Great Tusk, Darkrai, and Dragapult. In return, Ogerpon appreciates Raging Bolt's help in pressuring physically defensive Pokémon such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Corviknight. Ogerpon-W is even more effective at dealing with Ground-types, trading Ogerpon's ability to hold an item and boost its Speed for a harder-to-resist STAB combination and wallbreaking power, pressuring defensive cores such as Sinistcha + Gliscor and Galarian Slowking + Corviknight more easily with pivoting support from Raging Bolt. Meowscarada offers a stronger U-turn and Knock Off as well as an even better Speed tier, especially with Choice Scarf variants acting as a revenge killer for faster threats such as Iron Valiant. Weavile has a strong Knock Off as well, and its Ice Shard complements Thunderclap perfectly against offensive cores, hitting threats Raging Bolt struggles with like Ogerpon and Tera Ground Dragonite. Hisuian Samurott can pivot with Flip Turn and deal with the likes of Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Iron Crown, and Galarian Slowking while also providing Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, which, alongside its own Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokémon, makes it extremely effective against bulkier cores like Alomomola + Galarian Slowking or Ting-Lu, Toxapex + Gliscor or Ting-Lu, and Dondozo + Gliscor or Blissey. Pelipper's Drizzle can give Raging Bolt the options to run Thunder and Weather Ball, letting it hit would-be checks in Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with Water-type coverage. Barraskewda is a great partner on rain teams, as it's extremely hard to switch into and able to pivot with Flip Turn, and it loves Raging Bolt's ability to pressure Water-types like Alomomola, Dondozo and Primarina. Raging Bolt fits similarly on sun teams, synergizing with Torkoal and Ninetales' Drought, which activates Protosynthesis and allows it to hit the likes of Rillaboom and Iron Treads with sun-boosted Weather Ball, and with Walking Wake, which pressures Ground-types and shared checks like Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Raging Bolt also appreciates a defensive backbone to fall onto when its Volt Switch is blocked or after revenge killing a Pokemon. Flying-types like Corviknight and Gliscor check Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, with the former offering hazard removal in Defog and the latter offering hazard support. Clefable's physical bulk allows it to take on Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor while setting up Stealth Rock; it can also cripple walls like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey with Knock Off and switch into Knock Off well itself. Alomomola makes a good partner thanks to its great physical bulk and longevity with Wish and Regenerator, which it can use in conjunction with Flip Turn to keep Raging Bolt healthy, and it appreciates the help in beating Ogerpon-W. Steel-types like Assault Vest Iron Crown and Tinkaton can threaten Iron Valiant and Kyurem, while Galarian Slowking can check them as well as offering a slow pivot and a powerful Future Sight. Lastly, hazard removal options like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Iron Treads can clear the field for Choice Specs Raging Bolt.</p>"

  "Iron Boulder": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Boulder is a setup sweeper as well as a solid speed control in the current metagame, outspeeding the likes of Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. Close Combat hits targets such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over Close Combat, forgoing the Ting-Lu matchup for a better matchup into non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. These moves can be run in conjunction with each other, but in that case Iron Boulder has difficult matchups against Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Zen Headbutt can be used to improve these matchups as well as provide a reliable means of revenge killing Booster Energy Iron Valiant, again in exchange for the Gholdengo matchup. Substitute is also a viable option, and it can be used to ease Iron Boulder's matchup versus Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as allowing it to avoid Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking as it sets up. Given a free turn to set it up, Substitute is an option that allow Iron Boulder to avoid being revenge killed by priority, such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. However, its main use case is with Tera Flying, as the combination allows Iron Boulder to circumvent Gliscor—which otherwise would be a solid check—and turn it into setup fodder by avoiding both Toxic and Earthquake. Running Taunt over Substitute is also an option; aside from beating Gliscor one-on-one with Tera Flying, it also allows Iron Boulder to overwhelm Skarmory by preventing its Iron Defense and Roost attempts. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, notably helping Iron Boulder brute force its way past Skarmory, while also allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. It also provides a Sucker Punch resistance, which helps versus Kingambit. Tera Ground can be used to boost the power of Earthquake, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulkier variants of Gholdengo at +2 as well as helping Iron Boulder avoid being picked off by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Tera Flying not only lets Iron Boulder wall Gliscor in combination with Substitute but also grants it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and facilitates setup opportunities versus other Ground-types like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Tera Blast Fairy is also an option to nail Great Tusk and Zamazenta while giving it a crucial defensive typing to take on Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Iron Boulder's power and its top-tier speed, alongside its good coverage and access to Swords Dance, make it very suitable for hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Kingambit appreciate the weakening of shared checks such as Landorus-T and Skarmory. The same goes for Iron Moth but with Ting-Lu and Gliscor. Iron Valiant also appreciates Gliscor being weakened and can whittle down shared checks such as Gholdengo to make it easier for Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder struggles with entry hazard damage putting it in KO range of priority moves such as Kingambit’s Sucker Punch and Rillaboom’s Grassy Glide after Tera. Teammates that are effective at keeping hazards off your side such as Taunt Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Hatterene, or Great Tusk are good partners. The first two also provide their own hazards, facilitating the weakening of Iron Boulder's checks. Iron Boulder also has difficulty overcoming Dondozo. Partners that can weaken it or take advantage of it, such as Kingambit or Ogerpon-W, respectively, are good partners.</p>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Crown serves as a strong offensive pivot and sturdy check to a bevy of special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus courtesy of its well-rounded stats, good defensive profile, and solid offensive movepool alongside a great pivoting option in Volt Switch. Tachyon Cutter's multi-hit properties allow it to bypass Glimmora's Focus Sash to OHKO it before it can set up any entry hazards. Future Sight's delayed damage puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the opposing team, since Dark-types switching in to block Future Sight or Steel-types and special walls trying to sponge the attack will have to survive powerful physical attacks from teammates like Great Tusk, Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Zamazenta, and Weavile; Psychic Noise offers lower but more immediate damage while simultaneously nullifying recovery attempts from Gholdengo, Blissey, Corviknight, Garganacl, and Clodsire, allowing Iron Crown and its teammates to force significant damage against these threats. Focus Blast rounds out Iron Crown's coverage by hitting Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Tera Steel Clodsire super effectively, and it is also its strongest attack against opposing Iron Crown. Volt Switch allows Iron Crown to capitalize on its ability to force out most special attackers and gain momentum for its team and has great synergy with Future Sight by safely pivoting in the aforementioned powerful physical attackers that can take advantage of the chip damage or switches it forces. Assault Vest greatly boosts Iron Crown's special bulk, allowing it to better handle special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Choice Specs is a decent alternative for more offensive teams, boosting Iron Crown's damage output to staggering levels, letting it even outright 2HKO Blissey with Tera Fighting Focus Blast. However, this comes at the cost of greatly compromising its special bulk, being 2HKOed by Iron Valiant's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock; it also prevents Iron Crown from switching moves. Tera Fighting turns Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type attacks into a resistance, allowing it to survive Kingambit's Sucker Punch in a pinch while boosting its Focus Blast to 2HKO Ting-Lu and physically defensive Corviknight; Tera Fairy also offers a Dark resistance, but the Dragon immunity, Fighting resistance, and Fairy neutrality it provides allow Iron Crown to better check Dragapult and more reliably handle mixed and physical Iron Valiant sets without compromising its ability to check Calm Mind variants as heavily.</p> <p>Iron Crown is best run on bulky offense teams, which can both cover Iron Crown's defensive shortcomings and maintain a similar level of offensive pressure, often in the form of additional pivoting options to maintain momentum. Hisuian Samurott is a spectacular teammate; it can form a VoltTurn core with Iron Crown using Flip Turn, reliably set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, and even remove Heavy-Duty Boots with its strong STAB Knock Off to allow the duo to rack up massive amounts of lasting damage through Spikes and Future Sight or Psychic Noise. The two share excellent defensive synergy, as Hisuian Samurott's Ghost and Dark resistances cover Dragapult, Gholdengo, and opposing Hisuian Samurott while Iron Crown's Grass and Fairy resistances cover Rillaboom and Iron Valiant. Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off have impeccable synergy with Future Sight, and Hisuian Samurott's Razor Shell hits Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit very hard, rendering Iron Crown's Future Sight much more difficult to switch in against. Landorus-T is another great teammate; it also forms a powerful VoltTurn core with Iron Crown, can blanket check most physical attackers with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet to complement Iron Crown's ability to blanket check most special attackers with Assault Vest, can set up Stealth Rock, and the two also boast impeccable defensive synergy courtesy of Iron Crown checking Ice Beam users like Deoxys-S and Landorus-T checking physical Iron Valiant and Heatran. Together, Iron Crown, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T form an extremely powerful core that resists every type in the game, utilizes multiple pivoting options, sets up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can blanket check many physical and special attackers alike. Calm Mind Primarina is a good teammate that can run Psychic Noise itself, allowing Iron Crown to more freely run Future Sight, and can take advantage of Iron Crown's ability to wear down teams over time to set up for a late-game sweep once threats like Encore Iron Valiant are dealt with. Physically defensive Moltres is another solid teammate, as it can reliably check most physical attackers by spreading burn with Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body and heavily punishes Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott and Steel-types like Gholdengo aiming to switch into Future Sight, and appreciates Iron Crown's ability to temporarily keep special attackers like Deoxys-S and Walking Wake at bay. Kingambit itself makes for a strong teammate, as with Iron Crown's Future Sight support, Kingambit has a much easier time both finding opportunities to set up with Swords Dance and muscle past physical walls like Dondozo and Alomomola, which are quickly overwhelmed by the combination of Future Sight and powerful Dark-type attacks possibly boosted further by Black Glasses, Tera Dark, and Supreme Overlord. Kingambit additionally resists Ghost- and Dark-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo and opposing Kingambit lacking Low Kick, which Iron Crown greatly appreciates. Zamazenta and Weavile also greatly appreciate both Iron Crown's Future Sight support and its pivoting capabilities, allowing them to be brought in safely and giving them opportunities to fire off a powerful Body Press or Knock Off that, when paired with Future Sight, can prove nearly impossible to switch in against.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high Special Attack and good coverage, Choice Specs Iron Crown is a potent wallbreaker that can 2HKO a number of the metagame's defensive options like Garganacl and Gliscor. Tachyon Cutter being a multi-hit move lets Iron Crown OHKO Focus Sash Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, break Multiscale on Dragonite, and deal significant damage to Landorus-T. Psyshock is preferred to let Iron Crown take on specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey, while Psychic Noise can be used instead to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Zapdos from healing in front of it. Volt Switch lets Iron Crown pivot out of Pokemon it would otherwise struggle against while also dealing significant damage to the likes of Primarina and Alomomola. Focus Blast helps Iron Crown deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads and is its best option to damage Ting-Lu. Tera Steel increases the power of Tachyon Cutter, letting it 2HKO offensive Gholdengo variants and OHKO fully HP invested Landorus-T most of the time, while Tera Fighting Focus Blast guarantees a 2HKO on Ting-Lu, as well as OHKOes Ogerpon-W most of the time and guarantees an OHKO on Cinderace. Both Tera types also remove Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type moves, improving its matchup against offensive Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Choice Specs Iron Crown needs physically offensive teammates like Zamazenta and Dragonite that can reliably remove specially defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Blissey. In return, they benefit from Iron Crown being able to handle physical walls like Clefable and Dondozo. Because Iron Crown will be consistently locked into one move, it's easier to revenge kill, so it needs defensive teammates such as Primarina and Landorus-T that can switch into faster offensive Pokemon like Darkrai and Zamazenta while also providing pivot support for Iron Crown. Alomomola is another good teammate for Iron Crown, pivoting it into favorable matchups and keeping it healthy with Wish. Gholdengo is especially annoying for Iron Crown, as it resists both of its STAB moves and can easily heal off damage, so teammates like Kingambit and Great Tusk that can easily take care of it are useful. Finally, Iron Crown benefits from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott that can soften up foes and allow it to clean them up easier.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With solid bulk, a one-time Speed boost, and near-perfect coverage, Calm Mind Iron Crown is a potent sweeper and late-game cleaner. Tachyon Cutter has the benefit of hitting twice, allowing Iron Crown to OHKO common Focus Sash leads in Glimmora and Ribombee, giving it an alternate use as an anti-lead that denies entry hazards. Tachyon Cutter also allows Iron Crown to break Substitutes while chipping the Pokemon hiding behind it; it can break Zamazenta’s Substitute after one Calm Mind and Kyurem’s without any Calm Mind boosts. After one Calm Mind, Iron Crown can hit several important ranges with Tachyon Cutter such as an OHKO on Kyurem and a good chance to KO offensive Landorus-T; it also secures a 2HKO against defensive Landorus-T variants while not being 2HKOed by Earth Power. The choice of Psychic-type STAB move depends on the team's needs: Psyshock targets the lower Defense of Galarian Slowking, Ogerpon-W, and Primarina, while Psychic Noise prevents walls such as Dondozo, Pecharunt, Alomomola, and Corviknight from spamming recovery to outlast Iron Crown. Stored Power is an option that can reach astonishing power levels, capable of breaking past almost any non-immune wall; however, it requires several turns of setup and has no benefit other than raw damage. Focus Blast complements Iron Crown's STAB combination by providing excellent neutral and super effective coverage against everything in the metagame except Gholdengo. It is Iron Crown's best way of hitting Ting-Lu and Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. The EV spread maximizes Iron Crown's offensive capabilities while letting Booster Energy enhance its Speed; the leftover EVs are invested into HP for increased survivability, notably allowing Iron Crown to survive a Choice Specs Kyurem Earth Power. Tera Fighting and Tera Fairy remove Iron Crown's original weaknesses, most notably both turning its weakness to Dark-type moves such as Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott’s Sucker Punch into a resistance to give it an easier time sweeping. Tera Fighting strengthens Iron Crown's Focus Blast, OHKOing Darkrai 2HKOing on Ting-Lu at +1. Tera Fairy is a more defensive Tera type that, unlike Tera Fighting, gives it fewer weaknesses. It further improves Iron Crown’s matchups against Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult by turning the Dragon resistance into an immunity.</p> <p>Calm Mind Iron Crown best fits on offense teams that appreciate its unique traits as a sweeper. Due to its low initial damage output, Iron Crown will struggle against bulky threats such as Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo, which require significant chip damage for it to break through them. Teammates such as Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W significantly threaten these bulky foes, and in return, Iron Crown can deal with Kyurem and Rillaboom. Iron Crown is also extremely vulnerable to many offensive threats, many of which can survive almost any hit from an unboosted Iron Crown such as Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Kingambit; they can either force a Tera or outright KO Iron Crown. Ogerpon-W and Iron Moth also resist Tachyon Cutter and threaten a clean 2HKO on Iron Crown. As such, Iron Crown appreciates pivots such as Pecharunt, which walls Ogerpon-W and weakens it with Parting Shot, and Alomomola, which can take hits from Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and other physical threats and threaten a burn with Scald to enable Iron Crown set up on them. Furthermore, special walls like Blissey and Clodsire using Tera Dark completely wall Iron Crown, as Focus Blast does insufficient damage. Because of this, Iron Crown appreciates physically offensive teammates, such as Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta, that can deal with its checks; in return, they appreciate Iron Crown's removal of Fairy- and Fighting-type threats such as Enamorus, Hatterene, and Great Tusk. Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk also set entry hazards to accumulate chip damage, which can compensate for this set's low initial power and allow Iron Crown to clean up or sweep earlier than expected.</p>"

  "Pecharunt": {
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Pecharunt's insanely high Defense, Ghost typing, and wide movepool make it a an excellent defensive pivot and support Pokemon for offensive teams. Malignant Chain is a powerful STAB move that, more importantly, can spread status, which Pecharunt can take advantage of with its Poison Puppeteer. Hex gives it a solid STAB move that complements its ability to spread poison, but Foul Play is an option to punish setup sweepers like Dragonite and Terastallized Ogerpon-W more. Shadow Ball is an alternative option for a Ghost-type STAB move that is more consistent than Hex and can deal more damage to Pokemon immune to poison like Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, at the cost of losing the bonus damage with Malignant Chain. Parting Shot keeps up momentum for the team and is a great way to safely pivot on setup sweepers like Kyurem and Iron Valiant, among others, by cutting down their attacking stats. Heavy-Duty Boots is a solid item choice to block residual damage from entry hazards that Pecharunt would have otherwise been susceptible to as it pivots in and out, but Air Balloon is a good alternative to mitigate Pecharunt's Ground weakness and give its team another Pokemon immune to Ground, which is especially helpful for taking on Great Tusk. Tera Ghost is used on Hex sets, letting it secure an OHKO on statused targets like Dragapult and removes Pecharunt's Ground weakness while keeping its ability to block Rapid Spin, which is very helpful against Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Tera Dark works well with Foul Play variants and completely changes all of Pecharunt's weaknesses, including giving it a Psychic- immunity, giving it the opportunity to heal or get off a surprising Malignant Chain in front of foes like Deoxys-S. Pecharunt can benefit greatly from two distinct EV spreads, with one maximizing Speed and the other Defense. A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs ensure that Pecharunt is fast enough to outspeed Great Tusk and Gholdengo, whereas just 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Jolly Kingambit, and putting the rest of the EVs in Defense and the Bold nature allow it to take more hits from the likes of Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W.</p> <p>The support provided by Pecharunt's ability to spread status and pivot to gain momentum makes it an excellent teammate for offensive teams. Pecharunt forms solid cores with Dark-type Pokemon, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Darkrai; these Dark-type spam teams are extremely weak to Zamazenta, which Pecharunt can completely wall, and Iron Valiant, which Pecharunt can switch in on and threaten with Malignant Chain. On the other hand, these exact same Dark-types are threats to Pecharunt itself; having Zamazenta and Iron Valiant as teammates can help deal with them. Pecharunt's Ghost typing allows it to block Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and Iron Treads, providing support for teammates like Hisuian Samurott to spread their entry hazards and keep them up throughout the game. Bulky Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu also synergize well with Pecharunt, taking advantage of its ability to block Rapid Spin to spread entry hazards of their own, and they help deal with Iron Moth, which is otherwise able to set up on Pecharunt quite easily. Pecharunt can also remove Toxic Spikes from the field, clearing the path for setup sweepers without Heavy-Duty Boots, such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Leftovers Zamazenta. Pecharunt struggles against some of the special attackers in the tier that can outspeed and prevent it from making any progress, such as Darkrai and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Having powerful teammates like Iron Valiant and Kingambit can provide much needed offensive support while also taking advantage of Pecharunt's Parting Shot to switch in on foes and set up safely. Landorus-T and Iron Treads can threaten Pecharunt significantly with their Ground-type attacks, and Gliscor can use Swords Dance to outpace the damage Pecharunt could do with Hex. Running Air Balloon, having a Ground-immune teammate like Landorus-T, or pivoting to a teammate like Kyurem or Ogerpon-W, can cover for this weakness and allow it to turn the matchup around in it favor. Pecharunt is also almost completely walled by Kingambit; Zamazenta and Great Tusk are great teammates to check Kingambit, and they can both be brought in safely with Parting Shot.</p>"
